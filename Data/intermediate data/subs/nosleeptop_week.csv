Jaunt,56,186,1rff5i,606,I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love youI held her tight I love you I love you But I started to cry because dollies dont love back No my dollie wouldnt do not anymore I wanted something of my own to care for Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely Something that needed me I wanted a real babyI asked mama how to make a baby She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devils talk from my mouth The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school but no one noticed They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses They only noticed me to laugh at meThat night after I said my prayers I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before Big bright and ruby red it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it It was beautiful so I sent it a wish Bring me a baby I said bring me something to loveThe star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty Something was there with me Black and formless like a storm cloud it floated above me You want a child it said speaking into my head instead of my ears I will give you a child but you must promise to love and care for him no matter whatI promiseWisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart Gritty black tendrils rough as sandpaper opened me and slithered inside They scraped my insides slowly at first then faster and faster It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out I tilted my head back to scream but black filled my mouth and nothing came out Shhh it said to love your child you must suffer for him first A final push in and shards of splintered glass exploded inside meThe thing loosed its grip and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor I was shaking and cold and the room was falling away Will I die I askedNo You must care for him It is your promiseI woke the next morning without a scratch Was it a dream I touched my belly No he is there I can feel him Tiny and vulnerable and perfect I would keep my promiseHe grew every day Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses Everyone noticed me now especially Jenny and the other girls Slut they said Whore Trash One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her something small and black like a living shadowMama cried She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled Not clean not clean she said She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done because what would the neighbors think I didnt mind As long as my little boy was safe inside me I didnt care where I wentI dreamed of him He told me his name but it was a sound I couldnt pronounce a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air I couldnt say it but I could hear it in my head and that was enough He told me that he would accomplish great things but he needed my love to make him strong first In my dreams I held him tight looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you alwaysMama dreamed of him too I think She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please Please help us God She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeletonI was drawing pictures one night when it happened I reached up for a red crayon and pop yellow liquid gushing out of me Hes ready hes finally ready I called out to mama and told her it was time She phoned the doctor begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain I refused To love my baby I must suffer for him firstPushing screaming breathing pushing again Hours and hours I was weak I was tired But the thought of him kept me going After so long we would finally meet I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him I pushed again with the last drops of strength I had left I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed sighing with reliefI am sorry dear but the baby didnt make itNo No youre wrong I kept him safe this whole time I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams I was going to care for him and make him strong he cant be he cant be he cantI am so sorry Here child you can say goodbyeI held him in my arms He was limp and motionless his skin a pale gray his eyes shut tightly He looked so peaceful I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life I clutched him to my chest and cried tears dripping onto his head Goodbye my love goodbye But no wait He cant be gone I can hear him I can hear the flies in my mindHis eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor Mama fell to the floor and screamed Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the doorMy babys head turned back to me and I looked into his eyes for the first time Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself I looked into those cold dark eyes and I smiled My son My beautiful son I am so happy to see youI stood up while mamas jagged screams scratched my eardrums and I carried my son to the bathroom I opened the door stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor and turned on the tap I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me He was perfect He was everything I had hoped for And he was mineI saw things in my dream that night I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun I saw red Mists of red rivers of red chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight And in the middle of it all I saw my son my baby boy Mamas so proud of you sweetheart I will always be there for you I will make you strong I will make you the man youre destined to be I will love you and care for you and protect you no matter what I promise,1385399840.0,The

ephique,86,160,1rikrx,486,I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom dad and big sister We were a normal family neither happy nor sad somewhere in between I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs It was also some sort of medicine for me it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes You see my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting I hated it I hated hearing her yell at my poor motherDuring a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad making sure that I didnt have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up I remember jogging most of the route home since my dad sounded so serious It gave me the creeps to say the leastI jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house The kitchen was the first room youd see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably something had definitely happened My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch he told me to sit down as wellI was scared and curious at the same time Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didnt bother caring too much about any of my sisters business so I could figure out that this wasnt about my sister I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say as if he didnt know how to explain something to meFinally after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time He said Your mother and then he needed to grasp some air and he continued Your mother has passed awayI was eight years old and I couldnt grasp that concept I didnt understand death or that my mom was eternally gone I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards godknowswhat I remember thinking how unfair this was I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly he didnt know what to do and he was in shock at the timeMy sister continued crying she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didnt actually care to know at that precise moment She was just being desperate and no one could blame her I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there I thought that was why she was crying so much I didnt shed a single tear I kept it all inside Of course that didnt mean this incident didnt haunt me for years I never stopped thinking about my mother The aftermath of my mothers death is what has been shaping my life the recent years My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital Something I didnt even think existed when I was eight This resulted in that I didnt get to meet my sister very often my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it and I didnt blame him I was guessing that my sister wasnt doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by something that troubled me I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad It felt so dead and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died We didnt do anything I literally spent all time at home in my room making or playing music Me and my dad didnt even greet sometimes when I came home from school it was depressing My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mothers death something that Im about to get intoYou are probably wondering how she died by now and its a legit question to be asking The best answer I could give you is that I dont know My dad has always told me she died of liverfailure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me It didnt add up my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didnt drink I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasnt mature enough to hear the truth In addition to this whenever I asked my dad about this matter hed get heavily upset Nowadays I never ask about my moms death nor do I even bring up mom as a topicYears went by and I ended up being fourteen It kept going like I just described I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house My dad did work he had the nighttime shift at a local bottle factory Im not joking he actually made glass bottles for a living He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job You guessed it the bottle factoryI was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen My school was the type that had an afterschool library that didnt close till  pm I didnt need any of the books or supplies that the library offered I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa Either way I hadnt seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldnt see her again for another two When I arrived at the house the front door was open This is odd I thought Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mothers old jars Its never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door around the lock I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone ready to call the police This is when I heard something coming from inside the house I was dead scared to say the least this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse I didnt know It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor trying to move it It was so dark as well I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights I started to slowly pace into the house walking towards the noise This is where I had to make a decision was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark I picked the former I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window It was my sister naked My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital I switched on the lights in an instant She had redecorated the entire kitchen in the dark Of course it all looked hideous and random she didnt know what the hell she was doing I remember being in a slight discomfort I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life I also hadnt seen her for a good couple of years at all She didnt look very comfortable either she looked like she didnt know who I was and was wondering what I was doing thereI uttered Linda out loud that was her name She didnt respond she just continued standing there looking at me Dont you remember me Im your brother I still couldnt get any feedback out of her it was as if the wheel wasnt spinning at all I wasnt sure what the protocol here was not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured Id try to call dad before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered Dont call dad This is when I realized she couldnt be completely empty inside after allYou dont want to call dad She continued  I had no idea what to do I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place Luckily my dad got home at that point not coming from a finished shift at work He had a good five hours at least left I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation My father ran into the house as fast as he couldThis is when something I didnt expect happened he told me to leave He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house I asked him where I was supposed to go he told me to wait in his car Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didnt think twice about it I ran out to the car As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts I had no clue what the two of them were discussing although I never saw my sister move her lips so Im guessing my dad did most of the talking After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car he joined me inside I remember asking why he didnt bring Linda with him Dont call her that name he shouted in response I was so confused at this point Dad started the car and drove me to my only friends house I didnt see him very often though I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point I didnt really create any friendships I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friends doorbell his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight I didnt even know what was going on to be fairWhatever he told them worked I got to spend the night at my friends place Tims place to be exact It was pretty awkward I remember I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish We got to be deskmates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester so we werent very close It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after I guessed that made it easier for my dad leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to He did but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tims parents both trying to justify me as Tims best friend I dont know Tim didnt have many friends I guessOn the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me as if I was mocking him I remember how desperate he looked as if he had no fire left in his heart He uttered the words Do you think I wanted any of this as he grabbed his hair in regret All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances and Im not blaming you when Im saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours Is what came out of his mouth next I tried to comfort him telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not I really didnt have a lot of cards in my deck at this point I mean my dad was basically losing itWhen we got home he told me that he was sorry and that I should go up to my room I did go up to my room but I got to tell you I was starting to get very anxious about my dad I really wanted to know what the hell was going on I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online I couldnt sleep so pulling an allnighter was my only real option I was reading A Brief History of Time for a science project in school I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes I figured Id go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway I saw my mother standing just outside looking right at me for a fraction of a second Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night I kept thinking about it as I couldnt sleep She looked deranged scared and raw The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white s movie I kept begging for the sun to rise up I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what youll see I might have been fourteen but I can openly admit that I was dead scaredIt finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said I think I need help While holding the glass of juice as if he wasnt sure he was going to drink the rest of it I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasnt sure that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf he thought that could give him some relief I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea jokingly adding that its better than hanging around the house doing nothing He looked offended when I said that something I didnt really understand since he obviously worked all night so that would justify him sleeping through the daysI understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died Well its hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liverfailure I mean it was possible Imagine if it was true and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me Thats the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thingHaving that explanation out of the way I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf I just walked into his room unexpected A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room it looked similar to an office which is nothing hed ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory He was actually sitting at his desk Not only that but the desk was flooded with paperwork of some sort maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day something he could manage from home I didnt ask I had a big enough question for him as it wereI dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured Id sit on it It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable better than standing up anyway Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying You want to know about your sister and what happened the other night Dont you This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt bringing up mom here would have been a carcrash I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me Your sister is not right in the head shes in a mental hospital I couldnt believe he hadnt figured out that I would have known this by then Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didnt know He explained the context telling me that she couldnt take our mothers death A tear started climbing down his cheeks and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine and then I left the roomI realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business I had no idea how Id ever get the truth about my mother out of him When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again the image of my mom started crawling back to me The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway was my mind playing tricks on me I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before Night landed again I hadnt spoken to my father again that day I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought Id see my mother again We all know you can imagine things in the dark kids do it all the time Its as if your mind fills in the gaps but that incident the other night was different I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that Id open the door to the darn hallway and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer Im not going to lie I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out there was no sign of my mother I turned on the lights and went back into my roomStill not wanting to go to bed not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured Id listen through some of my older songs I had loads of them most of which werent very good however I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good especially not at writing my own songs I guess I was decent at playing other peoples songs I basically went through my songs in chronological order it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs Knowing that this wasnt an overworked track yet it was made just days ago and I hadnt gotten around to mastering it yet I figured I wasnt going to give it more of a thought That was until the neurons fired that track was made the day I couldnt sleep the day I saw my mother in the hallway Being a bit gullible I figured that Id give it a go using my acoustic headphones I tried everything I played the song backwards I cut out bass middle frequencies high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples I couldnt hear anything suspicious just that white noise I was a bit disappointed at the same time relieved Although that white noise shouldnt have been there nothing in my room could have made a noise like that I didnt want to overthink the situation so I ended up hitting the bed Later that night as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before slowly dozing off to sleep I hadnt been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when youre in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder I continued lying in bed trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch for the blink of an eye just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again just as the light went on The same stare same face still that black and white filtered look from before I got so shocked I fell down on the floor the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant I wasnt sure what to make of this and I definitely didnt want to tell my father about what I had seen knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldnt let me sleep I just couldnt sleep at all I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become Whatever this all meant and needless to say I didnt get any sleep that night eitherI met my father in the kitchen the next day he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his workcrew later that afternoon I was happy for him he deserved some time out of the stress After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added Have you been thinking of your mother lately As if he could read my mind I told him that I was always missing my mother and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately He stated that he thought I had I had no clue why  Short after that he left for playing golfI kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing In fact I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed how could it have been on I had no idea Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk it got me a slight reminder on how he hadnt gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company I dont know how Id describe it better than that After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address I remember wondering why dad wouldnt show me something like this Daddy why didnt you visit me last weekend I thought you were coming back I was waiting for you Im sorry if I made a scene I thought something had happened to you I ran to you because I wanted answers no one has answers here Ive been getting visits lately why cant you come to me at the same timeI fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five yearold in this state On afterthought I guessed my dad didnt tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasnt in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges Although thinking about it that doesnt sound ridiculously different than a mental hospitalThe rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of workrelated things and records of local policeinvestigations Why would my father be looking into cases of murder pedophilia rape and almost anything you can think of It wasnt really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up I knew he had a friend in the police force that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them I didnt even want to know at the time I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadnt slept in far too longI apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that Im dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there Im only taking precautions to make sure that Im telling it right If Im finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work which made complete sense It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar This time I wasnt using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time I wasnt worrying about that I was thinking about my mother showing herself again Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itselfNot too long into that night I started feeling sick of being indoors for so long and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing I remember being on the sane side of the fence thinking critically and trying to find solutions not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell I figured Id take my bike down to a local gas station not more than ten minutes from my house I wanted some chips candy and maybe a couple cans of soda I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off I got there faster than I thought I would It wasnt cold outside either it was a pretty smooth night After grabbing some generic brand of chips Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left I didnt spend much time in the store but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen With no bike feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home Something out of the ordinary happened after this and I wasnt even sure if I was seeing things at first I was walking on this huge open road I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road It was tied together with the forest behind our house It was the type of road that didnt have any traffic other than truck drivers passing once every couple of hours at night I didnt want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what youd imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear I assumed she was looking for me she was definitely staring at me I continued walking not necessarily fearing my sister It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her that she would never have done anything to hurt me As I approached her she didnt give me any response what so ever she was just staring at me in a lightblue scrubcoat looking lifeless I had reached talkingdistance I couldnt believe this was happening It felt surreal like one of those scenarios you cant be prepared for in real life She had started to shake a bit I couldnt tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous I asked her if she was looking for me out there and if she had escaped the hospital She didnt respond I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me as if I was a threat to her After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it She started to slowly bring it forth it was a plastic bag From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasnt heavy or dangerous for that matter I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag then she started to stretch it out to me I took this from your house the other day Im sorry I think this belongs to you Jonathan I do realize that I never told you my name it is indeed Jonathan I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even she seemed to be so out of it I remember grabbing the plastic bag she wouldnt let go of it too lightly either it was as if she still wanted it After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence she wouldnt stop staring into my eyes during these Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad Shortly after she started walking towards the forest as if she knew where she was heading I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dads car acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister I didnt even know if I wanted him to catch her or not she was purposely running away from him He dragged her into his car and they both drove away heading the direction he was originally going This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times Something wasnt right I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasnt anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school but that doesnt change the logic of it He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thingI ran the rest of the way home trying not to drop anything I still had all the items I bought at the gas station I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did I had no clue whenever he would get back and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me I couldnt spot my dads car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house I didnt bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything I made my way back to my room as fast as I could I dont really know why but I locked the door after me as if there was something to fear I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me I never really thought of something until now and that is how my sister could have found me It must have been a coincidence or she had been following me for a while knowing she couldnt approach me in the store I dont knowI looked into the bag it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever for example there was a roll of tape in there I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos most being after mom died The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks they werent even dry I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag There was only one thing left in the bag an usbstick I took the stick out and threw away the bag Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasnt sent to the hospital yet but it was pretty much pending already In fact most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away On one of them its my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing she actually wasnt acting too badly the first couple of weeks I guess she didnt process our mothers death until later or something Another photo is of dads old car he had to sell it in order to compensate for our familys financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had my mothers candle business He loved that damn car with his entire heart we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter x behind them It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking I figured my sister must have had done this for what reason I was about to find out I kept staring at the first picture it was the one I told you about earlier the one of my fathers old car It was a Pontiac from the early s and it must have cost him a fortune I never had any particular memories of the car I remember it spending most of its time in our garageI kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadnt used the car more he obviously loved it The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper for selling it of course I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat It wasnt very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent She had the same drainedout appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room and this was taken after her death I couldnt believe what I was looking at I remember dropping the photo out of shock so many thoughts started circling inside of my head Part

floydnimrod,132,120,1rhxtb,454,Id just come from church for some reason Im not sure why Id gone into the church but it was the weirdest service Id ever been too Everybody was there It was a packed house Rich people poor people criminals middle class folk It was all people who didnt normally go to church I looked into the coat room as I walked in and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top Right in a church I was like what the hell Ive never see thatI sat in a pew and looked up There was no minister They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ and the minister was applauding her She seemed happy But the audience was restless not really paying attention not sitting down just kind of wandering around talking to everybody And then I saw a woman I used to know someone I worked with years ago I went to sit down next to her and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me saying she was so glad to see me I wasnt sure if she was sad or drunk or terrified or just lonely but she whispered in my ear offering me sex saying shes always wanted me ever since shed known me I sort of pushed her off my lap thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pickup And then I got up and walked out There wasnt really a church service going on anyway I dont even think it was SundayAnd then for some reason I was in a car with this old lady I dont even know who it was or why I was with her She was old like my grandma Freddie but it wasnt her We were driving down the street She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost I dont think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street almost the size of Portage with several lanes But they all seemed to be deserted like very early on a Sunday morning Im not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset but the sun was low in the sky I think it was late in the day The streets were mostly clear thoughThe lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car I think she was going to ask somebody for directions I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled like the satellite was confused or just no longer there And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds It basically turned green instead of blue but only for a moment and then it was back to normal Everybody stopped and looked upI was still in the car but I leaned forward and looked out the window The sun was over in the west low in the sky And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the suns normal path It was huge And my stomach got queasy for a moment It made your stomach sick because it was so big it actually pulled on you with its own gravity like the moon pulls on the tides but much bigger and everything inside you just got tugged aroundBut it went straight across the sky without hitting When I realized how close it was though I knew it was gonna hit somewhere probably on the other side of the world The gravity of the earth pulled it in and it slingshotted around to the other side somewhere I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old ladys armCome on We have to find shelter Its gonna hit We just abandoned the car in the street and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station or hydro office or whatever it was Im not sure which it was but there were large utility trucks with lifts on them It was also deserted for some reason except for two guys loading one of the trucks We banged on the doors but it was locked up We ran from door to door trying to get in but everything was locked And then I felt a great rumble under my feet It nearly knocked me down Ive never been in an earthquake so I dont know what its like but it felt like the entire planet shivered Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside except there were no hills I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions We were able to stay on our feet though A few moments later the sky in the north went dark If I assume the sun was setting in the west and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a northwest to southeast direction then it was north the black came from And I mean the entire sky Like a wall of blackness smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere from west to east as far as you could see in one huge wall of black cloud And it was coming toward us Well sort of going towards everyone everywhere I guess It came over the horizon like an charging army fast and steady advancingIt hit on the other side of the world somewhere Come on we have to get indoors We wont be able to breatheThe air started turning yellow Ash started raining down and bits of rock and debris from the blast where ever it hit I took a deep breath and held it as I was running I could already smell a weird burning rock smell like sulphur like burnt matches but more metallic Me and the lady finally got into some doors but it was just a little foyer We ran in and shut the doors behind us The inside doors were locked But it was somewhere to hide There was a fire alarm I pulled it not really knowing why I was bothering But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight The sign said In Case of Emergency so I pulled it The alarm went off and we looked out the window The yellow air turned brown and then dark red Then everything went black The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water And all light went out of the worldThe world as we knew it was over Even if we survived life as we know it would never be the same Wed be set back  years reduced to hunter gatherers again living out of caves If we survived the impact that is I honestly dont think anybody would have survived the shockwave Something with that much gravity hitting the earth would pretty much end the story for everybodyOf course thats when I woke up,1385478425.0,I just dreamed of the apocalypse I probably wont sleep for a few days

Exxile,99,164,1rbws0,416,Hello reddit Im a killer and I have no problem admitting that Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it Im only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to youI was a normal child but normal is relative so who am I to make that call What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up My parents treated me properly I did great in school and I had many friends It wasnt until high school that I started feeling the need to kill It was all so spontaneous I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head I zoned out and focused on the image his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes A few weeks later that daydream became a reality and I got away with itEveryone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes Some were saying that he joined the army others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flameWhen I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims Thats when I began to develop a signature style I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back Honestly the sound of the bones breaking didnt sit well with me Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found but they never were Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims They were no one in particular Women teenagers it really didnt matter to me A dead body is a dead body in my eyes I dont care who it belongs to Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me I wasnt trying to drag out the last moments of their lives I just wanted them to die I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat  About a week after I killed my final victim I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with She doesnt realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body She wasnt able to have kids which was fine with me I never really saw myself as a father Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married I was okay with this as well I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood However when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth I didnt know how to prove it to her so I killed someone in front of her One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill herRight now shes kept in my basement I dont treat her like a prisoner mind you she has everything she could ever want Im hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so shell quit trying to escape I know one day shell accept who I am Maybe one day shell help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together Or perhaps you guys wont believe me either and youll brush this off as just another made up story But thats the funny thing about being a killer,1385266368.0,The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth,580,nosleep,top_week
ephique,71,121,1rlj0w,393,Part  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrikrxiwanttotellaboutmymotherOne of the ideas that spawned in my mind was that my sister was trying to tell me that our mother wasnt dead Another one which I didnt even want to think about was that this was our mother being back from the dead I assumed after giving it a couple of minutes that my sister had edited the photo somehow or that it was just random shades in the leather of the backseat forming what looked a lot like the face of our mother I was feeling very uncomfortable at this point but I still made the decision to carry on and look at the other photo with a marking on This one was a photo of dad holding up a big worm we had found in the backyard I hadnt seen him as happy as he was on that photo for a long time I remember feeling some kind of sensation looking at it He was standing in the middle of the woods not too far away from where I met my sister earlier I could tell where the scene took place from the utmost right part of the picture where half my tree house I once built with my dad peeked out I tried finding something as disturbing as I had found on the former picture when a sudden banging on my door started It was violent and heavy before I knew it I could hear a voice I know youre in there did you speak to your sister when she was here It was my dad had he seen me on the street next to my sister I didnt know and I didnt exactly have the time to think either I hid all the photos under my bed and opened the door looking as if I just woke up Your sister has been in the house again hasnt she I told him that I hadnt seen my sister since that one time she was found naked in the kitchen Alright thats good Im just checking since I figured she might have been here again After that I told him once again that I hadnt seen her and then he finally left me alone I couldnt figure out why he seemed so upset and angry especially considering what I recently witnessed out on the road Something wasnt right about any of this On top of that I had a photo of what seemed to be my dead mother in the backseat of my dads old car Thinking about this reminded me about the second photo now when my dad had gone to bed I could examine it freely I guess the second photo gave me some kind of a nudge reminding me that my sister wasnt the only one who changed after my mothers death My dad looked so happy I dont remember too much about the incident in the photo I was assuming they took it as a joke since my dad was holding the worm as if it was a huge sea monster he had found at the bottom of the ocean I didnt even know who took it I assumed it was one of my sisters old friends I ended up putting the picture back under the bed in order to get some sleep Again it wasnt easy sleepingI finally did get some sleep that night although not before I spent a good couple of hours thinking of the disturbing image of my fathers old Pontiac I wasnt as scared when it had gotten bright outside and I could hear my father vacuum cleaning downstairs So I was tempted to continue my investigation into the second photograph something I started doing before I had even gotten my pants on I just couldnt spot anything out of the ordinary I guess I never filled you in completely about the details of the picture It wasnt just my dad showing off the worm my sister was actually in the picture Just next to my dad to the left She was walking towards the camera looking somewhat blurry since she was in motion I had no idea why my sister would mark this one it really seemed like a normal photo out of any family album I ended up putting it on my desk leaving the rest of the photos under the bed This when I remembered the usb memory I had found in the bag being excited as all hell I powered my computer up as fast as I could I didnt even let the sorry thing load fully before I mashed the usb stick into one of my empty slots I didnt actually expect the drive to work It looked very rugged and old I was expecting that dialogue window telling me that I would need to format the drive in order to use it But it did work the suggestion box on what to do with the drive showed up making it easy for me to explore it right away On the root of the stick there were two folders Revision and SelRevision I had no idea what any of that was about I figured Id start with the former It consisted of a very long list of documents all named in chronological order starting with the date and ending with some kind of code When it came to the codes I couldnt see any pattern what so ever maybe the inside of the documents would explain that The names of the files looked like  GKQ or  YYB Inevitably I started opening the documents all of them were pdffiles I got a bit disappointed when I realized that it was nothing else than what my fathers desk was already drowning in it was the local criminal records I even recognized some of them from before I didnt even bother checking most of them You have to understand that these were all within the same template and they included loads of information of the kind that I believed was completely irrelevant I went back to the root of the memory stick to check out the second folder not expecting anything else than what I just saw in the first folder I guess you could say I was right it had the same type of information that the first folder had Although not as many documents in fact it only had two of them Out of curiosity I compared the files in this folder with the former folder and it turned out they were copies from the first folder I had no idea why someone would do that Let alone my dad who I guessed this originally belonged toThe two files in the second folder were both records of rape and psychological torment both unsolved cases left with no real evidence The documents were connected to eachother the police suspecting they shared a criminal Both had dates around four years prior to me finding the usb stick although a lot of the information inside them took place later Stated in the records was an anonymous victim In fact it seemed to be the only victim listed who had phoned in to alarm the police about these incidents long after the crimes were committed I didnt even want to know what I was looking at after that It had detailed descriptions of what this person had done apparently very sick and sexually violent crimes I wont get into detail but just know this was the type of information that would let some of the best of us to empty our stomachs readingI wasnt sure how I was going to get rid of the usb stick I had no clue were my dad originally kept it Even if I did I had no idea if he knew it was gone or not if he did he would have known I put it back in its spot I ended up putting it in my back pocket along with the second marked photograph I remember wishing I had more friends at this point since I could have used a break from the atmosphere of our house I could still hear my father vacuum cleaning downstairs not having anything better to do I figured Id see if he could use an extra pair of hands it was after all a pretty big house for just me and him When I had paced myself downstairs my father wasnt anywhere to be seen I followed the sound of the vacuum cleaner into the kitchen The vacuum cleaner was left on my father still wasnt anywhere to be seen I turned off the noisy thing and dedicated a minute of silence to figuring out where my dad was and why he would have left the vacuum cleaner on It didnt even look like he had gotten started cleaning the kitchen it was dirt and dust all over the floor I also had thoughts about dumping the usb drive in one of the cupboards but I never did I didnt notice when I stepped into the kitchen but I noticed later that it seemed like someone had been looking for something in there some of the drawers were open and even the fridge had been moved I was guessing someone had been taking a peek behind it I figured I might as well push the fridge back to its original position As I was using all the energy I had left after these sleepless nights in attempt to move the fridge I kept staring out the window which I could just barely see gazing into our living room I could see the forest I used to play in growing up I remember it was a quite windy and chilly afternoon That didnt exactly invite me outdoors I could even see my old tree house in the distance I couldnt believe my father spent so much time with me trying not to make it fall apart something it kept doing Since I had spent something close to an hour examining an old photo that partly took place in the view I got outside the window I figured Id walk into the living room and take a better look at it Upon entering the room I could see my mother staring at me through the window next to it I reacted with impulsively retracting to the kitchen as fast as I could I think instincts took over I summoned the courage to walk in there again and my mother was no longer to be seen She looked scared this time as if she was hiding from me It gave me the chills to say the least I didnt feel like peeking out the window anymore but I did notice something out there that was suspiciously different from the picture I had in my back pocket I noticed one of the trees in the photo had been slightly damaged a lot of twigs missing the bark looking weak at some spots None of this took place anymore whatever originally caused it must have stopped Id also like to mention that you would imagine that the nature would have grown a noticeable chunk by the years but I could barely tell that this photo was taken any earlier than a week before judging from the forest alone My dad looked younger of course This is when I noticed a cluster of rocks piled up behind our flowerbed a bit into the forest I wasnt sure if those rocks where there days ago or not I had never seen them The photo happened to cover a view behind the flowerbed and not a single rock was visible My dad must have done some sorting out in the woods recently not that he had ever worried about taking care of the forest behind our house before Not giving it more of a thought I made plans to head back to my room upstairs Later night was closing in I didnt know what to make out of any of this all I knew is that I thought something was wrong with me since I kept seeing my mother I remember blaming it on all those sleepless nights I had experienced I originally planned on sleeping when I entered my room I couldnt take much more madness But as I was expecting I couldnt sleep It felt as if I had a weight on my chest preventing me from relaxing or breathing easily I didnt even want to listen to music or read a book I was just laying there with my eyes closed in my dark roomI kept thinking that I heard something A small tap from the other side of the room or a creaking noise from the door I remember putting my hands over my ears while constantly telling myself that I was just being gullible that I was just sizing up small coincidences because I was scared Wanting to become one with reason I figured Id remove my hands from atop of my ears and open my eyes so I could prove to myself that there was nothing in my room I just wanted to sleep I opened my eyes it was dead silent in my room I looked around from left to right and there was nothing to be seen in the room That relieved me a bit but it wasnt enough to convince me I was safe I figured Id get it over with and turn on the lights again so I did I was more than happy with seeing that there was nothing unexpected in my room I hit the light switch again and started to climb back into bed when I heard a tired voice from the other side of the room Jona I wasnt sure if I imagined it or not I was so full of fear that I couldnt move I was halfway into my bed and it was impossible to stay as still as I wanted to I remember the springs in my bed making a constant noise as I was halfway into the bed It didnt sound much like my mother but no one else called me Jona I turned around slowly and saw my mother looking at me from outside the window as if she was standing on the garage roof just outside This time she didnt disappear she kept staring at me I had no idea what to do she looked completely solid as if she was a still image I remember not even having the courage to say anything and at the same time I couldnt take my eyes off of her Her face was deranged and disfigured so sad with a look of misfortune I made an escape from my room and ran down the stairs as fast as I could apparently I fell before reaching half the way downI woke up the next day in a hospital it was a doctor and my father standing there looking at me as if they were waiting for a sleeping pill to lose its effect Upon waking up I remember telling my father about what I had seen he assumed I had a nightmare and told me to get some more rest I yelled at him again I explained how it wasnt a dream also adding that it wasnt the only time I had seen her I remember the doctor telling my father that dreams could seem more realistic after you had been knocked out My father leaned in and told me to shut my mouth or I would end up where my sister was I didnt know what to thinkLuckily my legs werent severely damaged my father only took me to the hospital because I passed out I guess that would explain the minor pain I was feeling at the back of my head Both of them went away somewhere leaving me alone in my part time hotel of a temporary bedroom It wasnt that luxurious it was like a normal room in any American hospital I felt ready to go home but I wasnt sure if they would let me go I could just barely hear my father discussing that matter with one of the nurses outside it sounded like they came to a conclusion My father walked into my room and told me that we could leave I wasnt sure if he threatened them to get that option I made it back to my fathers car I guess I cant say back since I had no memory of travelling in his car on the way there but I had to assume I did During the trip home I remember my father acting nervous as if he didnt fancy passing that side of town I dont think he was used to driving there The hospital took place in the opposite direction from where the bottle factory was relying that being from our house of course When we got home he dropped me off in our driveway then he told me he had to go golfing I personally thought he looked way too serious to be going for a golf session maybe the stakes were high Shortly after saying goodbye his car was around the corner nowhere to be seen I paced myself into our house I remember feeling relieved and anew as if my accident in the staircase had given me a fresh start I wasnt worrying as much but I still wanted answers You know that feeling when you just know something isnt right I had it all over me Before moving on I made sure to empty our mailbox it was almost fullI realized when I entered the house that my dad had finally gotten around to cleaning the kitchen maybe he figured out that the vacuum cleaner needed manual handling Although at the same time it didnt make much sense where did he find the time to clean the kitchen It was still dirty when I fell down the stairs late the other night and this was early morning the next day I guess my dad was one flexible cleaner Or maybe I was mixing up the times I did get a pretty solid hit to the back of my head I was going to grab something out of the fridge but I remembered the snacks I bought the other day I never got around to eating them Knowing they were in my room upstairs I started to make my way up there As I was sipping on one of the soda cans I tried making my way through the mountain of post I had collected from the mailbox There wasnt much interesting a lot of it seemed to be bills my father hadnt gotten around to paying yet with the occasional letter from my fathers bank I assumed the bank was sending him statements maybe for buying half a ton of golf equipment online Although I had never spotted any golf equipment what so ever maybe he kept that in the trunk of the car I came around to a letter that fitted the template I remembered from my sisters letter I had no idea what to do of course I wanted to read it but my father would inevitable find out After giving it a couple of seconds I figured I could just open it and never show it to my father at all How would he know that he ever got it Upon opening the envelope I noticed a tearoff slip attached to the main letter this must have been torn off already when I found my sisters old letter I wasnt sure what to think of it it was a returning to sender notice Not knowing how that made any sense I figured Id dig into the actual message of the post Before I started reading I couldnt help to give some attention to the layout it just didnt make sense It had this template that I had seen before wrapping the handwritten message from my sister into a box in the middle I couldnt find a business or a company name anywhere on it and it seemed to be in a pretty sloppy quality It looked a lot like someone had printed it out with a printer that was just running out of ink not only that but it also didnt look like an original copy of the template You could see that aligning of a muffled shadow copy that you would get if someone scanned the document and printed it out I didnt know what type of mental institution my sister was at but it sure couldnt be an expensive one I jumped into the messageThank you for seeing me daddy I had started to think you didnt care about me anymore Ive always felt relieved and secure in your presence Sometimes it might not seem like it but I have always respected you for teaching me wrong from right Sometimes I think this home isnt helping me it was better before Visit us againI love you daddy Sincerely your little darlingOnce again I had to correct a huge load of errors for the sake of this story Id also like to add that the absolute last word darling was more of a guess than a correction It was mostly faded into the white background and accounting for possible spelling errors there was no way I could be sure it said darling I felt somewhat eased after reading the letter I didnt know my sister and my dad had a bond like that There was a date signed underneath her message it wasnt in the same handwriting as my sisters I figured she was too mentally incapable to remember dates someone at the hospital must have been handling the dating I had to either get rid of the letter once and for all or hide it somewhere my father would never find it Not over thinking it I ended up putting it under the bed with my other stuff from earlier when I realized all of it was gone The photographs and the rocks I didnt even remember if I had put something else there as well either way it was gone The usb memory that I had put in my back pocket was surprisingly still there and so was the picture of my dad holding the worm Suspecting my father for taking the stuff under my bed I figured I had to find a new hiding spot for the letter My room was a bit like an open field there was no real good hiding spot in it I finally figured I could put the letter under my doormat knowing it might not have been the best spotJust before sliding it underneath I took a last glance at the signed date it was the day I met my sister on the road Now the message made less sense she didnt seem to be acting very positive about seeing my dad that night I also wouldnt call that incident a visit They must have had a lot of letters going in and out of the mental hospital making the posting of some letters somewhat late Thats the only explanation I could think of It wasnt my sister who signed the date after all it wasnt even the original letter since they scanned her handwritten message onto the template I didnt know if they did that out of convenience or safety maybe bothIt was starting to get a bit dark outside and my father was still away hopefully enjoying swinging a golf club Not being sure what to do and not having any motivation to do anything musically I ended up walking down to our kitchen in order to manage a way to get something to eat This is when I noticed all the photographs from under my bed laying on a coffee table we had in the corner of the kitchen My dad definitely found them Luckily I had nothing to fear since if you think about it it wasnt anything else than old family pictures taken from our house I dont know what reason I could have had for having them but making something up shouldnt be too hard if he ever were to ask meWe had a big mirror in the kitchen It used to be kept clean when my mother was around now it had collected dust and a bit of what I believed was grease from my fathers hair products I put some microwave pizza into the microwave and started to check out the bruises I had gotten on my legs using the mirror They looked gruesome and painful but to tell you the truth they didnt bother me too much It was as if most of the pain that got caused to me when I fell down the stairs got past me during the time I spent dozed off in the hospital I guess I felt lucky considering that things could have gone way worse I didnt want to believe it anymore I caught a glimpse of my mother staring at me through the window behind me once again from our backyard I didnt want to turn around Even though I had lost the sight of her in the blink an eye I was still staring into the mirror making sure nothing was behind me It was just me and the humming noise coming from the microwave I might just have seen her for a fraction of a second but I could tell she looked older this time Much much older Part of me felt like I should have known better than to look into a mirror its hard to explain what I was thinking during these moments It was as if every experience I had could have been a coincidence or could have had a psychological explanation rooting from the loss of sleep I had been having After each and every incident it felt like it wouldnt happen againI turned off the microwave before my pizza was finished and stepped into the living room I wouldnt be able to tell you today why I did this but it felt as if my mother was leading me to it I ran out to the backyard I was getting so sick of this I wanted it to end It felt as if I had nothing to lose anymore It was dark outdoors by now night had fallen over the town faster than I expected it to I made myself to the miniature mountain of rocks behind our flowerbed I was scared and I didnt even know of what anymore I kept pushing rock after rock off of the gentle hill someone had formed Some of them went to the left some of them went to the right I tried to distribute them as evenly as I could When most of the rocks were out of the way I was standing on top of a soft soil I couldnt tell from how dark it was what color the soil had but it seemed somewhat greyI ran as fast as I could back to our garage where my fathers old Pontiac used to be parked I knew we had garden tools somewhere in there I was out of luck the bigger shovel I believed we had was nowhere to be found and all I managed to get my hands on was a smaller shovel made for picking up plants from a home garden I made my way back to behind the flowerbed It was getting really dark now I could barely make out what anything around me was I kept digging as fast as I could I believe my sanity was starting to fade out for an instance After a while I was about two feet down into the ground and still nothing could be found I wasnt expecting to be able to see much so once every five inches or so Id feel my way through the dirt in order to make out if there was something down there This is when I heard my father park his car in the driveway I didnt want to know what he would do if he saw me digging in the forest not far from our backward it didnt help that it was dark outside I remember saying to myself Why couldnt he go directly to work after golfing tonight It felt like God was playing a trick on me I left the small shovel in the newly dug hole since it already was obvious someone had been digging out there anyway I tried to be as quiet as I could not wanting to take the route to the other side of the house since I hadnt heard the door shut yet something that implied my father still hadnt entered the house I was sitting where I earlier had witnessed my mother staring into the house I was doing the same Being ridiculously scared of my father seeing me I kept my head held low waiting for him to enter the house I eventually heard the trunk of his car close followed by him entering the house I was thinking of sneaking around the house in order to enter the front door while pretending to have been at Tims place something that wouldnt work since I had dirt covering my waist and down I sat there looking at my father in the kitchen knowing that I had no reasonable explanation to what I was doing if he spotted meIt took almost thirty minutes before he came into the living room I had no idea what he was doing in the kitchen for that long I could hear as he walked around he never took his shoes off As he started to move his head in my direction I dashed down under the window just in time I could hear the footsteps coming closer to me I couldnt see anything but I could tell he must have stopped just next to the window I guessed he was staring out the window looking for something Out of fear I started crawling trying to get away from the window I spotted one of our old outdoor tables standing next to the same wall as the window knowing the risk of my father spotting me I figured Id give it a try anyway I thought I made it to the table without being heard or seen something that I believed was a miracle at the time My father looked confused he was still staring out the window I didnt know what he was looking for I could only have feared he had noticed that the pile of rocks was gone He started to move I was relieved I was hoping he would be heading for bed but it turned out he was heading for the light switches Leaving the lights in the living room alone he turned on the outdoor lights Now he could clearly see that the pile of rocks was gone he started to look anxious and puzzled I remember still sitting under that table as he ran past me heading into the forest As soon as he was a good distance into the woods I started to sneak around the house making my way inside I was panicking to say the least and I had to find a new pair of jeans Luckily for me we had the washing machine just as you entered the house to the left I threw my old pair of jeans onto the floor and grabbed a new pair from the washer we had the type of washing machine thatd have a drying mechanism as part of the washer so the pair I got a hold of wasnt terribly wet Before running straight up to my room I grabbed my old pair with me all would have been for nothing if he could still find those on his way in I remember seeing my dad standing out there in the woods looking at a note of some sort He looked a bit confused almost as if he was reading instructions for something Once I had made it to my room I locked the door after me I was very stressed out and I had no idea what was happening anymore I knew I had to hide my old pair of jeans somehow and you know from earlier that my room wasnt the best place in the world when it came to finding a good hiding spot After not too many seconds of thought I figured I could throw the pair out the window onto the garage roof Before I did that I thought itd be a good idea to empty the back pocket It felt like my heart rate went full force when I realized the pocket was empty My mind started spinning where could I have dropped the photograph and the usb stick I had no idea At first I thought I must have dropped it when I took them off or on the way up to my room since I was holding my pants pretty sloppy throughout most of that running That was when it hit me in the chest my father wasnt reading any instructions out in the backyard he must have been looking at the photographLast

JunkPrince,53,92,1ragny,263,Hey all long time reader of rnosleep and I finally have a reason to postI work in a recycling center I am the guy that weighs the truck when it comes in with scrap metal watches it unload and then weighs the truck when it comes out That difference in weight is used to calculate the value of the scrap and how much the customer receives for his load its a well known place in my town city actually Theres a pretty steady business and its good work I started out in the yard sorting and a few years ago moved into the office I still have to wear a hard hat and safety vest but only when I have to watch a truck unload in an area that the cameras dont cover A few days ago we started getting loads from a demolition job about a hundred miles from town It was an old Air Force base that didnt survive the latest round of budget cuts The base was being scrapped to make a nature preserve The plan is called Nukes to nature The contractors brought in mostly structural iron copper wiring and office equipment I was watching a contractor  who was mostly likely drunk tip his truck when a old metal desk caught my eye It landed right side up twenty feet from me Because I was bored I walked over and opened the drawers One of the drawers a metal lock box I took it back to my desk and set about picking the lock Working in a scrap yard we sometimes come across old strongboxes or small office safes My boss has a deal that if you can open it then whoever finds it splits the contents  with the scrapyard You can see why Ive gotten pretty good at picking locksThe box opened after a few minutes of concerted effort Inside was just an old piece of computer equipment an inch high by  inches long The closest thing I could compare the size to was to the box that your bank send you your checks in It had a small bar code on the top part and handwritten in permanent marker was the words  MJ Containment  An orange sticker proclaimed  Erase and Destroy ref FM  USA TRADOCI showed what I am now calling the hard drive to my boss who was VERY unimpressed and gave me the number for a IT guy who might want to buy it I am going to see if he wants to buy it but Im going to ask him if he can see what files are on the drive Secret plans to bomb the Soviets Blueprints for a new jet fighter Who knows Its a mystery worthy of rnosleepIll post when I hear back from the IT guyupdate httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrdjjfoundharddrivewtfupdate  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrfzsdonewiththisfharddrive,1385222169.0,Found hard drive,355,nosleep,top_week
tellmewhatiswrong,54,72,1reivz,244,Arghhh I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself inI started off  as being in the most amazing relationship Ive ever had I married the girl of my dreams last year after being together for  years prior to that She is the most beautiful intelligent interesting person I have ever met and I knew that as soon as we met each other Immediately the chemistry between us was electricDont get me wrong we are extremely different in a lot of ways but up until this point that has only helped to make our relationship stronger Im an atheist a kind of scientific nerd I guess She on the other hand was morenew age I guess you could say Not particularly religious but interested in the paranormal philosophy anything that cant really be explained It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFOs however for the most part this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentaryHaving said that she is so sensible and smart Shes a very curious person thats what I put her hobbies down to really Its never been more than a passing interest of hers She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary But she seems content enough at the momentwell she didThe reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on  kids When we first got together we both agreed that we did not want to have children We based our entire relationship on that premise We were content with travelling the world expensive wines and sex on the kitchen bench All that would change if kids came into the picture I have never wanted children and dont feel like I ever willShe used to feel the same Until her sister had a baby She started to get a little clucky she said She started to see us with a baby of our own At first I thought it was just a passing comment but the longer time went on the more I realised she was serious Thats when the fights started Fight after fight every week Her crying and yelling and begging me to change To compromise Me dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged Things have been said in the heat of the moment and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other She makes me feel like I cant give her what she needs that Im denying her her happiness I make her feel like shes not important she says That Im being selfishMaybe I am I dont knowSo we found ourselves in a stale mate She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counsellingI was reluctant to say the least But I was willing to give it a shotSandra our therapist was actually not what I expected She seemed rational and quite straightforward not the Einsteinesque shrink that I had imagined She advised that we really we had two options  either she could stay with me and be without a child Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby We seem to be stuck in secret option number  staying in the circumstances we find ourselves inDisregarding all the fighting she was still her normal self and we have been managing to keep it together and still spend some quality time together We have still been going out with friends and going for walks with our dog and I know we still love each otherI stopped going to couples counselling I sort of felt like she couldnt give us a real answer she was only there to listen My wife kept attending on her own though I think she takes some kind of comfort in itShe came home last week and told me that shes going to be attending a Self help seminar and would I like to go I said definitely not I couldnt think of anything worse than to be honest Even the counselling sessions were too much for me She asked if I minded if she went She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst and that her therapist would be in attendance on the Assistance Team I said whatever she felt would help She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue Im all for anything that could help us get back on track so I told her to go for itThe seminar seemed pretty intensive It was  hours a day Friday Saturday and Sunday of last week It was also very expensive but I bit my tongue She got home last night and just seemed exhausted I havent gotten many details out of her as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak Today we both had the day off which was recommended by the people who organised the seminarToday we woke up and she wasintense I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life She was stroking my face and staring into my face It was quite nice actually Nice to have some affection We cuddled in bed for a long while She seemedok Her eyes definitely looked brighter but she didnt say much just was very intensely affectionate She got up to have a shower and I went out to have some breakfast After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door telling her to leave some hot water She must have had it on so hot steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway and the walls were dripping with condensation I knocked a few more times and yelled out to her but got no responseI opened the door and waited for the hazy steam to clear to see her standing there fully clothed and staring in the mirror The shower was on full ball and extremely hot and I reached over the turned the tap off She didnt take her eyes off her own reflection She was very vague when I questioned her and sweating profusely I managed to get her dressed out her pyjamas and shes in the other room now watching TVI assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar I dont really understand all this new age crap has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars Or know someone that has Ive tried googling more information but cant see anything about this specific group Any advice would be appreciated Im a bit weirded out right now to be honestUpdate herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrhbucupdateneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobein,1385361882.0,Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird trancezombie like state Not sure what to do or if Im

afewsmallrepairs,13,61,1rff0q,247,Theres always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her toobig smile and her nails painted to match her pantssuit  Theyre nosy and smothering but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectlylacquered finger the same goddamn shade of melonred as her smart little blazer  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway out of politeness more than anythingThe house smells like cookies  Its an old realtor trick make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of freshbaked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesnt seem quite so steep  People want to feel like theyre homeIts a candle I think  Smells soursweet and artificialI realize suddenly Ive been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes staring aimlessly into the house  Where to begin  The living room I guessTheres a big ugly fauxleather couch along one wall  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots  It doesnt serve much except to fill up the space  Its flanked by two particle board end tables little doilies on top of these  Miss MelonRed Blazer doesnt have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork  The room looks like a scene straight out of a s Sears catalog  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizonThere are little dimples on the walls paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there  Scenes of summer vacations children playing smiling happy faces  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling rightWell the realtor hasnt put up any pictures  The room feels empty skeletal without themI move into the bathroom  Nothing special here more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashellshaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain but Ive found the cookiescented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfactionThere are two bedrooms  One at each end of the hall  I choose the one to my right feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchens eastern lightIts a small bedroom  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old whoever replaced them was an amateur  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care  Its a shame is what it is  This would all have to be redoneTheyve set up this room as a home office but it should be the childrens bedroom  Where the thriftstore desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes doThe headache is no longer approaching its here spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fastFocus  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is the telltale trace of someones childhood tiny little ticmarks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time  I run my fingertips along these marks still so visible through the fresh coat of paint  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off  who would do something like that  Who would try to erase the remnants of someones lifeIf I dont leave I might faint all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave I move down the hall to the other roomThis one is the master bedroom  Looks like they couldnt afford a bed to properly stage the scene so this one feels even emptier than the den  The walls have been repainted a cheerful robinsegg blue but its wrong  Its all wrongThey did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color I hate this color it clashes with my bedspread and I wouldve never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue  though there were many nights I suppose I didnt sleep I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong where he was and why he thought he could fool meI drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall  Its new of course they wouldve had to replace it  Faulty wiring that causes fires well that just wouldnt do  When the bank takes a house it cant sell one with such a serious problem  Sometimes things need to be replaced resold  A fixerupper thats what theyd call itThe headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything hed promised to do to this damned house all the little projects he swore up and down hed finish someday to make this place perfect for me things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his wayIt wasnt hard  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson  I was careful used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history wore a wig  Id seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be even if she did get off  but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent shell be a pariah forever and thats simply not how I planned to live the rest of my lifeIm really sorry about the children  My daughters  I truly am  I didnt know theyd be in our bed that night  They were supposed to be at a friends house but they came home early someone had pulled someone elses hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway  I didnt do anything that couldnt be fixed with a few small repairs both to the house and my lifeIt makes me so angry  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me reeking of some other womans sex  He couldnt even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasnt there because she was away at her own mommys the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her Im sorry maam theres been an accident could you please come with usIm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss MelonRed Blazer behind me inquiring politely if theres anything she can help me with  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like shes relit the candle in the bathroomI straighten tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at meI explain Im just looking  The price on the house is so low though what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economyThe real estate agents smile falters and she hesitates  I know shes bound by law to tell me to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothingI know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime how dangerous it is and how not careful Im being right now but something in me cant resist because I can still see the little matching beds the stickers across the headboards and the ticmarks on the doorframe and something inside me needs to hear her say it to quantify each and every step I took to get hereWell she says slowly about a year ago there was a fireI nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go the pain in my brain dissipating at last leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children

ephique,111,106,1ro3vw,246,Part  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrikrxiwanttotellaboutmymotherPart  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrljwiwanttotellaboutmymotherpartI had to make a snap decision at this point I couldnt just stand there My father obviously knew I had been out there since he already had gotten hold of the rest of my photo collection from underneath the bed My first initiative was to open the window and see if there was any chance of escaping the villa altogether a plan that probably would have worked if I didnt get interrupted before even grabbing the handle Needless to say my father had already gotten to the door He tried opening it by force but luckily I had remembered to lock itWhy is the door locked is Jonathan in there with you He shouted and continued pounding the door as if it had a threshold for pain I assumed he thought my sister had locked herself into the room Had he seen my sister around the house At least he wasnt suspecting me for doing the digging Open the door we can talk about this I want to know what you did in my backyard Darling I think he gave up on the possibility of me even being in the room he probably figured I would have spoken up Not being entirely sure what to do I figured Id take a social turn of events Linda isnt in here what do you want dadI remember how quiet it got after I replied to him and not just because of the banging Your sister was uhm Your sister was acting all crazy out there today she has escaped again Im starting to think theres something seriously wrong with this hospital Im paying my good money for He really sounded like he didnt expect me to be in there after all I cant lie though a part of me thought he was bluffing to get me to open the door I had a lot of twisted feelings about the whole thing but I figured I would have to give in he didnt sound too angry toward the end Luckily for me he didnt seem to be too much of a threat after I had finally opened the door I remember thinking If he wanted me dead he wouldnt have taken me to the doctor when I fell down the stairs He acted completely normal he even asked me if I wanted something from the store he needed to head off to work That reminded me of when I was a kid he would always buy me a snack on his way home from work I told him I could use one or two cans of soda I wasnt very comfortable speaking to him at this point as you can imagine He also seemed a bit unstable like there was some quick task he wanted to get out of the way I did what I could to keep the conversation short Before leaving he told me to give a call if I spotted my sister adding that the hospital had phoned him about itI cant express with words how relieved I felt seeing him leave the house again I was also very confused I didnt even know what I thought of my father at the time let alone my sister Was she in close proximity had my father seen her I had no idea When I was completely sure his car wasnt just out of sight but also out of hearing distance I knew I had to finish what I started Something gave me courage I knew I should have been more scared but something kept me going I gathered a flashlight from the cupboard in our kitchen and headed back into the forest behind our backyard I knew something was underneath that flowerbed especially judging from that anxious stare my father had when he noticed the pile of rocks was gone I thought I was imagining things out of the stress I felt as I was digging deeper and deeper into the soft soil I thought I could see my mother staring at me from a distance always at the end of my vision No matter where I looked that feeling followed me I could barely see anything I kept the same strategy I used before feeling my way through the soil every five inches or so I was losing my mind in fear of being watched I kept hearing twigs snapping and that distinct sound of someone walking on leaves No one was ever to be seen a notion that wasnt very comforting since my poor flashlight didnt reach much more than ten feet   I remember hitting something of a different texture with that small pointy shovel of mine I could barely summon the willpower to point my flashlight toward it It was a hand a pale lifeless hand I already thought I knew whose hand it was but I wanted to make sure I followed it with my source of light finding the torso it was attached to I couldnt breathe and I wanted to cry but the fear of someone hearing me was stronger than that I pointed my flashlight at the face and ended up dropping it in astonishment Now I couldnt hold it together anymore I screamed and I cried as loud as I could I tried to cover up the body with what dirt I could grasp giving up shortly after I ran back to the house that was the only reasonable thing I could think of I felt so tumbled inside of my head I didnt know what to think anymore It felt as if I was under the influence of a mindmelting drug I was so full of fear and anger that I couldnt tell if I was thinking or not I was standing in the living room of our house completely out of reason for the moment The neurons finally fired and I grabbed the landline phone and called the police I knew that the first thing to do upon phoning the police was to add all details concerning where you are after that I added Im in serious need of help right now I could be in danger Make your way here as fast as possible Very obvious additions I was scared and I dont think anyone would blame me My father has killed my sister I found her buried in the backyard I was crying as I threw these hard lines out there It was as if not saying them out loud would keep them from being true I felt helpless The woman on the other side of the line told me to hang on as she was about to ask me questions about my situation I thought Id be safer upstairs so I carried the phone with me and locked myself in my room it felt like a habit at this point The woman told me that officers would be at my destination within minutes so I felt relatively confident ending the call Shortly after that I noticed something unsettling in my room the doormat wasnt pointing in the right direction It was one of those doormats with a short greeting on top Mine wasnt anything out of the ordinary it said welcome home It caught me offguard the letter from my sister wasnt underneath it anymore My father had known all along I felt chills running down my spine as I kept thinking about how I had potentially been running into his trap there was no way he went to work I made a run for it I wanted to run as fast and as far as I could On my way down the stairs I spotted him in the living room She brought it upon herself Jonathan He said as if it was an obvious fact I was scared as I got to witness how my father acted in his true colors I always knew mom didnt die from a liverfailure and now I know what you have done to my sister I shouted as I walked backwards away from him as he slowly made his way closer to me Finally I could hear police sirens it felt like time couldnt go fast enough My father snapped he ran toward me and knocked me into one of the windows in the living room  I was dozing off I didnt make it hard for him to pick me up and carry me on his back into the forest He ran past my sisters lifeless body and onto the road where I had spotted him chasing my sister at one point His car was already parked behind a cluster of bushes Upon arriving at the vehicle he threw me into the backseat He seemed to know his way around a shaky road into the woods He even knew it well enough to make it through without the headlights I was barely conscious the slam into the window really got to meI remember hearing the sound of sirens getting less and less noticeable as he drove me further into the woods After at least twenty minutes I could feel the car stopping My father made very solid and strict movements it was as if he knew exactly what he was doing He grabbed my leg and pulled me out of the car violently This is what happens when you interfere with other peoples personal business He implied as he started pushing me toward what I believe was a very old wine cellar in the middle of the forest He opened the heavy and sturdy door and threw me into a pitch black room saying And you thought I was playing golf What a lousy sport I didnt know what to make of it I couldnt see anything in there After a brief moment a vile stench started crawling into my nostrils it was so concentrated and thick that it felt like it would stay in my nose forever Shortly after I was throwing up I couldnt take that odor it was too much My father stepped inside and turned on what I believe was an electricity engine that went on gas It started flickering and after a couple of seconds I could see clearly inside the entire room It was indeed an old wine cellar not in good condition at all I knew the stench came from behind me I had purposely turned away from the smell in order to save myself from throwing up a second time I was sitting on the floor wondering what was happening as my dad started walking past me He was walking toward the other side of the room I followed him with my eyes in case he had plans on doing something spontaneous to me I noticed that he had put on a fake mustache and a hat while I had been throwing up How are we doing today Mrs Rose did you take your medication He said in what I believe was an attempt at British not to me though He was speaking to the corpse of my dead mother which he had tied up against a chair forcing it to somewhat sit up It was beyond rotten it was barely anything left that resembled a human being As you see we have a new patient today maybe this one will appreciate his family at home Speaking of which Mrs Rose perhaps you would like to write a letter to that husband of yours today I believe you hold him dearly I started running for the door smashing and hitting it all I could It was too thick and way too heavy for me to be able to make an impact Are you missing your family already little Jonathan Dont you worry youll get to see your father again I bet he misses you every day  Summary by R Jorgensen officer in chargeWe got a call from what the emergency center thought sounded like a teenage boy He seemed terrified and scared while telling them about his father having murdered his sister and supposedly hiding her underground in their backyard Minutes after the incident our officers had made their way to the villa in Ohio We couldnt find the boy who alarmed us about the crime suspecting it had something to do with a broken window in the living room positioned downstairs We directly started a search for the boy using police dogs in the lead Not far from the villa we found a female corpse identified later as the sister of the young boy who reported the crime Our police dogs didnt take us further than to a road not more than a couple of minutes from where we found the corpse We spotted tracks in the road nearby leading into the woods on the other side With that being our only lead we followed the tracks as productive as we could It wasnt easy to manage on that road our vehicles kept getting stuck in pools of mud It wasnt an official road by any meansAfter what I would believe must have been something around thirty minutes we found ourselves next to an old wine cellar It was so broken down that youd mistake it for a cave The heavy door made of stone was locked and it took us five minutes to get through it by using vehicles tied to ropes basically forcing the door to open up Most of the cops that started sneaking inside ended up backtracking the smell creeping out of that room was beyond disgusting I myself was stood outside peering into the old wine cellar After maybe ten seconds we could see the boy running out he was bent forward in order to move with the chair that was tied to his back He looked confused and scared as you can imagine The father was stood inside just next to a very old corpse of a woman that he had tied to another chair He didnt seem to be threatened by us I was under the clear assumption that he was a psychopathWe interviewed the boy Jonathan Rose We also did our fair share of psychological research on the father whose name was Henry Rose He seemed to be a horrifying example of a psychopath as well as a schizophrenic We had him tested by experts in every relevant field we could think of We do this with every criminal that have no clear motive behind their actions in order to understand them In the fathers own mind he wasnt committing crimes at all he thought he was helping his sister and wife by treating them in his wine cellar or mental hospital if you asked him Henry had no sense of emotion he couldnt feel empathy His brain basically had no active mirrorneurons he didnt see himself in anything humanlike At the same time was he for some mysterious reason still interested in compliments on being a good father and husband He made his captives write letters promising them that itd go straight to Henry Rose someone he didnt know he was during the times where his other personality had taken over It was a very curious case I still havent seen anything like it during my entire professional career ,1385673836.0,I want to tell about my motherpart  Ending,352,nosleep,top_week
tellmewhatiswrong,70,62,1rhbuc,221,OriginalPosthttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsreivzneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinsomeThanks to everyone for your responses I have taken a lot of your adviceIll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours I was going to walk our dog Zeus but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confusedShe woke up after a couple of hours and waswell Happy Really really happy Almost manic She woke up full of beans and smiling like a maniac I was initially relieved I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed We set off for our normal walk and she was extremely energetic bounding off in front of Zeus and I Zeus is a Labrador and although he is a big boy hes still a pup We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as were trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable Its always been a real task getting him back on the leash though he never ever comes when hes called Anyway we let him off and hes running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough My wife shes picking flowers and sniffing them and singing She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit as she sings under her breath I was feeling quite content at this point Figured she must have just been over tiredShes swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt She yells in an almost unfamiliar masculine voice Zeus Here and points in front of her feetI stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know solemnly trot over to where shes pointing sit in front of her and stare up into her face They both sat there for a split second very still looking at each other I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her Umwhat the hell How did you manage that and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again and she started swinging again  Oh she said I used my mind to call out to himits something new I learnedShe seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest I pressed her for more details but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got She knows I dont believe that for a second Im just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained Thats really the only explanation I asked her to do it again but she refused so I think we both know it was a flukeThe rest of the afternoon wasnice Kind of odd Its like theres something thats amiss Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that something is not how it should be but you cant pin point whatWe talked a bit about the seminar She said that it was very intense The days were very long She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset to explore the root causes for whats going on in your life I asked if any hypnosis was used as suggested by you guys and she said no They talked a lot and were assigned to small groups and encouraged to open up and explore their inner beings She said she felt a lot better since attendingStill something was not quite right For instance we were talking about my sister who lives in another state and how she had recently got a new job A few minutes later my phone rang and it was her I picked it up and said Emma Speak of the devil and my wife smashed me up the side of the head causing me to drop the phone and shouted Emma is NOT the devil How could you say that Emma is NOT THE DEVIL I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down She was very upset at what I had said She sort of went silent again and was very still She seemed rather annoyed at me but by this point I was nearing exhaustion myself so I let her beShe fell asleep early about pm on the couch I covered her with a blanket and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and Ive never noticed it before I think that in my state of hyper vigilance I am being overly perceptive of small details I read more of my original post and all your comments and decided to step outside and call our therapist just to find out more about the seminar as I knew she was there assistingI walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her She answered on my first ring What she said has really weirded me out Only because although she gave me a lot of information she has raised many more questions as well as answered them She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda who are both selfappointed psychotherapists She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state they may need assistance She said she has referred a lot of her clients to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases Basically the course is about discovering your inner self and using different methods to connect to your inner voice to find out what the cause of your worries are She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense Each session goes for  hours with only an hour break During these sessions many different activities and topics are explored including regression Apparently Brian does this  hour session on the second last day where he gets everyone to meditate and be still and he regresses them back to childhood or even in some extreme cases past lives Our therapist said it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that but that she seemed brighter had a clarity about her after this experience They discussed what my wife had gone back to in her mind and the therapist was happy that it hadnt caused her any great distress but reminded me she couldnt discuss the specifics She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her experience I told her about my wifes strange behaviour She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions but nothing major I dont know if its just me but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice I dont know maybe I imagined it She said to call her if theres any further problems I hung up and as I was putting out my cigarette I turned to go inside and my wifes standing there staring at me I jump and say Jesus Christ honey you scared me and she replied Not as fucking much as Im going to scare you Ummm ok I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face and her face was fixed in this awful scowl I figured she must still be pissed at me from before I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep And well thats where she is now she was supposed to be off work today too but I was meant to go back to my job But when my alarm went off I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok I rang in sick for work and Im just doing some household jobs waiting to see if shes better when she wakes up and googling what regression means and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone Still nothing that convincing though I dont know Maybe Im too skeptical I just dont believe this crapThe whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me if Im honest But I have to say it has caused some kind of change in my wife She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment and Im worried because we both have to go back to work tomorrow and her work environment is very proper She is always a perfect employee and very dedicated to her work I cant help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in thismood Do you guys know anything about this regressionis it the same as hypnosis She was adamant she wasnt hypnotised but it sounds like it to meFINAL UPDATE HEREhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrnsafinalupdateneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeEDIT Ok now Im getting really freaked out I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep I cant quit work out what song shes singing Ive never heard it before But shes saying something about being someone called Azara or something Its really fucking unnerving it doesnt even sound like her Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light EDIT TWO Ok I managed to record a bit of itshes singing but I dont know what has anyone heard this before Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her Im kind freaked out now Ill admit it Here it ishttpsoundcloudcomuseraynmqytetesjECMW,1385448974.0,UPDATE Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird tranceZombie like state

chimeraphantasm,46,52,1rbg7n,213,My name is Ramiel and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep Trust me its better this way If its the middle of the day for you or perhaps youre not quite tired yet bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness but youre not nodding off yet I dont want you to forget what youre about to read Im on the tall skinny side of my arabic family I guess I take after my mom in that respect Though im pretty sure she didnt have this much facial hair She named me after an angel that is responsible for divine visions I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was  Why does my name and physical features matter I suppose it doesnt but if Im going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis id rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate  I dont want you to forget me when this is over Before we begin heres an interesting fact to wrap your head around Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT Dimethyltryptamine two times in your life Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind like a mass wipe of your hard drive Now you might think that isnt too important if youre just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts what if that soul that consciousness that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence What if at the moment of death you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable something youd only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you you continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there Your brains last failsafe a defence mechanism to ensure you wont carry the burden with you But like any kind of defence mechanism theres always a bypassand theres always a black box  DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night Not the reason however We have no idea why we dream we just do As soon we enter REM sleep our dreams become their most memorable and malleable It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible though we seldom ever remember the dream itself Because like a drug trip our brain is determined to protect us from that experiencebut what if that wasnt the only reasonConsider this The older we get we sleep considerably less hours As babies we sleep for up to  hours and by the time we hit  years old its half of that amount What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we dont spend too long in that realm No im not talking about the further from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects Youre still very much within your own mind but theres something else there with you  Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or nonbeliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why despite being an Atheist I pray to something to anything hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me that I dont dream Im a counsellor at my local university I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus It was your usual run of the mill kind of work talk to terrified st years whod never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom dealing with homesickness new friendships one night stands etc The nd years were dealing with social troubles within their housesapartments deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams so youd offer them all the appropriate advice your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in If not well theres always next week and beyond that a private therapist But like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions theres always one encounter you never forget For me that was Milo Moraga a nd year student studying Psychology amp Philosophy The first time he came into my office he struck me as a little bit gaunt his striped longsleeve top hanging off him like itd stretched in the wash Strung out but shy That would have been my first impression I think he sensed my preconceived notions avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside He was apprehensive sleep deprived his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept He sat down glancing around at the windows and leant forward cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastilyHello Milo how can I help you I understand you asked for this appointment because ofanxiety Do you want to tell me about that I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem it just gave him time to compose himself He didnt respond just kept shuffling in his chair I guess he wasnt  sure he should come here  Your lecturer sent you here didnt they I said bluntly feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward  minute session rearing its ugly monotonous head He nodded but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded  I leaned forward placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him I had to be very careful with how I handled this If he was suicidal one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck  Milo what happened in the classroom to get you here Can you tell me that muchHe mimicked me leaning forward as well though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own it looked like his spirit was broken The lecturerMs Armstrongshe was talking about solipsism and I just gotlost within it Do you know what solipsism isI did but I shook my head I didnt want to interrupt him when he was being so open Its a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind it is a construct of his own psyche There is no other human beings no other individual thoughts just his or her ownI guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down I raised an eyebrow thats certainly not a usual response Comforting Milo You mean to say you enjoy being alone amp isolated  No the opposite actually I have a lovely group of friends a loving family and a fiancé but it was comforting for another reasonif Its just me then what hurts me is just me I know what im capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point It means thatthat He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained It means that I might not die after all I rolled up my sleeves my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me First signs of stress I suppose I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath I knew this was going to be rough Itsits my dreams doc Theres something in my dreams I cant sleep anymore Each time I do its like I can sense im going into that place again journeying deeper into the void with every evening Ive tried taking coffee shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands onI even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for  hours butwell you know the problem right doc He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually no matter how long we put it off I exhaled Milo I want you to start at the beginning I know youre anxious to get some kind of help but if I dont know the route of the problem I cant give you the correct advice okay Now I want you take in  deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth Can you do that for me And you dont need to call me doc im just a volunteer counsellor You can call me Rami if you like He nodded and did as instructed his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia I didnt want to ask at this point how long hed been awake for but I could tell itd been more than a handful of days Once an individual goes past the  day mark they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later  Alright I picked up my laptop to take notes Go ahead tell me what started this all offWhat follows is the unedited conversation this is verbatim what was said between the two of us If I can find the audio recording later I will attach it to the post  Do you know much about lucid dreaming Rami  I know a little just that its something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer He nods before continuing Theres a learning curve to it you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses The typical things really the sensation to scratch your arm to roll over to block out the voices He stopped and stared at me with fear I didnt mean to tell you that  Its alright well get to it later lets just focus on the why and not the how for the moment What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place  He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid I kept seeing him in my dreams at first hed just be a random appearance and then hed start to try and approach me friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend Never threatening or hostile just attempting to make contact with me Though hed never get to Every single time id be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another directionHe shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing I remember in the first few dreams we had hed just be lingering in the background If I was walking through a street hed just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me Id see him watch me but then my dream would shift and I guess id just ignore it and carry onafter a few weeks I began getting better at controlling my dreams Id start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting like Inception I guess but morepersonal Id turn myself into a member of XMen or id go on a date with my perfect woman yknowthings that you can only dream of literallywell thats when he started to become more apparent Id usually wake up before he actually got too close but Id always remember the look on his face before I did His eyes widened He always looked so angryFormer abuse victim I thought adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions I didnt want to stop him while he was on a roll I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me I was in a park id visited as a child with my mother It was a small piece of heaven in London back then a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess But this was nothing like I remembered it the trees werent trees they were corpses stacked on top of one another some overlapping andmeshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me unable to move or even speak to me But their eyes their eyes said everything Because at first they fixated on me with hatred then quickly away in sheer terror Theyd seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already sufferingsoI His eyes welled up with tears unblinking as they streamed down his face  I looked Rami I looked and saw him standing some  feet away down the path his head bowed He wasnt moving and yet he was His body was almostrippling The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak Every time I blinked he came closer I tried for the longest time to not blink reallyI did But the brain betrays your conscious impulses The more you try to put off a basic function the more your brain wills you to do it When he was  feet away he simply vanished By the time I had registered that he was gone I heard a whisper in my earhe was standing right behind me I could feel his breath on my neck Ramiit didnt feel humanThere was an awkward silence he took in some deep breaths and shuddered Obviously reliving the memory wasnt going to be something pleasant for him butthe way he reacted it was like he truly had experienced this I stared at him nodding and silently encouraging him to continue When he didnt I leaned forward and quietly asked him what im sure he was waiting me to ask What did he say to you MiloMilo shook his head Im sorry I dont remember That was when the dream ended I didnt see him again in my dreams for a whileWe talked for a little while longer mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week This would be our last session together  It was a Monday morning and id just come back from a friends wedding my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover my flannel shirt covering the bruises id sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol It was a day my mind was not in the work I suppose I just wanted to get home and go to sleep    Milo came in earlier than planned he looked desperate He was pulling at his hair biting his fingernails and pacing constantly It didnt look like hed seen any sleep at all I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety How on earth hed managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me  I remember what he said Rami I remember it clearly now He said between pants and more nail biting Okay Milo Well why dont you take a seat and well talk it out He ignored that but stopped pacing and stared intently at me  Ill be right here always He put his arms around himself a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated That was what he said I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes He started bashing at his temples IT WONT FUCKING STOP  All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here  Did this make you afraid to dream Milo  He started laughing his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter  You dont get it do you He didnt mean just when I dream He meant always Now I knownow I know for sure He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace Not content but willing to let go  Thanks for listening Doc sharing this with someone was important to meand to him Hes going to have his work cut out for him im sure And just like that he got up and left I followed him out naturally concerned for him I watched him leave the building and cross the road  Then he did something I wont ever forget  He turned to me smiling and outstretched his hand crying openly as a vehicle struck him I didnt even see it coming I was so captivated by his expression  I couldnt even bring myself to go over to his body I gave my statement and went straight home All I could do was look in the mirror wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me When I looked at myself I didnt see a  lb brown coloured hipster I saw someone troubled someone who didnt look like theyd slept much lately someone like MiloI got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening Milo was in a coma and on life support He was nonresponsive and likely brain dead His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views I think deep down they just didnt want to let him go Id been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming trafficI wont bore you with the traveling details but his apartment was surprising I was half expecting a filthy run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state Guess I just watched too many detectivehorror movies growing up His place was immaculate everything was extremely clean and organised hed already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front this was already beginning to look like premeditation He had a desk beside his bed this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions Books on demonology the science of sleeping DMT some sleeping pills and a journal His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal ill include photos later if I get permission from the family names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out It initially contained legible competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled certain words appear larger than others he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to its end  The final entry is barely legible but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always  After this there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal rewritten over and over almost like its been carved in DREAMWhich brings us to the final part of this story the present Im sure youd all love to discover im actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and im moments away from death passing on a final message But as im sure youre all coming to realise that is not the case  I just woke up from a lucid dream ive never had one before nor do I know how I had one but it was definitely a lucid dream I was able to control my reality my own physical form and everything around me It was here I saw Milo He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything he asked me a favour  Pull the plug let me dieI was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment I wonderedwas this perhaps a shared dream I cant take the torture anymore Rami Please tell my family I love them but I need to be let goIts okay you dont need to suffer anymore in the real world ill do what I can to convince them I croaked placing a hand on his shoulder Milos smile faded  Im not talking about the torture there Rami Im talking about the torture herewithout being able to wake up he has complete control Im his new puppet and he wants to play forever He has no physical form this is where he resides This is where he plays  He looked over my shoulder and back at me with a sad smile on his face   Now hes chosen you as his new playmate He knows youre going to take my place Look at my journal again look at the drawings youll need to rememberHe turned to walk away leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream  Oh and Ramidont turn aroundI didnt but my entire being was willing me to Its that same feeling of anxiety you get when youre home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you A crushing horrifying feeling I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers we can plant ourselves a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal An idea be it malicious or noble can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement  The second section detailed a supporting theory  Within every story told fictitious or semibiographical exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as god This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream Our dream world or coma world it can be argued are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos uncertainty and pain of our dreamsYoure probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right nowIve attached an image of the man in this story and im sure youre all familiar with him  If you are youll understand why ive done this  Why ive made you awareThere is no Ramiel that name is a subliminal plant in itself it means Dreamer in Arabic I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks months and years I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him You know its funny but I found out what Milo meant by Dream its an acronym Dream Rami Evil Always ManifestsThats where I got the idea for RamiHe exists now to help fight off him  Because now youve read this read my experience and Milos youre aware on a subconscious leveland he needs new playmates This is no warning that implies you can do something to change it You cant your dreams are his playground not yours  You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like if that makes you feel better and sleep easier But he doesnt just strike the night you fall asleep he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould He only enters when the reality is in flux  But with Ramiel in your head now too you have a guide a protector to help you  I didnt At least Milo is at peace hopefully I will be soon too Ive been putting off sleep for days I cant keep doing it much longer   Im beginning to feel drowsy I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section I cant put off sleeping forever I dont know whether im going to wake up or not but at least youve all been warned about him Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity please be carefulDream of Ramiel you will be safe I wish you all the best you might not know my name or my face but do not forget my story  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later Do not forget about him Because believe me he wont forget about you when you fall asleepThe worst thing about all this Im not sure he stays in the dream world anymore When Milo looked at me I think I mistook his expression and his gesture At the time I thought he was crying and happy stretching his hand out to shake my hand Now I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop him getting to me

Charliesfriend,48,41,1rhapg,197,A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community so I decided to create an account to share mineWhen I was a little girl about nine years old my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas My father had just gotten out of the Army and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world and spending two of those years in active combat zones my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone He couldnt have found a better location for this purpose anyone whos ever followed Interstate  westward through that area knows there isnt much between Topeka and DenverI still remember the day we my mom dad older sister and I moved into that old ranch house It had been built in the early s and being something of a history buff I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition the depression both world wars and everything since The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road backed literally into a hill This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground buried in the hillside Outside the house was a little grassy yard area and across this yard was an old barn We didnt have any horses but my dad held a particular love for classic cars and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare timeMy sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs while my parents took the master bedroom oddly on the first floor My sister and Is rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen and the stairs led down from thereIt was only our second or third night in the house that I began to notice some strange things occurring I was unable to sleep one night and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed The house was incredibly quiet both from being in the middle of a very isolated area and by virtue of being half buried Just as I was reaching the halfsleep stateSLAM I heard a door downstairs slam shut At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it but I couldnt make myself believe that And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core I heard footsteps coming up the stairway I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes so it probably wasnt my parents coming up to check on me I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs and then begin down the landing I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door pause for a moment and then continue on When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room he paused again and again he continued He reached the far end of the landing and then turned around and came back the way he came He continued for what seemed like an eternity pacing around outside my sister and Is rooms I finally worked up some nineyearold courage and crawled to the door I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside I waited until he was moving away from me and I was between him and the stairs planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned I barely cracked open the door and looked out and sawnothing The footsteps had stopped and the whole house was empty and still I was confused and afraid but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed A minute later the footsteps started again back and forth all along the landing Eventually they lulled me to sleep I didnt mention the noises that night to anyone fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko and of being made fun of by my sister But over the next few weeks everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch Objects moved on their own Small things would disappear for days only to be returned exactly where theyd gone missing from It was what I guess youd call typical poltergeist activity nothing harmful or malevolent just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room My family eventually began referring to this entity as Charlie He seemed to be a harmless ghost and sometimes downright helpful Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen The coffee maker had no automatic timer Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something like car keys or the like wed search the house frantically only to turn around and find what wed been searching for laying on the ground behind us And sometimes Charlie would slam a door or walk around loudly or turn a sink on seemingly just to let us know he was there And always those footsteps at nightCharlie always seemed particularly active in my dads auto shop My dad would occasionally find car parts hed been working on had been tinkered with despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there Sometimes tools would go missing only to be returned a short time later Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet When we asked what was wrong he just said Charlie was walking around out thereJesus I thought you all were just hearing things I wasnt sure why Charlie loved that shop so much but incidentally that was where I caught my first sight of him It was a Saturday and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch and asked me to take it to him I eased open the barn door and saw my dad seated at his work bench his back to me And I saw another man next to the car also out of my dads field of vision He was about  with dark hair and eyes He was dressed in what looked like typical s clothing black slacks a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt and topped off by a brown paper boy hat cocked to one side He looked right at me for a second a big mischievous grin on his face and then he simply disappeared I didnt even realized I was still holding my dads sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to realitySo passed the next few months My family was happy on our little haunted ranch Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us and life was good And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting One night in late November however I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could beMy dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka almost two hours away and since my Sister was almost  by then and there was virtually no crime in our rural area my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning Of course to my sister and I it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted watch scary movies all the kid stuff you cant do with your parents around At around midnight I was in my Sisters room with her watching some movie on her TV when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room My first thought was that it was Charlie playing another prank by this felt different somehow Charlies noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home But this noise sounded violent and angry Before I could really react we heard another loud crash and another My sister cautiously peeked out of her door and down into the living room I swear I saw her go white She began trembling and her hand covered her mouth I peeked around her to see what she saw and felt y blood run cold We could just barely see two men outside our from door One of them was kicking it in As we watched a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out and they both entered our home shining long flashlights all over My sister and I crawled under her bed and held each other tight This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt But as the two men began to go through the living room another loud crash came from the kitchen One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut a favorite trick of Charlies The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted Is there anyone in here If you are you better come out now We will find you and we will FUCK you up My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud At the mans words though Charlie apparently got angry We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room I heard one of the men say Whatthe FUCK And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around All at once every door window and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently and loudly Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls across the floor even at the intruders At this point the one in charge just yelled FUCK this and turned and ran out his buddy close behindAs soon as the men were out of the door everything stopped and the house was again silent It was a long long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move She had left her cell phone downstairs and and she needed it to call the police and our parents She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone I followed As we got to the bottom I looked into the kitchen and for just a moment Charlie was standing there exactly as I saw him before with the same grin on his face A moment later he was goneThe police arrived shortly and my parents not far behind The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables and they must have been scared off by a passing car Lucky for us My sister and I didnt even try to tell them what really happened and within thirty minutes both men were caught still fleeing After that night hearing Charlies walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night When he played his little pranks I would always look for him And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smileSeveral years later when I was a junior in high school I was working on a school report at the local library The topic was the history of our town and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my familys ranch I typed our address on the search bar and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks The date of the old article was July   and at the top was a picture of a man about  with dark hair and eyes It was unmistakably Charlie The title of the article read Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child a daughter after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu On the night of July  the article said Mr Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town When he pulled up to the house he found the door had been forced open He ran inside and found a man on top of his daughter The girl was sobbing her dress had been ripped open and the attacker held a knife to her throat In a moment of sheer instinct Mr Davis threw himself at the intruder tackling him of his daughter and as he held the attacker Mr Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor who promptly called the sheriff When deputies arrived they were able to apprehend the attacker who had been beaten half to death Unfortunately he had stabbed Mr Davis three times in the chest Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor,1385447812.0,Charlie,238,nosleep,top_week
tellmewhatiswrong,49,78,1rn4sa,184,Previous UpdatehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrhbucupdateneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinOPhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsreivzneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinsomeOk Where the fuck do I startThis is the update I really dont want to give I wasnt going to give it But Im pushing  hours with no sleep and its not going to happen anytime soon and I need to get it out before it eats me alive You guys are the only ones who know the entire story And I justfuck I cant believe whats happened I dont even know if I can bring myself to explain but because youve all been so good to me Ill tryI want you all to know that I know this is all my fault If I hadnt been so selfish such a fool I wouldnt be here typing this now My own horror story My own living nightmare Im never going to escape this Ive decided Im not even going to try You should all know this is my last update Probably the last thing that will ever be read by me because my lifes over now Forget Ophelia Im stuck in my own version of Romeo and Juliet Except theres no waking upWhere do I start When she woke up the other day things were a lot worse She was so out of it She looked so thin She got up and sat at our kitchen table I fixed her something to eat and sat across from her She looked tortured And so beautiful Her face was so defined these big beautiful sad eyes her pale skin looked like porcelain as she sat there chewing on her rosy lips She looked at me like she had never met me before in her lifeThe whole Ophelia thing made me realise something was definitely up I asked her about it She just started crying She sat at our table and banged her head over and over and cried For a second she was back And she was scared She said she had dreamed the most vivid dreams all night She couldnt make sense of what she was seeing She said she dreamed of rushing water and wavesof monsters of me of crushing darkness and fluorescent lights She dreamed of tunes shed never heard and faces she had never seen She was exhausted She knew that something wasnt right Nothing was right The tears stained her cheeks as they poured from her eyes She gasped and spluttered and held onto me for dear life soaking my shirtI told her it would all be ok Wed get her help She just had to trust meShe shouldnt have listened Im a god damned fucking liar I meant it at the time with every fibre of my body but I wasnt enough I couldnt protect her I wasnt there when she fucking needed me me her husband the one person on the face of the earth who swore to her that I would be the answer to all her questions the strength in her weakness I stepped outside and I called that fucking shrink And I tore her to shreds with the words that I spoke I told her that she has fucking destroyed my wife and she better start fixing what she had broken She told me to take her to the hospital I dont know what took me so long but I bundled her up and got her in the car and I drove faster than I have ever driven in my life I rushed her into emergency and we got to see a psychiatrist right away What a waste of time that was Because even though she was fragile and seemed to be slipping away there was nothing techincally wrong with her Because she was back She wasnt vacant like she was the day before She was present she was there she knew she needed help But that doesnt make you a crazy person That makes you a sane person A sad sane person yes But she has no history of mental illness She had no thought disorder or suicidal ideation at the time of presenting All the questions they asked to assess her she answered and the psychiatrist said she needed rest He prescribed some sleeping tablets and sent us on our way Ill never forgive him for thatHe told her that he thinks it would be good for her to go to work the next day For us both to go He said once she got back in touch with reality with her normal life then things would begin to improve He said emotionally draining experiences can take time to recover from and we should go back to busying ourselves so the mind has other things to think about rather than stewing on past emotional issuesSo stupidly we got up the next day and got dressed for work She was out of it again She looked like a ghost Like a shell of person a person that was loud and funny A person that was talkative and animated Someone who ate peanut butter out of a jar and sang Ice Ice Baby into my big toe I helped her change her clothes She was talking in a baby voice again whispering to me I said I didnt think she should go but she said it would be better It would all be okI said at the very least she should let me drive her and pick her up When I dropped her off she walked out into oncoming traffic Cars slammed their brakes and honked but she didnt notice I called out to her but she disappeared into her building I called her office and spoke to another PA there Penny I told her that my wife was a bit out of sorts She said she would keep an eye out and it would all be okAnd Penny did keep an eye on her She kept an eye on her and was able to recount to me in horrifying detail the events that unfolded My wife got to her desk and seemed extraordinarily happy She told everyone she had a life changing experience Its hard to believe that the broken person I saw aimlessly step out of my car that morning transformed into a glowing happy woman in a short few steps But thats what Im toldEveryone was glad she was back Everyone had missed her she ran a tight ship and no one knew the work as well as she did so there was a lot waiting for her when she got back She sang a lot and couldnt settle on a task which was their first inkling something was off She was usually nose down at her desk from morning til dusk but not today She paced the halls and wandered the office But people thought that maybe she was still in holiday mode They didnt realise how bad things were Just like I didntI thought of her all dayWhen pm rolled around I was already in her car park waiting for her I called her at  to see where she was but got no response I waited and I waited I was about to go up to see what was going on but then I saw herI saw my beautiful wife Not coming through the lobby doors where my eyes had been trained but standing naked in the frame of an  storey window She wasnt even holding on She was standing there so casually like she was waiting for a bus I got out Time slowed down It was like a nightmare where you open your mouth to scream and nothing comes out I ran I ran and my brain tried to process what I was seeing As I ran I saw her turn and glance back in the building at whoever was on the other side andsmile Then she was falling Then she was gone The sound is something that will haunt every corner of my mind for eternity I justI SheMy wife MY FUCKING WIFE The rest was just a blur I collapsed on the bitumen and everything was dark I woke up and screamed for them to take me to her But they wouldnt They said that I would never recover if I saw what happened to her Its too late for that though I had to see Penny I had to find out what the fuck had happened WHAT THE FUCK GOES ON IN THAT FUCKING CUNT OF A BUILDING Who the fuck let this happen WHY HAS THIS HAPPENEDPenny said that around  oclock she went to go into the CEOs office who was away in Germany She found my wife in there staring out of the window Penny asked if everything was ok My wife turned around singing a nursery rhyme and twirling her hair around her finger Penny went to get her a drink of water and when she came back my wife was standing on the desk undressing and singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Penny grabbed another girl and they tried to her down She got off the desk and hovered near the window They called security who said that they would send an ambulance By this stage my wife started talking about me Repeating over and over again that she was a good wife That she was a very good wife That she was a good daughter That she was daddys little girlAnd thats when everything changedShe started saying increasingly disturbing things They had never heard anything so awful come out of her mouth and they knew then that this was very very seriousAnd then just like that she jumped into the window sill and looked out That must have been when I saw her Her final words were I winAnd like that she was gone,1385641079.0,Final Update Need

Grubbery,28,69,1rkkgk,177,Ill try to keep this as short as possible apologies for the title Im not a creative person Im studying computer forensics Take a hard drive or device and get the information from it While working on a project to see if age of drives affects how much data can be pulled off a disk I came across something I dont know how to approach this Ive been to the cops with it but they just think Im playing gamesI bought  of the old recall Dell systems from around  I had one so I bought them out of nostalgia really they were all going really cheap they looked in perfect condition but none of them booted up I had  HDDs in total to test Not booting up is common in such old units but perfect for me it makes my research cheap I plugged in the first hard drive using the usual forensic protocols write blockers taking notes etc and started trying to get information It was surprisingly easy the fault with the laptop this drive was in was likely on the motherboard It was a pretty clean disk an operating system web browserhistory MSN Office and some text files The folders the text files were all numbered like this   all the way to  Within each folder were three files Beginning Middle and End I was more focused on the percentage of recoverable data so left the files I figured the machine belonged to some author who was weirdly neat with his file systems I put in the next hard drive from another Dell system    Beginning Middle EndI couldnt believe it I stared at my screen dumbfounded I broke out of my temporary trance and checked I wasnt rescanning the same drive Sure enough this was a different drive the first drive was sealed away where I had left it But I didnt get how this was happening they were bought from buyers over  miles apart I checked the tracking history to confirm and theyd been sent within an hour of each other I scanned each drive every Dell drive I had was numbered and constructed the same The files werent deleted they were just there present within the system I checked and each listing for these HDDs said they were just old laptops the sellers wanted rid of I contacted each seller asking them for the story of the laptopThe first one who replied said they had moved into their house and found it in their shed six months after moving in they tried to get it working and it didnt so they just put it up for sale I waited a while for the other replies The second to come through stated they had found it in while insulating their attic The third reply found the laptop in a second hand car he had bought two years ago and just put it up for sale because he saw a couple more on eBay fetching  a few quid as he put it The final response I got contained profanity about me being nosey I never heard from the fifth laptop owner I just wanted to know why they all ended up with me when theyd come from separate locationsI gathered whoever owned these laptops left them to be found Id scanned all the drives at this point for my project prioritising getting that out the way my findings were more important than reading some sick poems Now I had everything stored I could start looking through each diskI had disks I refer to them by their numbered folders for ease             and    So I was missing two assuming  is the last folder whoever owned these made    and     I started reading the files  Beginning Theres nothing here its only the first Im just practicingMiddle Theres nothing here its only the first Im just practicingEnd  Theres nothing here its only the first Im just practicingPracticing what you cryptic prick I asked out loud I decided to skip to  hed be done practicing then He was Beginning The poor girl cant breath Im sure someone should take the bag off her head  I took the bag off her head and now she is happy Itd be a shame if she lost a toeMiddle The poor girl doesnt have any toes and she cant stand Im sure itd be a shame if she lost her arms  Her arms are gone where did she put them Itd be a shame if they were in her foodEnd It took a month but she ate her arms and even her legs what a greedy little tart   Its such a shame she lost her headPoetry I didnt even know I started to check every file and sure enough the same wavelength There were time lapses between each file creation the longest being  months Odd numbers were males even numbers females That was clear I was peering into the thoughts of someone with too much time and imagination Every description of death was different One lost his ears and died to infection Another woman was described to have mysteriously gone bald and have no face I stopped reading them it was just becoming silly at the mention of battery acid I got on with my life and kept them in a cupboard I had better things to do really but the files I always kept readily available in case I ever wanted to read from where I left off I read    before I gave upThen two months later a news story hit me in the face at a million miles an hourPolice revealed that the remains of Missing I will call her Joy youll see why were found just outside of OMITTED Thursday evening the police are investigating what appears to be a clear case of murder The remains of Joy were found badly mutilated with large portions of her skeleton not present at the site and the body was significantly decomposed she has been missing since March  age  It looks as if the body has been moved from a previous site and dumped A note was found on her body in a sealed bag presumably with what looks like three poems describing how she diedMy mind thought about those HDDs  fit the timeline they were all bought prior to her going missing Three poems discussing how she died No details of the mutilation were on any article I found so I went in blind During my project I was working on how much data could be found not WHAT data Id used automated scans to see if everything was there and hadnt manually done it  I had left most of it alone I began browsing web histories I came across searches for hardware shops and found various fake Myspace and MSN accounts I started to get a geographical picture of where each laptop had been used some were used on the same day with time lapses whoever was using these laptops was doing so on an almost simultaneous level I found Joy Number  created March  the only female in that chain which was mutilated according to the poems The laptop was less than two years old at the time th person The data on the laptop showed it was in the area Joys body was found This little girl so small and coy if she were mine Id call her Joy Ill make her mine and then shell see Joys the one Im happy to be I love being Joy it feels so fun Im sheltered inside her from the sun My skin is covered and she is not she smells as if shes begun to rot Joy left her I dont know when shes stopped gurgling again I want skin I want elbows I want knees Ill take her skeleton as I pleaseWhat do I do rnosleep I think Ive found hard drives pertaining to dozens of deaths  are out there still that I know of going on how the files are named no one is taking me seriously with this edit Trying to fix my formatting ,1385560397.0,Joy

apparently I explained to her that Id had that same breakfast since I was a kid It reminded me of home and I didnt plan on changing the habit anytime soon We got to talking some more of course I found out that she was a performance art student at the university She worked parttime at a local dog shelter She had a sense of humour enjoyed the outdoors and her hobbies included bodypainting and magic She was cute Real cuteI thought Id leave the body painting for a more opportune moment so instead I asked her about her interest in magic She smiled fiddled with her hair and told me about how her father had been a professional magician and how that had led to her interest in magic and performance art She picked at the last of her breakfast looked at her watch and told me that she had to go Just before she left she told me that she would show me a magic trick sometime that might put me off eggs altogether Does it actually involve eggs I asked herOf course it does She replied She grabbed her bag said goodbye and left the café giving me a little wave through the window as she crossed the street outside I sat and watched with a smile on my face I waved back just as she disappeared behind a garbage truck pulling up outside doing its morning roundsAfter that she sat with me every morning Our conversations almost always ended in the same way I would always ask her when she would show me her eggtrick One morning I even brought a box of eggs with me so she had no excuseI need something else though She saidWhat I askedWell to do the trick I need some eggs some gloves and a dog she replied slightly blushing I told her that I really had to see the trick now but before we could talk about it any further she grabbed my phone from the tableLook Im going to put my number in your phone and I want you to ring me later around  oclock I have to go to a party and I dont really know anyone there so Id like you to come with me Is that ok with youI certainly had no problem with that It was unexpected but I jumped at the opportunity I rang her later that evening and arranged to meet upI met her at a converted loft on the other side of town She held my hand as we walked into a crowded room full of performanceart exhibitions artistic types and generally trendy people We looked around for a while helping ourselves to the cheap Champagne It didnt take long before I noticed that Olivia looked every bit as uncomfortable and outofplace as I didI dont even know what Im doing here She laughed God I think I made a big mistake in my career choice I think I need to get out of hereWe ended up getting a cab to bar had a few drinks and ended up in my place She stayed the night I woke up the next morning at about six oclock but Olivia had gone All that was left was a small note on the bedside locker which read XXXIm not going to pretend that my heart didnt sink a little I took it as an emphatic Goodbye it was nice while it lasted Life must go on I thought to myself as I got out of bed and wandered into the bathroom giving myself the usual pep talk Theres plenty more fish in the seaIt wasnt long before I found myself sitting in the café again staring at my eggs on toast Alone I didnt really have any appetite I thought about taking the day off work and just going homeThen I saw her running down the street towards the café a smile beaming across her face and waving like a maniac at me She was wearing a ringmasters outfit complete with tophat and tailcoat and running alongside her on a leash were two small golden retriever puppies In her other hand she held out a box of eggs If anyone else saw her running down the street that morning she must have looked like a complete weirdo but I dont think I ever saw such a pleasant sightShe burst in the door giggling to herself powering through her own embarrassment and selfconsciousnessAnd now for one morning only I will perform for you my greatest trick How to get eggs  from dogs she said as she took a bowI gave her a quick round of applause She turned and picked up the two puppies and placed them on the table in front of me She then turned to pick up the eggsThats when Olivia lost her footing on the wet tiled floor She slipped violently forward then back colliding with the tables edge and then hitting the floor Her head landed with a force that cracked one of the tiles and blood poured from a wound on the back of her head She was out coldEverything else happened very quickly All I remember is being on the floor trying to talk to her screaming at the owner to call an ambulance Then she opened her eyes For a brief moment she gazed into mine as though everything was ok A single tear ran down her cheek then suddenly her demeanour changed A look of horror ran over her faceShe let out the most bloodcurdling scream I have ever heard and tossed me aside as though I wasnt even thereWhat are they She screamed as she swatted the air in front of her Get them away from meI tried to calm her down but she was like someone possessed She ran through the shop screaming and overturning tables finally running out the door She went to cross the street It was like she never even saw the garbage truck coming She was killed instantlyI could not believe what I had just seenIn the weeks that followed I met her parents on several occasions I had to give several statements to the police and the coroner so it was unavoidable They were distraught Utterly inconsolableI remember getting that letter from her mother in the post one morning explaining what the coroners findings were The official cause of death was deemed via motor vehicle collisionThe contributing factors went some way to further elaborate on what I had seen that morning in the café An autopsy revealed that Olivia had been suffering from asymptomatic Ocular larva migrans Undoubtedly they said this was as a result of prolonged contact young dogs at the shelter she worked at who were carriers of the eggs of Toxocara canis The worms had gone unnoticed in the back of her eyes trapped in a granulomatous mass That is until she hit her head on the floor and ruptured the tissue When she opened her eyes that morning it took only a moment before they floated into her field of viewTheir wriggling and wandering must have caused hysteria disorientation and terror they noted which led to her irrational behaviour and unfortunate loss of spatial awareness,1385599456.0,How to get eggs  from dogs,145,nosleep,top_week
slightlyspooked,49,26,1re11f,100,NoSleep I need your help Where do I begin I started working volunteer shifts at my local community centre about  months ago I love my job I get on well with all my coworkers but somethings been bothering me recently More than bothering me actually Theres been an attack on a child Well  I cant call it an attack exactly Everyones calling it an accident but I cant believe that Let me start over This whole thing began when the centre began to hold saturday clubs  an hour or two every weekend when kids are given pretty much free reign over the place We put on activities  cake baking crafts that kind of thing  and just generally keep an eye on the placeWere also there to keep the kids out of the basement Id like to say before I start that Ive never heard of anything being up with the basement before Im not a particularly superstitious person or at least I wasnt before all of this happened and I dont scare easy Basically the kids have to stay out of the basement because theres a lot of junk down there that could topple over onto one of them or otherwise get them in trouble Just to reiterate this is the only reason I was ever given for keeping them out of the basementBut kids arent satisfied by a simple its dangerous down there They wanted to know why Well I spun them this cock and bull story about how Id seen a monster down there once The other volunteer that day Julie joined in on the fun immediately and soon we had them all believing that there was something dark and horrible in the basement that would snatch them up and eat them if they ever went down there Were talking about  year olds here so the stories werent particularly gory or scary  but they believed us pretty much right off the bat Maybe thats why things went so weird Im sure those of you whove been around children know that they see the world in a different way to the rest of us  what seems to us like childish fantasy might as well be real life to them Anyway I told them that story three or four weeks before the incident Every Saturday wed have these kids in and every Saturday the veteran members of the group would take on the duty of informing the new members of what horrific fate awaited them should they wander into the basement With each telling theyd add details Some of them were actually very grim  they came up with one about a Victorian boy  bearing in mind that the community centre was only built in  that had been eaten by the monster and still roamed the halls crying out to go home The details got more and more gory  they came up with the idea that the monster would mark its victims with three slashes of its horrendous glistening claws  this was the same week we were showing the Zorro movies on the old projector In short it was beginning to seem as though Saturday Club had turned into NoSleep Junior We had complaints from parents about their children being too scared to come in and so my boss decided it was time to put a stop to the monster talk We tried everything we could to get the kids to stop talking about it  we played nonmonstery games with them we made apple pie we even passed the caretaker off as a professional monster hunter That kept them quiet for a while and we began to hope that theyd lost interest altogether In the meantime though I began to feel more and more uneasy locking up the centre at night I had no reason to be afraid  Julie or one of my other coworkers was usually waiting at the front desk for me in case there was trouble and the Zumba fitness group usually hung around outside until we locked up anyway In short nobody could get in without one of us noticing I mention that because the night before the attack I could have sworn I heard someone   a small someone  crying all through my lockup It always seemed like the voice was coming from the next corner but when I looked there was nobody there I even got Julie out to have a look  she said she couldnt hear anything but I could tell she was concerned Maybe she just wanted to get home early I dont know I told the police I hadnt seen anyone for definite anyway I wasnt working the next day but thats when the attack happened I dont know much about the details  the police told me that Julie heard crying and screaming from the basement and went down to find two of our regulars Tommy and Rosie spattered with blood and crying When she rounded the corner she discovered a third child  I wasnt told his name he was new  lying unconscious beneath a shelf She confided to me later that while shed told police the shelf must have toppled onto him it looked more like hed been hiding beneath it What sent me to you guys though is the other thing Julie told me Her first instinct being a mother herself was to pull the child out from under the shelf and make sure he was okay He didnt have any of the injuries shed expect in this kind of accident  no broken bones not even a bruise Instead he had three bloody lines carved into his chest Three large horrible claw marks When the police asked the other two children what theyd witnessed theyd only say The monster got him The Centre is closed until further notice  I think they think theres some sort of psychopath living there Thats the logical explanation but somehow I cant help questioning it When I pass by the closed Centre I swear I can hear a child crying inside  crying to go home The boy is okay by the way  apparently hes recovering at home but he wont name his attacker Hell only say that something got him I take a little comfort knowing that hes alright but how long will it be before something else happens Something worse Im afraid NoSleep  what have I done,1385345220.0,Ive Created a Monster,126,nosleep,top_week

gavinfaris,44,25,1rplro,85,Ok this is the ideal place to post this Ive asked my friends and some family if theyve experienced this but they have no idea what Im talking about When I was a child maybe around  I used to have theseincidents Id be about to fall asleep and all of a sudden Id feel disoriented Its probably a sleep paralysis thing or something but I remember looking around and I could move and everything even sat up a few times but everything around me seemed to lookweird Id feel as If I was in a big room that was expanding and the tv would start to shrink along with other things Id feel justreally really small I could FEEL the space around me increasingThen there was what happened afterI could almost always predict it would happen becuase the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up There would be these whispers Just these soft whispers I couldnt hear any words It sounded like maybe  people whispering at once Always at once The whispers would get louder and louder until they were voices Always talking at the same time No gaps Id get really scared and cry out Most of the time my mother would come upstairs she usually was downstairs relaxing after I went to bed and once she entered the room the voices would fade away likeREALLY fast Almost stopped instantly you know This happened for a while I remember Maybe a good couple of years Almost every night Sometimes Id be too scared to call out for my mother and sunk myself deeper in my covers pushing my little hands as hard as i could over my ears but of course this didnt do anything After a long while it would just fade away veeeeery slowly I hated it By the time it faded I was always sweaty and terrified and slept completely under the covers head and allAt some point I realised that if the light turned on  the voices would stop I cant remember how I came to this conclusion as it was many years ago like  years I remember a time when I screamed for my mother to turn on the light and she turned it on Instant reliefBut there was just one time that really sticks with me I remember the voices starting up and pressing my hands against my ears I called out for my mother but she didnt come I waited The voices grew louder I remember thinking it sounded like the amount of people in a football stadium Like a HUGE crowd The voices picked up and soon they were shouting Shouting so loud I was crying Like wailing cheeks soaked with tears snot and all I knew there was only one thing to do I had to switch on the light myselfThis meant however that I had to take off the covers and walk exposed to the light switch at the end of the room Im sure you can imagine how terrifying taking off the covers is as a child when youre scared I sort of shimmied to the end of the bed with the covers then slid out of them slowly still sobbing before crawling on the floor my best attempt to be as least exposed as possible I reached the light switch and I had to stand up I hated it I hated it so much The voices were screaming in my ears now I couldnt hear anything else My body was literally shaking from the fear as I stood up feeling my body weigh a ton and switched on the light The voices almost instantly turned into a distant echo Still shouting and screaming but like an echo now I collapsed on the floor crying softly and heard my mother come up She found me there a total wreck I think that was the worst time Slowly the voices grew less intense and there were whole weeks without incident until eventually they just stopped I cant remember when but I cant seem to find anyone who has experienced this beforeIf this sounds familiar let me know,1385735948.0,Has anyone experienced this as a child,110,nosleep,top_week
TheGroovyTurte,12,25,1raatv,73,So Im not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told if only for my own piece of mind  Im an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously underserved community  The hospital itself is old its been standing since the late s it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium Ive never really encountered anything supernatural but I havent written off the existence of such phenomena  That being said a shadow in the night isnt enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the nightSo when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well  Id have my admissions Id take care of the current patients without issue  Then one night I got an admission Ill call this patient Jerry  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility  He has a whole boat load of medical issues kidney problems diabetes high blood pressure  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia Before meeting Jerry I was told hes actually a really fun guy hes always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen I was a little anxious  The admission was done the orders were placed and I didnt think more of it  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night  It was around  in the morning when I went back to see Jerry  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up  When I went in there Jerry wasnt in his bed  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying not crying but rather whimpering as if he didnt have the stamina to make it a full cry  I tried putting on a brave face and said Jerry whats going on For an old guy Jerry was quicker than I thought and stronger than I would have believed  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him  They wont leave me alone they wont let me sleep they wont let me eat  He continued on in this line of things the phantom they wouldnt let him do  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this I still needed the blood and this wasnt the first time Id dealt with a confused older patient  I helped Jerry back to his bed  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient it was something familiar  I tied the tourniquet in place then I cleaned his arm found my vein and went for it  Im not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing I was filling up my vial it was about half way full when Jerry started screaming LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONE He began to jerk violently somehow the needle stayed in place but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerrys body was pulling it back  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm but the needle didnt budge  In shock I pulled harder my efforts still could not budge the needle  In response I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being  full to maybe being about  full  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerrys arm leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me Can you see them  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room  I walked back to the nursing station one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep  I made my way to the oncall room which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerrys eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing and a senile sick old man  The only trouble is since then the shadows Ive seen in dark rooms seem darker the lights unable to pierce them  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings  Im not really sure what to make of it  In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker the tapping louder and now I cant shake a feeling that Im being watched

moduspwns,10,18,1rjvbc,65,His mother was so pale Her eyes were blank except for a trace of what I took to be urgency I know better now She gestured toward the crib as though it were an afterthought He should stay asleep while were gone He sleeps right through the night most nights I offer mothers varying degrees of assurance when they leave their children in my keeping for the first time Its something to intuit A mothers face will tell you how much assurance she needs It seemed to me at the time that whatever pressing matter she would be tending had overshadowed her reservations about me whom she had just met And a man Of course just to be a man calls for suspicion But then she did show some concern  or what I took for concern I know better now  for her eldest Sam a boy of three who had yet to speak It was nothing unusual she said The doctors say some children just speak when theyre ready Before she left she looked tentatively at him almost apologetically She hesitated a moment as she clutched the door handle as though shed forgotten some instruction Its best he remains in the crib unless theres an emergency Hes likely to get fussy if he realizes Im gone She shut and locked the door in one fluid motionSam would not look at me I understood he might take some time warming up to me but he showed almost no emotion at all I asked him silly questions for a time and gave up in the absence of any acknowledgement I didnt blame him His mother was peculiar to say the least and something about this house was oppressive I had the strangest inclination to bolt straight out the door and never look back to leave Sam and the baby They would surely make it on their own for the evening What could happen to them really locked safely in their home She did say the baby sleeps through the night and it didnt seem that Sam would so much as take note of my absence I managed to fend off such absurdities just well enough and just long enough to remain at my post It wasnt long before I heard the baby stirring and I felt in me some irresistible grim inclination to see him Id begun to wonder whether he was inflicted with some bizarre malady the way his mother and son behaved I sneaked quietly into his room which was just down the hall from the living area His door was wide open yet the light of the hall was dim and strained to reach the crib at the far corner of the room I made my way to the crib easily enough but it was terrible standing there waiting for my eyes to adjust Panic gripped me in the darkness as though I was in immediate danger and yet I did not fear for the baby or for his elder brother in the living area I feared for myself more deeply than I believed possible and for the first time not merely for my life My life was a trifle Id have gladly disposed in half a moment to escape that roomI looked down at him and labored in vain to convince myself that what I felt then was relief It was only a baby My façade was quickly overcome for it was immediately evident that something was very wrong with this child It was oddly sexless and not merely in the manner common to most infants Its skin looked a pale grey  an effect of the light I hoped Its plump features were wellproportioned and smooth everything one might find endearing in a baby and yet none of it was right There was something unnatural drawn in every feature of this child in his crib in the dark His face was a perfect mockery of innocence but only that And that was not the whole of it Though his eyes were closed and his chest rose and fell steadily I knew he was aware of my presence at his side He perceived me with a dark malice even as he slept I imagined reaching out in affection to caress him as one might an ordinary baby and let out a wretch His eyes opened but not both at once There was an almost imperceptible delay between the opening of each and with his eyes open his features took life His skull was oddly lumpy his skin perfectly smooth How could I have missed those tumorous lumps mere moments ago He reached a hand with uncanny deliberation and began massaging his face in a most grotesque fashion His skin yielded to his grip like dough and to such an extent that I could peer into his eye sockets The whites of his eyes were webbed with red which matched his bloodred gums He was all pale grey and red with none of the vivacious pink of a child It looked as though he was haphazardly resculpting his own faceI noticed then that there was something more to his breathing My mind must have prevented my hearing the truth in the first place for the sheer impossibility of it but in light of the absurdity before me then I was able to discern words My face it breathed My face my mark then My face my milk and after some seconds My markmy facemy faceIt noticed me then It froze flesh firmly in its grip It trained an eye on me It was at first a look of mild curiosity an appraising look But soon malice crept in and the force of it struck me backward I wanted to swoon in revulsion or to run from the room I wanted to scream but its will  its choicest weapon  held me firm I heard a noise behind me and somehow managed to tear my eyes from the crib It was Sam at the open door tentatively standing outside It was obvious to me then that he knew and refused to enter His mouth was moving His eyes were wide with fear but he seemed determined to articulate I walked to the door as though wading through thick mud I could not turn to the crib could not face it but nor could I bear the thought of it at my rear I stepped out of the room and in the light of the hallway found the courage to face the room The crib remained as it was in the shadows I could not see inside I bent to one knee and grabbed Sam by the shoulders What is it Sam I asked and shortly repeated What is it There is only one baby he started but despair took him A groan escaped him a groan in which I could hear pure inarticulate dread more dread than his three years could possibly have contained I shook him gently and he sobbed back a quick sharp breath There is only one baby in hell he choked I heard a stirring in the crib And then the breathing No words this time There was something unsteady in it something that suggested laughter It was a humorless pitchless laugh that we felt more than heard I looked to Sam and for the briefest moment the fear fled from his eyes In its place it left the deepest disgust the most profound loathing I had yet witnessed The expression vanished so quickly I wondered whether it had been a trick of the low light and terror resumed After some minutes I summoned the strength to take his arm and usher him to the living areaHere we sit in an age which never ends Both of us this room the house and everything in it are fears subject He is our eternal tyrant The truth must be that at some point I died and some power was there ever any power but fear  saw fit to condemn my soul to the bottom circle of hell Hellwhich has only one baby When I first arrived odd though it seems Sams presence provided some relief Yet I have come to realize he is just another tool of my tormentor Sam serves always and only as a reminder to meSam reminds me that I am helpless to save myself or anyone that I have no more strength than a child He reminds me that my terror is not for him I would cast him into the very crib itself if it meant I could feel a beam of true light from the window The window Every long while and the gaps grow longer still I find my eyes drift to the door expecting its mother to return Then the window expecting the red sun to peak over the horizon Sam reminds me of the truth Fear has no mother There is nothing outside The night never ends,1385528075.0,There is only one baby in

TheGraveSin,10,18,1rdci1,63,So I grew up on a farm cows chickens horses you name it I usually got stuck feeding and watering the animals while my brothers ran the tractors and threw the hay bales Dragging the waterhose to each and every animals water pan was a pain and sometimes Id catch my younger brother sneaking at the other end of the pasture watering some of the animals I hadnt gotten to yet and it would always make me smile to myself Sometime in the summer our ducks started dying off Id find them smooshed and assumed it was an incident from them trying to breed one another and split some of them up in different pens and thought nothing more of it   Then three days later I found a calf with its body oddly angled and no sure sign of what caused it to die Nothing else happened for about a month or two Then I found the horse laid out freshly dead with sweat beaded all over it as if it had been running all night it was a young and healthy horse one of my favorite and my heart shattered to pieces I was reluctant to go back the next day forcing myself to look at my sweet animals and focus on them instead but they were acting oddly the pigs in particular who were hiding in their makeshift huts and houses not even coming when I did my usual call or dumped out the food I got worried and walked in the pen getting on hands and knees to look inside their little houses as soon as I saw their snouts with a squeal one of them ran into me biting at my arm and face I toppled backward kicking it away and dashed over the top of the pen hurt feelings because they were almost always happy to see me I didnt tell anyone just let it go assuming that at losing so many of my precious pets I was wigging myself out   The next time I went out at this point it was around winter because of the cold I asked my mom to help me with the animals As we were dragging the hose to the dairy cows she stops suddenly and asks whos that I look over seeing the usual figure of my brother and just say oh its just Derek Momma She shakes her head No Dereks at Pauls A weird feeling crawled down my spine as I glanced over my shoulder at the young male figure Dropping the waterhose I stepped in his direction I could clearly see his dirtsmeared jeans and the back of his hair had the same blond curl of my brothers Derek I yelled running over to him and reaching a hand out to put on his shoulder He turned his head in my direction his bright red eyes meeting mine as my hand fell through air I passed out then My mom says that by the time she reached me the figure was gone After later discussion my brother swore on his life that he had never once been in the pasture with me ,1385327030.0,On the Farm,81,nosleep,top_week
MrAlfredo,7,22,1rnx3s,58,I got home late last night from work and noticed that I had a new friend request on Steam I accepted and the person began messaging me claiming to be my brothers fiancée and she urging me to buy the new Thanksgiving DLC for Borderlands  before the three dollar price shot up in an hour so that we could play it together This was already a red flag to me because just the other day I was talking to my brother and his fiancée about Steam and she asked Whats Steam but never mind that It got stranger still when she refused to download Mumble my preferred VoIP software so we could play together more easily insisting that she had a friend who used a different program called DXE Ultimate which sounded ridiculous but was supposedly some other VoIP and her friend didnt want to download Mumble either So I figured what the hell Ive already got Mumble Ventrilo and TeamSpeak simultaneously installed whats another VoIP I went to the site she linked to download this thing and first off the site was riddled with ads and popups for all kinds of unsavory things Red flag number two The onsite description of the software didnt sound like a VoIP or chat program at all in fact it was pretty clear about how bad it was going to fuck up my computer and the download button said Please let me in which DEFINITELY left me unsettled Red flag number three So I turned my sights back to my brothers fiancée in the message box I began by asking flat out who is this really The response was pretty obvious the person restated that they were my brothers fiancée I followed up by asking questions that pertained to interactions wed had in the past mustache humor Borderlands  as well as prior conversations I asked about her friend too because that kept sticking out to me Who was this OTHER person she was playing games with The person on the other end was nailing the personal questions and skillfully dodging the questions about their friend but the answers seemed somehow robotic too methodical practiced or perhaps extracted from the real source I continued grilling the person in question until I had exhausted the possibilities and told them Id download it in the morning and went to sleepI wouldve posted this story sooner but I had to go to work this morning yep on Thanksgiving Fortunately Ill be getting to see my brother and his fiancée today Im planning on asking her about the exchange because it was extremely odd Ill update this post with more information when I can break away from the Thanksgiving festivitiesEDIT Okay so the story gets a little bit weirder she was at Thanksgiving which is good because now I know the mystery person didnt have her tied up or something But when I asked her about the messages she got oddly defensive citing that she hadnt heard of Steam before the other day when we talked about it She almost seemed offended like I was accusing her of something She continued wigging out until I mentioned the malware by name I saw the change immediately her eyes went wide and her jaw dropped Apparently someone had messaged her through Skype claiming to be me and was trying to get her to download the same software She had also been suspicious of the event but was being more tentative about asking me about it Apparently she had gone through similar steps that I had and was greeted by the same cold calculated types of responses I asked her what time that happened thinking the person used information they gathered from both conversations to answer each others questions She said it happened at pm last night Now it was my turn to go wideeyed and drop my jaw I informed her that I was at work from pm to pm with no available internet Whoever it was who did this knows me and used that knowledge to fake being me to her and get information from her to use talking to me Ill update again if I receive anymore messages from this person,1385668084.0,My Brothers Fiancée,80,nosleep,top_week
childrenofsamhain,23,9,1rhdoj,57,My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child Until recently he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters Sarah and Emily Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three Within the first two years living in the house Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary It wasnt until his daughter Sarah was around two years old that he started to notice she talked to herself Jamie thought nothing of it she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway whispering and giggling Curious he asked Sweetie who are you talking to Sarah replied The woman standing in the hallwayIs she your imaginary friendI guess Amused he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall whispering quietly Whats your friends name he asked her Her name is Helen Mary she said And what are you two whispering about Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped Im not supposed to tell you Suddenly the front door opened downstairs and they heard Claire come through the door Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her Jaime didnt think about that again for a few weeks Over time the two noticed that Sarahs interactions with Helen Mary became more frequent but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily Jaime was at home alone with Sarah He heard her playing upstairs chatting away with her imaginary friend when suddenly he heard glass breaking He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway holding a hammer She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces There was glass everywhere Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits When he returned to the living room he asked her directly Sweetie why would you smash all of our family pictures She looked at him Helen Mary told me to do itWhen Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends Jaime told her about the incident The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes She gasped silently at the sight When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior Suddenly the color ran out of Claires face and she looked at Jaime Theres no way she could have done that aloneWhatThere is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herselfJaime was confused I told you I caught her with the hammer She told me that she did itBut it wasnt until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him But some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground How could she have reached thoseHis mind was racing She must have moved a chair or somethingShe was adamant There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it and you would have seen her carry one upstairs rightJaime was silent He didnt have an answer They went to bed that night without any answers The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking Though he didnt have much time to think about it as two weeks later his second little girl was bornEmily was two years old in the summer of  and one afternoon when Claire was at home alone with the girls she heard Emily alone upstairs whispering She called up to her Who you talking to kiddoThe woman standing in the hallwayClaire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister Then she spoke againShe doesnt like you MommyWhy doesnt she like me Claire responded surprised I dont know Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent Until one night last monthJaime had put the kids to sleep around eight oclock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after Exhausted Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him He turned to see what was wrong and saw it His  year old daughter Emily standing beside the bed with a hammer in her hand Blood poured from Claires forehead Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand He turned to his wife She had stopped screaming now and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face She was going to be alright but she did have a deep cut to her forehead Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room He went and checked on Sarah who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed He told her that everything was alright and closed her door He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway and he finally asked her Emily why would you hurt MommyShe told me to DaddyWho told you to The woman standing right behind you She told me to hurt Mommy And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered And she told me to hurt you too DaddyThey moved last week ,1385451179.0,The Woman Standing in the Hallway,66,nosleep,top_week
Zapator,8,20,1rjnd6,52,Its funny how love can work You cant control how things might turn out Love can be an unexpected thing at an inconvenient time or in a strange place Oddly enough I met Jodie in a funeral homeI was there because the deceased was the sister of my best friend Finn Finn was extremely shaken up by the loss so I went to comfort him She had died under horrible circumstances It was a shock to everybody However thats a story for a different day I was searching for a mop because some little kid had peed everywhere I had found an unlocked room near the back so I decided to look in there for the mop I walked in but it was too dark to see anything I fumbled around for the light switch and thats when I saw herI knew it was love at first sight She looked pale and sick and she was taking a nap She had the most beautiful long red hair I had ever seen Her face was that of an angel I didnt want to wake her up so I was sure to be very quiet I decided to go back there later and talk to her I didnt find the mop though so I returned to the mass emptyhanded  After an hour or so had passed people had already started filing out of the building to go to the graveyard I couldnt attend the burial so I told Finn to take it easy and I stuck around until everyone left After they did I managed to slip into the back room to see if my queen was still sleeping But much to my disappointment I discovered she had gone missingI knew that I shouldnt be too worried though I had learned enough about her from the other people at the funeral to know where I could find her the next day I also learned that her name was Jodie I waited until the next morning to go find her I found her at the graveyard She was by Finns sisters grave She seemed to be stricken with grief because she lacked emotion entirely However I convinced her to come home with meShe looked exhausted so I put her in the bed in my guest bedroom After about  hours I got a call from Finn He told me that someone had dug up his sister and he asked if I knew anythingI guess I did leave a mess,1385521544.0,Jodie,72,nosleep,top_week

WontThinkStraight,17,15,1rcy69,50,I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad and to check on how Emilys family were doing since their tragedyhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentspclnotes In some welcome news they are now expecting a new child to join their familyBrad had another story for me though one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights Ive captured it below to help get it off my mindIn a universe filled with choices but with only one life in which to make them regrets become inevitable Regrets for things done or left undone for words said or left unsaidAt that moment when our life is fading and we see it all over again how would we feel about those decisions weve made  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching How we treated those we loved and those close to usBrad was not the only child in his family He also had a younger brother Paul They could not have been more opposites to each otherWhere Brad was brash and wild in his youth Paul was introverted and contemplative And like many siblings their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other Looking back Brad admits that he was an arrogant possessive and obnoxious brat Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brotherBut it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all As an only child Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him That changed when his brother Paul was born three years laterAt first Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with He imagined they would play together and be best friends That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried smelled bad and demanded constant attention The second year wasnt much better with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brads toys and presentsIt became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul He found they had nothing in commonWhere Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others Paul just babbled and talked with himself Brad loved being outside and active Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon setWhat unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw There would be the usual things every child draws  houses animals trees and family What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra personTheir parents would be there and Brad and Paul all drawn in rainbow hues Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and redThe family faces all had big smiles but the stranger was a disfigured mess two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth In every drawing of the stranger he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all overOver time this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them  just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house or outside in the yardAt first their parents thought it was just a phase but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was He told them it was his friend the burned man He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember He never said anything  he just stood there watching and listeningThey concluded it was just an imaginary friend Granted it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend but at least Paul wasnt drawing some reallife predatorOne night when Brad was  and Paul was  they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt ManPaul said that he had been in an accident a fire that had burnt his entire body and face It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing He was very sadPaul didnt find the Burnt Man scary though He had always been around and never did anything Just watched and listenedBrad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friendPaul yawned and simply replied that he wasnt imaginary He was in the room with them right now In fact he was standing right next to Brad watching and listening as he did every nightBrad felt a chill go up his spine He had always been a brave child but for the first time in his life he felt fear He looked around in the darkness not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleepBrad didnt go to sleep that night and concluded that he needed a room of his ownHe could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend But he couldnt admit that he was afraid either so his  year old mind came up with an ideaHis plan was simple  to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms So began their adversarial relationshipThey fought over everything for many years and often physically Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation all to the chagrin of their parents It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time replaced with pure animosity for each other But on the first night in their new home Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed watching him It stared at him through hollow eye sockets and moaned at him through an open jaw It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missingBrad screamed so loud it woke the house and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about Brad told him he saw the Burnt ManPaul laughed and said he hadnt seen him in years In fact he could hardly even remember him In any case he couldnt see him in the room now Paul closed the door as he left then reopened it quickly and shouting Boo before laughing again and walking back to his roomFor Brad the memory of it seemed very real though It wasnt just the terror but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounterAnother incident was when Paul was  and involved in a hitandrun accident He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and the doctors werent sure if he would survive Paul was lying in bed with a coma with his parents crying around himBrad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls It was the Burnt Man watching Paul intentlyJust go already Why are you still here Youre not wanted Just leave us Brad remembered shouting at the figure He got a severe reprimanding from his parents thinking that he was shouting at his brotherPaul is dying Brad Its time to put your stupid feud behind Were family for gods sake Act like it his father had rebuked while his mother criedThe words stung Brad especially since he couldnt explain that he wasnt shouting at Paul He quietly fumed then stormed outPaul did recover two days later though and was out of the hospital a week laterThat last incident was  years ago The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then Paul married had two children of his own and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT They had developed a grudging respect for each other though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the yearsThe Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory filed away and never thought of again until recently Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focusA few months ago Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fireA chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location dousing him in burning chemicals The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbowPaul was In a life of many regrets Brad now has one more for the list He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him and that despite their differences he loved him as a brotherHe regrets that his last words to Paul werent goodbye but a text message which read You suck Ive shat better excuses than that It was said in jest about why Paul didnt have time over the weekend for a beer but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each otherSo every now and then Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother the Burnt Man is still around to hear Now much older and wiser he no longer fears the Burnt Man  but fears that the only one listening might just be himselfOne that can only observe in silence powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him judging him with regret for the decisions hes made and is yet to makeLinks back to the earlier stories in order A Curious Mind is a Terrible

iampatheo,11,15,1rcqug,46,  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes I live with my parents and my grandfather who is my fathers uncle actually so basically not my grandfather      I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind maybe because as a child I didnt look into it enough but I never forgot But with the most recent event I cant help but ask you guys for advice     The first event occurred when I was around  I guess I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather Mom was helping me put my tie on  we had a school uniform  and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water Now the kitchen is right next to my grandfathers room and its on the other side of our house As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about So I just put it at the back of my mindThe next incident happened a year back or so It was after  pm and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading I like doing that getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one elses It freaked me out a little But even then I didnt put it together with the incident from all those years back     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen On the way I noticed my mom dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV As I walked past my grandfathers room I saw him Sitting on a chair by the window The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything I did a double take I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window He was looking at me but for some reason I couldnt see his eyes Not because they werent there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it upI really need to know what this is Is this a doppelganger And if so what should I do Is this thing going to be harmful It hasnt done anything harmful so far ,1385309994.0,DOPPELGANGER Problem,61,nosleep,top_week

JustAnotherLondoner,9,12,1riwe6,41,I was twenty six years old when I had finally saved up enough money to move out of my apartment My fiancé James and I bought a house in the British countryside We were both cityborn people so we wanted somewhere in the peace and quiet That was our first mistake The nearest town was  minutes away  if youre walking and willing to push your way through fields of wheat There was only one house within that distance it was around a  minute walk from ours on the other side of the field backing onto our back garden We were told that the house had been vacant for years so as far as we were concerned there were no other humans around We were in our own little bubble and we were loving every minute of it Due to part of my family being Irish I was used to a bit of silence Every year I would visit and every year I would sit at the window of my guest room stare at the cows in the field outside and just take in the silence It wasnt something you heard a lot of in London James had never experienced that growing up he had spent his whole life up until now in London Though he initially liked the idea of a bit of silence I think he found it a bit unsettling It was a bit too quiet for him Whenever there was a bang or a whistle of the wind outside hed jump and wonder what it was I would reassure him that it was nothing but he was always a little tense About a month into our new home James and I were watching TV in our room before we went to bed It was around pm Jaaames fancy closing the curtain while youre up I plead as James got up to go to the toilet He sighed and walked over to the window to close the curtain He paused and stared outsideKate He began Has anyone moved into that house I havent seen any moving vans so I dont think so Is there a car there I replied He shook his head Why I asked confused by his sudden fascination in the house Because the light is on Someone must be in there He said giving me a confused and concerned look I reassured him that its probably nothing that someone obviously must own it but might not live there all the time It was probably a holiday home or something similarOdd place for a holiday home James responded in a tone which suggested he did not believe my reassuring explanation this time He kept his eyes on the house for a minute longer and then finally closed the curtain Maybe we should go over there tomorrow and see who they are Introduce ourselves as the friendly neighbours we are I suggested James thought about it for a moment and then agreed That was our second mistake The next day after James and I returned from work we went over to the neighbours house It was getting on  oclock and so it was getting dark out I suggested we take the car but James said we should just walk as its only  minutes away I didnt mind too much it was only  minutes after all I took some cookies with me to gift the neighbours with in order to make friends On approach to the house we noticed a few odd things First the scarecrow in the field separating our two homes was dressed in a suit The suit was torn and had what appeared to be blood on it We also noticed that there was a face on the scarecrow  two crosses for eyes and a stitched up mouth Well thats fucking creepy James said pointing at it I agreed Is it wise to meet these people Im not getting a good vibe He beganWe have to now Theyll be able to see us from their window Itd be odd for us to just turn back now I interruptedWhat if this was all placed to ward off visitors He replied I had no response I just continued walking to the house and he followed In the place of where a knocker would normally be on the front door there was instead a sigh It readTRESPASSERS BEWARE GUARD DOGS WILL BE RELEASED WHEN I SEE YOU Well thats a good sign I see no dogs he might not mind that were here James said looking around worryingly I knocked on the door The sound of multiple dogs barking began James worry grew stronger and he tried to persuade me to go home It wasnt safe here Lets wait one minute and if no one answers well know we arent wanted I replied I saw the light was on again They were inside I wanted to know who my neighbours were A minute passed and nobody came to the door I sighed in disappointment and turned to leave with James When we reached the scarecrow I took one last look around to see if anyone had come to open the door Thats when I saw himA shaded figure stood at the entrance of the house watching us leave I couldnt see his face he seemed to have deliberately stood in the darkest spot of the garden out of sight I stopped and looked at him wondering if this meant he wanted to speak He slowly raised his hand and waved before stepping back inside and closing the doorWell that was odd I whispered Could you see his face  I asked James I turned back to see he was about  steps ahead of me still staring at the house NNo He replied His gaze fixed on the house of the mystery neighbour Lets go He said before taking my hand and pulling me home When we got home James locked all the doors and windows and closed all curtains He was paler than I had ever seen him and he was sweating Are you alright Whats wrong I asked I was beginning to panic as he looked ill with fear We have to move soon He replied He then proceeded to open the laptop and load an estate agency website James weve only been here a month We cant afford to move now I replied trying to make him thing logically againWewe have to move though He replied still scanning the laptop screen Why I asked No response More typing on the laptop and scanning of the screen I repeated my question No response again I slid my arm around James and closed the laptop The question of why was once again askedThe neighbour He began I recognize him From whereMy nightmares I was officially lost Then James opened up his laptop again and Googled The shadows of Cambridge Sure enough pictures similar to what we had experienced popped up A shaded figure with a raised hand apparently waving but in the dark so that we cannot see him The physique was the same throughout  it was probably the same person There was even a picture of his scarecrow Okay so What is this exactly I asked This thing isnt a man hiding in the shadows He is a shadow He can get into any place with light nearby and pretend to the the shadow of an object by clinging to the floor or wall but he is some sort of I dont know three dimensional shadow being He became known in Cambridge after a series of murders the CCTV cameras showed this this thing show up It suffocates people and then slumps into the darkness so nobody can find it It leaves no footprints fingerprints loose hairs or skin flakes It leaves nothing behind because there is nothing to leave Its a shadow But its D I dont know But its dangerous We need to leave Kate Before it kills us and nobody is around to hear us or find our dead corpses rotting in that damn field out there There were tears in his eyes but he was too focused on finding a new home to cry The estate agency website was open once again and he was scanning He was even looking at apartments again I awoke the next day to find James still on the laptop I had crashed around an hour or two after the events of the night before but James hadnt moved He was still tense his skin still pale and sweaty his eyes still wide with determination to find a safer home Oh morning He said quietly as he glanced over to see me sit up Ive found a few potential homes Most are in London suburbs but thats alright Its still not as loud as the central city areas and that thing wont be there I nodded in agreement I didnt want to move but seeing James in this way scared me and I was beginning to see it was the only thing we could do Otherwise hed be living in fear and paranoia over the neighbours or worse we could actually be in dangerThe next week a for sale sign was posted outside our house The day after that the sign was missing It returned a few days later covered in a bloodcoloured red liquid I refused to touch it We got the sign replaced but this one went missing too This one returned black as if it had dipped in ink We tried to clean it this time to avoid bothering the estate agents again Underneath the ink was a message scratched into the board it read YOU CANNOT LEAVE This is the point in which I began genuinely worrying for mine and James safety This neighbour of ours didnt want to meet us but he didnt want to see us leave either A conflicted character it seemed A month or so passed and nobody wanted to buy our house We knew why  everyone knew about the shadowed neighbour I began to accept the fact that we were probably stuck there and James began accepting the fact that we were doomed to die soon He stopped eating sleeping bathing and began obsessing over this thing He looked up how to ward it off how to protect yourself and your home from it remedies for if it scratched or bit you the list is infinite Eventually he got fired from work for failing to attend for two weeks without so much as a phone call His hair and beard grew long his clothes dirty and damp from sweat He was a broken man One day I came home from work to see an empty desk with the laptop open James I called No reply I checked all of the rooms in the house but to no avail  he was missing I looked out of the window and noticed that the light in the neighbours house was on He was there I knew it I had to knock and see if he was inside                              ContinuedI drove to the other house to avoid walking alone in the dark for ten minutes On arrival I instantly know something had changed The light was now off and the front door was wide open I turned off the car engine and sat there staring at the door waiting for something to happen Maybe James would come out maybe the shadow would I dont know If nothing was to come out it meant I was meant to go in I waited or a few minutes and stared at the door intensely hoping praying that someone would come out so that I didnt have to go in Nobody did I took a deep breathe and got out of the car As I approached the open door I noticed something was pinned to it A note In what I hope was just dark red ink the words Come on in Kate were written I entered a the house into large hallway I was immediately met with an old musky smell Everything in sight was covered in thick layers of dust Slightly to the left of the centre of the hallway was a large staircase The wall going up beside the staircase was covered in old portraits  all of the eyes had been scratched out and the mouths torn and ripped My instincts told me not to go upstairs straight away I instead walked into the room to the left and called for James I didnt really expect any response and sure enough I didnt get one either I was now in what appeared to be a study There was a large mahogany desk at the back of the room in front of a large leather chair On the desk were piles of papers but no pens All letters on the desk were written in red I walked over to the desk to see what these papers were only to realize they were all the same They all read Wrong turn Keep looking There were hundreds of them all spread over the desk I turned and went looking for another roomThe next room I entered was on the other side of the hallway It was a living room with an archway connecting to the dining room There was a large metal fireplace with a large red rug in front of it The rug was covered in black soot I walked over to the fireplace to inspect why the soot was on the rug Inside the fireplace was a letter It read Stop messing around downstairs and find your dear James Hes waiting to be rescues Kate This confirmed it James was upstairs I frantically ran upstairs trying to ignore any creepy alterations to the paintings and decorations and staying focused on finding James I called for him but again got no response Suddenly a door creaked behind me I swung around to see it slowly open Nobody came out This was the shadowed neighbour directing me I cautiously approached the doorI walked into the bedroom of a child There were no toys except an old rocking horse covered in dust All mirrors had been covered and the curtains were closed There was a thud from the inside of the wardrobe As I stepped closer the musky smell began to clear and I was instead met with the smell I had become far too familiar with since James and I saw the shadowed man the first time  sweat and dirt I opened the wardrobe to find James still pale as a ghost and sweating more than I had ever seen him sweat before He was drenched in sweat and stunk horrifically He was tied up and blindfolded I quickly untied him and lifted his blindfold Without thinking I jumped back and gasped in shock His eyes had been scratched to an oblivion and he as unable to open them There was surprisingly less blood than I would have expected the neighbour must have collected it for his letters SickI put the blindfold back on him and directed him through the house constantly reassuring him that it was me and no one else He was tense and silent the whole time When we got to the front door it was locked with a note on it It readGoing so soon But he hasnt had his mouth fixed yet I turned to James and asked him what it meant No reply He instead took a deep breath and opened his mouth Inside were lots of tiny cuts over the insides of his cheeks on his gums and even his tongue I looked at the paintings near the staircase  their mouths had been sewn thin strikes of paint had been put over to repair the rips in the mouth area of each portrait At that moment James snapped He ripped his hand out from my grip and stomped into the office room I had been in earlier He soon emerged holding various stationary equipment  a holepuncher a stapler even a large pair of scissors What are you doing I asked He handed me the scissorsI dont know but if it approaches try to stab it with these He replied He then proceeded to throw the holepuncher with all his strength at the window The window shattered Never mind He said Was that a window or the glass of the door He asked trying to feel the window frame Window I replied He grinned and tried to climb out Careful of the glass I warned and tried to help him out He then proceeded to pull me through We were outside We were nearly free I took hold of his hand again and dragged him to the car And then typical to any horror movie or story the engine wouldnt start Shit I yelled slapping the steering wheel in frustration James can you feel for the manual in the compartment please Maybe thatd help In truth I wanted to find an explanation in there first before going out there and trying to fiddle with the engine alone The shadowed thing was out there somewhere and I didnt want to be out there with himJames opened the passenger side compartment and sure enough a note written in red fell out This one red Come back soon neighbour I frantically turned the car key in the hopes that it would start without me having to get out Success The car eventually started We drove off out of there as fast as we could and went home to pack our stuff and leave that area for good It is now two months later The house remains unsold but still for sale We are renting an apartment back in London again and havent been back to the house since James lost his sight in one eye but the doctor was able to recover one His mouth is fine Every now and again we find notes in random places in our apartment saying things like Im watching you and You wont get away so easily next time We burn them and hope that one day theyll stop One day that thing will leave us alone One day well really be free ,1385502108.0,The Shadows of Cambridge,53,nosleep,top_week
ohthankheaven,6,16,1rbpkl,44,I dont have an exciting life I wake up each morning at exactly AM and by AM Im starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work Im late every single day by about fifteen minutes to be precise I dont care they could fire me if they wanted but Im the kind of guy who comes to the office keeps his mouth shut and gets the job done They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isnt so bad compared to the hour and fortyfive minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day I would describe my job as dull repetitive and relentlessly boring and correspondingly so is my life My house isnt particularly lavish Living alone as a male really doesnt give your residence that home feeling Im not your average lonely I lack companionship I do not have a family I do not have friends Every day is the same Its winter time and the days freeze together My alarm goes off I hit snooze Again the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker I hit snooze After a third ring Im out of bed and on my way to work Its freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work My weatherbeaten jacket doesnt provide that much protection either I scrape through the day counting the minutes The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to Their snide remarks always make me laugh and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making It also feels good to have somebody to talk to especially when youre as solitary as I amI dont choose to be this way I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident It was a tough loss it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom which just so happens to be where I still reside I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like Im lost in the masses Maybe I should be more interesting or funny or wear nicer clothes Im not good with these things I started taking comfort in the internet For me it felt safer more secure from the harshness of the real world Not that the internet isnt any less relentless the only difference is Im hiding behind a screen and a handle I do not have a Facebook I dont know if its because I dont see the point of having one or Im too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well I visit my favorite sports websites browse Reddit and enjoy YouTube None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life so eventually I started using a dating website A website that I dont feel the need to name They are all the same anyway It was slow at first Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway I didnt know what to write about myself and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope Suddenly a chat prompt appeared on my laptopHello she saidHer name is Julie and she is beautiful I dont know what she saw in me but for the first time it is real it is there We spoke for years Endless chat logs phone calls video chats We shared tears laughs and something I never felt before love Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time and she said yes I was nervous at first but extremely happy I asked her if she wanted to have dinner but she said she would rather just come to my house instead Yesterday she came over she really is a special girl We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night She really is excited to have me now I can hear her calling for me now I have never felt so happy and so confident There is one thing that is for certain she will never leave me Even if we fight even if we argue she still wont leave me We are going to have a great time together and we are going to play Even if it turns out she doesnt like the games we play she still wont leave me There is that chance though that small chance that things wont work out That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back It scared me at first because I cant go back to being alone again I wont go back I dont worry anymore though because Julie loves me and the games we play Julie loves to be with me and Julie isnt strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell To be continued,1385259704.0,Julie,60,nosleep,top_week
hotforhautbois,16,22,1rlo21,41,Like many dumb kids who move away from home for college I had a series of extreme changes to my life right away Within first year I got involved with some stupid boy I didnt even see that coming Im attracted to women Ive gone  years of life believing that I was a lesbian But I digressI always found the boy to be aninteresting character He was that kind of douche who makes life hard for certain people always going around making fun of the girls and being a loud obnoxious nuisance A bro People like that always made me nervous and uneasy because by nature Im introverted Being social always sort of took something out of me if you will It would make me wonder how do people even get to be extroverts How can they do it I always joked that there was something sinister to it From my point of view I felt that extroversion has a selfish quality selfish yes but sinisterI was only kidding I just couldnt understand their casual blindly confident nature I was fundamentally differentThis extroverted character was the dude everyone else knew though I got to knowwell something elseAt first he was nice Too nice Im not stupid and besides I know how it goes I like girls too I knew he was trying for something I just kind of humored him for a while because hey free stuff from nice boy Occasional free food Free alcohol I put his obnoxious extroversion aside to be friendsHe took my virginity on my th birthday after we got really drunk I wasnt even angry I was using him tooWeeks go by and soon were having sex pretty regularly It wasnt great sex but at the time I was depressed I liked the warmth of another person Additionally he was a lot larger than me as in larger and a lot of upper body muscle not fat and I kind of liked that feeling of being almost entirely engulfed by another person This was only to a point though Once we were both entirely too high and he sort ofcollapsed onto me He just lay there I couldnt breathe He was heavy and I couldnt move him I just had to wait until he recoveredcame down from his high a bitThat was the last time I could remember before we both left at the end of the school year Over that summer I came to the conclusion that I would probably be better off not sleeping with him anymore but that either outcome would be acceptable Its not like I missed the sex very muchI guess neither of us got laid at all that summer because literally on arrival he came to my apartment again and we had sex Again So much for being able to do without it Honestly it just got really goodThat year he started coming over all the time even though it was difficult He moved out of my building and across the city It became kind of rushed and hasty sometimes half the time hed not even remove his socksIn this process of coming over and having to make use of the time he learned that I seem to enjoy rough sex though it was never really my idea Either way I became familiar with this version of him that no one saw I found it hilarious He was like a dumb animal Id always have to find creative ways to hide all the bites and scratches all over my neck and back and then go about my lifeAt school I would just ignore him This had its practical reason being inconspicuous but mostly I hated talking to him He was just flat out annoying I didnt even know how to talk to him When I would see him Id walk in the other direction I dont think he liked being ignored though Not five minutes after seeing him and avoiding him Id get texts asking if Im free later And usually Id say yes Sometimes Id get really strange texts though Once he wrote that he knew I was on the th floor because he could smell me first Lo and behold I showed up about a minute later according to him Thiswasnt all too creepy to me but only because I knew what it meant Personally my senses are pretty mute so I have only been able to identify the smell of two people in my whole life The first was my best friend who I was in love with in high school The second was a girl I fell for shortly before I got into this situation Similarly I could find both of them by smell first even before seeing them It is entirely a sexual thing and I knew itThis was anodd situation to say the least even from the beginning but certainly not a bad one At some point I think I got a little bit sexaddicted I would wake up soaking wet most mornings I found myself spacing out all the time Honestly I wanted nothing more than for him to stay over and have sex the whole night because somehow that had never happenedI asked him once or twice if he would but he would always act all dodgy about that question I didnt ask why I didnt particularly care given that his answer was no every time As it were he started getting kind of selfish though that had already been happening to some degree When wed hook up generally he would listen when I would tell him to ease up or slow down or what have you This was no longer the case and he just kindadid what he pleased So I dumped his assHe wasnt angry he didnt really react at all We pretty much disappeared from each others lives because well we werent exactly friends to begin with Not much to dumpI was still waking up soaking wet though Maybe not that weirdly being a gross  year old I just had to deal with it myself now and that was going okay I was kinda happy not to deal with this dweeb from school anymore So life was just pretty mundane Until the nightmaresActually I didnt know if they were nightmares but it would kinda go down like this I would hear things or hallucinate noises while I slept and occasionally awaken in the dream paralyzed to a crushing presence Whatever that presence was Id feel it embrace me but too tightly Sometimes Id dream hallucinate or maybe actually see for all I know my door open or that I had forgot to lock itId wake up with bruises sometimes Id wake up and find panties missing I was scared and my sleep schedule became irregular I know that the dudes who work the desk downstairs have keys to all the rooms and this was my initial theory to the missing stuff I started deadbolting my door and things stopped going missing Even so I set up a cameraI watched nights of footage sped up Nothing remarkable I was not surprised by my own actions occasionally Id flail about in my sleep and it explained to me the random bruising I would wake up with On one tape I saw something I never did end up slowing the footage down but it kind of resembled eyes They looked like a photo negative I just decided in my head that they were light reflections I mean really what else could it be Maybe I could get some sleep given that I was finally trying to use some logicI was continuing to have dreams about a presence in my room though it had morphed pretty much into just sexual dreams I would still have that weird crushed smothered sort of feeling sometimes but even so I wasnt scared anymore If anything it felt kind of comfortingId wake up with bruises still Sometimes even wake up feeling sore as if the sex were real I probably was flailing about in my sleep again I could have set up my camera again but I had already seen myself do it and I thought what would be the point of seeing it againAt least I could sleep even if Im too turned on all the time Ive always liked sleeping a lotI became kind of reclusive I stopped hanging out with people Sometimes Id skip class I must have been sleeping about  hours a day I wasnt really happy about this but hey Guaranteed vivid sex dreamsThat bring us to the present dayIm so tired I havent slept in four days The last few times I fell asleep I woke up wet again but wet with blood I am going to succumb to the lack of sleep sooner or later and when I do Im not going to wake up Its going to be the last timeI feel like Im going crazy Just sleep I think to myself Theyre just dreamsI now know that they arent dreams thoughI know because I managed to drag my sleepdeprived self to school the other day and I saw that kid I used to hook up with We walked past one another without saying hello but I looked back at him and he looked back at the same time making a blank sort of eye contact with meAnd then I realized something having made that eye contactI realized what I saw on the tapeI realized that I should never have asked him to stay the nightEdited for claritys sake,1385588753.0,Stay the

conspiracydebunker,10,13,1rjvg5,43,I work as a police officer in the eastern part of the Netherlands Me and my colleague Bert patrol the countryside during the weekends at night Nine out of ten nights are boring and nothing happens We might give some drunk guy a fine for riding his bike home without a light or catch a group of people drinking in publicWere always on the lookout for troublemakers Contrary to what you might think drunk people staggering around and being noisy are a low priority More worrisome are small groups of men who walk outside and carry large bags or cars that seem to drive with no particular destination in mindLast weekend something strange happened that still frightens me as I think back of it We had to drive to a neighboring village but road maintenance had blocked of our usual route We figured we would take a short route that goes directly through the local forest although it is unpaved and poorly lighted As I drove to the next village my colleague tapped me on the shoulder On the right side of the road ahead of us I could make out the silhouette of a figure As we drove nearer it seemed to me an old woman as the figure wore a long dark coat around knee length narrowed at the waist She did not seem in a hurry but rather appeared to walk at a timid pace understandably afraid of her surroundingsAfter catching up with the figure I slowed down our car and stopped by the side of the road Its not uncommon for us to encounter old people suffering dementia and wandering around in confusion at night However to my surprise I noticed in a glimpse that the figure was not an old woman but rather a young person aged  at mostThe person pretended not to notice us and continued walking My colleague yelled for them to stop and the person turned around I saw what appeared a very androgynous young person whose thin and elongated frame was accompanied by delicate facial features and pale skin I suspect it must have been a young man but all strong virile features expected of boys his age seemed absent in his demeanor and appearance Most peculiar of all was his clothing which reminded me more of a th century dandy than a modern day teenagerIt would be easy for me to dismiss this as one of the local goth kids playing hide and seek in a forest at night but I felt in my gut that something was different here I had never seen anything like this around here before and it seemed to my admittedly untrained eye as if all his clothing was authenticMy colleague asked him where he was headed I am just headed my own way The young man answered in a fearful voice I could tell from his accent that he was not from anywhere around here but I had difficulty placing it Do you need a ride out of here My colleague asked Nno but thank you He answered after slight hesitationMy colleague became visibly upset and asked him if hes aware that its illegal for him to wander here at night to which the boy gave no answer Alright thats enough I said and asked him for his ID Please do not bother me He answered to which I responded that he could either show his ID or spend the night behind barsWhy do you people always have to bother me He insisted again as he appeared to be on the verge of tears I noticed that his nose began to bleed apparently from the stress Look what you did He said as he held his hand against his nose before demonstratively holding up his bloody hand in front of himMy colleague then informed him that he was placed under arrest and patted him down for any weapons or ID but found nothing whatsoever except for a long hemp rope in his coats deep pockets which my colleague seized As the three of us entered the car and we began to drive I noticed that his bleeding did not seem to stop I handed him a box of tissues we store next to the drivers seat As I turn around to hand him the box of tissues I notice that the engine stopped running I grow nervous as I never have problems with this car Im forced to stop the car to try to restart the engine After a few attempts it works again as sudden as it stopped and I breathe a sigh of relief As I accelerate I look in my mirror and notice to my shock that our passenger has vanished Did you lock the doors I ask in shock to which my colleague answers in an aggressive but affirmative manner I stop the car but leave the engine running We both step outside We look around for what seems like eternity before realizing that neither of us at this point really dares to leave the vicinity of the car Alright lets get out of here My colleague states We both get back in the car in a hurry and Bert promptly declares I dont get paid enough for this crap to which I respond with a chuckle As we get back to driving I have a sudden realization Bert I begin in as calm of a voice as I manage Where did you keep the rope Bert slowly turns his head to look at me before answering Its in my pocket Could you check for me I ask him No He states in a firm manner Bert look in your pocket for me I repeat Bert opens his pocket and sticks his hand in Both of us are silent for a moment DRIVE DRIVE GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE He screams in horrorI hit the gas pedal Luck has it that the end of the unpaved forest road is nearby When the trees are far behind us and I notice the first other car I finally slow down By the time we get to the next village our second to last destination for the night my heart is still bouncing fast I only calm down when Im back at the police station and finally free to head home after saying Bert goodbyeThe next day after returning home I told my wife what had happened Do you think these kind of pranks are funny She responded in a visibly angry manner What do you mean I asked her After she calmed down she explained to me what upset her Apparently her greatgrandmother was of noble birth In a stack of papers she inherited she had read that her uncle had hanged himself on hunting grounds owned by his parents after being disowned by them because he had impregnated a girl The family sold the land to the government and even my wifes grandmother was told never to play in the forest as a child,1385528197.0,Why I hate the Night

grandmaslipboogers,19,13,1roaik,46,Hi rnosleep my name is Dave I am  Im gonna tell you about myself quickly okay I need you to know these things so you can understand my storyMy mom has more heart than brains and she loves me more than I deserve to be loved by anybody I gave her hell when I was younger and she has yet to yell at me My father used to beat the fuck out of her and while she defended herself she would clean and bandage his wounds when the fight was over And my father hes a different story I dont understand how a man this rough ever landed a woman as loving and delicate as my mother He was  erm is a big guy about  Slim as they come but with some muscle on him He was so strict For as long as I can remember he made me call him Dom which is his first name If I ever slipped up and called him Dad I would owe him anywhere between  and  pushups He said it was embarrassing I was not allowed out of the house if the sun was setting and certainly not when it was dark If he did not have the license plate number address and positive impression of the parents at whoms house I would be over I was to stay home If he did not have the drivers license number of my teacher I was not allowed on field trips He was just a very terribly paranoid person In fits of rage triggered by paranoia he would beat my mother and I while accusing us of betraying him He was also if you did not already assume a moderately heavy drinker Between  and  pints of brandy a day and always a tall can of beer or two between dinner and bedI rebelled Like all teenagers my age I rebelled fueled by pintup fury over the abuse that I took so quietly It was rough I did many weekends in detention centers for fighting and unnecessary petty crimes And eventually in the heat of all this I fell in love A beautiful girl Olive with an awesome singing voice and the same passion that I hadThree years ago I got Olive pregnant I was  Olive was  Her parents were mortified my mother was heartbroken but very serious about teaching me to be a father She was waking me up at all hours of the night with a sack of flour and a tape recorder playing a baby screaming telling me what the baby needed diaper change feeding cuddling whatever and then she would watch me do it only stopping the tape when I did it the right way She really whipped me into shapeMeanwhile I was not allowed by my father to see Olive The beatings were worse I was flunking school and skipping a lot to pick up extra shifts at work My father was furiousThen one day Olive went into labor When her and my daughter was almost ready to come out our parents came to wait in the living room I came out to update them only to be greeted immediately and startlingly by my drunken father He grabbed me by my shirt collar and motioned to Olives crying mother slurring Look what you did to this girls family This obviously caused a scene Everyone was getting upset Then for once my mother spoke upDom I do wish you were a sweeter man He let go and turned to her His arms went limp as he walked towards her She rose from her vinyl seat and he got reeeeal close to her face He said very slowly and very defeatedly A Sweeter Man He looked around at the people gathered in the room and nodded slowlyThen he walked out of the hospital There wasnt enough time for anyone to worry because just as he made his grand exit a nurse came out and told me that my daughter was readyIn less than an hour my mother was a grandmother and Olive was a mommy Our daughter Ava was born healthy and kickingMy woman and my girl changed my life I calmed and settled for them And now we actually have a house I keep Ava and Olive both happy and healthy And Im happy tooAnd as for my dad I never saw him again Nobody did except for my mother She was summoned to pick his body from the morgue a month after he disappeared They said he died of cardiac arrest that may or may not have been alcohol related and they found him on the side of an underpass two towns over But life went onThis year Olive and I hosted Thanksgiving We expected many guests but nobody expected Dom to show upCuriously enough Dom did show up He showed up completely sober and in great spirits My mother was upset and my aunt went home because she was petrified Everybody else was just thankful to see him Olive and I were both stunned and cautious When he showed up I took him outside to see if it was really him In his wallet he had my dads expired drivers license and all of his credit cards It was himDom ate dinner with us played with Ava mingled with the family and then left to go see his mother Olive and I watched him walk down the road hands in his pocketsI apologize for my typos and if this was scrambled Im on my second bottle of Sutter Home and Im honestly a little afraid I

Brodiche,28,15,1ra24j,36,The Eighth CrusadeOn the outskirts of the large city known as Canto a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away There were some smaller towns outside of the city but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of cannibalistic citizens came flooding in In the end those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it the hesitant died along with the rest of the city However this small cathedral was different It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance  Short flashes of lightning filled the air just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth With a small grin played on his lips he gazed dreamily at the cityWhat a sight Obliteration has never looked so divine He whispered to himself Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head Well I guess you cant get much more divine than thatFeeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body Slightly irritated by this the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off The temperature was dropping fast it wouldnt be long until the rain began to pour The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city The Vatican ordered complete destruction they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a heathen city The man wouldnt feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed He leaned back against the lightning rod and lit another cigar daydreaming of the day beforeOne bite one citizen and his work was done His mission was to just get the ball rolling nothing more Being as potent as he was his victims often became immensely strong They were puppets sure but also unstable The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church The man was frustrated that he only got one snack he was tired of the left overs from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks He was craving prey with more life to it one he could enjoy stalking before the killThe Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral Along with being the drop point the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew His orders were to simply enter the city light the spark and watch God cleanse the Earth from the cathedral You zealots are no fun he would tell them Im doing Gods work for you lazy ass holes the least you could do is let me off the leashThe hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much freedom the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy armyIt pissed him off that they never got over thatHe resolved that it was never really his fault humans were frail weak creatures They are easy to corrupt in every way None of them could handle the thirst and they tore everything apart Turning their victims into for lack of a better word zombies The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but ritualistic blessing before he set offVai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a DioDeliver them I shall He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk The helicopter was taking off it was time to go to workLocke could not stop thinking about his one victim regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feastThe man found himself seeking a challenge In the back of his mind he knew he wouldnt get one but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city With the pace he was traveling at it wouldnt be long before reached the edge of Canto his long strides covered more distance faster than a highend sports car going ninety on an open freeway The cool night air was refreshing to him its not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedomBeing cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Lockes sanity Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma he had no real connection to the outside world Its not like he longed to live amongst the humans no the thought of that made him sick The only reason he could stand the Men of God back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible Hes seen them put on human masks sure seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces No no behind their masks they are every bit a monster as LockeThe city was drawing closer massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding smaller clusters of lights What were the humans doing at this hour Were they working overtime tucking the children in late night binge drinking at the local bar They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them Sure it looked pretty from a distance but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity even though he never considered giving it anyways he asked to be briefed on the citys situationCanto was dying almost all whove entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become Corruption plagued the citys central government all of the representatives power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor As a result crime was abundant Drug trafficking prostitution child labor plagued the down town streets Whole families were often caught in cases of indentured servitude as the wealthy put it where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too it was just the way it went And it was reason enough to cleanse itLocke reached the edge of Canto he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings Looking at his watch the man whispered to himselfTime to light the matchUpon entering the city Locke found to his disappointment that there was no shortage of easy prey The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets practically half dead already prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever He was slightly surprised however to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building A young woman dressed in rags stumbled past them she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care The guards just looked upon her and laughed asking the woman unrepeatable questions When she didnt respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neckIn a very swift motion the girl whirled around grabbing the guards wrist and pulling him close The mans face was within an inch of hers his expression showed that of pure pain She had broken his wrist In a split second she revealed a small revolver put it to the mans chin and pulled the triggerThere was a bright flash then a spray of crimson red The mans body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm Landing knees first on the guards chest she pinned him to the ground Grabbing a firm hold of her preys head with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete Over and over again she did this until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalkIt was all over that quickly She stood up without a sound her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner While the look she gave him was quick it was more than enough to excite him She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength and short dirty black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye Locke knew her just by that single short glance He knew her struggles knew her strength and knew her will to surviveHe knew he had found his preyThe building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren snapping Locke out of his mystified state It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty not a piece of human filth to be seen Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape A thought crossed his mind and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust Not wanting to risk compromising the mission Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey The mystery womans scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops Lockes mind wandered back to the two guards how efficiently and violently she dispatched them Two full grown armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size Where can a human learn to kill like that Without mercy or emotion just pure unadulterated instinct After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist The hunger was starting to get to him it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag Locke felt his heart sink he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building and descended to the street below The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet leaving a small clear circle around where he landedFor a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moonThere is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey spoke the man His voice had a crisp raspy tone to it full of anticipation and a hint of sensualityThe womans eyes widened at this not out of fear however it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity the grip on her bottle tightened She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone  Listen Ive had a long day I already have had to deal with two assholes today she lifted her hands almost defensively to reveal that they were caked with dried blood I caved both their heads in before they learned their place maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around hereThe man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat amused and intrigued by her intensity He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Lockes head The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding begging for his life like she has seen so many other men do However the man was still standing Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his faceHmm Im not much of a whisky man I prefer a more  he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise  exotic spirit He began to chuckle to himself in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him This is the most pain hes been in in years and that is saying something His chuckle escalated to a howling laughterThe woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement Even though she was beginning to panic a smile spread across her face Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than  minutes in fight with her much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the headShe watched as the mans laughter grew his bloodshot eyes screamed madnessIts time to put you down you crazy sonofabitch she said with a smile She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard the aged blood glistened in what little light was available The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the mans open mouth and pulled the triggerAgain there was a quick flash His head snapped back with full force but he remained on his feet never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon He lowered his head fixing his blood red eyes on the womanHe was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his preys face Whats the matter baby doll You seemed surprised you cant dispatch me as easily as those two security guards Locke began to laugh again Honey they are nothing compared to a true monster     Locke took one last look at his victim then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey                           The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal The womans eyes were glossed with fear but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky Locke allowed the womans essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that persons life and personality Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that persons life All their thoughts feelings information becomes a part of the predators body and soul Veronica He whisperedThe womans body began to violently shake She was beginning to reanimate Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire everything about her will be augmented and enhanced Locke looked back at the shaking body Give those zealots hell for me VeronicaTurning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can He had lit the match Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night Locke finally said with a smile                                The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead like veils of moving sentinels suffocating the very light out of the stars The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky echoing into the midnight horizon A light from below slightly illuminated the world trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth releasing and delivering throngs of angels utmost nightmares unto Gods domain The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again Below the heavens true evil incarnate devoured the world Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe fire danced on the water under decimated bridges streets were in chaos destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs Police stations show no sign of life a constant siren blares somewhere in the city with nothing living left to answer The city its souls everything was devoured by chaosWell almost everything,1385199684.0,The Eighth Crusade,51,nosleep,top_week
jdpatric,7,14,1rird0,39,I was told that this would fit well here I have a few more and one recent that Ill try to post up as well Sorry for the wall of textI lived in Pennsylvania until I was one month shy of being  I know that exact date because you had to be  to hunt in PA and I was looking forward to it Anyways we moved to Florida and I get to hunt down here too so thats OKI had a few good friends that lived right down the street from me We lived out in the country My address was literally   Road Middle of nowhere So wed hang out at my buddies place or wed go up this hill for about half a mile until we reached the burn pile and cabin at the topIt really was a basic cabin Outhouse No lights Nothing Wed hang out there use it as a fort for Nerf battles manhunt CTF etc Well one night my friend invited a few of his friendscousins up to the cabin so we could roast marshmallows and play manhunt There were something like  of us to start but the number slowly went down to  by nightfall So we played manhunt  vs  in the dark Around  pm we were in the middle of a game and two of my friends had hung back with me because we were the fast ones We realized that there were only three of us left on our team and that we hadnt captured anyone from their team We tried to make a jailbreak and lost my friend Well call him F It was just myself and another friend that well call L L and I were  yards from the other team and they had  of our  players now in their jail They began to press our side more and mess with us until one of them told us we were cheating L and I looked at each other unable to figure out why Our side had about  of it covered heavily in trees The other side was about the same with both wooded areas near the back of the sidesAt one point when we were chasing someone off our side I saw L and I running in the same direction and someone on the other side of L I quickly cut behind L and intended to surprise the other person and nab them on our side I was probably the fastest person there and I didnt want to be on the team to capture nobody Once I emerged from behind Ls trajectory we were both running I saw absolutely no one Nothing no trees no scarecrow absolutely nothing that I could have mistaken for a personI surmised that there had to be someone from the other team hiding behind our lines waiting for us to cross over and then tag us there Well the game ended up dwindling down to us with two left and the other side with  We capped one person and then all parties were exhausted I asked the other team mostly Ls cousins who was behind the line waiting to cap us No one claimed responsibility I figured it was someone trying to mess with usBack at the cabin we start cooking hot dogs and marshmallows over a fire We were all ish with one person being maybe  older cousin so we were drinking soda and not beer Note If this had been beer and Id been older Id just chalk this up to booze All  of us are around the fire when we saw someone coming up the hill Its hard to see outside in teh dark when youve been staring at a fire for a while but at least  of us had seen the person so we figured it was one of the people who left coming back or someone new After about half an hour no one came up We went and looked and found no one Being the intelligent young kids we were we decided to investigate further Its summer after  am and were out playing with fire and flashlights looking for a mystery person Yeah we were not honor students We went to the path that led down the hill and could clearly see my friends house in the distance they left the outside lights on for the dogs and no one in between Someone was trying to mess with the group so they ran into the woods and came out directly on top of us scaring the crap out of everyone After we all changed our pants and regrouped we headed back to the cabin only to see someone on the very far side of the clearing There were three of us with flashlights and all of us attempted to illuminate this person but we were too far away to get a good look as soon as we lit himher up heshe disappeared into the woodsOK then now a few of us are freaking out Six people decide to go down to my friends house to spend the rest of the night where the ax murderer from hell wont be able to get them Since they have  and the  of us who decided to rough it are only  the group of  got two flashlights I was the only one left with oneWe decided to figure out who this was L had an uncle who was only  years older than him who we figured was just fucking with us We knew his place was less than a mile from where we were big extended family large family plot of land L Fone of Ls cousins gonna call him C and myself began to walk across the clearing Once we were about  feet from the edge of the woods we could hear someone moving around in the brush Not stomping or anything but very carefully moving through the fallen sticks and underbrush trying to make as little noise as possible We figured it was Ls uncle well refer to him as Uncle JSo we split up again and two people waited in the clearing F and Ls cousin and myself and L went into the woods to try to flush out Uncle J We figured F and C could see OK from the clearing and to be honest they actually could L and I eventually were about  feet INTO the woods further than we thought wed need to go when we heard this low rumble noise This is one of those times when I regretted trying to act macho L and I kinda looked at each other to make sure it was neither of us rumbling and basically just stopped dead in our tracksI shined the flashlight up in the direction of the noise directly away from the clearing and the fire and couldnt see anything There was just nothing there It was to this day one of the most eerie noises Ive ever heard Like a noise a Halloween decoration would have made but real We stayed about  feet into the woods never venturing much further in and searched the general area Never found anythingAfter about half an hour of this its now past  am we heard a noise just at the edge of the clearing and both of us turned around I had expected it to be F and C coming to figure out what the fuck was taking us so long But instead I see one person basically hiding halfway behind a tree looking at us Ive never not wanted to shine my flashlight on something before that moment If it was dark I wanted to see what it was But in the distance well past the shadowy character I could see F and C milling about by the fire I had this awful feeling that there was no way Uncle J was being this creepy I didnt want to see who it was and I really just wanted to get away from this person I mean the hair on the back of my neck stood straight upL must have seen it too because he started slowly backing FURTHER into the woods We moved in as wide a circle as we could around this shadowy person and managed to make it back to the clearing We got back to the cabin and grabbed F and C and began to make our way back to Ls place When we were about  yards from the cabin we heard its door slam and we fucking boltedWhen we made it back to Ls house near the bottom of the hill we debated what to do should we call  Was that a trespasser Or was that simply a family member messing with us L went to notify his parents who we figured would be overjoyed at the premise of being woken up around  am by a bunch of sweaty terrified  year olds They werent home Apparently Ls grandfather had a heart attack around  pm None of us had cell phones as it was  and so no one had been notified except for Ls  year old step cousin I never really figured out this relationship TBH who had drank himself near blackout drunk as soon as the adults left him in charge of all the younger kids up at the cabin Seriously he got reamed the next day by basically every adult in attendance That meant that uncle J and basically every other of Ls family members who could have been messing with us were at the local hospital with the patriarch of the family whod had a mild coronaryAt  am we knew sleep wasnt an option and began to watch and wait for the shadow guy to show up at the bottom of the hill Less than  minutes later I hear a sound coming from upstairsonly problem istheres no upstairs to Ls house Theres something someone on the roof L grabs his pellet gun cause thats going to be super effective and we go outside cause you know were smart and stuffWe shine ever flashlight straight up at the roof and see a completely black silhouette jump off the far side of the house in a mad sprint The way Ls roof was shaped the part he it jumped off of was over  high there was a huge vaulted ceiling in the back room of the house and the roof was even taller to accommodate for the attic We watched it run away from the hill and towards the creek  wide maybe  deep and we followed it until we realized how much faster it was than usOnce it reached the edge of the creek it stopped and looked back at us This rumble thing came back and it jumped the creek and we lost itThe next day we told Ls parents and they informed us that the cabin was being torn down A cow had been killed and dismembered IN THE FUCKING CABIN early that morning presumably after we left It could have been a panther cows werent uncommon on that part of the property but they tended to avoid the people it could have been a bear but fuck we never went back up that hill at night No way no how Never saw that thing again Might not seem like much but to  year old meI had a new face for fear,1385498927.0,The woods of Pennsylvania,53,nosleep,top_week
youngsterjose,3,10,1rd8lb,39,My mother once told me a story her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide this is that storyMy mother had a sister once I remember my earliest memories of her she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad She never had an answer My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her It wasnt the first time she had been followed by this man Only difference was this time he tried to talk to my aunt He asked are you happy with your family arent you tired of living in a house of religious fools She was scared and asked who are you and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes He smiled and said your people call me the devil and she started to run She ran as fast as she could Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened My mother tried to calm her down my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself Soon enough she passed outA few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem She didnt go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house So she moved back to my grandmothers house They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized It was around  in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm Her breath taken away her eyes wide open she turns around and sees the man claiming to be the devil He says tell me whats wrong I know I know somethings wrong let me take you away from all your troubles she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed My grandmother started yelling at her are you crazy do you have any idea how late it is why are you screaming she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed the devil hes after me mom my grandmother was religious still is but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or twoWhile in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging you know theyll never believe you or you know they cant see me When the lights went out she closed her eyes She could hear his threats she could hear him mocking her life She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice her thoughts She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital Around  month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later My mom did not hear of her for about  months after she got out of the hospital My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops Yet she never found her Turns out she was hiding in the woods She didnt want see anyone my aunt told my mother that she never gave in I dont know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find She explained to my mother how he never left her side he was always there talking to her he did not want to let her go My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man the devil said to my aunt  i want you she ended up killing herself a week after She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse A few members of the family came to her funeral not many though thats what my mother told me My grandmother did not go She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herselfA few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around pm its still light out so she thinks why not visit my sister she needs it so she walks to the cemetery It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes She told me some things in this world happen that cant be explained and that was one of those things,1385324165.0,My Aunt,49,nosleep,top_week
ultrafilthy,14,26,1rpa86,34,No sleep No mother FUkInG sleep Im not trying to address the readers here Im describing the past few days Wait Weeks Wait Months Im describing the past few months of my life BackgroundIm living in Asia right now doing a three month internship I attend a particular university in the US im american that requires  internships upon getting a degree Students can go anywhere they want as long as they get an internship in their field of study Why did I choose Asia To get as far away as possible from what happened to me in the US From what I saw From what I may have caused That being said Ill begin my story Two years ago I was hanging out with some friends What I call my crew I wont name anyone because its not important Instead ill describe our communal interests There are five of us that make up the core crew My brother a information systems student a fashion student an electronic media student a philosophy student who is into djing and producing music and a city planning student me We are all generally creative people and we like to collaborate on ideas events art projects or what have you We build off each others inspiration For example one time we threw a fashion show at a bar in the downtown area of where we live I brought art to the picture the fashion kid brought the clothes the other three brought a unique style of music atmosphere We like to do things in the public eye Often this leads us to do online promotion of our events Nothing too crazy you know Facebook invites and that type of stuff This leads me to another common interest of ours The internet The internet is amazing Everyone here knows it Upon the thousands of uses it has our crew tends to use it for inspiration There is a grab bag of sites we all pull inspiration from One being chan Okay I know this is reddit and its a constant war between the two communities but seriously there is a lot of good content on chan After you filter through the dicks Car Parts and gore that is chan was not in my personal queue of sites to check everyday untill the fashion design kid sent me a link to a thread with really wild art work With my interest immediately sparked I go to the link and of course the thread ed I feel like I dont have to explain this but threads  on chan after they go idle for a short period of time and everything in the thread is lost I said fuck it cut my loss and closed the link After a few days my friend told me I really missed out and if I go back and request the thread someone might post the pics I do as told Got called a nigger faggot Lame Regardless I decide to browse b and see whats good I ended up seeing why people go to b and frequently returned over the next few months until I finally understood all the humor and inside jokes Hooked at that point I would log onto b before I would even check my email Because its an awesome site After class on day I get home go to b and see a TOR thread Most of you know by know what TOR is but I doubt you have explored it Even if you have gone in have you really gone deep No probably not PM me if interested though I got the good links Seeing this I decided to explore it because why not Keep in mind this was about  years ago Thus the silk road Snowden bitcoins and all that were not popping up on the front page of reddit everyday I have a naturally curious mind so I got really into this whole deep web thing and pretty much dedicated all my free time to it This really wasnt easy It takes a lot of time to filter through all the bull shit dead links avoid Cheese Pizza and not get hacked Fast forward one year If your keeping track I said this started two years ago spent  months on b and one year on TOR So thats  months before I fled to Asia At this point I got passed layer one of the deep web This took the ability to learn and find the software on hidden in TOR that allows you do to do Layer one was pretty much mild Yes there were hit men drugs and mild porn Layer two is where things begin to get weird Going to layer two I started to find the dark side of the dark net In short snuff Im not talking creepy pasta snuff im talking pictures and videos I may sound sick but I was interested in this It wasnt for fap material if youre wondering I am interested in this because if I hear something exists I need to see to believe The snuff videos I saw were generally low quality and had their fair share of errors By this I mean I could not reaaaallly tell if the vids were real I thought it might just be people with somewhat good special effects and props reducing the quality of their videos and making things seem real Dont get me wrong though Some of it was real for sure But some seemed to unbelievable to think humans would do such things Three guys one hammer doesnt even hold a light to this shit After seeing what my stomach could handle I was ready to leave Till I saw a strange link All weird tech TOR shit aside This was my path to layer three The bad stuff The new born hurt core stuff Twisted I know but I had to go to see if humans could be that sick in the head What I saw I can not forget and I do not recommend This stuff was bad Simply bad After seeing a certain video containingwelllets just say I closed my computer took a long cold shower staring at the wall and could do nothing after but take a xanax and go to bed Waking up the next day I immediately thought about what I saw I go back to my compute and remembered I forgot to close TOR I open it try to close it and I cant Every time I move my mouse to the close button it goes the opposite direction wutjpg After five minutes of trying this I say fuck it and power down that SOB and assume restarting it everything will be closed Wrong So wrong I opended my computer and a txt program was opened with a bunch of text I read it and took a huge dry gulp Everything personal on my computer was in this box My adress bank stuff personal notes everything My first thought was NO ive been hacked Wrong again I tried to use the mouse and it worked fine except with the problem of not being able to close TOR I was able to use everything else I open google chrome and do some searching for a key stroke logger I figured if I can download and install it maybe I could find what program or phising code whoever did this was using and I could undo the mess I got the logger and installed it Now the waiting game I didnt do anything once it was installed and just sat and watched If any thing was done I would know it was not me I put the logger window next to the window that had all my personal information so I could see both windowsAfter a period of wait something happened Someone hit the enter key   The thing is the key logger didnt tell me this I could only tell because  of a shift in the txt window a bit later a new paragraph begins on the txt box Could not copy it but it looked like thisrgsdvsssssssssssllwatchingandwaitingda fuq i thought I look over to the key logger and only one letter appeared The letter J No idea whats going on I keep watching  more lines go by similar to the one above Each one caused only one letter to appear on the key logger after about  more lines nothing happens The key logger looks something like jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth Fuck this I thought and leave my computer For the record I froze all my bank information and important accounts because of potential theft I had been away from my computer for three days when all the sudden I had a thought TOR links at level one start out onion from there they get stranger and stranger I go back to my computer and move the mouse to the jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth and it changes color from black to grey indicating a link I clicked that shit Yeah it was stupid But I really had no option whipe my drive clean and start all new accounts or see if I can get to the bottom of this Clicking the link brought my to a new window In tiny deep red letters it said my real name I clicked it All the sudden my computer goes black hhhhhhhhhhhhh this is where it happens I just got wicked chills The computer goes from black to matrix style green zeros and ones flying doen the screen Slow at first then fast Then faster Then faster Then A photo of me One that I have never taken One that was in a place where I have never been It was a photo of me standing there with my hands behind my back in a abandoned where house Looking at it freaked me the fuck out till Only three or four seconds passed till my head moved in the photo It looked left two seconds later my head turned back and slowly turned to the right Wait This wasnt a picture this is a video Right then and there I decided I had enough Whoever was trying to play a sick game with me was going to loose because I was not having it I stood up I picked up that computer and I smashed it I smashed it good It was a cheap computer I got off ebay that I used to play around with Not my main CPU At that point I felt better because I had released aggression But the thought of what I saw could not leave my mind I tried to tell my friends but they simply would not take me seriously Cops Yeah right no point Parents Nope not going to bother them They wouldnt give me two words before they would stop believing me After the smashing I didnt use any computer for a few days I tried to shake it off and eventually did A few weeks passed and I forgot Until a dream hit me I was sleeping as usual and I had a dream of the video Except I wasnt watching the video I was in the video It started just like I described earlier I was standing there hands behind the back looking left then right To the left dusty old factory walls to the right same After looking right I looked down and brought one of my hands in front of me and stared at it Red Blood red This freaked me so bad I woke up screaming and did not sleep the rest of the night The next day I was shaken but continued life That night I Tried my hardest to not sleep but I couldnt help it and passed out No dreamsRelief The next two weeks had no dreams I began to forget everything Shortly after in class one day I was making a model of and had to cut some foam core with an exacto knife I was cutting along till a kid accidentally bumped me and a got a small cut on my hand I looked at it and there was only a little bit of blood Hardly did any damage The kid who bumped me said oh shit sorry man are you okay I looked up to my right to tell him its nothing but I could only see a dusty factory wall I looked to my left and saw the same I looked down and saw my hand covered in bloodThe kid put his hand on my shoulder and I snapped out of it you alright dude yeah im fine im going to go wash it I went to the bathroom washed it And just left and went home I got to my room and sitting on my bed was that mother fucking computer still smashed into pieces Okay reddit here is what makes my story different I didnt see this and ignore it I saw that shit and I turned right around and left the house I wasnt about to be all investigative and demon hunting on this I noped right the hell out of there and got in my car and started driving I didnt know what has happening but I did not care I just drove It took me about two hours and a refilled gas tank to get my shit together Pretty much I just drove on the highway randomly When I got back to my neighborhood I didnt go home I went to my brothers house I called him up and just asked if he wanted to kick it Of course he did so I went it He tossed me a beer and looked at me you alright yeah just tired from studying mass ya hear me fool chea drink that beer though and you be alright word lets watch eastbound and down There was no way I was going to tell him I could hardly understand what happened let along vocalize it Fast forward a few hours and I passed out on his couch The dream started again Same story but the new event was after I looked down at my hand I looked up I saw myself Not in a mirror I saw myself standing there in the exact same position except my arm on the me I was looking at started to come out from behind my back Thats when I woke up I woke up to being thrown into the wall by my brothers roommate I had been told my brother was sleeping and I sprinted up stairs to his room and started pulling him by the arm With more strength than normal Retard strength He freaked out yelling and I guess his roommate came in saw us and threw me off into the wall My brother said my eyes were closed the whole time and in the end he chalked it up to some sleep walking shit He was pretty pissed and we didnt really kick it for a week Regardless After that happened that day I went home and I was going to grab that broken computer mess and burn that shit Oh yeah I was going to burn it to pure ash Nothing bizarre ever happened in my life till all this started I wasnt able to put any sense together so I was just going primal mode I got home Stormed to my room and there it was But Back in its pre smashed condition

WILLingtonegotiate,12,10,1rdxhm,33,Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural Just extremely weird somewhat scary It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety more than anything Well I will start from the beginningWe moved into our new home around the end of August We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here  I say new home because it is just that a NEW home The neighborhood is new as well All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old We love the area Awesome neighbors rural setting though stores still within walking distance We know absolutely nobody in this town so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far We live in a  bedroom house with our three childrens rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs Our room is literally  feet from the front door I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door  Around our third night in the new home is when it started DINGDONGGGGGG The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about  seconds I dont know why I find that eerie   DINGDONGGGGGG DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONGThese three were quite rapid taps on the doorbellI must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet much less my body I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly Then three rapid taps My room is completely dark only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock This same clock showed me at this moment it was  am Wtf I thought I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun its a Glock  with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel It would be quite handy in a few minutes  I grab a magazine slide it in and chamber a round With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front doorAs I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep loud booming knock  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head as if he were leaning on the door listening for any type of movement coming from within my house I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speakWho is it I shoutedMy question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over meAgain I shout Who is itAnd I hear him for the first timeIts me Daniel replied the dry calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door I do not know a Daniel I replied sternly What do you want I askedIve been left here I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gunYou have  seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand I said this with a very loud and booming command In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it It was after am and I was worried for the safety of my family I mean no good person would do this type of thing to a stranger rightI start to count  just then I look out the peephole and no one is there  the  was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown I have a bathroom just off the foyer and its window has a clear view of the front door  I peer out of it no one there I think to myself okay he got the point Oh shit what if he didnt and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby truck I decided I would need to go outside against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay insideI enter my room to grab my shoes and got a shock as my wife broke the silenceYou are not going outside after that She exclaimed She must have heard the entire thingDo you want this asshole screwing with our cars I askedI could care less you are NOT going out there She again rattled offBaby go back to sleep I will be fine I assured herI get my shoes on go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying The door had been unlocked this whole time I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon the beam from its attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale Nothing I step outside and onto the wet grass I check the side yard closest to my door and then start towards the driveway The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway No sign of Daniel I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body Im right here Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisperThis was so chilling at the time that I could not bring myself to turn around right away It felt as if he were inches from me Right behind me staring I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around but when I did I was surprised Daniel had not been directly behind me but about twenty feet away sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me His silhouette small and twig like There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol When I illuminated him it was not what I was expecting Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat I know too many movies right This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty more of a grungy type of look going on He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me legs stretched out into the street hands placed palm down stretched out behind him fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them What do you need I rattle off with an understandably shaky voiceOnly what I asked for He replied again way too calm for the situation I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police I say I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man That will be fine would you do that for me would you call them for me He spat back as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his headSure do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man I askWhy on earth would you shoot me I could have walked into your home without ever knocking right He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knewAlright move the FUCK on dude NOW I shouted but noticeably terrified nowHe rose to his feet seemingly in one movement Turned to me his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me staring as if he were asking me to lower the light which I did As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves He brought his hands to his face and covered it while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky and then slowly down towards me He smiled and said in a hushed but very deep voice Call them motherfuckerI raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards meCall them motherfucker He screams As if he knew what the outcome of the call would beTake one more fucking step and it will be your fucking last I shout my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torsoHe stops in his tracks cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown Followed by a snarl His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face everI get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police My wife was already up there she must have been watching the whole thing I quickly dial  while ushering my way to the window As I peer down at him he slowly looks up at us still snarlingCall them motherfucker His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than beforeI get the operator on the phone never breaking eye contact with DanielI explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the wayShe calmly starts to ask for more details What is he wearing physical description what has been said did he physically attack me was he still there did he have any weapons do I have any weapon The questions seemed to go on and on She then saysSir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving can you see it She askedYes I exclaimShe then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door I immediately head down stairs and there is the knockPohleece A male voice shoutedI opened the door and was greeted by an officer The cop was about mid s portly and visibly sweaty You called in a disturbance He askedYeah did you grab him I repliedHell no is he still here He snarked Well he was ten seconds ago I saidWe both walk out into the yard where we had stood No sign of Daniel I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken Damn thats some crazy shit He said with a look of astonishmentYoure telling me I replied He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back He explains that a family had just reported their  year old son missing Their son was african american tall and most importantly his name was Daniel He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit Everything started to fit perfectly There was a reason he was so irate and up and down This wasnt a maniac it was a young man that was simply ill My emotion went from scared for my family to scared for this young man As we are standing there in my yard the cop and I We hear itCRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACKFive very noticeable gunshots rang out Followed by my neighbor a  something asian widow running from her house handgun swinging wildly back at her home She was screaming quite literally bloody murderAs I stand there paralyzed with shock the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commandsPut the weapon down now He screams thunderouslyI killed him She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklesslyThe officer orders her to the ground approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her He starts to search her stands her up walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon All while I am standing there in horrorHe shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door My neighbor found him standing in her living room naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall blood splattering everywhere She retrieved her handgun and shot him  times running out her door immediately afterI was told he was dead before he even hit the floor She hit him with three bullets One through the neck one through the thigh and one the fatal one through his temple I met the young mans family who actually was pretty hostile towards me They wanted quite surprisingly to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going throughOh yeah I forgot the craziest part After the police officer ordered me back into my home my wife and I found something that send chills down our spines Lying there at the foot of our bed a pair of shoes and socks You guessed it They were Daniels ,1385342598.0,ITS ME DANIEL,43,nosleep,top_week
psycheko,13,17,1rlcmm,26,Note So I posted this on here a couple weeks back but then I got really nervous and scared and incredibly intimidated by so many of your amazing writing skills I deleted it  This time however Im going to muster up the courage to post it and keep it posted Im only mustering up the courage because I was reading something on here which brought on this whole discussion of mirrors in dreams and how theyre bad news  And well having a nightmare containing a mirror twice in the same night was ratherunpleasant So I figured it was damn time to shareLet me start off by saying I do still get bad dreams but nothing on this scale hence why I say that this was my final nightmare up until this point in my life Its weird because its one of the two memories I can remember vividly to this day the other being when I was sexually assaultedanother story for another day  This nightmare however was like walking through fire doused in gasoline where my bad dreams now are more like a slap in the face  Im just trying to stress the fact that nothing compares to what Im about to sayIt actually was this month when the nightmare happened  I was in grade  at the time so this was  years ago The day was pretty average I didnt watch any scary movies wasnt around anything frightening or any of that jazz  I didnt eat late or have any food that normally does have a tendency to create nightmares which is why this one was oddI dont remember what time I went to bed but it wasnt that late  And to be truthful with you it didnt start the moment I fell asleep either  No the nightmare didnt begin until midway through a dream I was having  And so this is where it beginsSo like I said I was having a pretty average dream  All I can remember are green hills  I cant tell you anything else but I distinctively remember green hills  And all of sudden sort of like when youre watching TV and a special news statement pops on the TV and the news anchor goes sorry to interrupt this broadcast my dream interrupts without the lovely warning I was in my parents bathroom They have a long horizontal mirror that spreads across from the corner of the wall to the edge of the sink so its the entire length of the sink  And I was simply staring at myself in the mirror combing my hair with this pink comb they have  I was just mind my business when I noticed these ghostly white hands around my waist  I blinked and turned to see this little ghost boy behind me He was pale as sin and had black hair He looked up at me grinned this Cheshire catlike smile before disappearing into nothingness  In my dream I screamed and blacked out  The weird thing is my dream continued for the moment it was interrupted The exact moment I ended up waking up and was fucking freaked the fuck out  I was terrified of going back to bed because normally if I have a nightmarebad dream they dont stop  But it was a school night and it was  in the morning I had no choice but to curl up in my sweat soaked bed and go back to bed  And it was a stupid stupid mistakeSo once again normal dream everything is fine and all of a sudden BAM dream is interrupted once again  Once again I was upstairs in my parents combing my hair  I was minding my own business when I noticed those damn ghostly hands again but this time the hands contained a knife which rested against my throat  I whipped around like it was nobodys business and watched as this little boy slowly began to back up with his head down his face obviously covered his arms at his sides  I watched in horror as this boy slowly continued to back up and was forced to stop as his small frail body reached the bathtub  As I write this Im getting chills The little boy raised his head ever so slowly and I automatically notice blood seeping from his eyes down his cheeks  Empty eye sockets met my gaze  He lifted an arm from his side and of course it had to be the one with the knife  Suddenly he grinned that Cheshire cat grin and disappeared just as quick  I once again freaked the fuck out blacked out but this time I did not wait for my dream to continue  I woke up  It was am and I still had an hour to sleep but that was SO not happeningTo this day I still get creeped out when Im in my parents bathroom because of how vividly I remember this nightmare  Im terrified sometimes to be up there so much so Ill turn on all the lights  And I always feel uncomfortable looking in the mirror  I guess a part of me is terrified that one day Ill see those hands and those empty eye sockets againThat is not a sight I want to see,1385581184.0,The Boy With No Eyes,43,nosleep,top_week

thedarkhalf,7,10,1rhyj5,25,You know that feeling when youre all alone and hear your name whispered Maybe youve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop Had things go missing only to reappear in odd places Maybe youre like me and you lie in bed at night only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around nothing Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately tickling you You check and nothing was there Im sure your parents tell you its nothing from a young age perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination They probably deep down fear its a ghost or apparition Even they couldnt know how much worse it really is  Stop deluding yourself Its not a cobweb Its not the wind Its not nothing Its something far more sinister an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention Some of you Im sure will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house Its such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do its the spookiest part of a generic horror movie because those suits in Hollywood havent seen what these creatures are really capable of If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their voices Im sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because its real form is so terrifying youd probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear a zombieesque state youll never awaken fromand that would ruin their fun too early If you dont die instantly seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and Ive heard of cases where insides have been liquefied skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every poreThe first time I awoke to one in my room with me it was after Id given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention I had thought it was cool I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg followed by more spindly legs followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs Yep a giant spider bigger than a horse came into my room I tried to scream but that just resulted with me hyperventilating then vomiting all over the floor It strode in all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away but it held me down with its two front legs piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devouredwhich I was  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn I lay in bed delirious desperate muttering for help My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me I passed out shortly after from fear blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later believing to have all been a dream I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals birds mostly wrapped up in what appeared to be spiders webs discoloured drained of their blood and insides All dead I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself dried blood caked on my body and face puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts my stomach my legs and in my hair The second night I encountered one of them they took the form of my uncle I lived with my uncle for nearly  years while my father was travelling almost every week for business I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods He didnt know what his brother did to me That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me He crawled onto the bed and tied me down I struggled but when I did he beat me with his belt like he had started doing when I was eight years old I fought as hard as I could tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl The torture that night lasted for many hours possibly days I try not to remember it I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago when my uncle died This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me Theyve only grown stronger with every drop of blood with every scream and with every hopeless sob Ive given themTheir true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that wont instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane yet they like to take their time with their toys The dreams for me started after those incidents I have seen what those beings really look like andjust thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking unable to stop retching The other day I wasnt careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train In my dreams it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world but it all feels real Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this tormentbut what if when I die I get sent to their realm to be their plaything forever Its not just the occasional brush against my skin the odd floor creak and the rare moment of is someone calling my name Now I feel them on me at all times their rough sharp skin cutting mine scratching me violating every single part of my body Their voices scream and howl at me maniacally taunting and laughing at my neverending misery Even when I shut my eyes I still see them their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts of spirits Yes it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering isnt it You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive you open your mind and let them in Dont Whats out there isnt human it isnt some person with unfinished business whats out there wants you to think that to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper That creak outside your room That faint sensation on your flesh I hope not because now

Moncheriebourbon,2,8,1rowsn,23,Her name was Mary She was in charge of looking after the girls in the dorm It was a great thing the president of the university had done creating an all female dormitory so the girls didnt have to walk to the normal school in the harsh Midwestern weather Mary loved her job The girls were so young and full of ambition Theirs was the generation of Elizabeth Kady Stanton Jane Addams and Alice Paul The world was slowly changing for the better her girls would be teachers on the great prairie and this hall would be where it all began This particular night only a couple of girls remained in the building due to the Easter holiday Ingrid who hailed all the way from Kankakee Emma from Shawneetown and Bridget from Chicago Bridget was a restless soul she found the prairie too dull and devoid of the exciting life she had grown accustomed to in Chicago She had seen the Worlds Fair for herself ridden in Pullman Cars and volunteered at Jane Addams Hull house She was only here to appease her mother who insisted an education would endear her more to Jonathan Moore the wealthy factory owners son Unable to sleep Bridget made her way up to the fourth floor music room Her long white nightgown and matching housecoat lightly drifted across the floor as she made her way to the piano Something soft and sophisticated would remind her of her mother and soothe her to sleep she chose Beethovens Fur Elise The song was so ingrained in her mind she was able to close her eyes and let her fingers naturally flow across the keys So lost in the music she didnt see the gruff groundskeeper drunkenly enter the room At first it was the enchanting music that drew him in but then seeing lovely fairhaired Bridget in her dressing gown his thoughts turned to something more sinister Poor Bridget who missed the city she never imagined something like this would happen to her The groundskeeper believed she was dead after he had finished ripping her gown and her body he fled before anyone could catch him Bridget the resilient Chicagoan dragged herself down the stairs If only she could get to Mary Mary would help her After an eternity she was at Marys door Bridget tried to knock but didnt have the strength so she scratched and scratched and tried to call out with a hoarse whisper but Mary wasnt roused In the morning Mary woke up pulled on her housecoat and opened her door intending to go to the community shower room Instead she found Bridget lying lifeless at her doorstep Mary couldnt tell you what happened after that Only one thing was clear to her she needed to protect her girls She began wandering the halls all night locking doors that were left carelessly unlocked occasionally entering a room and sitting by the bed of a girl having a nightmare she made sure not a single candle was burning after lights out windows were to be kept locked and absolutely no one went anywhere in the building after dark without Mary escorting her Mary only grew worse as the years wore on She was convinced there were men waiting for her to sleep to stop walking the halls even for a second in order to pounce on her girls The doctors said she had hysteria and she was sent to the asylum in Kankakee She panicked in the asylum and knew she had to get back to her dorm or else her girls would all meet the same fate as Bridget She gained the trust of her nurses and one night asked for some knitting yarn and needles The nurses obliged because Mary was such a good patient Mary took her needles and fled back to the hall She was buried in Kankakee in a paupers grave The dorm remained all female through The Great War prohibition the Great Depression The Second World War after coed dormitories became common when AfricanAmericans were finally allowed to attend college through records tracks CDs Mps and iphones And Mary always watched over her girls She no longer needed to sleep so she was able to freely roam the halls every night checking for unlocked doors Walls no longer kept her out so she could sit up all night with a homesick girl who was too embarrassed to talk to anyone else Mary loved her girls but her very being in the dorm attracted less friendly spirits and as the years went on and debauchery became commonplace amongst the girls these bad spirits grew stronger I come in to this story in the fall semester just a few years ago I was living on the second floor of the Marys dormitory with one roommate Rachel my roommate left for home nearly every weekend so I was frequently left alone in the old building Rachel and I were always hearing strange things at night footsteps piano music scratching at the door On more than one occasion one or both of us would fall asleep with the television radio or computer on and wake up to find it had been turned off Other girls said they had similar experiences and we all laughed it off as Mary our friendly ghost looking out for us I became obsessed with the story of Mary and Bridget The fourth floor had been locked up years before I came to the University but you could still walk up the stairs to it and peek in through a crack in the door Most of the girls were afraid of it but the landing just outside the fourth floor entrance became my personal study nook As the year wore on I became increasingly aware of an eerie feeling at the back of my mind I started seeing shadows hearing scratching and waking up terrified for no reason One blistery weekend in December Rachel went home like she usually did The cold weather had kept me indoors for the majority of the week and I was feeling a little stir crazy I went outside to have a cigarette and out of habit looked up to the fourth floor Surprisingly a light was on I stared up wondering how and why someone was up there It was only a second but something was in the window It was big and had red glowing eyes I screamed and dropped my cigarette A couple of girls going into the building looked at me strangely when I looked back up the light was off That night I could hardly sleep I kept seeing those red eyes and my body felt like it was in a constant fight or flight mode Something was just wrong the air felt too heavy there was someone in the room with me even though Rachel was gone I drifted off to a light sleep but was awakened by the sound of growling There was something in the room I tried turning on my lamp but it wouldnt work I spun around in bed and saw in Rachels corner of the room what was making the noise It was a big dark creature that looked like a cross between a giant wolf and a horse Its eyes were glowing red and I could just make out shiny white canines barred at me Panicking I pulled my covers over my head and started saying a prayer begging that the thing be cast out in Jesus name I dont know how but I fell asleep again I woke up sometime later it could have minutes or hours and knew the thing was gone There was a peace that radiated throughout my body before I even opened my eyes When I did open them I saw a woman sitting on the side of my bed She was dressed in very old clothes and was humming something familiar I drifted off to sleep feeling protected It wasnt until I woke up to the sunlight that I realized the song she was humming Fur Elise I had other equally and more frightening things happen to me while living in that dorm I think that Mary was looking out for me that night and all the other nights similar things happened Mary really is still looking out for her girls over  years after her death but there are other things out for the girls too I just hope Mary continues to be there to protect others the way she protected me ,1385701703.0,Marys Hall,31,nosleep,top_week
NeonPaint,12,7,1ra0o4,23,I need someone to help me I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what Im going to wake up to I need it to stopThe past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house It would have to be better than this I work at a nursing home Its not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting Its haunted I know it sounds stupid but it really is We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge I guess the most recent example is Dessy I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself Dessy is a cute little old woman She is the grandma you wish you could have Weve always had a pretty good companionship A couple weeks ago she changed Her appearance and her personality completely shifted Her eyes become sunken in hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed teeth started to turn a nasty yellow and her feetdear god her feetthey looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails they didnt look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of  She started saying things to me There was one conversation that has stuck with me Dessy do you want to go to the dining room tonightFuckfuckyou little whoreExcuse me Why are you saying that Honey you can eat in your room I just wanted to make sureHow does it feel whore Little slut you fucking slut you whore you SLUTYou need to stop being mean How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner At this moment she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them downYou fucking slut Does he do this to you Does he put his hands in your pants Does he fuck you with his hand He fucked that little virgin ctvirginwhore slut fuck youwith his handvirgin ct ct ct I went white as a ghost I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age my name and that I wasnt married I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew things My personal life isnt something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me And then she smiled I cant explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me how it made me cringe how it made me sick Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago Stuff starts happening to me at my house It began with scratching One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls I didnt think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house If I went into the kitchen the scratching would follow I couldnt get away from it But I soon realized there are much scarier noises out thereThe moaning is what followed and its been driving me to the brink of insanity Every night I hear this awful moaning Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine I get up I search for who ever or what ever it is If it sounds like its coming from the living room I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet the moaning is now in the kitchen It plays with me Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from If I even want to know where it comes fromThe sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me I cant explain it but when I hear it I know its a cruel joke I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been I cant sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings If a spirit is around I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but this has no name nothing What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a smile I havent seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible One night when the moaning was louder than usual I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it When I walked into the living room I saw a shadow and it had a smile on its face that made me throw up right there It made everything in me want to come up in my throat After I cleaned up and calmed down I realized that the smile was familiar to me Maybe thats why it caused me to get sick it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room She has never smiled at me like that again but I cant handle the thought of seeing it again whether its with or without a faceThe moaning and that smile haunts me It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to STOP I havent had a real nights sleep in days  Im exhausted and Im working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy Things I usually love to do I dont have the energy to do I always liked to post comments on reddit but its been a couple weeks since Ive even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting its pitiful I need someone to tell me what I can do Any ideas will help ,1385196781.0,Maybe Im losing my mind,30,nosleep,top_week
Jaaaaz,8,15,1rnwuj,20,When I was a kid I stayed with my great aunt while my mom was at work My best friends were the twins whose backyard came up against my aunts yard There was a park nearby that the four of us would ride our bikes to We always loved to play there with the old playground equipment but even as a kid the place seemed off There were never other people at the park no matter what time we went despite being on the edge of a newly built subdivision with plenty of kids In the middle of the woods were the remnants of house a foundation and the chimney Further out the woods had a clearing an access road to a private club and then more woods with a creek we liked to play in The clearing had a place where it pushed into the woods a little more like a culdesacIt wasnt really visible unless you were looking from the park side of the woods Down by the creek there was a fence to sneak around and a few rusted out cars on the edge of the pathI remember one time I saw my aunt leaving a little dish with some food scraps in a blue porcelain bowl in the old chimney Id never noticed it before but thinking back I probably just never noticed it tucked back there Shed tapped the bowl a few times against the brick and walked us down to play in the creek One summer there was a rickety treehouse on the culdesac part of the clearing I remember my aunt and uncle talking about it not long after we found it The kids who pieced it together were gone itd fallen and they didnt survive To this day theyve never found any remains nor can I find any records of it happening Over the years Id forgotten about BushDell Park Recently I was in the neighborhood and something told me to go check on the old place It has been fifteen years since I last visited the park but not a thing had changed The slides and swings were still in the same mediocre condition they were in back then My aunt used to always hum a certain melody when we were at the park and as I got out of the car it was like I could hear her humming faintlyAs I walked further into the park the melody seemed to get louder I was walking towards the entrance to the woods and it occurred to me that it was someone in the woods singing not just my fond memories I snuck up off the trail and followed the noise as quietly as I could Eventually I found my singer standing over by what was left of the old chimney It was my aunts neighbor though last time I heard she could barely walk or see for that matterI sat and watched her She tapped the bowl inside the fireplace a few times just like my aunt did Then I heard  gentle clanking of metal I looked around myself but nothing appeared out of the ordinary The trees rattled in the wind I assumed the fence was rattling The sound was creeping up on me but there still wasnt anything around me Lydia was gone the next time I looked at the chimney Out of nowhere this stench hits me The closest thing I can compare it to is some mixture of death and excrement I made the biggest mistake of my life when I looked up The long scarred muscular arms stretched out in the branches the weathered bearded face The metal sound wasnt the fence it had to have been the chains wrapped around this things wrists ankles and waist His mouth just hung open with these big vacant eyes He didnt notice me or just didnt careHe moved through the trees not in the nimble way that a monkey would but also considerably better than any person He jumped down onto the crumbled foundation and started gnawing down whatever was in the bowl From behind I could see that it looked like some chains had become embedded in his back He rose up and released an inhuman scream to the sky I stayed as still as I couldI turned and started to slink back towards the park I could already hear grunts and chains behind me I took a sharp turn I dont know why I was running as hard as I could and it seemed like the chains and grunts kept going as if I hadnt turned I started to notice the smell of death again The telltale grunts and chains couldnt be heard but as I kept running the smell got strongerI probably ran past the first few warnings that I was in the wrong place As I ran I started noticing bones hanging from the tree limbs from wires If I had to guess some of them were probably human femurs by the size and shape but its hard to say since they appeared to have some of the ends gnawed almost to a point The trail turned small the size of trail youd expect a few kids on bikes to wear in after a few summersJust off the edge of the trails every now and then Id spot a small animal skull usually resting against a tree I crept along the path the bones hanging grew in frequency and started to look more and more carved I came to a clearing and there was Lydia She threw some kind of raw meat into a stone circle and started walking straight towards me What is that LydiaSomeone your aunt wanted taken care ofI heard the rattling of chains behind me I turned around but I couldnt see it Not on the ground not in the trees I turned around Lydia was gone I turned and there it was towering over me Im a little over six feet tall and it was still a couple feet taller Its mouth fell open and let out  deep groan the smell should have knocked me over I hit it I hit it with everything Ive ever had or ever will have Right in the mouth right in those jagged brown yellow and black teeth The thing didnt even stagger it grabbed its mouth and its eyes filled with hate I ran through the fence through the park back to my car Every step the chains and tree rattling got closer to me The last I saw it was standing in the gate of the fence I called the police from the car I told them about the bones and where they were I figured theyd sort out that thing if they found it I drove to Lydias Everything in the neighborhood was quiet I banged on the door Her daughter opened the doorHi is Lydia homeShe hasnt been here in a long timeIs there any way I can visit with her I have a few questions about my auntShe paused Is it about the thing in the parkI was floored how did she know Yeah I saw her feeding it or somethingShe told me shed promised your aunt that she would try to keep him calmWho is it Im not really sure She said privately that it may have been your aunts son That thing isnt human though is itI dont think soOur conversation was cut short by a phone call It was the police station They said I was too old to be making prank calls Apparently there was a clearing there but no bones no burrow I excused myself from Lydias house If anyone knew what was in those woods it would be her sisterI made the call in the driveway Grandma did Aunt Genevieve ever have a sonThe line was dead for a moment I suppose she did give birth to one He died shortly after birth he had so many things wrong with himAre you sure she didnt hide him away in the park by her houseI love you but please leave that monster alone All Genie ever wanted was for thatthing to find a place to

irinax,12,8,1rf7xn,22,Previous post herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcopwhoisthiswomanpartThis night I had a friend over Its not related to the woman or this story at all  it was planned much earlier I needed some help with my new place so shed help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really takeShe had to leave really early before  AM so I thought I can just sleep until  and then goBut as soon as she went out I felt something weird As if theres someone still with me Someone watching me I just knew someone is thereKind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW theyre here even though the door of my room is closed And I know so I have to get up and checkThats how it was So I got up to check Nothing I couldnt see anything but I could still feel it I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that theres nothing there It didnt It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there  it was just an ingeneral feeling of misery and despair not related to something specific So I figured maybe I was just getting sick maybe I was too tried too stressed maybe its really nothing and I went back to bed I fell asleep really quickly Then the doorbell rang I woke up It felt like I slept for hours and hours but in reality it was only like  or  minutes I went to open the door guess who it was The womanYeah I was terrified and for a moment I thought  Im done Its over Byebye cruel worldIt  wasnt  regular fear like youd be afraid when you know theres a reason to like a gun pointed or an angry dog It was more like fear of the dark you dont really know what exactly you fear but its still scaryAnd just to make it clear once again  she doesnt LOOK scary She looks normalShe speaks in a normal tone with a normal voice But theres just something about her that makes me want to get away but in the same way intrigues me  I feel that I HAVE to knowSo I was really holding back the what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch rant that was forming in my mind I just greeted her instead because seriously what good could come out of getting pissy Not like that would help nowShe says hi Im like uhumm yeah hi And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing hows life etc etc So Im like wtf you saw me yesterday and the day before and the day before She ignores me She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out I have things to do so  I wouldnt be a good host right now She says she doesnt mind it all I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home Maybe when I fix it I know  she knows Im lying But I just HAVE to say that I cant tell her the truth She just walks in and I immediately escort her outAnd the truth is I just DONT want her in I cant let  her I know she cant do anything more than she could do in the hallway or from the door or in the park or in an alley or anywhere else really but I just didnt feel like letting her in and still dont I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at  in the morningShe keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something And the pushier she gets I get less afraid more angry She then asks me about my old town my friends family my new friends my new place what am I planning to do here I dont tell her shit I just ramble about unspecific things getting more and more angry She makes me feel dizzy Not in a Ohsoniceandcute way In a very bad way In a Icouldpassoutorevendie waySomehow I get through the conversation and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me Youre really not going to let me in I explain to her again that Im going out now and the place is a messSo she glares at me and nods AlrighttttI really thought she was going to attack me  I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whateverBut she turns around then she turns back to me and says See you soon Maybe Ill come again tomorrow I tell her itd be better if she just lets me invite her when Im ready for visitors when I can actually provide a good stay for a guestBut friends name stayed the nightI get terrified again  bitch how the fuck do you know but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartmentShe nods again And then she says bye see you And walks away Turns around once again stares at me and says I still cant figure it out Thats why I just have to come back like you had to interrogate me at the park And then walks down the stairs I try to stop her but she ignores me Wont talk anymoreNow the thing is nothing about her except the knowing my greatgrandmother part seems supernatural otherwordly She seems like a silly but creepy lost cause And if it wasnt for my grandmothers warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena Id even consider her a cute wackadoodle But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she a woman

quietgrl,12,9,1rchof,19,I had moved to Minnesota months ago in order to get away from some strange phenomenon happening to me in Philadelphia since May  I dont know what to call these things ghosts phantoms spirits However my friends and family arent judging my experiences as real accounts of the paranormal they believe that Im slowly losing my mind And sometime I wonder if thats the case too if Im simply falling into to some form of schizophrenia I decided to share my stories here so maybe I wouldnt have to feel much like a freak or that Im going crazy Or maybe I just dont want to feel alone with this Well I had a week to relax again without anything strange happening to me However I had that feeling again that things werent over and was just getting started I am anxious all the time ready for the next creepy thing to happen to me and Im not even sure if I can call my life living anymore I rarely sleep I barely function at work and Im losing a lot of weight from the lack of eating My only distraction these days seem to be stupid videos on the web and chatting with the cute neighbor named Charlie I dont share with him about my experiences because I dont want him to look at me with those same pitying eyes that my friends and family give meAlthough last week I did dare to ask Charlie if he had noticed anything strange in the neighborhood He gave me a funny and confused look and I had to try my best to explain what I was asking without really explaining the truth of my situation Oh I said waving my hands as if the movements would untangle my nervous words You know I mean do you notice anything weird or any weird stories from others in the neighborhood I was trying to figure out if I was the only person who had a ghost following themNo Charlie said shaking his head slowly in thought And then his baby blue eyes lit up Well yeah If you mean if there are any weirdos here yes we have a few like anywhere else I am a bit weird for example Nah I blushed towards him Youre not weird at all You seem very normal to me And very cute I wanted to add but I kept that thought to myself Well after a while of nothing happening to me I didnt exactly catch onto the next bizarre incident right away It must have been nearly am in the morning when I heard a man singing loudly outside If it hadnt been for CottonEye Joe Id been married a long time ago Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye Joe At first I was a lot annoyed for having my sleep disturbed by the most unlikely song but then it was kind of funny that someone really seemed to like this song and thought it was a good idea to bellow it early in the am Then another thought came to me that it may be the voice of Charlie proving me wrong about my earlier opinion that he wasnt weird It sounded a little like his voice and I couldnt help but wonder if he was drunk off his ass and having a bit of fun tonight I rushed from my bed and peered out the window my eyes slowly adjusting to the darkness outside The only thing I could see was a shadowed figured of a man non descriptive as he shambled towards the direction of the pathway between my house and CharliesI giggled to myself before heading back to sleep knowing that I would tease the guy tomorrow about his choice of song I slept peacefully as the night faded back into silence The next day I did run into Charlie a silly grin on my face I told him how I spotted him in a chorus of Cotton Eyed Joe stumbling towards his house at am in the morning He gave me the most confused lemon face that I ever saw on a man and replied Well I dont know who you saw but it wasnt me For one thing I was asleep at that time dead to the world And second of all I hate that song I dont even know all the words to it let along could sing the chorusHmm I said a bit confused now because I swore it was his voice that I had heard Hey he smirked I did tell you that we have some weirdos among us right It was probably Mr Roy who lives about two houses down from us All he ever does is drink and he only seems to leave his house during the night to avoid conversation and eye contact with any of the neighbors I wouldnt be surprised if he had a few too many last nightI agreed with that explanation for the time being but I wondered if Charlie was somehow covering up an embarrassing moment that I had caught him in The next night the singing happened again this time at am with a loud chorus of Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye Joe I rushed to the window and again I could only see a shadowed figure shambling towards the pathway and disappearing around the corner leading to the front of the housesI felt uneasy about the movement of the shadow as it didnt seem exactly like a humans walk at all and very unlikely for even a drunken one It was a combination of stops and jerks forward like someone moving a puppet on a string And sometimes the shadow seemed to jerk too far ahead causing the figure to appear a couple of feet in the matter of a blink I wasnt sure if I was just overly tired and seeing things or maybe not I decided to go back to sleep and forget about itThe next night I was awaken by the man singing the song loudly again this time at am I had left my floodlight on before bed a light that illuminates my driveway I eagerly peered out of the window hoping to see the guys face this time whether it would be Charlies or the weird neighbors This time the figured shambled directly in the path of the bright light and still his face was nothing but a shadow There was no hint to any of its features just a shadowed figured that belted out Where did you come from where did you go Where did you come from CottonEye JoeI was frighten shutting my curtains and hiding under my blankets I slept with my bedroom lamp on for the rest of the night just like a little kid Later in the day I asked Charlie if he heard the singing man last night or any time this week He did not And again I felt as If I may be hallucinating these thingsLast night I heard the man singing again this time at  midnight And I refused to leave my bed and look out there not wanting to see that shadowed figure shambling by moving many steps ahead in the matter of seconds I figured it was all in my mind that it would go away if I just ignore it Thats when I heard the creak of one of my floorboards at the end of my bedI sat bolt upright and could see the shadow standing at the foot of my bed Its darkness seemed to stand out much bolder than the darkness of the room a silent silhouette of a man who just stood there and said nothing for a while I was too afraid to move or to call out to my sister who was asleep in the nezt room I just stared at the figure barely breathing waiting for it to move or flinchIn a voice that was deep and demonic it sang out Where did you come from CottonEye JoeAt that moment I lost my shit and began to scream as I flipped out of my bed and hit the floor with a huge thump I began to crawl my way towards the door of my room but that thing it grabbed my ankle and began pulling me back towards it I kicked flailed around on the floor and cried out No no no no Let me goMy sister burst into the roomflipping on the lights her eyes wild and her voice wavering Whats happening The shadow man was gone and I broke out into tears still very afraid but so relieved that it wasnt there anymore After some moments of hysterical sobbing I was able to tell my sister what had happened I thin this time she believed meI dont know if the whole thing was just a horrible nightmare or if Im somehow hallucinating However that grab from the shadow man felt a lot real I can still feel the memory of that grip on my ankle a rough and cold hand that eagerly wanted to pull me in towards it I cant sleep with the light off now,1385298217.0,Cotton Eyed Shadow,28,nosleep,top_week

angelcot,5,2,1rh91p,18,Hi rnosleep This is kind of embarrassing to post but heres a few stories of things that happened to me as a kid I was a pretty anxious kid and a lot of weird stuff happened to me Nothing paranormal though Theres more than just these stories but I thought Id at least start with thisEver since I was a kid Ive been afraid of windows Thats not saying much though I was afraid of just about everything else too But growing up my house was full of big windows Floortoceiling windows in the family room two sliding glass doors in the dining room a huge window that looked out from our kitchen into the front yard My mom never bought curtains or blinds for any of the windows other than the ones in our bedrooms because shed get depressed if it were too dark in our house I had light blue curtains in my bedroom that my grandmother sewed for me since my windows were an irregular size Every night I would pull them closed then pin them down to the walls with a pushpin so that I wasnt able to see even a sliver of the outside out of the corner of my eye My bedroom window looked out on the backyard I remember being so irritated whenever someone would accidentally leave the back porch light on The light would shine through my light blue curtains and play shadows on my wall Id cover my head with my pillow so that I could fall asleep without worrying if I would be able to make out the silhouette of someone trying to peer through my curtains still pinned to the wall From a young age I had problems with insomnia My mom struggled with it too I remember my dad telling me stories of when my parents were still married when my mom would wake him up just to talk because she still wasnt asleep at    in the morning I remembered feeling envious that I didnt have someone to do that to I listened to books on tape at bedtime to fill the silence Sometimes I would sneak into my brothers room and lay on their floor hoping for sleep to come Being uncomfortably aware of how their curtains werent drawn completely closed When I was  I moved from my room which overlooked the backyard to my brothers room and my brothers separated and took over my room and the office My new room was at the front of the house If my curtains were open someone could easily look in as they walked up the path to our front door During the day I didnt mind it I could watch for my friends or packages from the postman At night it made me so anxious I began to develop a habit of vomiting nightly My mom was sympathetic but didnt know what to do about it A year later I was moved back into my old room and my older brother moved back into his I stopped vomiting every night I feel like I had a reason for being so afraid of windows One night I must have been about  or  I was up late as usual listening to Ralph S Mouse on tape for the billionth time I had emptied the glass of water that my mom had gotten for me so I got up to refill it I was already wary of windows so I kept my head down on my way to the kitchen Id often see things out of the corner of my eye something moving or something that could have been the shadow of a human but would later try to convince myself it was nothingEven with my head down something outside caught my attention A car parked in front of my house I lived at the very bottom of a culdesac so we didnt have a lot of people drive down our street at night and stop to reorient themselves The car had its headlights on and I could tell there was someone sitting in the car Looking at my house I dont know if they were looking at me but my paranoia told me they were I stood there for a long time forgetting about my glass of water I didnt look away Paralyzed until my mom came in the kitchen Shed seen my door was open and wondered what I was doing up When she noticed the car in front of our house she quieted and gently pushed me out of the kitchen and back to my bedroom I noticed the car started to drive away as I was ushered away from the window This staring contest with the person in the car in front of my house happened twice more although over the course of a few months Once they switched their headlights off and stayed for what might have been  minutes Although my memory might be exaggerating I still dont understand why I was so afraid of seeing someone in my bedroom window but how I could fearlessly stare out of the kitchen window at the person in the parked car Maybe I felt less vulnerable in the kitchen Maybe I was comforted by the fact that they were so far away Even though the walk from where they parked was just a few seconds from my front door and the window I was looking out The third and final time I saw the car the person got out of their car They were tall and I could see them standing on the other side of their car but I still wasnt able to make out their face When they started to walk around their car and I assume towards my front door I scurried back to my bed I never liked sleepovers as a kid Staying over at a friends house meant laying awake on their floor for hours with nothing to listen to but the sound of their calm breathing Nothing to look at except for the sliver of their window I could see from behind their curtains Having friends at my house was just as stressful Usually wed sleep in the family room because it had a TV in it It also had the floortoceiling windows Usually I would sneak off to my own room after my friends had fallen asleep so that I could sleep peacefully away from those big windows When I was about  years old I was having a sleepover with a few of my friends It was after  so my friends were starting to fall asleep I knew I still had at least two or three more hours of being wide awake I was laying on the couch swaddled in my blanket The TV was still on but Id turned the volume down for my sleeping friends to something barely audible Usually I tried to keep my eyes away from the windows But that night my cat caught my attention meowing and hissing at something outside I cautiously looked out the window worried about what my cat might have seen out there Just another cat skittering in front of the window Relieved I looked out at my dark backyard Was that it There was a man in my backyard walking around Even with the distance I distinctly remember he was frowning He had his hands in his pockets I did not know this man I woke up one of my friends whispering in her ear and telling her there was somebody in the backyard She stirred quickly obviously alarmed and looked outside She saw him too Im not sure if he felt our little eyes on him or what but he turned to face us Neither of us made a move not to lay back down and pretend we were asleep not even to look at each other or look away There were a pair of french doors that lead to the back patio in my family room right in the middle of the wall of windows The man walked up to the doors and tapped on one of the small window panes The handle of what looked to be a heavy flashlight hung out of the pocket of his sweatshirt He smiled at us Not a deranged smile not a smile that looked too wide for his face Just a calm warm smile He mouthed something and pointed at the doorknob I was never very good at reading lips I stared straight ahead unblinking not responding I could hear my friends breath heavy and shaking He spoke the sound of his voice muffled through the glass Open the door A pause he knit his eyebrows together like he was concerned Im visiting your parent Let me in My heart was beating out of my chest I was a paranoid enough little kid to not fall for this line I mustered up every ounce of courage I had in my little anxious yearold body and got up off the couch For a moment they man at the door looked relieved I ran out of the room screaming for my mom I could hear my friend call out at me that he was leaving and the rest of my friends starting to stir I told my mom what had happened She turned on all the outside lights and called the police while my stepdad looked out every window for any signs of the man All of the girls at my sleepover had their moms come over and pick them up I cried and stayed the night in my parents bed although Im pretty sure I didnt sleepIn my moms bathroom there was a big window that looked out at the sideyard The glass was distorted though so my mom never bothered putting a curtain over it You couldnt see into the bathroom if you were just passing by the window If you stopped to press your face against the glass you could see in or out but everyone in the house knew not to do that when they were in the sideyard I remember my mom shrieking one night running out of the bathroom saying shed seen something through the glass A rat climbing up the windowsill and staring into the bathroomI always liked my moms shower more than the one in my bathroom My bathroom didnt have a fan in it so the whole bathroom would get uncomfortably humid The shower curtain in my bathroom reminded me too much of that scene from Psycho too and Id always shower with the shower curtain pulled open and Id get water all over the floor My moms shower had a glass door that I liked much more even if there was that big window I could see clearly from the shower Once when I was  I was showering in my moms bathroom because my parents were out of town My brothers were home but were playing video games in the family room I would keep my head down when I showered in my moms bathroom Even if the windows glass was hard to see through it was still a window and the shower was the most vulnerable place I could think of being looked at Every once and a while I would glance up to quell my growing anxiety To tell myself nothing was out there Cautiously I looked up to satisfy my anxiety Nothing was out there I told myself My gaze met the window There was a dark figure pressed up against the glass Through the foggy wet shower door I couldnt see anything All I know was that it was somebody I screamed and ducked down past the tiles so that whoever was out there they couldnt see me A few moments later I heard my brothers knocking at the door both of them calling my name and asking if I was ok I pulled a towel from outside the shower and wrapped myself up before I stood up Whoever was out there was gone A few weeks later my friends and I were playing in the side yard There was a huge tree out there that we liked to climb in and pretend we were characters from XMen or Sonic My friend called my attention to something in the grass over by the window of my moms bathroom A polaroid picture of the distorted glass of the window it lay in front of  ,1385446224.0,Windows,20,nosleep,top_week
Hangingtree,4,5,1rosmv,17,I love my jobIm a butcher you see You may think I sound cruel or maybe even crazyBut I really doWhen I was a kid my father would always take me to work with me It was a family owned butcher shop His father before him and his father before him Weve owned it for the longest time My father taught me all the cuts of meat The thigh the neck the ribs I always liked ribs but I feel bad eating them The best ribs I ever tasted was after my grandmother died She never approved of the store and had arguments with my grandfather and my father about it She wanted to keep me as far away from it as possible Didnt want me See those things when I was a kidI didnt mind though Blood was never a problem everything has blood in it technically tree sap is blood It wasnt a problem to see though I always liked to tease my friends who feel sick when they see it Id cut off a foot of one of the animals and chase them around the field with it My father didnt mind he was actually really lax about letting me do what I want He liked me at the shop I kept things nice and clean Like I said I dont mind seeing the blood or even messing around but I just liked to keep the place clean For sanitation reasonsMy mother on the other hand was the one that always yelled at me for doing anything she didnt like Shed yell at my father for letting me go to the shop saying it was wrong She was a vegetarian after all She would say things like They feel pain Theyre living things You shouldnt be killing them and eating them They were just animals It wasnt like I was hurting peopleMy father had a lot of headaches from her always yelling Though I still remember when we were eating the day after she passed away Hed stare into his plate of potatoes and steak and just cry He really did love herHe started bringing me to the shop more after my mother died A sort of father son bonding experience He got a little sloppy with his work though To stop the animals from crying out you had to slit their throats first and let them bleed out He forgot to do this The noise hurts your ears like when youre sitting in a restaurant and some kid wouldnt stop crying High pitch and it drills into your ears I always hated it My father gathered up the cuts of meat he needed and took them to the other side of the shop I had gotten into the habit of cleaning his knives when he left I picked the knives off the table and was about to wash them when the creature spasmed on the table I didnt think it could move anymore most of its limbs were gone and it was cut open Its skin was all dirty almost black but you could still see pink underneath it The thing looked me in the eyes I saw fear in them like a deer in headlightsH Help meI stared at the animal It shouldnt be able to talk None of the others had talked before My father returned wiping his hands on his apron He saw me standing with the knives Whats wrongI must have looked worried I didnt mean to scare him I pointed at the animal on the table It talked My father just gave me a quick frown Thats not right He walked past me taking one of the small curved knives out of my hands He stuck his fingers into the things mouth opening them wide It gave no fight Ah here He reached the knife in and wiggled it around I saw blood dripping out of the animals mouth He pulled out a small pink thing You have to cut out the tongues Otherwise they talk just like usI looked at the animal on the table Its four limbs missing its shaved head and bleeding mouth But they arent like us right No matter how much they look like usNow you got it slugger My father gave his warm laugh I always liked that nickname,1385697831.0,My fathers shop,22,nosleep,top_week
schizoidvoid,2,5,1r9u3h,14,This is shaping up to be a big project which is good for me and hopefully for all of you as well Turns out ten thousand characters isnt nearly as much as I hoped it would be Thanks to those of you who have commented on parts one and two Here are some links to get you started into my storyThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart  Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations Part  SpiritshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcvthesilverladypartspiritsI remember a story arc in Greys Anatomy where the ghost of a doctors dead lover followed her around and only she could see it Thats when I stopped watching the seriesI was eating cereal watching reruns of Scooby Doo I couldnt recall cereal ever tasting better and I couldnt recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining But thats how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch giggling musically at the television Today was a day of firsts for the both of us Dad walked in at some point looking haggard as I had ever seen him His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks I gave him a halfsmile equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy Make no mistake I hadnt forgotten my sisters death but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady I stood up smoothly walked the three paces across the living room and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster He was apparently speechless but when I looked up at him I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a littleI reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad I smiled at her and then glanced back at my dad who was looking at me quizzically now I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him againWere going to be okay DadHe only nodded and wandered off He had taken time away from work to grieve and so he had not even dressed himself In the silence that followed I looked around I had to laugh and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble Yeah I must have snapped Two deaths was one too many My laughter had drawn the ladys attention She looked at me and frowned a little I shook my head at her incredulous and turned away Things like this didnt just happen to peopleI was grateful though at least I didnt get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something There wasnt much of an earthly nature that could upset me with her around That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered I decided I might as well make the best of it Everyone grieves in their own way I suppose Jurassic Park was showing and I figured Id go see it The movie wasnt for several hours though and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP The silver lady sat across from me and I couldnt help but laugh The entire restaurant was going about its business and yet here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey like a ghost bride her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenicI still had an hour to kill after breakfast so I decided to spend off some of my allowance though it had been meagre from week to week I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques built into the slightlyrenovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the towns conception way back at the turn of the century Several tops caught my eye and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one I asked her what she thought of them from time to time but she didnt seem to have an eye for clothes having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia I was just wrapping up at the last store preparing to break another fifty dollar bill when a little girl in front of me in line turned aroundShe smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her moms skirtMommy MommyWhat is it honey the woman asked a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgentShes so pretty mommyThe mother looked at me and smiled and I smiled back Yes shes very pretty hon Now come on weve got to get to the bank She halfwalked halfdragged the girl out of the store the girls eyes were locked back over her shoulder that cheesy grin still on her faceI would have felt flattered except the child wasnt looking at me She was looking five feet to my left Right where the silver lady was standing My heart dropped right onto my stomachA sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl Suddenly I was along for the ride as the silver ladys desires became my own in our shared headspace I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted Their car was parked twenty paces from the storeBy the time I had halved the distance between us they were pulling out And then shrapnel was everywhere I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass Truly in a daze now I staggered to my feet and wandered it felt towards the smoking ruin in front of me Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck I walked up to the passenger side window got as close as I could despite the truck and felt a warm breeze blow past me The silver lady was in the car then embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girlBlood trickled from every orifice in her head Her skull had split open from front to back stretching her face oddly and she was staring vaguely off into the distance blinking outofsync one eye and then the other A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck One moment there was a girl fighting for life and the next there was a lifesized gory mannequinI never got used to that part when life leaves the body the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drankSound returned to the world and I heard choking gurgling screams Oh my god oh god no my baby oh god no My legs went out from under me I sat down hard on pavement kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb The silver lady was crying againI dont know how long I sat there but the next thing I knew the street was lit up with red and blue lights The din of sirens was crashing through my skull I was nearest the crash when it happened and so I had to give a statement I must have done well enough at it because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone My dad was there in ten minutes flatI stared out the window blankly all the way home held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady Dad tried to get me to speak several times but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks I curled up inside myself and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest I fled into it covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver ladys loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark I breathed deep and opened my eyes My gaze was drawn down to my own body My skin had taken on a silverwhite glow and an opalescence like polished marbleI glanced over at my dad wondering if he was seeing this My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark sicklyhued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morningSarah Sarah what is it he asked seeing my face tight with shock and alarm His voice was jarring I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it But I couldnt respond I was busily looking around at the world which had taken on an alien cast The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive I could see the air itself buzzing with activityThis is the true world I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own We seem to have  merged I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time So much suffering so much death I was a failure For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the oceanI was being shaken My mouth tasted of ozone Dad had stopped the car and I realized I was doubled over and screaming Dad was near hysterics trying to get a response from me My voice shaky and otherworldly inside my skull said Sick  stomach Home Please take me homeThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart

AssassinCorgi,17,10,1rp1g1,15, I suppose I should start by saying that I am not the one with RLS or Restless Leg Syndrome but in fact my boyfriend He has had it since he was young and his parents found out one night when he decided to slip into bed with them after not being able to sleepWhat happens is that he cant control his leg and he is completely unaware of it even happeningI cant speak for other people of what theirs is like for those who have it but what he does is while laying on his stomach his knee will prompt his foot to go straight in the air and then his leg will go limp and it will fall hard onto the bed Almost as if kicking itOne night when we were sleeping together in a dorm room I woke up to him constantly raising his leg and then letting it drop onto the bed I thought he was trying to get my attention Hey cut it out I half whispered half groaned But the sound and feeling of his dead weight foot lifting under the sheets and then falling continuedShifffff PLUNKShiffffPLUNKJosh Cut it out I started to shake him gently it was kind of freaky I had never slept with anyone until him and I was a pretty light sleeper ShiffffPLUNKI shook him a little harder this time Hey Cut it out Im trying to sleepHe turned over to me groggily and asked whatYou keptkicking in your sleep I showed him what he was doing and he explained it to me that it was RLS and that he usually didnt do it unless he had a lot on his mind or was stressed out Another habit he has is talking in his sleep Which can either be absolutely hilarious or truly terrifying There is never a middle groundAn example would be the fact he asked me did you find the egg to which I responded with what egg and received the reply of the dinosaur egg we have to put it under the floor so it can hatchI have no way of coming up with something that absurd off the top of my head this was a genuine conversation we had while he was asleep I enjoy responding because I never know what Im going to get Which bring us to the other sort of responses I get like one night he whispers to me do you see her See who That girl over thereWhereHe then turns over and points toward our closet and says Shes right thereUtter fear washes over me as I dare inch my vision towards the closetShes across that lakeOh thank fucking godNow I tell you all this to bring to you the particular story that happened the other day We are currently living in a trailer of our own Now when I say trailer I dont mean a nice extra wide trailer I mean a very small travel trailer Like the kind you put behind a truck to go camping in We are still getting used to all the noises and the swaying it does when the wind blows to hard The whole thing will rock at night whenever either of us turn in our sleep This particular night however has been pretty peaceful ShifffffffPLUNKUghhh I groan in my head So I let it happen a few more times to see if he will just stop on his own ShiffffPLUNKNow over the years Ive learned a trick I would place my leg on his gently to just let him know hes doing it and it brings it to his awareness without either of us having to say anything So I do just that ShiffffPLUNKWhat the crap So I snuggle closer and put my foot across his other leg But something doesnt feel right Hes on his side not his stomachShifffffPLUNKWhat what the fuck So I get close to his ear and whisper to him hey Stop kicking your legHe looks at me as we hear it againShifffffPLUNKThats not meShifffffPLUNKThis isnt funny JoshOur voices barely audibleIm not laughingShiffffffPLUNKShifffffffPLUNKShifffffffPLUNKShifffffffPLUNKShifffffffPLUNK ,1385706305.0,Restless Leg Syndrome,25,nosleep,top_week

DrakeBlackWood,3,6,1rome5,13,I wont bore you all with the details of my work that can be for another time What is important is that I have made the decision to share my case files with the general public Most of the cases Ive been involved in have revealed themselves to be distinctly ordinary or tangled up in lies hoaxes and even mental illness But there are a few instances which I continually come back to In the quiet hours of the early morning these are the facts which weigh down on me and keep me from sleep I dont know if this is just a form of self therapy I definitely could use some but perhaps some of you who are fascinated by the bizarre and are compelled like myself to discover whats truly out there beyond the humdrum world we seem to live in that you might find the following case studies of some use I know it gets said here a lot but names have been altered and all sensitive information has been redacted Please also be aware that these are my personal notes and as such are not written in story format They are for educational purposes onlyCase  The Fugavi IncidentI travelled to Somerset in the South of the country last Saturday March rd Having been contacted by a friend in the local authorities down there I was brought in to consult due to the similarities with the Whitman case Two local boys James Carney  yrs old and Donald Lewis  yrs old had stayed out later than allowed by their parents on Wednesday the th of April At approximately pm both boys found themselves on the outskirts of the town and in realising the time and worrying about how angry their parents would be with them they decided to take a short cut on the way backTo make it home as quickly as possible James suggested cutting across a large field known as The Fugavi Patch Donald was hesitant in doing so as the large patch of grass was often avoided by locals as it had picked up a reputation for being unsafe especially at night Interviews with the families of both boys neighbours and the local school headmaster revealed several secondhand accounts of alleged experiences there including strange dim lights whispering and an unpleasant smell associated with The Fugavi PatchDespite Donalds hesitancy both he and James climbed over a metal gate  feet in height and proceeded to cross the  metres of grass to the other side As both boys approached the middle of the ground James began to complain to Donald about feeling nauseous along with a warm stabbing pain in his stomach As they continued on James became increasingly disorientated and began to sweat profusely while retching and then vomiting several times Donald panicked and believing that James required medical assistance phoned for an ambulance from his mobile phone James grew delirious collapsing to the ground asking Donald several times Who is that man standing over there What does he want James pointed repeatedly to a row of tall hedges on the other side of the field lit by a nearby street light but Donald could see no oneAs they waited on the ambulance James grew frantic with fear pointing and screaming across The Fugavi Patch in the direction of the hedgerows yelling about a man walking towards them Donald tried to calm James fears by telling him that there was no one there but James screamed and thrashed around on the ground clutching his stomach in agony crying out for help Finally he lost consciousness just as the ambulance arrivedJames was rushed to hospital but was unfortunately Dead on Arrival The autopsy recorded the cause of death as being a cardiac arrest brought about by a violent allergic reaction to trace chemical waste still present in the soil from a metalworks factory which occupied the field twenty years previous I was able to contact the owner of the land a Mr Adams who was very upset about the whole ordeal as the locals blamed him for the tragic events He produced papers clearly showing that the entire area had been decontaminated and was supposedly quite safeThe death of James Carney has left the small town community shocked and traumatized but the official explanation seems to have been well accepted I cannot however dismiss the strange events surrounding the boys death The sickness and excruciating stabbing pain he experienced before collapsing the man he screamed about walking across The Fugavi Patch towards him and the horrific marks and sores on the poor boys body one in particular which stretched out across his abdomen and looked uncannily like the imprint of a human hand         If you wish to know more about my case files then please contact me HEREhttpswwwfacebookcomwelcometotheBlackwood,1385691820.0,Case  The Fugavi Incident,19,nosleep,top_week
JUVIEMAKER,8,5,1rhq9j,11,I have a nose for things No seriously all my life Ive had a very strong sense of smell and I dont mean for the average person I have an abnormally freakishly ridiculously absurd sense of smell Its been that way since I was a kid Heres a prime example when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother god rest her soul every month in Daytona Beach for the summer My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood I would always leave my Grans house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats One Saturday after a day of playing outside when kids used to play outside I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air but something wasoff There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent It was kinda tangy bitter sorta nutty just all around unpleasant Being so young I couldnt quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didnt like it Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgustGran  Whats the matter baby Come sit at the table and have a slice of cakeFive year old me I aint eating that cake it smells funnyLet me just interject for a second  Now if your family is old school like mine you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elders cooking Especially if that elder is a family member you just dont do it That is unless you want a black eye ribs broken missing teeth you get the pictureGran Girl get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of youOh geeztheres that tone You know it you know it well That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off You know that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives youre delicate childlike mind nightmares for a month or your whole life Yeah thats what I was hearing right about then But still I was adamant I would not eat that damn cake That smell It was just too potent Now you might be thinking whats the big deal Surely youve smelled worse things than that cake before which is very true At that point in my life Id smelled worse things before WAY WORSE but Id never been subjected to eat those things either Also the stench of that pastryit was just so very not right I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong and that cake was definitely wrong Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throatGran Come over here and take this plate nowOkay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble Even if my grandmother didnt kill me I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify With every step she took it grew more and more intense Girl you better take this cake she yelled holding the plate out in front of her I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away No I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip I dont want the cake granny but my pleas of desperation came to no avail My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm Suddenly she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction tilting my face towards hers She looked down at me with an awful glare Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Grans wrinkled sockets Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before You will eat this cake She shouted through gritted teeth Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece I had never seen this side to my Gran before My once sweet devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes I had never known terror like this My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade But you know what There was something else I was more fearful of Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devillike grandmother there was still something more bloodcurdling more utterly terrifying than herthat fucking cake NO echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman Her arms flew in the air letting me go in the same instance and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenlyCRACKThe sound of my grandmothers head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that I bent down and looked into Grans half opened eyes They werent black any more Theyd gone back to their normal brown again Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red To make a long story short the police were eventually called My Grans weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it Needless to say there were lots of screams Oh and youre probably wondering what that smell was right I actually didnt find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was I was pouring it into my foster parents coffee one morning when it finally hit meCyanide From the smell of it Gran probably couldnt have used too much either Maybe half a teaspoon give or take totally undetectable to the average persons nosebut not to mine So thats what that was go figure  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs My foster parents passed away later on that day I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really dont  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me Was it because of what Id done to Oscar her cute little Maltese I mean if Id known the oven wasnt a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently I was only two at the time Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommythat really was unfortunate I didnt want to hurt her but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed But anyways thats neither here nor there Im an adult now and those days are long behind me Im actually on my way to my boyfriendsexcuse meexboyfriends apartment right now Im visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with And guess what They just had a baby isnt that the sweetest thing  ,1385470521.0,A nose for things,16,nosleep,top_week
FUCK,12,4,1rhjmk,12,So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared I mean thats how I even know about this subreddit because I like reading it And thats one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the  year old son was the one who had it happen the most I went through every scenario I could think on the way there Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children The son was as I said earlier  and the girl was  they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such I took a note about it but didnt dwell on it that much We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV Point of view cameras strapped on and started our investigation My Uncle took the upstairs our colleague took the first floor And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walkytalky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely  plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness It answered backMy instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly You know who I am I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here It chuckled again before I heard a small sound Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message My uncle did that a lot he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out I also saw a candle and a small match book and thats when it hit me My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head This was a three kings set up I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice My voice whisper right into my ear  Do you know who I am now I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened I just held out my camera to him and he took it Before he watched it he asked me why I didnt call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did He looked at our colleague before watching the recording After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in and it was as I thought It was a set up for  The three kings I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was He didnt so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket  and it has been used recently The bucket was full of water  My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation We went back home and I have decided to type this up Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house  I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them ,1385460233.0,What have these people done,16,nosleep,top_week

Marksman,4,6,1rftnd,10,Have you ever looked in a mirror and you were a little off put by your expression Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you is youI walked beside my friend and as we walked we talked I cant remember what we talked about but all I remember is this bland superficial conversation about nothing in particular Conversations like these bothered me they didnt seem real to me just like sounds verbal things that hold no real meaning And as I thought about our conversation I wanted to make it more real for me to give our little talk some depth and just before I asked her a meaningful question I tripped I startled awake rubbed my eyes glanced at the clock but the time didnt register in my head I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom I shuffled over dragging my feet to be sure I didnt trip or stub my toe flicked on the lights squinting from the brightness relieved myself and turned on the faucet I ran my hands under the cool water threw some water on my face picked up the towel and wiped my face off As my eyes adjusted to the light I looked at myself in the mirror and my reflection was smiling at meI considered that I may have been dreaming or hallucinating but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more hoping I was still just a bit drowsy But nothing changed I looked at myself and was quite curious I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling It certainly didnt feel like it Normally this would creep the hell out of me I would on any other occasion scream or run away but I just stared at the reflection looking into my eyes as if they werent mine A genuine happiness I havent felt that way in far too long I felt calm But suddenly as though something dropped to the ground the feeling of calm had broken like a shattering vase a feeling welled up inside me A tightness in my chestLike someone had just punched me it was one of a gurgling frustration I would be happy if it werent for this stupid house things are constantly broken and this wretched family it all torments me every day of my life Thats when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier Because I said so the words resonated in my mind I could feel my teeth gritting the sound made my skin crawl but the reflection just kept smiling backtaunting me The shrill sound of my mothers voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my earI shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there I peered over at the clock and looked at the time    Its lateI couldnt possibly sleep now I was simply too stressed I had school tomorrow but I had to deal with thisLet me sleep I muttered half to myself half to the voices and that face in the mirror This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions and just was a still image of myself smiling I became angry at this point What is wrong with you I said to it hoping it would stop Just go the hell away I growled through my teeth Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger No Its mouth didnt form the words but the sound just streamed out of it The ringing got louder and louder I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing Then it all just stopped Was it over I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life It started laughing a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice But it was a sound I had never made before a sound like true laughter this was new to me It bothered me I was envious Why cant I experience that kind of happiness He bothered meI had enough The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling STOP I yelled as I punched the mirror the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand I could feel them scaping at the bone The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm I stared at my hand It didnt hurt but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards It still smiled IT STILL SMILED NO I slammed my hand against the counter the blood spilled all over the room on my shirt and faceAnd so it happened Blake had snappedthough In his own mind he was trappedBroken and confused he wanted to dieBut all he could do was simply cryThe lights flicked off his mother shrieked in the other roomscared as though she could feel her impending doomHis father had been up all night drinkingWhile Blake was pondering and thinkingThe sound of the window outside smashingrang in his mind terrifying echoed the crashingNOW OF ALL TIMES Blake shouted furiouslyWe enter Blakes house to a horrid scenethe smell of blood nothing was cleanThe sanctity of his mind and house violatedwith adrenaline and fear his pupils dilatedSprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a toola knife very sharp for he was no foolNot afraid to risk his life with nothing to live forThis life And the criminal he did abhorCreeping through the house to find the thiefHe heard a loud scream though very briefIn his parents room he finds the two mangled corpses the floor already soaked in blood His parents had been completely mutilated each had been stabbed numerous times now slumped on the floor eyes still open A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents hunched over with a bloody knife in hand the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window His skin fair and pale his face was itself a conundrum it was an inexplicable quality His face looked off Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder His fingers were skinny the joints looked massive in comparison He looked almost inhuman but he was unmistakably a man Awkward echoed in my mind perhaps for lack of a better word as he edged toward meYou didnt I said to himYoure welcome I stated in a soft warm voiceto Blake who accepted my words without much choiceI followed him back to the kitchen as he put the knife downThe blood dripped from his hair as heavy as a crown Its done its over He quietly muttered to himselfWe can sleep now He put the knife on the shelfI climbed back out the window never there was a messas Blake walked he had no more stressHis house unviolated but his mind still taintedto this new life he will never be acquaintedMy wits came back to me Cold blood streamed down my arms I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror the counter was a mess Between the cracks I see my face depressed Sad to the point of a complete bleak The frown That was more like it That makes more sense to me no longer that disgusting smile I saw a tear on his face It was of blood Feeling around on my face I felt a drop of blood Blood on my face Then I felt something that I did not expect A smile My mind twisted Reality as I knew it broken demented distorted I looked again at my hand The shards of glass still glistened in the light even covered in blood I saw a piece of bone fractured I glanced again at the clock  When did that happen I said as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel mannerFor a moment dead silenceMOM DAD I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room There they lay Bloody and mangled bodies multiple stab wounds on both of them in the torso the chest the legs the knees even the faceI hugged them soaked in their still warm blood Yelling at the top of my lungs IM SO SORRY IM SO SORRY Like a pin dropping the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this wasBut only one thought reverberated in my mind This is going to totally ruin my day After about  minutes the blood grew cold and the corpses began feeling rather stale I walked around their room looking for my next days lunch money and as I was walking out I slipped in a pool of blood With a loud crash I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time I silently muttered to myselfDammit now I need to get some new clothesI began pacing toward my room taking off my shirt frustrated by this inconvenience I threw it on the floor and it made a sloshing sound Maybe I can wash it My mother had done my wash up until now I took a shower and put on some new clothes Clean at last I walked back into my parents room I stared a little while Maybe  or  hours It was so Peaceful This shouldve happened a long time agoWhen I remembered that it was time for bed I began laughing Laughing as I never had before in my life Overjoyed More genuine than any laugh I have ever had Time for bed I dont have a bedtime anymore No one to yell at me No one to tear my mind apart I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room Oh time for school I said with a grin on my faceBut without my parents here to test me this was no raceMe This house was now my place Im here to stay for I had left quite a trace,1385409532.0,Reflection,16,nosleep,top_week

Dectrek,2,5,1rbx7r,11,All my life I have never believed in luck Its just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or selfabsorbed people saying Arent I the greatest I just won  off the lottery Im so lucky or Can you believe that he just won  grand off the lottery that son of a gun Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesnt mean that I gamble Oh I gamble alright I gamble until Im rich and drunk at the same time Ive been to Vegas with my friends Ron Jerry and Max a ton of times and they always say Wow Rob youre so lucky and Ill either ignore them or Ill be too drunk to hear them I was addict when it came to gambling but one night that all changedIt was another Vegas trip with the guys I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a business trip and they had completely bought it I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight we were going to live like there was no tomorrow I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore I started to black out so we went to the streetsNow the next events were blurry and I dont remember all of it I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink and thats when every turned blackThis is when it happened First everything was dark and I couldnt feel anything but then I heard voices They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me cheering as if it was a football game Then the lights went upI was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on I was laying a colorful wheel something you would see on the wheel of fortune and I couldnt get up Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about  yards from where I was laying A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphoneLadies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome too our next contestant Rob JohnsonThe crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin slowly at first but it gained speed quickly I was beginning to feel sick when I heard Jerry press the button when youre ready and the wheel began to slow down As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell Lets see how luck our contestant is too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on The wheel stopped on the color green and the crowd screamed with joy All around the room the color green was shown with the words Bad luck on them I was deeply confused when I heard Well it looks like Rob wasnt too lucky stay tuned for our next contestant too which I blacked outI woke up at the hotel in bed where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley too which I replied that I just had had one too many drinks They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my lossesMy count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had  points on the table He had thrown  aces kings queens jacks  and so on and so until  to which he had only thrown three I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table and what I saw I couldnt believe He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my moneyI ran to the atm and took  dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was It was always a card that made me go over  I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost My bank account was swept clean that night all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hoursRon Jerry and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldnt believe what happened that night It had been a terrible night but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleepI was back on the wheel and everything was exactly the same as the night before except I got a new color This time I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word Truth When I woke up it was the next day and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast That day my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared and I was fired The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldnt be able to pay for it That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new colorThis continued for ten days each brought a new horror such as pain or divorce to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife On the eleventh night I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone Lets give it up for Rob Johnson everyone The man yelled and the crowd went wild I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphoneNice job Mr Johnson He said The crowd loved youWhat was that I asked I demand you tell me at once what is going onOh Im sorry you must be very confused Im Chris Armstrong and I run this show You see whenever someone new comes along we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past  hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times You had  total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times You sure put a show on for the audienceSins I askedOh yes you committed theft gambling murder you name it You cheated at blackjack you became drunk you beat up a few people and you committed more theft We havent seen a suspect like you for a whileI dont remember anything like that I snapped at himThats probably because you were drunk when most of it happened Dont worry though youll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them laterThis is when a thought occurred to me he said I committed murder but I didnt remember doing or who I did it tooWait who did kill I asked suspiciously You dont know I thought it would have occurred to you by now Lets see if I can make you realize who You got into a fight with him after you left the casino You hurt him pretty bad and in your drunkenness you killed him When he came here we thought that instead of making him face the wheel why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usualThats when I remembered him saying Push the button when youre ready Jerry and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjackI killed Jerry I asked in horror but then a new though came into my mind Wait if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel then does that mean ImYes you are dead Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley The past  days have been a simulation Mr Johnson welcome to HellLucky me,1385266824.0,Lucky Me,16,nosleep,top_week

SpudzOCD,6,6,1rgcw5,10,Hey redditors im new at this so excuse my writing skillsAll through my life ive had things happen that i just couldnt explain ive told a couple of friends but even they dont know what to sayMy story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house i lived in a room with my two brothers kyle  at the time and Dylan and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room The first incident occurred after about a year in the house our street was built on a graveyard and happenned in our room it was an ordinary day before it happenned woke up ate breakfast went to school nothing out of the ordinary however when i came home from school that day there was something odd about the house I couldnt quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong But being a kid at the time i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed After my mom turned out the lights and left the room i began to drift off to sleep after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound kind of like if you dropped a frying pan i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed I looked over to Dylans bed at the other side of the room he ws still asleep I began to question if i had actually heard it at all feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake we had a bunkbed Kyle was on top as i was climbing the four step ladder i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground waking up Kylewhat are you doing he saidi heard a noise so i wanted to see ifsshh he stopped me mid sentance and focused his gaze to the back of the room The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan who was still asleep But this figure was definately not human It was at least  feet tall its head was overpoweringly large compared to its beyond anorexic body Its fingers were  inches long minimum From what i saw it wore nothing but it very well could have as it was late at night and i was still half asleep Then the image that will haunt me forever It whatever it was turned towards me and Kyle It just stood there staring at us for what felt like forever it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real I looked at him and back to Dylans bed whatever it as when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylans bed I looked back towards Kyle who was already asleep again and decided to go back to sleep myself not knowing if what wed seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or notWhen i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if theyd seen or heard anything last nightthey didnt So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladderTo this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that nightMy second experience was only four or five years ago a couple of months after moving to Australia We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not it was a pretty average day when it happennedI was  and I was once again in bed at the time I was sharing a room with Dylan  at the time Kyle  was in a room across the hallway Jenny  was the next door down and my parents room was at the end of the hallway It was about  at night and we were all just about asleep My mom and stepfather at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise so it ws just us kids I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed so i opened the door to check I headed towards the kitchen once i reached the living room about halfway to kitchen from my room i could see into the kitchen i slowly emerged from the wall no one thereweird i thought so i headed back to my room but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife I jumped quicker than id ever jumped before Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed I did the same without the laughing I was back in my room now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen I called outKyle go to bed idioti am you fuckwit he said as he emerged from his room half asleepwell then whos upstairs i askedIts probably just a possum in the attic or something dont worryI regretfully closed the door and went back to bed But as soon as i did loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway along with heavy thumping on the walls they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was i shit you not the same tall black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago I practically shat myself It stood there for a couple of seconds but if felts like hours then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room I dont know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room nothing there it vanished again I dropped to the ground in shock just as Kyle open his door and screamed WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT Its back i saidWhats backthe thing i saw hunched over DylanI stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to AustraliaMy most recent encounter with our old friend was last year Wed moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things Wed been living there for about  months and my friend from primary school Jordan was now living in the complex too It was around PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house I was playing my ipod at the time Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan who surprisingly caught it and returned fire but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force We all just stood there speechless not knowing if that had really just happened Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to doThat night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed i was making a late night snack Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs same height same scrawniness same long fingers only this time it was a little misty like a shadow and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairsI am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is all i know is that my mother has become a clairevoyantI know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed the figureFor the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see himher again i will not hesitate to report the time date and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of itfor now redditors i bid you farewellEDITUPDATE Ok im rushing this so pardon my writing I was hanging out with Jordan and Kyle during the week and decided to mess with an aboandoned house in the complex Kyle and our friend who will be called W were being the little shits that they are and started knocking on the door of the supposedly haunted house they knocked once nothing they tried again still nothing Then kyle rang the doorbell a couple of timessilence They were about to walk away when something started banging and smashing the door loud enough to make both me and Kyle jump it only lasted for a second or two but it was still freaky as fuck Scared shitless we left the area almost immediately about an hour or two later i was casually riding a bike through the complex Kyle and W were alking behind me there was nothing out of the ordinary when suddenlythe bike screeched to a halt and thrusted to the right about  meters like someone physically pushed with a fuck tonne of force After that i blacked out but according to Kyle W I fell off the bike and somehow ended up standing on my head for about  seconds almost like somebody was holding me upright Kyle and W ran as fast as they could towards me but as soon as they got about  meters from me i dropped to the ground It was at that point when i regained consciousness and the first thing i saw was hand marks on my legs like somebody had just squeezed them as hard as they couldi still havnt seen the figure for a while but im keeping an eye outWill update if anything else happensstay safe and have a nice sleep,1385422010.0,An old friend of mine,16,nosleep,top_week

chrispybigwood,6,11,1rpjmm,10,Im sure many of you are well aware of the famous idea that when a person is at the cusp of death they see memories of their life flash before their eyes According to those who have survived this phenomenon the flashes are slow enough for them to recognize each individual memory and evaluate it It can often lead to epiphanies where one realizes the morality of their life as good or evil and decides to change itIn my youth I was known to dream infrequently and had trouble keeping tabs on my dream journal in my psychology class The few dreams I did have were so mild of temperament and experience that I often forgot they occurred at all I realized at some point this coincided with the fact that I suffered ongoing insomnia and I often stayed up for multiple days at a time My attitude was that life was too short for sleep there were too many things to explore and appreciate to watch them pass idly by in ignorant blissThe only dream I do remember having was one that still terrifies me with every waking moment the one that sends shivers down my spine with every eyelid I see closed I remember waking up in an amorphous environment nothing was memorable except that there was just nothing there Oily shadows which ebbed and flowed in the vast infinity of this abyss before me The experience was in this first person as I looked down and saw my hands feet and body just as how it was in the real world The sheer quality of my vision and perception in this place was like that of a lucid dream mixed with all the governing laws of reality I began to walk aimlessly about hoping to find something or anything in the inky blackness that so completely enveloped me I wandered for what seemed like eternities until finally I came across a single door It was very odd because I had sat down to rest my tired legs and when I looked about again I saw it plain as day like it had always been thereSuddenly a startling clarification encroached my mind Youre not supposed to feel fatigue in a dream not supposed to feel the burden of time I felt the creeping sensation of dread crawl through every fiber of my being as I thought to myself I may never make it out of here or at least not the same What was this place I thought Was it purgatory hell heaven something in between Was I even still dreaming Was this a just punishment for my actions or was this where I must prove myself in some unknown test of character Time would have driven me insane had I not again had the fortune to bring the door into my gaze again Where had it come from What was its purpose Should I enter So many variables to a single constant element in this placeThankfully I had the luxury of time to ponder my decision I decided if I waited long enough I would wake up back in my old familiar house in my old familiar bed and I would wake up safe I felt instead of the previous awe and mystique I saw in the flowing shadows a sense of imminent danger about them I felt there to be an element of malice of hate in there as though it consumed them They were everywhere and there was only one of me Panicked I ran towards the door and thrust it open with all my might leading with my shoulderI was very confused when I arrived on the other side I saw the same overwhelming darkness and looked behind me to find the door so I might escape again It was gone however and I was right back where I started again Alone hungry tired thirsty and altogether desperate I felt myself getting weaker as my will slowly ebbed away as if it was absorbed by this damned oblivion Right then is when I saw itLike a mirage I didnt know if my eyes truly saw it but far in the distance beyond the haze of shadows was a vaguely manshaped figure I called out to it I waved at it each eccentric motion more exacerbated than the last Eventually I ran to it until it got close and then I saw just exactly what this figure was It was meMy view was from behind but I still knew the exact same head of hair the exact same body type the exact same length of the arms and legs the exact same musculature as my own I stopped dead in my tracks and froze every nerve in my body He looked around and stared me dead in the eye and a look of the most honest and real shock I have ever seen swept over his face His jaw gaped wide open his eyes larger than a sinkhole and his eyes locked mine for the briefest of moments And then he ranHe ran away from me with all the speed of a bat out of hell I pursued him but with great difficulty as I felt a pulsating pain in my chest that intensified the closer I got to him When I was just out of arms reach I felt a crushing exhaustion throughout all of my body By some miraculous feat of strength I was able to actually outrun him I wasted no time in leaping on him and tackling him to the ground I felt a shock in me that resounded with more force than if I had been hit with a thunderclap Time seemed to slow as we both fell to the ground and collapsed into it The last thing I saw was his faceI only glimpsed it before I woke up but what I saw haunts my every waking moment His flesh was already cold colder than even dry ice to the touch His skin was pale beyond pale and closer to being an unnatural shade of white unbeknownst to human vision His eyes stared lifelessly dead blank expressionless in no particular direction yet I felt as though they peered into my very soul His lips were crimson red the exact color of the very blood that runs in my veins I saw this and I FELT like a part of me had died when he didI woke up in my bed and threw myself into an upright position upon doing so I looked around the room and made absolutely sure everything was as it should be before letting my resolute guard down It was then that I felt the same overwhelming sense of fatigue and exhaustion I had felt in my dream I was starving and insatiably thirsty Moving any part of my body was met instantly with excruciating pain I looked at my clock to see if it was morning and it read  Satisfied I moved downstairs and cooked a savory meal of bacon and eggs and carried on my day as if nothing had happened until I looked at the messages on my answering machineThere were hundreds of them so many that the answering machine had deleted some of the old ones One was from work informing me that they had fired me from the company after three consecutive no callno shows on the job Another was from my parents wondering if I had got their package requesting that I call them back upon receiving it One was a startled message from my girlfriend wondering if anything was wrong as I missed our date and hadnt communicated with her in three days I listened to all of them and became more and more confused about the situationI looked at the calender to confirm my suspicions and they were proven to be true The current date was indeed three days from when I had fallen asleep before that terrible dream My mind was fucked This meant that not only was it the most realistic and coincidentally the only dream I remembered having but it took place in real time simultaneous to REAL life The fact raised the question though was I suffering from the exhaustion because the dream was real Was the man I killed a version of me in another dimension or universe Was the life I was living now even real Or was I just another version of him in that universe a mystery to be uncovered or a shocking discoveryThoughts raced through my mind as I simply stood there contemplating everything I had ever come to know and understand Should I be alive whats waiting there on the otherside is death really the endThis last question burned and lingered in my mind and I couldnt erase it no matter how hard and fruitlessly I tried It consumed me to the point where I had to kill myself to find out for sure I walked slowly deliberately and with a definite purpose over to the knife rack in the kitchen and picked out the large serrated butcher knife from it I placed it in my hand and envied the feel of the cold steel against my rough calloused palms The feel of the handle and the power to decide life and death at my fingertips I raised it ever so smoothly in the air and placed the blade right against my throat A smile creased my face as I took a deep breath and prepared for the unknownSuddenly in a flash he appeared before me and alarmed me to such a degree where I dropped the knife where it clattered earpiercingly on the floor The silence in that room was absolute and his presence so dominating that the only thing my eyes could focus on were him This was an impossibility though wasnt he dead Hadnt I felt his life force cease to be just as I felt the connection between us cease How is any of this making sense how could any of this happen in real lifeHe stood there solemn and unwavering in his posture His face showed not the slightest trace of emotion as he raised an outstretched arm and pointed a long finger in my direction His voice was calm yet boomed in the deafening silence He said four simple words which chilled my bones more than the dream ever could Four simple words that confirmed my worst fears and suspicions which lurked at the bottom of my subconscious mind He said simply Was I not enoughHe vanished after that He didnt fade from existence or blink into nothingness he simply vanished One moment I was looking right at him and the next he was gone I couldnt believe anything that had happened this had to be a nightmare I pinched myself I cut myself to see if I still bled I screamed I clawed at the walls I begged a merciful God in pity to not let this be real Eventually I conceded defeat and laid on the floor with eyes transfixed on the ceiling and closed my eyes But this time I never woke up,1385733288.0,Evasion of a

buttootz,4,8,1rl0m6,10,Im not entirely sure if this is where this belongs but I dont know where else to put it Last night I had the scariest experience of my life it was extremely surreal It begins with me falling asleep as most of this is a dreamIn my dream I was a little not myself just a little girl Ive never seen I was living in a subdivision with my mother but she constantly hid from the neighbors she would go out in public but no one would ever notice her One afternoon my mom was getting home and the neighbors children were in their back yard which butted up to ours playing kickball Eventually the ball ended up in our yard when one of the little girls came into the backyard to get her ball my mom ran outback to greet her Think I can make the ball into that trash can over there She pointed over to a trash can on the complete opposite side of the yard the little girl just giggled and encouraged her to try She kicked the ball and it appeared to be going nowhere near the trash can All of a sudden the ball bounce off a tree and slowly balance along the telephone wire and went straight into the trash can upon impact the trash can ignited in flames The little girl stood frozen watching the trash can burn and just as slowly as ever a trail of fire began leading towards the little girl who stood frozen in fear The fire caught the little girl and completely turned her body to ash from her feet all the way to her neck leaving just a smokey charred head I ran over to her and as I was running towards her parents realized she was missing and came looking for her upon seeing her they were obviously devastated and they called the cops The cops came over and questioned my mom The whole time I just stood there and watched her lie to the cops telling them she had no idea how it happened I couldnt tell the cops what happened because I was scared of what she might do to me The next thing I know were in the grocery store I remember being in the produce aisle and there was a bigger guy with us All of a sudden this guy had me bent over a sink gagging me with his hand of mushed up fruit The whole time he was chanting some kind of verse I remember feeling so weak sick and helpless He just kept trying to stuff his whole arm down my throat like he was trying to climb inside me I kept fighting him periodically he would stop forcing his arm down my throat only to ask me if I was ready to commit I had no clue what he was talking about After what seemed like hours of this happening I just took his hand and shoved it down my throat I just gave in I couldnt handle it anymore I woke up in his body and he was in mine I was just drained I couldnt focus I didnt know what was going on He was carrying me and asking himself what he should with my corpse because he thought I was dead When he realized that I was still alive he set me down and wiped all the fruit and vomit off my mouth kissed me and walked off leaving me to die When I woke up I could taste the vomit in my mouth I looked to the clock at it was  am I did not feel right something was off I got up and went into my parents room to tell them what happened because I was so freaked out While I was explaining the dream I felt something running down my leg when I looked it was blood I was bleeding and it ran all the down to my ankles,1385573248.0,Demonic Dream,18,nosleep,top_week

SprightlyMonkey,2,9,1r98ph,7,Most people no matter what their age cant really remember many things before the age of  barely anyone can remember most of their life before the age of  I know that my earliest living memory was when I was  when my younger brother was born Its odd that after it all of all the things I couldve remembered its that which is stuck in my mind When after it all I was left with but a notepad with three notes A URL an address and some jottings And thus I take it upon myself to inform you of all that Ive learned in these past few hoursI dont really know who I am any more Im a tall gangly male with long black hair and the only name I have to go on is the pseudonym Im using to convey this message I know that once I was interested in psychology and philosophy These things mixed together to form a fondness for one thing in particular I slowly became obsessed with working out how memories worked why we had them and how they formed Of course you have the scientific answers but thinking back they dont really provide you with much explanation Very very few people if any can remember their birth perhaps the single most important events of your entire life and barely anyone can remember it Dont you think it odd that whilst we remember inconsequential things like our first tooth falling out or how you grazed your knee when falling off your bike you cant remember being born People will put it down to a theory called Childhood Amnesia where adults find it difficult to recall early memories as children havent got fully developed limbic systems But how come there are exceptions to this ruleOf course the answer is I dont know Or more rather as horribly ironic as it is I forgot I know that I did research this I did a load of it In as much detail as I could It was a personal project of mine one I know Id been working on for a long time Again God knows how long I forgot that too It all feels like an eternity ago now considering Ive forgotten it all I suppose that its my own fault considering I brought myself into this I went perusing into areas one shouldve left untouched as far as this transcript can tell me And that has landed me deeper in whatever mire I find myself in than I can assume most others ever have And that scares me Not because I fear for my life definitely not I am literally nothing now with nothing to my name but this notebook and what I am writing here I suppose you want to know what the jottings are Well theyre in two parts The first parts are like stage directions with little annotations in handwriting I can only assume is my own describing the setting presumably so I can find my way back there The second part is a statement A saying or a speech or something So without further ado I shall do my best to relay this scriptI am sat at a bench at my local green Its a cold dark winters evening with heavy air hanging over me Across from me stands a man who is much better equipped for the cold than I Hes wearing a large overcoat with the collar rolled up around his cheeks and a small hat stuck atop his presumably bald head He looks about  the only reason I can tell being the soft amber hue from his cigarette betraying his wrinkles lined with a rushed stubble with awkward tufts slightly bushier than the rest The wisps keep rising up and obscuring my view of his glassy eyes If I didnt know any better I wouldve said he had been crying but thats silly He stands a good inch or so higher than me and makes an effort not to slouch Whenever he speaks to me he addresses me very carefully and politely referring to me as Sir or Mister and making sure to annunciate every syllable as if a single mistake would betray him This makes his speech slow but not staggered he has no difficulty in speaking properly but he is deliberately taking care He isnt particularly stocky but nor is he lanky Hes a perfect medium Hes addressing me gesturing for me to approach him Hes ushering me on now waving his hand as if to say for me to fall in behind him I do so Hes leading me to a flat the address is written here but for your protection I shant be putting it in until I can confirm its safety Its very well kept  rooms All doors are shutHes gone into the room straight ahead of the sofa Im sat on shutting the door behind him Im not sure how but I dont think he noticed thisThis next part is not in the same handwriting as above Its very intricate certainly whoever wrote it took their time There are however mistakes Very obvious mistakes but I cannot figure out what theyre for I think that that may be why I am writing to you now to see if you can assist meDearest Curious Inquirer It is my solEmn duty to regretfully inform you that you have gone far enough in your scour for the true workings of the human mind It is a sincere wasTe of a life lived too litTle for me to have to extingUish but you leave me with no other option You simply have discovered toO much The real worry that I have is that I may have intervened far too late However there is no use in dwelling upon these mistakes They are mine and mine alone I was charged with the protection of your Blood and that is a duty which I can onLy suffer for so long Our exIstence is insufferable at times I can only imagine how yours must be liVing without such core memories so many thIngs that you must hold so dearly important Of courSe you meaning you alone Everyone else is too ignorant to go out and look for that which has been taken from them Theyre Content with the answers theyre provided with acting as if there isnt exemption to the socalled rules One shoe it would appear does not fIt all I truly wish I could reward your innovation I honestly do In as many years I have desired a chase such as this Something I can truly be proud of If you remember one thing which is highly unlikely I want it to be that your childhood is something you have to keep Once its lost its lostThe infinite possibilities of a childs mind is often labelled as immature but tell me can an adult construct a story from but a pen paper and some squiggles Do we consider men like Picasso to be immature and simpleminded How can something so infinite and yet so delicate be incomplete You mislabel it as immaturity when in fact childlike wonder is a blessing A blessing lost to age because it no longer suits you It doesnt fit the world youre entering That is why you are stripped of it We act simply as you askYou brought your lack of memory upon yourself Persist in finding it at your own perilYour SaviourIf you can find any information on

JustAnotherLondoner,1,11,1r8zg3,8,Last year my brother Liam fell ill and took himself to hospital He wasnt insanely ill but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be After an examination he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone He told me that the first night he couldnt sleep The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony He didnt know what was wrong with him but it was too late for a nice chat so he remained silent The second night wasnt much different but Liam managed to sleep for a few hours from about am until around am He hadnt faint for a while and felt he was getting a lot better hoping that he would be able to go home soonLater that day the man in the bed next to him awoke Hi Im Jim He introduced himself What are you in for My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things and asked why Jim was hereWell He began I dont really know I was only in here for a broken leg initially Then I fell ill I think theyre keeping me hereWhat How Liam asked When I was close to recovery I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home Later that night I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed She didnt see me but I noticed that my leg felt funny I think she did something to it I dont know what but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia This was nearly a week ago and im still here not getting much better Dont tell them when youre ready to go home just go His face was dead serious Liam was a bit worried about Jims story but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses He ignored Jims advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked awayWell Good luck Jim sighed I hope they let you out Thanks Liam replied The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day That night Liam had another restless night Jim was groaning again but Liam was beginning to grow used to that Suddenly the groaning stopped The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of JimAARGHH STOP GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME FUCK OFF the curtain was closed around him Liam couldnt see what was going on He was too scared to speak The curtain swiped open Liam pretended to be asleep his eyes slightly open He saw a nurse leave Jims bed Jim was laying in his bed holding his legs AAre you okay Liam whispered What the fuck just happened I told you man The nurses are keeping me here They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again Im not getting out of here any time soon Jim replied He revealed his leg to Liam  there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it He had indeed been injected with something Liam laid down in shock Jim decided that now the attack was over it was safe to sleep When Liam awoke the following morning Jim was gone Liam asked a nurse where Jim was and the nurse apologetically replied Mr Morris passed away late last night How could that be He was well enough to hold a conversation with Liam just hours earlier to his apparent death The injection It must have been the injection I visited Liam later that day and he told me of the events He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day He was desperate He was not in safe hands there after all I tried to sign him out but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared I reluctantly agreed I visited again the next day and Liam was in a terrible state He was pale his face was sweaty He even had a temperature he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him Liam told me otherwise They attacked me Kate Thats the only way i can describe it I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in She rolled me over and prepared my leg for an injection You know what they do they wipe it with some sort of liquid I startled her when I asked her what she was doing She told me it was just procedure I asked her to stop and said that id rather not have the treatment She got aggressive Called another nurse One held me down while she injected me I screamed but nobody came Now all of a sudden Im ill Im not getting out of here Kate Im going to die in this bed Just like Jim He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him He was soaked with sweat I asked his doctor what was wrong with him and the doctor told me it was pneumonia My heart sunk It was just like Jim Liam was right  he wasnt safe here I needed to get him out Ill be back tomorrow to get you out of here I told Liam They wont let me today and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out theyre all watching me I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor Tomorrow I can do it quietly when im not being watched so closely Liam agreed The following day I returned to the hospital Liam told me the nurse had not returned that night I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk stating that he had asked me to take them home for him The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word We escaped and I took him home Before leaving we slyly stole the sign out clip board and Liam was able to sign it He was legally free Three days later Liam was found dead in his apartment The pneumonia had gotten worse and without treatment took his life He left a note It read I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection I left without said ear infection but with bigger problems I was abused I have made a realization either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down or they are ways to make medicine companies money After all they make money through our illness  they dont really want us to recover I would not advise anyone who is not dying to stay in a hospital  definitely not alone There you will never

iamphiip,6,5,1rq1mr,14,I met Chris the summer before high school when his parents moved to town and our mothers became good friends Over time we became friends good friends and then best friends We remained close throughout high school but then he moved to Florida to work with his father and I joined the Army We still stayed in touch but a couple years went by before we saw each other again    I was taking leave for a few weeks and decided to swing by Florida for a few days before heading back to Korea for another year Chris picked me up at the airport and we spent the drive back to his apartment catching up The most interesting conversation was when he mentioned his apartment was haunted Shortly after Chris and his dad moved into the apartment Chris felt a strange presence in his bedroom The temperature in his room would drop several degrees even when the air conditioner was off and his computer chair would swivel for no apparent reason when he was on the opposite side of the room He told me he never felt threatened but he was sure his apartment was haunted    He told me he started his own investigation He read about a technique that was supposed to facilitate communication with the ghost He took a writing pad and pencil asked a question several times out loud then cleared his mind and started writing It would be jibberish at first something along the lines of safvhagjnLGFDKsfbvaDGSLKNdjghACKK After some time words would start to form as the ghost used Chris energy to direct the motion of his hand From this technique Chris learned the ghosts name was Jeremy and that he had committed suicide in that same room about a year before Chris moved in Jeremy said he was  when he died and he was lonely    Chris was skeptical at first but when he asked around the apartment complex he discovered that a  year old named Jeremy had in fact hung himself in the same apartment about a year before Chris and his father moved in The fact that this information matched exactly to the answers on the writing pad convinced Chris that Jeremy was a real ghost and really haunted the apartment    When we arrived at Chris apartment he showed me the writing pad and then told me he was going to take me into his bedroom and introduce me to Jeremy He said he needed to introduce me because Jeremy didnt like visitors and would sometimes make them feel uncomfortable until Chris told Jeremy to dial it down because the visitor was a friend Chris and I walked into his bedroom and he said out loud Jeremy this is Dylan He is my best friend and I want you to treat him with respect and be nice to him    The rest of the day passed without incident That night Chris offered to sleep on the couch and let me sleep in his bed if I was alright with that I said it was fine I was still skeptical about the ghost and I thought it might be an interesting adventure to sleep in a haunted room I was pretty reckless back then when I was in the Army I thought I was invincible so I didnt even consider that this might be a bad idea Besides Chris introduced me and Jeremy had never acted out against Chris friends once they had been properly introduced    I decided to do a little of my own investigating after Chris went to sleep I took out the writing pad asked Jeremy if he liked me cleared my mind and started writing After a while I must have fallen asleep because I had a nightmare that I couldnt breathe In the dream it felt like my throat was full of foam and there was a huge weight pushing down on my chest My throat burned and tightened but when I brought my hands up nothing was there I struggled and kicked and clawed at my chest and neck but the burning and the inability to breathe only got worse All my strength and Army training was useless Finally I had that falling sensation and woke up  Chris woke me up He said he had been asleep until he heard me thrashing around in the bedroom He came to check on me and found me sitting up against the wall asleep with my hands around my throat When he woke me up he said I slid down the wall a couple inches as if something had been holding me up off the matress My neck was sore so I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror I had bruises around my neck in a distinct pattern It wasnt bruises from my hands it was obviously a bruise from a rope    I went back into the bedroom and Chris was staring at the writing pad He asked me what I had been doing so I told him He showed me the writing pad and he was pale Among the scribbles and random letters was something I do not remember writing It said Jeremy is ONLY best friend,1385750356.0,A ghost tried to steal my best friend,19,nosleep,top_week

frankthompson,2,6,1redk6,10,There exists for all people a point A point where the quantity of coincidences exceeds what one is willing to accept as coincidence For a skeptic this point is rather high while for the naive it might very well be one Long have I thought of myself as a skeptic particularly in regards to the paranormal A scientist by trade I never accept any evidence that is nonrepeatable Nor do I accept theories based on small numbers of events I feel the need to preface my story with this short paragraph so that when I present my experiences you understand the viewpoint at which I approached themI grew up in a small house occupied by many members of my extended family As such rare was the moment in which I was ever alone in a room Save time spent in the bathroom someone was always within line of sight College was much the same having shared a rather small suite with three other students Being alone was not a sensation I encountered until my late twenties having had to live a rather spartan life upon discovering my chosen vocation left work opportunities few and far between typically tackling this issue by living in small apartments with many other individualsI was  when I obtained my apartment My apartment no one else had any claim to the space It was a two bedroom apartment one bedroom utilized as my home office and the other for sleeping I landed a job with the CDC and even though the cost of living was higher than what I was used to in the Midwest the pay was more than enough for me to find adequate living space within my budget I was ecstatic at first but my enthusiasm rapidly dwindledThe first nights were difficult I often thought I was hearing noises within the walls and after a few days I took to leaving the television on across the hall This helped me sleep a bit but the noises continued Eventually I was content to drown them out with music at nightI had lived in places with rats in the walls and old buildings that creaked many times before but somehow this was different These werent the intermittent squeak of the floor nor the persistent chewing and skittering of a rat swarm Odd rhythms with inconsistent breaks filled the nocturnal orchestra Irregular beats consistent sounds expressed in patterns I could not follow The predictability of the music I played over it clashed heavily with the everpresent undersoundAdditionally the noises seemed to get louder the more ambient noise was present I first noted this phenomenon on a Saturday night when a rather eventful occurrence must have left the patrons at a nearby bar incredibly excited when they took to the streets at last call I was awake finishing a manuscript when their merriment took to the streets and rather than notice the commotion caused by the inebriated I first became aware of an inexplicable uptick in the level of sound coming from within my home This noise was what broke me from my concentration and only after it did so did I become aware of the people outsideI began experimenting with the sound Recording it manipulating it The volume increases linearly with the volume of other sounds based on some rough audio analysis I took to sleeping with ear plugs and silencing all other sounds in my apartment such as to appease whatever is making the noisesI presented the sound files and my analysis to a coworker in confidence after some time I had little to fear regarding questions of my insanity as I had taken some video footage as proof of the location and timing of the events He was intrigued but insisted it was most likely something mundane My theory that some sort of creature or creatures were reacting to the ambient noise levels was rapidly rejected and I felt rather silly Still something was occurring and he offered to come help me seek out the source of the noise on the following weekendWe grabbed dinner that Saturday evening and he and I retired to my apartment shortly after sunset It was a rather pleasant outing and I was fairly certain that he was interested in me beyond what I had suspected initially Still though the point of the evening was locating the source of the noise and that is what we set our minds to upon entering my apartment Or rather that is what we were planning on setting our minds to when we arrived The noise was disappointingly absentHe stayed for a few hours more however and we watched a movie When it got rather late I saw him out after agreeing to see him again outside of work I did rather enjoy his company and his presence seems to have kept the sound away I went to sleep rather giddy for what the future might hold between us and slept more soundly than I had since moving There were no sounds that nightI kept busy on Sunday barely setting foot into my apartment While the previous night was pleasant it quickly faded into memory as I went about running errands and keeping the rest of my life in order I had more energy than I knew what to do with and I meant to make the most of it I was drained by the end of the day but I had accomplished many tasks that I would otherwise have continued putting off I dined alone and went to bed early Predictably the sounds returnedThe sounds remained a constant in my life for some time and while they were present I simply put up with them Eventually the previously mentioned coworker wound up spending the night for different reasons I hadnt even thought of the sounds nor had I mentioned them to him again since that first night With him there they were again absentAfter a few more months we moved in together him and I living in my apartment When my lease ended we moved to a larger place and had been there around a year without incident This week however he left for conference that due to a few projects at work I was unable to attendThe noises began the night he left three days ago I recognized them instantly and was unable to sleep I immediately set up an audio recorder as well as my laptop recording video and sound They were louder than ever before and clearer I spent all of yesterday reviewing the recordings and analyzing the files from before comparing now and then Several aspects remained consistent between the recordings and I am certain that they are the same noise This time however I captured something different The recorder I use for work is a new one and seems to have picked up more of the sound than my laptop and other device I can understand it nowThere are voices Alien and unsettling voices as though someone taught a pack of cats to speak in disjointed sentences Snippets of conversations that make no sense frequently referring to me by name They know who I am they seem to be following me and it appears that they like me in some twisted sort of way The creatures want me to know Im not alone They dont want me to be sad they want to make sure I know theyre there that theyre watching meI slept in a hotel last night to get away from them I couldnt sleep with whatever they were nearby and hadnt slept the night before I couldnt sleep much last night either though It was almost too quiet I had to turn the TV on before I could fall asleep I went home this afternoon intent on discovering more A few samples of broken sentences was hardly enough evidence for me to base any conclusion on and I needed to shake the feeling that Ive gone crazyI borrowed a few more recorders from work and set them up around my home At least one in every room The plan was to discover where the noises were coming from based on where the voices were loudest and clearest They started shortly after dark predictably The sound files were sent to my laptop every few minutes and I compared them on the fly Consistently they are loudest in whichever room Im in or in whichever room has the highest levels of ambient noise dishwasher and microwave created this pattern The clarity however seems directly linked to my location and my location only The longer I stay in a place the better I can understand them I can hear them right now I know what theyre saying I dont have to be alone again I dont have to be alone ever I just have to let them inI dont want to be alone I guess thats why I have this hammer now I just need to let them into the house so they can be with me so we can be together The more I listen the better it sounds I can hardly remember why I even left last night why I would ever want to be aloneIm going to let them in now I need to find out what they are If I come back Ill post the audio and update If I dont well someone will find the recordings The recorders will be missed in rather short order Wish me luck At least I know someone will know what happened to me if I go missing,1385355647.0,Lonely,16,nosleep,top_week
hardupharlot,2,5,1recln,10,Medic  respond to the  block of Norwood Road cross streets of Fernhill and Walbrook Ave for the report of report of a female down covered in blood  Await police arrivalThats how my Friday morning started  AM and I havent even had any coffee yet  In hindsight it turns out that I wouldnt need coffeeI never liked that address  It was a creepy looking compound  Perhaps you want to call it a lot or a property but it was always a compound to me  Somewhere where bad things happened they were just really good at keeping them insideWe left the station and made our way  minutes west  It was on the outskirts of the city and the sirens tore through the only road leading there  As we pulled up we saw a female with black hair matted with blood and in a white gown  She was lying face down and we shouldve stayed in the medic  We were told to wait for police but during shift changethat could take forever  She could be dead by then  We strapped on gloves threw our trauma bag over our shoulder and made our way to our patient  The first thing that hit me was the twitching  She was twitching her fingers and toes  I saw the hair curled up in small concentrated spots in her hair  It wasnt until we got closer that we realized why they were curled up they were twisted by a drill bitWe rolled her over wondering what sick fuck got a hold of her but the other side was worse  She had been crushed but evenly crushed  It was as if it was done by a machine  She was flat as a piece of threequarter inch plywoodWell she was dead and there was nothing we could do about it  Injuries incompatible with life was what our protocols stated  That means that we didnt even have to try because trying was futile  We sprinted back to the medic and looked around  Nothing  We couldnt even see the patientThen it hit me  We couldnt see the patient from the road  There was nothing even slightly resembling a pedestrian around here and we couldnt see her from the roadGET IN THE UNIT  GET IN THE UNIT  My partner was wheeling and I was healing but my screams of concern werent loud enough or fast enough  He yelled and I saw something that Ill never forget coming out of those woods  They were everywhere and they were surrounding us  Their teeth were sharp they were covered in blood and they looked like some sort of hybrid between a little girl and a black hole   We ran but the only place to run was through the open gateWe hit our little red Mayday button on our radios which opened up the channel of our lapel micsMedic  signal   Medic  signal SIGNAL  SIGNAL   WE ARE UNDER DIRECT PHYSICAL ASSAULT  THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL BUTTON PRESSMedic  we are sending backup  Are you under fire how many assailantsI DONT KNOW  SEND HELPAt least Communications knows but we were forced inside  As we ran in the gate closed  This is not how I wanted to start my Friday morning,1385354891.0,Medic  Series,15,nosleep,top_week
kenandmforever,1,3,1rc5s5,7,Hey guys Longtime lurker first time posterI guess I finally have something to post about Everythings just been wrong the past few weeks I miss her so much I know this isnt a therapy subreddit or anything but I was just thinkingmaybe if I can get these thoughts out theyll stop bothering me Its just I should have been paying attention you know I should have seen something was wrong But I didnt and now shes gone and its all my faultI guess I should start at the beginning She was my first serious girlfriend  Ill call her M to protect her privacy Last thing I would want is her family finding out Im talking about this on some site for thousands to see Anyway M and I worked together at a tutoring place on campus It was my first job and I was nervous but she helped me figure everything out M was really shy  she could almost never meet my eye and her voice was superquiet  but really sweet once I coaxed her into talking I got the impression she didnt think too highly of herself whenever I tried talking to her about her major or anything shed change the subject All I really got was that she was a Bio major and she was working on some research project about some new cestoda whatever that meant But she liked hearing about me and my major  English Ive never been scienceinclined  and laughed at my jokes and everything so we had a good timeAfter our shifts were over wed go to the Subways down the street sometimes I would always offer to get her something but she always turned me down She would just watch me eat while we sat together It always made me feel kinda bad especially since she was so small it was like eating in front of an African kid or something But she never seemed to mind so I got over it We became good friendsEventually I asked her out for dinner and a movie I cant even remember what we saw  some remake horror flick about mindcontrolling carnivorous worms or something  but we had a good time We were laughing through the whole thing and she kept pointing out the impossibilities and throwing all her science knowledge around I dont want to sound weird but I found it pretty hotBut by the time we got back to the car she had stopped smiling She said she didnt feel too good like she was sick or something She said she wanted to walk back to her apartment  she lived just off campus and was really big into fitness and everything  but it was like twenty minutes away and in the middle of the night so I drove her home She got out said goodnight and that was it No kiss nothingI went home thinking I had blown it but when we had the same shift again she was really happy Kept saying shed had a great time and everything So we went out on a few more dates I let her pick what we did  she never wanted to go out to eat but she did teach me how to ice skate and we went on a few hikes even some k runs Those were the worst but it was worth it to see the way she lit up At the end of each one I kept wanting to kiss her but she was really sheepish about it Every time I went in for one shed turn her head or peck me on the cheek before I could She was always embarrassed about it and apologized but I figured she just wasnt ready she didnt seem the type to have done a lot of dating herself That was fine I wasnt going to rush her into anythingThe first time we kissed was like three weeks after we started dating  and I wont say anything but wow At this point I realized I was completely head over heels for this girl She was smart she was funny and she liked me which was different from most girls We started going steady after that  and thats when everything started changing The signs that something was wrong had been present before but they really should have become apparent afterwards God Im so stupidShe started wearing big baggy clothes to work  huge stifling sweaters that sort of thing I wondered if one of the guys at work was hitting on her or something and making her uncomfortable but they were all either huge or really friendly and I didnt want to ask She would shake sometimes too like she was cold even when she was being swallowed up by these enormous shirts Id hug her and shed lean into me but it was like I couldnt even feel her underneath the clothes She started eating a lot Like I mean a ton When we went to Subway now shed put away two footlongs like it was nothing I took her out to a few ritzy places but the portions were always too small so we would end up getting burgers or something afterwards I didnt really mind  it was nice to see that she felt comfortable enough to stuff herself around me I guess We were kissing a lot more too which was of course awesome Because of her I was into hiking and stuff now so I felt great Everything seemed perfect Maybe thats why I wasnt noticing the signsI stayed over at her place a few times as things got more serious but we never went too far She was still embarrassed about that sort of thing I think  but that was fine I could wait Her couch was still infinitely better than my dorm bed anyway and her fridge was always heaped with food  mostly meat granted but Im no vegetarian Despite all her eating though she seemed to be getting thinner Her face was paler and she was more withdrawn Sometimes she would just stare into space for half an hour at a time not saying anything only to shake herself as I touched her or called her name a few times She started calling into work sick and when I visited her she would just be curled up on her couch heaped in blankets the remnants of some sandwich or a pizza box scattered around her I started to get worried but I wasnt worried enoughOnce when we were making out for a moment I felt something more than just her tongue in my mouth The feeling didnt really leap out at me  it was just a sort of niggling sensation swallowed up by everything else that was going on  but I kinda stopped and she drew back and looked at me with curiosity I swallowed ran my tongue around my mouth a few times but decided I had just imagined it Then she asked what was wrong and something flickered in her eyesI dont mean that in a poetic Englishmajory way I mean I literally thought I saw something tiny dart through her eyeI freaked out needless to say but she was just confused She said she didnt feel anything and even when I shined a light on her eye to see for sure there was nothing there I thought I was just going a little bit crazy so she went to bed and I stayed on the couch I shouldnt have dismissed it I should have taken her to the doctor Damn it why didnt IThings got worse She stopped coming into work entirely and I began taking time off to go make sure she was okay Her staring into space was more pronounced than before as was her shaking When she got up and walked around it was disjointed like she had forgotten how to use her body And she kept asking for food all the time At first it was just sandwiches then it was hamburgers then it was just the burger itself Then once she asked if I could just give one to her rawI was taken aback disgusted but she just looked so pitiful shrinking into her bed with all her pillows and everything fluffed up around her So I did Well I cooked it a little but it was still plenty pink in the middle when I brought it to her She ate the whole thing gave me a sleepy smile and fell asleepI went back to my couch silently freaking out It was all too weird for me Id never heard of anything like this Id heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever or whatever but this was ridiculous I decided I was going to take her to the doctor the next morning whether she wanted to go or notBut when the morning came she wasnt in bed I could hear the shower running in her bathroom Frankly I was a bit surprised she could even manage to walk that far as weak as she seemed But I decided Id give her some space if she was showering maybe she was feeling betterI decided Id go and make myself a sandwich When I came back the shower was still running which was weird It had been more than thirty minutes  I had ended up making myself a second sandwich and had eaten a hot dog too I was just weirdly hungry Anyway by now I was a little concerned I had no idea how long she had been in there before I had woken up and she wasnt the kind to take really long showers anywayM I called opening the door a crack You okayNo responseMStill nothing God the sound of the water hitting her is still in my headI stepped inside The steam was almost blinding there was a window she usually opened to let most of it out but it was closed MI pulled back the curtain and there she was sprawled on the tile blood pooling around her fractured skull her eyes gazing sightlessly upwards as the rain pelted her naked body But that was not the worst part The worst part was that she looked like a skeleton I still remember those pictures of the Holocaust victims we all see in high school where they look more dead than alive that was exactly what she looked like She was so painfully thin it was a wonder she had managed to walk on her matchstick legs at all Her ribs looked like they were about to poke through her skin But her bellythat was round and full like the distended ones you see in those images of African children on the charity commercials I knelt by her but of course there was nothing I could do She was long gone She must have collapsed and hit herself on the temperature knob on the way down It didnt look as though she had struggled at all she would have died almost instantlyI stayed there for a long time just staring A few times I thought I saw her stomach move  but of course that was crazy It was just the way the water hit her Then in a daze I left I called   even though it was far past that now obviously  and explained what had happened The lady on the phone promised to send a cops and an ambulance my way immediately even though there was no needThen I sat down and made some baconI cant even really remember what happened when they arrived There were just people swarming all over my house suddenly Two big cops started asking me questions I dont really remember what I said They kept asking me why I was eating and I just kept repeating that I was hungry over and over One said I needed to go to the station with them so I didWhile I was there they wouldnt give me any food not even a bag of chips no matter how much I asked They kept asking me how I couldnt have known she was starving how I couldnt have known something was wrong over and over and over All I could say was that I didnt know Shed hidden it all from me with her huge clothes and thick blankets I kept saying if I had known I would have helped her I would have saved her Now I know she was too far gone for that of course I hadnt seen the signs in time and it was too lateEventually they let me go Later in the day someone called her apartment but I didnt pick up A doctor I think or maybe a coroner They left a message Something about her stomach It sounded important but I couldnt bring myself to listen again I wandered around her apartment for hours touching everything that had belonged to her as if it would bring her back As if I could take back her mistakes and mineShe must have had some sort of eating disorder I guess Looking back the way she acted when we first met sounds like classic anorexiabut then it must have changed into something else I dont know Maybe she was eating a lot and then throwing it up  Ive heard about that on TVSometimes I cant help but think back to her stomach how swollen it had been how deformed I have no idea what could have caused that But it doesnt really matter now does it Shes dead and its my faultIm sorry guys Theres not a whole lot else I can say The past few weeks have just been awful They kept it out of the news but somehow people keep asking me about it anyway wondering why I didnt do something why I didnt see I dont know Ive just been living in a daze since it happened like I cant feel anything at all Nothing seems right Sometimes my hands kinda jerk on their own when Im just zoning out I keep waking up in the middle of the night feeling like Im starving but I think Ive been losing weight Grief probably Ive heard it can do that to you I really dont know I just kinda wish it would endAgain Im sorry This is a lot to dump on you all but I just have to get it out Im going to post this and then lie down for awhile I think I havent gone to work in four days now Just havent felt up to it Maybe make myself a burger  that sounds good Dont think Ill cook it though My stomach seems to handle it better when its fresh,1385276326.0,Cestoda,10,nosleep,top_week

iwantout,5,7,1rm6hh,7,First of all Im not a good writer so if you want to read a good story you should probably go read something else Probably not the most exciting of stories but this is something that happened to me and I would like to share my experience for those who is willing to readI live in a apartment building by myself The building itself is a bit old maybe build around the s or the s Im guessing not many people live here since it is dead quiet most of the time or maybe everyone just quietly stays in their room I dont know but this place gives me the creeps sometimes Anyway I was coming back from work at around am I work late very tired and ready to hit the sack I open the main entrance of my apartment and began walking to my room I dont know who designed this building but it had the most confusing layout ever My room is located in the second floor but there is this dimly lit hallway that I had to go through to get to the main hallway on the second floor sorry if that doesnt make sense I was walking down the dimly lit hallway and suddenly saw something transparently come out from the wall on the left I couldnt really distinguish at first but it was really tall maybe around  It had a silhouette of a woman looking down to the ground while slowly floating to the other side of the wall where it disappeared intoI guess what I just saw was a ghost but it was nothing like I saw or heard in movies books or from other people who saw ghosts I didnt freak out or get scared like I thought I would Honestly it didnt feel any different from watching some random person who is minded their own business walk down the street It also kind of reminded me the first time I had sex In my mind the first time sex was suppose to change my world and be a mind blowing experience but in reality it was a meh experience Same kind of feeling with the first time seeing a ghost just an underwhelming experienceI dont know where exactly Im going with this story I guess the one thing Ive learned from this experience is that its probably a safe bet to assume that most ghosts dont give two shits about me or my existence on this planetThanks for reading,1385602677.0,My First Time Seeing a Ghost,14,nosleep,top_week
OneStoryHouse,2,5,1rk4cg,7,So youre sitting at home in the middle of the night reading this story Maybe around two or three AM and its raining Simple right Nothing unsettling about the rain In fact you may even like the sound of it against the tin roof of your home or maybe you dont Even so nothing is out of place or  out of the ordinary except that tapping on the glass of your window You discard it as paranoia and try to continue reading and you shift your back to the window so you can prop yourself up more comfortably You can hear the tapping behind you now Before it just sounded like some raindrops but now its definitely tapping Its growing louder as you realize that youre at home alone Your parents have left town for a week or so on a business trip and they feel youre old enough to take care of yourself The tapping grows louder as that feeling in your stomach grows The feeling that whatever is on the other side of your window knows you are awake You wont accept it Theres no way its tapping It has to be rain and then a rhythm starts tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap You keep the curtains down hoping that if something is there it will just go away But it wont Now at this point Im going to try to help you I want you to go into your dads bedroom or wherever the guns may be and pick up a basic pistol Load two bullets into the clip and walk to some kind of room and then lock the door One bullet in the clip for it and the other for you I guarantee you would rather be dead than experience what it would do to you Take a board a hammer and some nails too Once youre inside the room nail it shut Even if it opens opposite the way its supposed to the lock will still hold it for a second or so Wait for it The tapping on your window will turn into loud slams It knows you moved the window will shatter after a time and then it will come for you It will start by screeching the most horrible ear splitting squeal you will ever experience and then it will rush for the room you are in It doesnt have fingers meaning it will have to smash the door As soon as theres an opening aim for the heart or the head and fire If you miss put the gun to your head without hesitation and fire If you do manage to hit the thing just like a bad dream you will be reawoken in your bed with a jolt You will lie there going over what just happened in your mind And you will be left there to listen to the sounds of the rain,1385537071.0,The Rain,12,nosleep,top_week
echoes,5,5,1rhee9,7,Ive always been a nonreligious person I was brought up by parents who told me to question everything To not believe the crap that is forced down our throats daily But Ive always felt a whole in my life when it came to that stuff I went as far as trying LSD and DMT to achieve this religious experience we all want but I never got it So after a while I just gave up and moved on and accepted there is no God or spiritual experience or anything thats real that will make me see life in a whole new perspective Naturally this got me down and depressed a bit It was then when I started seeing  everywhere It started one night when I was doing some heavy drinking and decided to do some coke lines I remember vividly my heart stopped and I remember a sound like a blender going off in my head When I forced myself to snap out of what had happened to me I remember the first thing I looked at was the clock on the cable box It read  This stuck with me for a long long time I felt like some force or spirit was forcing me to look at the clock when it was  in the morning and  at night As if reminding me that it saved my life This was going on for a while when I went as far as Googling what it was Unfortunately the  thing was associated to some spiritual stuff things I thought were bullshit to begin with But still  was always there Slowly I stopped thinking about it and my  experiences were less and less It wasnt until last week when I was driving home I was butt sober from an event when it started raining My tires and brakes were messed up and I didnt get a chance to change them and besides it hardly ever rains in this town so this came as a surprise to me As I was driving up a hill I lost control of my car completely on the wet road and was literally fighting my steering wheel and slamming on my brakes to stop the car but I couldnt This went on for about five seconds until I finally stopped the car in the middle of the road Again when I snapped out of my panic mode the first thing I looked at was the time and it said  Im not one who believes in coincidences but this has me thinking I have some angel or spiritual entity looking after me Even though I dont believe this stuff there is NO way that could happen Has anyone else experienced  or has randomly been forced to look at a clock when its  Or is it my brain playing tricks on me because of the LSDDMT I took ,1385452126.0,,12,nosleep,top_week

schizoidvoid,2,3,1rc47v,8,Thank all of you whove been with me so far I am actually really grateful to have an audience weve been chasing the white rabbit for three days now Lets get weird shall weThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart   ConvergencehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsruhthesilverladypartconvergenceFuck that You need a hospital said my Dad as he arced the car across the road onto the shoulder and back into the opposing lane headed to the center of town I was smushed against the door and then the back of my seat as he gunned the accelerator giving the engine a run for its money and losing traction briefly in the process My heart hammered in my chest and shocks of adrenaline coursed through my body This was it I was dying My mom my sister both dead Now it was my turn Two minds swam around inside my skull like binary stars poised to collapse together They took turns rocking back and forth faster and faster each feeling the pull of the other as they battled for control of my body Faster and faster approaching singularity vibrating my perspective like an engine in a car numbing my face and fingertips Black encroached upon my vision as I drowned in fresh air and then all was darkness appendix looks alright Given her recent loss and the trauma she must have experienced witnessing the crash its likely she had a panic attack Has this happened beforeNo never I opened my eyes I inhaled Sickness and death coated the inside of my nostrils I pictured my sinuses and lungs darkening as though I was inhaling smoke from an electrical fire Yellowed fluorescence glared down at me from the ceiling Misery seeped into my pores and tugged my heart in several directions at once Someone nearby was about to die and so many were sufferingI heard beeping and someone yelled for a crash cart Right on timeI was alive and I was myself But the definition of myself had changed I felt distinctly like one person yet knew that I consisted of two beings We had fused together the silver lady and I and I was equal parts both I examined my skin its ghostly sheen A greenish corkscrewshaped worm drifted over my bed briefly silhouetted against the glow of the fluorescent lights and sighed dreamilyWell that was differentOh thank Christ youre awake my dad halfsobbed lurching toward my side and away from the doctorIm fine Dad I think I had a panic attack A small purple leechlike thing with white spots had attached itself to his face while I was talking and slurped at a tear that had just trickled past It shivered ecstatically and began purringI thought you were dying I just  it would have been too much he said brushing another tear off and inadvertently dislodging the leechkitten thing It screeched and flitted away with a farting noiseI consulted my expanded library of memories  from when I was the silver lady Strange and very hungry creatures loved to gather at hospitals They fed off the dying the vulnerable the grieving It seemed to be a drug for many of the darker things in the world I mused to myself that fire was used to keep those pests away before it was used to cook meat People were so much more in tune with reality before language let the mind shape perceptionThe doctor checked me over and kept me awhile for observation Dad and I left with a small prescription of Xanax and a referral to a local therapist I knew I wouldnt be needing either now but also that it would reassure my dad to go I couldnt think of anything I wouldnt do to make him feel better and mentally shruggedI wanted to go pick up my car but Dad would have none of it His tone told me that hed rather walk through Hell than let me out of his sight right now and I couldnt blame him We went straight home and I stared out the window in fascination A herd of giant spotted fuzzy caterpillars were crawling across the road on the way out of town wiggling phallic appendages on their backs quivering with the motion We rolled the car straight through the middle of them and several popped with a glurping sound like balloons full of soft pulpy pudding A tall lanky semitransparent humanoid was licking the red paint on a stop sign several miles later with a blue fuzzy tongue the size of my dads knobby hands It paused when we pulled up and stepped over to the car in two long strides I was slightly embarrased to notice before it stooped over that its wrinkly penis was the size of my forearm I stared into one set of its chameleonlike eyes and smiled its other eyes were flitting around and examining the car It licked the window leaving a slimy trail that lingered until we were nearly homeThe vast majority of the spiritual wildlife that hides in plain sight is harmless or mostly so I knew Extremely weird and illogical yes but for the most part its interactions with the world we know are trivial Hardly surprising that we dont see much of it considering the human desire for an orderly world was a tiny sixarmed ape just fucking my ear canal or did that song get stuck in my head on its own No no earfuckers here no sirMy dad and I were both exhausted when we reached the house I broke off to the kitchen while dad meandered to the living room I popped open the freezer looking for my jumbosized tub of neapolitan ice cream and was greeted by a tiny pixielike critter with the head of a fly It burst out of the freezer and shook its tiny segmented fist shivering hard enough to affect its flightSorry I thought at it as though I had been telepathic my whole life Which technically I suppose I had beenDamn right it thought back It shot me the middle finger and buzzed off phasing through the solid glass window and toward the treelineYeah spirits are like that sometimesI grabbed my tub of ice cream and a spoon because this was not a day for diets I marched into the living room and plopped down beside my dad who was just settling down himself He turned the television on and it was set much louder than it needed to be I jumped and so did the shadowy figure in the corner It began screaming bloody murder Shocked I mentally yelled at it to quiet down but I apparently didnt get through Dad almost immediately turned the television down but the figure only screamed louder and my ears began to hurt I silently tried to reason with it for fifteen minutes to no avail In exasperation I asked if it wanted some ice cream and to my great delight it quieted down I took the tub back into the kitchen shadow man in tow and scooped out a spoonful of icecream into a little saucer which I sat in the sink I wasnt really sure what it was going to do with frozen dessert but I didnt really care as long as it was quiet about it I grabbed my bottle of Xanax off the counter and tipped a couple into my palm because it was most definitely a day for anxiolytics I tossed them back and swallowed dry and then went back into the living room taking my tub The living silhouette stayed behindDad left the station on the news until it mentioned the crash and then he channel surfed for awhile Between the sedatives and the ice cream I wasnt paying much attention I whittled the strawberry down to almost nothing and then half of the chocolate before I realized I was really full and put the tub back up The shadow man was gone and the ice cream in the saucer had warmed and melted I mentally shrugged for the second time that day which reminded me I needed to set up the therapy appointment I grabbed the sheet of paper with the name and number on it called and scheduled an appointment The earliest they had was about two and a half weeks from then and would probably last an hour and a half and could I please come early to get the paperwork filled out I said I would and thank you very much then hung up I wrote the appointment down on the fridge calendar so I wouldnt forgetI chuckled softly to myself I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole I needed a shaman not a shrink but I doubted either one could help me and I thought back to the memories of my mothers death of the wound in the world that had taken her away from me I saw it over and over again each time the person was different and so was the setting The memories stretched back to antiquity to the times before the written word before hatred took the form of words at all I knew that specter so well To call it the devil would be misleading To call

TheCollapsed,16,5,1rmu0b,6,When I was a kid I was pretty religious I always wanted to do the right thing and I always second guessed myself on whether or not I should do something that seemed even the slightest bit wrong Because I never wanted to upset God As I got older sometime around the age of  I started to find flaws in the whole concept of God I mean think about it for a second It doesnt make a whole lot of sense Christians always degrade scientists for The Big Bang Theory They say things like Oh youre wrong or How could it just have happened with nothing to have caused it Well The Big Bang Theory makes just about as much sense as God does Where did He exactly come from You really expect me to believe that there was a spirit that comes from nothing that has been around forever Sorry Whenever I talk about things like that I always get carried away by it But I guess you could say that for a while I was agnostic I didnt deny the existence of God but I had my doubts  years ago however that changed I was  when it happened It was November th and it was around  pm I lived with my mother who had been divorced twice The first time with my father and the second time with my stepfather Anyways I lived with her and my two halfbrothers I was kind of depressed because I hadnt seen my real father in years Whereas my halfbrothers got to see their dad all the time I do understand though My father was so upset that my mother was getting remarried that he tried to hunt her down He killed  people including two police officers trying to get to her Hes in the mental institution thats about  miles away from me Anyways getting back to the point of this It was November th at around  pm I was in my room rereading Catching Fire as the movie was coming out about a week after Id gotten kind of thirsty so I was heading upstairs to get something to drink I was on my way when I realized Oh I have a can of soda in my room I went back opened up the Mountain Dew can and went back to reading I finished the book around  minutes later and Id gotten hungry I was heading upstairs when I heard some heavy footsteps Usually thats the sound I heard whenever my mother just got done arguing with one of my brothers She wouldnt be in the best mood after that would happen So I decided not to bother her I could wait to eat I wasnt terribly hungry I went back into my room and I wanted to watch the first Hunger Games movie I exited my room to go find the DVD of it I thought I left it in the downstairs living room I had assumed it was in the cabinet that you had to crouch down to get to Just then I heard what I thought was my mother coming downstairs Normal It was laundry night I didnt find the DVD though I just sat there in silence trying to figure out where it could be I started going back to my room when I heard my mother go back upstairs I slapped myself in the forehead as I realized that the DVD was in my room I put it in and started watching it It was at the main menu and I decided to get something to eat I was going upstairs to make myself a pizza Just as I got upstairs the front door shut I assumed it was my mother She was probably running out for a latenight errand I threw the pizza in the oven and waited for ten minutes The timer went off and I grabbed it out when I noticed a foul stench in the air I didnt know what it was or where it was coming from I dismissed it though and took the pizza downstairs to my room I was watching the movie and getting really into it I smiled to myself a lot during it At the time I had the biggest crush on Jennifer Lawrence I always joked with my friends that I would marry her one day I heard footsteps upstairs again Moms home I thought to myself I started getting really confused though I heard the footsteps upstairs multiply by the minute I heard multiple voices that were unfamiliar to me I paused the movie and went upstairs Jesus Christ I heard one of the voices say Who would do this I got upstairs to find about a dozen police officers in my house One of them noticed me Stop he said Dont move I stoppedWhats going on I said Wheres my mom and my brothers The officer looked into my brothers rooms The police were blocking the doorways to both my moms and my both of my brothers rooms He sighed and shook his headCome here son he said We went outside the house Whats going on I said frantically Is my family okay The officer took a long time to respond Whats your name he saidChris Sherman I repliedDo you know that man in the back of that squad car He pointed to a cop car in the driveway It took me a few seconds to realize it was my father His clothes were bloodstained and he looked almost unrecognizable No I said in a whimper tears in my eyes I knew that the blood on my fathers clothes was that of my moms and my brothers I cried in the officers arms Im sorry son the officer said There was a shakiness in his voice as well I looked back at my father and he was smiling at me It was almost a look of Ill get you next time I got confused for a moment How did he not notice me I was in my room the whole time And thats when it dawned on me As I was looking for the DVD crouched down he mustve missed me I barley missed him when I went upstairs to make the pizza I got upstairs right as he walked out of the house I later found out that a witness saw my father exit the house an ax in hand He thought I wasnt home so he started walking to my cousins house who doesnt live that far from me Thankfully the officer stopped him right before he got to the houseI was at the funeral a week later I hate funerals so fucking much People crying hysterically preachers giving bogus speeches on how we didnt come here to mourn the deaths but to celebrate the lives of these people The preacher then looked at me and saidIt is by the grace of God that this boy survived it all And it happened I started laughing I actually found it so funny that he would even say that I got up and walked out of the church chuckling to myself as I did God There is no God I just got lucky,1385624592.0,Cruel Luck,11,nosleep,top_week
Insomnniia,4,10,1rmq6o,7,Ive always been a cynic impossible to convince As long as I can remember Ive needed  proof before Id belie anything The events of the past  hours theyve changed my perception of real or true Ill start from the beginning You decide what to take from it because Ive still yet to find an understandingDetermining if one is in a dream or not can be the hardest task the mind can tackle When youre awake surreality tends to stand out like a sore thumb but its quite the opposite when asleep The comfort of a dream will cause you to overlook anything out of the ordinary  but what if theres no feeling of comfort What if you have full reign of your senses What happens when you can no longer trust the information your senses are relaying to youIt started as normal as any day Ive lived in my past  years of life I awoke in my bed checking the time on my phone A red flag rose when my eyes were able to focus on the screen The time read FE As any person would I passed it off as a software malfunction was I ever naïve I continued my morning wakeup checking my facebook on my phone getting dressed etc It wasnt until I left my room that my head started to buzzI opened the door of my bedroom Do you believe in the supernatural I dont  or at least I didnt Ive since reconsidered my standpoint I entered the room on a cautious foot  The couch the side table and the chairs were all afloat suspended in midair I slowly approached the hovering furniture My fingertips grazed the fabric of the chair the chair spun as I grazed it as if they were weightlessA heart dropped The furniture flipped upside down and abruptly slammed against the roof I stepped back feeling for the wall to guide me In the pitch black I fumbled my hands around looking for the doorknob to the bathroom  The small nightlights glow was dimmer than usual I stepped into the room slowly quietly closing the door behind me An eruption of grinding steel burst from the walls My eyes fixed on the mirror before me as it began to bleed its colour down the wall leaving behind a clear sheet of glassThe silver pigment of the mirror ran onto the floor bursting into a million tiny shards The shards moved and pulsed inching toward me Stepping back my foot met the razorsharp shards I stumbledA burning searing pain began creeping through my foot Losing balance knocked the door open I tumbled to the floor Scrambling out of the door frame I turned kicking the door to the bathroom shut Scrambling to my feet I headed for the stairs Still attempting to cradle my foot I reached the first stair of the set Something seemed off I couldnt shake the unerring feeling that something just didnt feel right I tested my first steps as if on thin ice I pressed my toes eversoslightly against the first step almost as if to test itThe step felt normal it felt sturdy I continued opening the door to the outdoorsIt was dark and damp Something about the atmosphere was off it caused the hair of my arms to stand outright I took a few steps from the house distancing myself from whatever was happening within A low resonating sound began to ring through the desolate streetNot a single car person or house light filled the nightly void No more than a few dim streetlights The noise grew louder as the ground began to vibrate My eyes scanned the darkness with haste begging for something to hide behind an immediate sense of urgency overwhelmed meMy eyes locked on a waisthigh workbench draped in a tarp Hobbling as fast I could I threw myself to the ground behind it taking pressure off my footThe sound grew louderI covered my head as if there was a threat of an explosion The sound was no longer blocked by the unlit houses on the street the sound was no longer reverberating It was directly on the other side of my shelter I cocked my neck I attempting to peer over the bench My pupils snapped to pinheads There he loomed in the dim orange streetlightMy eyes strained in the lowlight attempting to see over the cover The figure stood rigid and dark a standing shadow My scalp tensed and the hairs of my arms jut so far outright Id have sworn they were ready to escape my skin The figure moved slowly trailing a black shadow in his wakeI ducked my head once again As the rumbling of this figure began to die down I receded from my shelter Slowly making my way toward the street my eyes strained in an attempt to make our figures in the dark Carefully stepping I made my way down the driveway Something shifted to my right I frozeThe movement now became a loud rustling My head was pounding hands trembling My gaze darted back and forth as my brain racked itself in an attempt to appease my fight or flight responseA dark figure sprang from the bushes perched on all fours Its head bent towards the ground as if to sniff something My eyes scanned the figure up and down It had a human body but its head It was about this time I realized the pressure Id been putting on my injured footMy legs gaveThe figures head shot up like lightning For the first time I saw the figures face The ears were long and rugged the face reminiscent of a rabbit This thing was simply put a human with a battered rabbit head I scrambled to my feet and began sprinting down my driveway away from the creature With no set direction I ran across the street into a residential surveySkittering on all fours the figure was right behind meThe adrenaline was causing my head to buzz my legs were moving ahead of body I continued running refusing to look behind me My breathing tightened The pain in my foot had become overbearing I toppled over instantly looking behind me The figure skittered along the ground like a spider Slowing the closer it got The ripped and torn ears were menacing I scrambled backwards into the singular streetlightEverything outside the light grew dim too dark to see Moving slowly into view the rabbitlike figure tilted its head I was suddenly winded unable to catch my breath He crawled slowly towards me staring straight at me I opened my mouth but nothing came out I struggled to move but was unable Slowly more of these figures emerged from the darkness They filed in slowly around meThen the noise That low resonating soundMy Heart dropped as the sound grew closer much more intense than before It was near deafening The figures all scurried off in different directionsThe dark shadowlike figure The light around him began to bend and swirl Then completely dissipate  The street lights had completely disappeared I could no longer see the survey I was surrounded by a faint blue ambient glowThe shadow began to flux what was once a solid black now moved like flowing smoke He closed in his face seeming to take form I was forced to my feet I was now face to face with the figure He lifted me off my feet I grew limp a feeling of intense exhaustion overwhelmed my body The ground beneath my feet began to crack and spill an intense light I raised my gaze to meet with the figure one last time before he released his grip As my feet met the ground I crashed through it The light so intense it caused my eyes to slam shut A ringing began in my ears Everything was so serene so peacefulThats when I heard the voices start faintly at first Too faint to distinguish The light beaming on my eyelids began to dim enough for me to open my eyes The voices began to come in louder they were frantic yells not voices The light began to dim voices becoming clearer I made out the word Clear followed by staticThe darkness persisted I felt a pressure on my chest followed by a large jolt My eyes shot open Gasping air rushed into my lungs I panted like a dog my eyes struggling to adjust to the lights and scrambling shadows The ringing continued louder My vision cleared slightly and I could make out a few faces unfamiliar ones The buzzing people held my head still while scrambling around my body I felt a searing jolt of panic I knew not what they were doing to me but my body refused to struggleThe faces receded as I was lifted I struggled to look around to get any sense of direction My face was smothered by some sort of maskIts two weeks later I think Ive made some conclusions Is it possible for your body to remember things without you being consciously aware I wouldnt have thought so but everything that had happened there it convinced me otherwise I was in a car accident The events that occurred did so after the initial impact knocked me unconscious A driver had been drinking swerved to dodge a raccoon and lost control I was launched through my windshield Notice anything yet NoThe impact and the flipping of my car the moving furniture The surgeons removed a  inch shard of glass from my heel which was lodged on impact with the road itself Authorities say the glass was a part of my my windshieldThe glass in my foot and the searing pain from the mirror fragments Still not convinced Ive concluded the black figure to be the paramedic Being lifted by the figure was them getting me on a stretcher and into a brace As for the shock Well that was the defibrillatorThe is all logical right Id like to believe so The only part still beyond my comprehension is why nobody is aroundIts day fifteen and Im afraid to leave my bed but I havent seen or heard a person in days The truly terrifying part is the mirror has been dripping for the past  minutes,1385620266.0,Far From

trigger,17,2,1rlyb7,7,Um I am a skeptic of the supernatural but I believe anything is possible so I wont discount supernatural occurrences if I cant find a logical explanation for them I have a few incidences that I have witnessed but couldnt explain I am only going to tell the one that freaked me out the most thoughSo here it goes I live in the Twin Cities in Minnesota USA a lot of people in the cities have cabins in either northern MN or rural Wisconsin our cabin was in northern Wisconsin a small town called Danbury The cabin is on Long Lake at the very end of Long Lake Road Along with the cabin came almost an acre of land of thick forest we carved a trail trough the land for ATVs and whatnot So the scene is setNow about me Im an outdoor enthusiast have been forever Im  and fit and have been a hunter since I was like  I know my environment well I know the wildlife I know the forest well and am typically comfortable in the woods I come from a military family an am trained in multiple forms of combat armed and unarmed and I have extensive firearms training as a result I am fairly confident in my abilities to defend myself I am not really scared of people big predators on the other hand Im not a big fan of bears wolves manbearpig whatever This brings me to the weirdnessIm  now but at the time of the incident I was  even at  I was a decent hunter and I generally have good common sense Anyway I was at the cabin with my cousinJ and grandparents it is middle summer I think July hot temps and whatnot Me and my cousin were shooting at each other with airsoft guns we had a full on v battle going on throughout the property including the woods which were my stalking grounds as I was wearing my BDU with face cover and all head to toe in camo our battle ended up about  yards northwest of the cabin into the woods we ended the war on the main trail and were standing and talking about the events that conspired and I was still on guard cause I always am I suppose I could be considered a tad paranoid Alright so we are talking when I noticed something moved on our  about  meters out I got quiet and focused dead ahead scanning J was still talking and I whispered shhhhhh he shut up and to freak him out I said we are being watched as a joke cause I figure the movement I caught was probably a bird or something but then I did notice something its dead quiet no birds chirping nothing then I started to think this only happens when a big predator is around so I started looking even closer then I saw it on my  there was a large animal it had reddish brown fur and almost blended in perfectly till I focused on it It had long front limbs armlike with formidable claws it appeared it was standing kind of slouched down against a tree like it was trying to be stealthy it was nearly as tall as me in this state the only reason why I saw it was because of its teeth I think it was panting because its whitish teeth were visible its snout appeared to be a tad elongated I couldnt get a better look because my first thought was we have to go I said it out loud J was already freaked when I said that he bolted up the trail towards the cabin he nearly left me in the dust because I was protective of him and I waited a good  seconds and kept my eye on it until I saw it move and it was fast then I ran like hell I didnt see which way it ran all I know is I heard it crashing through the woods J stopped at the shed to wait for me which was still  meters from the cabin when I caught up I yelled GO GO GO and we both bolted to the cabin and got inside and shut the door then my grandma asked why we looked panicked and slammed the door I knew they wouldnt believe me so I said we saw a bear and J noddedLater that night after the grandparents went to sleep we talked about it and I asked J if he saw it he told me that he paused for a second to look back after he ran to see if I was running with him and he saw me still looking at it then he saw it move too and me run but mostly he said he only saw a flash of fur he then said I thought it wasnt the right color for a bear I told him it wasnt we only have black bears in the area and the animal wasnt built right I said I didnt think it was a bear he then asked why I lied I told him they wouldnt believe us We have kept it between us until nowStill the animal didnt match any known regional animal profiles in the area Im at a loss for what it may have been I know that it was stalking us though and that it was built like an athletic predator not like a bear not as heavyset After the incident neither of us would go into the woods on foot alone without a gun we generally only went back in the woods on ATVs from that point forward I always loved the cabin up until then fortunately the cabin has been sold nowTLDR Saw a strange predator in the forest at my cabin,1385596086.0,A strange encounter in the woods,9,nosleep,top_week
Grindhorse,0,8,1rlc3b,7,resubmitted the full story after learning the character limitThe car in my driveway was full of mannequins all sitting upright in every available spot except the drivers seat  A single note was tucked under the windshield wiperDRIVESINCERELYM DI didnt have time to dwell on who wrote the note at the end of my street a second car slowly crawled its way down the block  It was midnight so I could barely see the windshield over the glare of the headlights let alone see who was drivingI wasnt about to hop into this mannequinfilled car and speed away but did I really have time to get my car out of the garage  Did I really have time to call the police  Did I really have time to runI hopped into the lifeless crowdWhat the fuck was I doing  WaitKeys  Where were the keys  How do I drive this car without keys  The car was an old Mustang the musclecar types but the body had long since rusted  I had never seen the car before in my life and as my hands searched the dashboard and seat cushions I made contact with another noteWIRESWhatThe ignition was gone  It was a mess of wires  It isnt like I knew how to hot wire this car or any car but I didnt have any other options  Two red wires were twisted together next to a sticky note with an arrow pointing to a third exposed wire  The note had one word on it of courseTOUCHI didnt know if this would work  I was trusting a sticky note  Before touching the wires a quick glance out the car window drained the skepticism from my mind  The second which was previously a quarter mile away now sat directly next to me on the driveway  I could barely see in the drivers window but it looked like hundreds of people crowded in that one car  A mass of human shapes all pressing against the window  I couldnt see features just dark silhouettes  How could it even be possible to give the illusion that so many people crammed into one carI pressed those wires together like I was trying to make them fuckAnd that was it  I floored that fucking thing out of the driveway  No idea where I was going but as soon as I accelerated onto the street the second car a jet black Camaro exploded out of the driveway behind meI droveNow I wont go into detail about escaping my town or my county or my state or the next state  But eventually I ended up on one of those roads you expect in horror movies  Sprawling fields on either side of me  One lane going in either direction infinitelyThe gas gauge never changed  The radio didnt work  All I had was the sound of the wind rushing outside and the sound of the heat inside  It was a cold night and I had been driving for three hoursAt least the clock workedAt least the mirrors workedI knew the mirrors worked because those damn headlights kept shining from  feet behind  That damn Camaro  One other vehicle came our way on the road that night speeding from the other direction  It was a big fuckin semi and once it passed me I checked my mirrorIt was alongside the Camaro  I saw arms come out of the Camaro I think  Long arms  Hundreds of long lightskinned arms  As more appeared from the car they began to grab the semis tires dragging the truck in the other direction our direction  And finally when the crowd of arms stopped sprouting from the windows of the dark car the semis tires were pulled off and the truck was flipped  I was going fast but Im sure no one crawled from that wreckageSince I was going straight forever I looked back to see the arms all turned upwards waving a greeting at me  And then in an instant they slid back into the car  It rocketed forward closing our gap to tailgating distance  I still couldnt see through the windshield but the drivers flashed the brights at meInhaleLets see what this fuckin Mustang can do  Heavy foot hit tattered floor mat  Tailgating distance turned into half a mileExhaleSo reader the mannequins huh  What about those  Let me tell you about my plastic familyThere were four mannequins  Each one was dressed differently and all of them were positioned to stare at me  All were maleMy friend in the shotgun seat was dressed just like how I dressed my senior year of high school and freshman year of college the years I reinvented myself Tapout shirt ripped jeans gelled up hair was that REAL hair on this thing and the mannequins leg space was filled entirely with empty beer cans  I spent a lot of time being a gigantic toolSitting in the middle seat in the second row we had my early high school wardrobe faded Pantera shirt shaggy hair cargo pantsDirectly behind me I could only make out that the mannequin was completely naked and covered in lacerations andburnsThe last road trip buddy wore a suit  This was a nice fuckin suit  Grey European cut and the hair was parted on the sideAs the ride wore on and I flew down through the nothingness doing  these mannequins began to keep me company  I found myself holding onesided conversations with each except the mutilated one  I felt uneasy about himThe conversations werent happy conversationsIn my paranoid tired terrified state I spoke to each as if I was speaking to myself at the age the mannequin portrayed  I decided the suited one was going to be me once I landed that real jobI was the most angry at the suited one  After another hour of silence following a bout of calling the high school and college mannequins giant fucking losers with increasing vigor I lost it on that suited sales display son of a bitchWhy cant you be in this fuckin drivers seat  Im here in sweats being mocked by you  Yes  I get it  I wish I was you  Why are you even here  Get out of this fuckin car  I dont need you reminding me that Ive done nothing worth being proudOkay  The voice was plainThe door flew open and I watched in the mirror as the mannequin was destroyed by its own momentumWait no it wasnt  The mannequin hit the pavement rigid limbs moving to catch itself when the arms appeared from the darkThe Camaro had been far enough behind that I only saw headlights as two small points in the reflected distanceBut now the lights were like eyes created from the Sun itself  Gigantic and staring an unseen monster being beckoned forward by hundreds of arms from the darkThe arms snaked around the mannequin grabbing it as itstood  It tried to stand  The arms grabbed it and as the Camaro pulled back into my view from the rearview the mannequin was hoisted far above the vehicleThe moon having become another friend of mine quickly betrayed me by illuminating the now living mannequin be pulled apart  All of its limbs at once were violently ripped out in all directions flung haphazardly into the night  The torso remained above the car held by a single arm  Sand poured from the wound  Sand and scraps of paper  The paper blew everywhere defying physics  One particular leaf made its way through the open door and onto my dashboard  I noticed the writing and grabbed itStill blasting forward into the void I figured it was safe to glance at the noteWere already in your headWho the fuck are theyMy question was answered when I checked my mirrorThere was the Camaro back within tailgating distanceArms tried to pour into the open door but I shifted gears and hit Gone again  But I turned around and saw one hand had ripped off in the back seat  I couldnt stare long because ya know the road  So I reached back to grab the dead handOnce I grabbed it the fuckin thing snapped to life behaving like some rabid animal  It hissed  Yes it hissed before jumping from my grip onto the shoulder of my shotgunseated companion  A finger bore into the head of the mannequin to my right and it screamed  The mouth never moved  But it screamed the kind of scream you allow when you break a bone  It wasnt horrified just pained  It was almost frustratedThe scream stopped abruptly  The hand disintegrated into dust  The hole in the mannequins head was goneThe FUCK just happenedI was snapped from panicking when the back door slammed shutHiThe suited mannequin was back but he was suddenly human becauseof course he was  A handsome man dressed in a grey suit staring at me with eyes that felt very familiarIm not even gonna ask who you areIm MDflip the car around  You need to end this or youre never going to stop driving  You can run all you want but isnt that what youve always been doing  Isnt that what everyones been doingIwhatIt isnt important  You need to attack this head on right now  Flip the car around and ram that fuckerI wasnt about to do that but this guys excitement was contagious  He seemed so nice so idealNo  I wasnt about to crash into whatever demonic things were behind meNo  That isnt gonna happenAlright  No use tryingHe shot himself  I wont go into detail but Im pretty sure he shot himself  I didnt look back  Focusing on the road was hard with the flash of light behind me  No sound  Just a flashWhen I did look back the seat was vacant againHours passed  The Sun started to rise but just as I saw it peak over the horizon I watched the moon fall from nowhere and pummel the day back into nightThe moon dropped itself onto the Sun  It was so close to day  Everything would be clear  Everything would be new  And that traitorous moon forced my mind back into darknessWhen the Sun started to appear and grey dawn forced itself to be noticed the Camaro began to drop back  It was almost entirely out of view an I could see an exit sign up ahead of me which Im sure lead to a town or city or anywhere that wasnt an expanse of roadBut the traitorous moon  Was it dragged down by those limitless arms  I think I saw themI know I saw them grab the moon and use it to hammer the Sun into submissionDarkness veiled the exit sign and I continued driving growing infuriatedThe fury mounted until I was sure it became an actual fireball  But maybe that was a premonition of what would come in the next  secondsFuck itDownshiftHandbrakeIm facing the demon carFloor itDavis Michael  Age   Body covered in lacerations and burns from headon collision with a black Camaro  Dead on arrival  Thats what the doctors would say shaking their heads  Nurses would hold back vomit at the site of my completely dismantled husk of a bodyThe headlights blinded me  No one swervedThe arms tried to greet me but the Mustang slammed through the limbs with a confidence that was only matched by my own  Too much confidence  Not enough confidence  Cockiness  Fear  Pain  Regret  Hate  Love  Love is lost and this car will be lost as wellLight at lastThen the darkI woke up in my bed at midnight  A roar was coming from outside so I turned my attention to the window  My entire block was filled with black cars engines rumbling  Some had windows rolled down revealing blackness and a slender arm or two  Some

freezessmyblood,5,4,1r9hka,7,So I am a firm believer in the natural world and I really have never believed in ghosts or anything like that before But lately I really dont know what to think Ill start from the beginning about a year after we moved into the new house My room is one of the biggest in the house with a good sized walkin closet I have always had these fleeting thoughts about a ghost or some sort of spirit living in my house I get that feeling that someones watching me regularly especially at night My room is also very cold almost all the time though it wasnt when we first moved in Lately though Ive been noticing strange things going on with my closet At first Id leave the room and find the door open when it hadnt been when I left or Id find the light on or off when it had originally been the opposite I always just assumed I hadnt noticed the door being open I just really didnt want to believe that anything was wrong But then the closet lights started going out I know that really isnt anything special but every single bulb wed put in would go out within a day We all just thought there was something wrong with the socket for the light so we just stopped putting them in Last night something I cant explain happened and I dont know what to make of it I awoke early in the morning at about  AM and I stood to turn my television off As I turned around from the tv to return to my bed I saw that my closet light was on I didnt think anything of it I just walked towards it to turn the light off when I noticed two dark shadows blocking the sliver of light under the door I thought my brother must be in there because we share a room and I was still fairly groggy from waking up so I slowly walked towards the door to try and whip it open to scare him I grabbed the doorknob and flung it open Inside was a woman standing right up against the doorframe and she was so pale Her hair was limp and pure white and she was dressed in these white clothes that hung from her loosely As soon as I saw her I froze and we stared at each other for only a second before she screamed the most horrifying piercing scream Id ever heard and the light blew out and she was gone I slammed the door shut and ran to my bed which unfortunately is right next to the closet I stayed there for a while until I mustve fallen asleep because I remember her staring down at me I awoke in my dark room and there she was standing over my bed just staring at me I was paralyzed with fright and I couldnt move She just stared and as she began moving her face closer to mine I finally shook the paralysis and yelled She slid back away from me as though she was levitating and disappeared Im terrified to sleep tonight because I dont want her to visit me again Her face is burned into my memory it was the most unsettling thing I have ever seen I dont know what to believe anymore,1385174866.0,My room is haunted,11,nosleep,top_week
ephique,5,4,1r8wrl,7,It was Friday and myself being unemployed at the time was up for something to do You see my girlfriend was invited to a party by her new friends from her dramacrew she recently joined and she wanted me to join her This party took place on the other side of our suburban ruin of a town and it made common sense for her to message me the location whenever she knew the exact address again she didnt know these people that wellAround  pm I left our apartment to head to the party still not knowing the exact location I figured I could at least walk to the busstation that had buses taking me to that part of town Luckily I got a message from one of her new friends on the way there Describing how to get to the destination My girlfriend hadnt paid her phone bill and had to use a friends phone to message me she has done this before She hates her network companyI took the bus taking me as far as I could buswise After that I had to get a taxi the only taxi driver I ended up finding had never driven anyone to that location before apparently Im guessing the dramapeople pretended they had taxis whenever they needed one Good practiceThe taxi driver who I believe was Mexican dropped me off at the address and headed back for the city shortly after I had no idea her friends was throwing a party out in the middle of nowhere and it was getting really chilly so I didnt spend too much time figuring out the mysteries of the universe out there I ran up to the doorMy first impression was that this must have been the most quiet party in the history of parties I heard no music no laughing no tapping Nothing Before I knew it I was banging on that door it had no ringer or anything I had to pound that thing No one openedI felt pretty confused at this point I did still have my phone though Although calling my girlfriend was no use cause I already knew her network always shut off inbound and outbound calls and texts whenever she hadnt paid Out of desperation I phoned her friends number but no one answered I assumed they were partying too hard to hear the phone ringing and I found myself mislead by a tired taxi driver who took me to the wrong house Thats the only explanation that made any sense to me what so everNow I was out of options I couldnt walk back into town cause not only would I not know the exact roads out there but it was also ridiculously freezing outside I tried banging on the door again and again maybe an old couple lived there or something and they would wake up if I hit that door hard enoughI ended up smashing the lever on the door accidentally the door wasnt even locked I looked around to make sure that no one was watching me because I did realize that being desperate or cold wouldnt really vouch well in court I couldnt see anyone so I sneaked into the house Whenever I had made sure no one was in the first room of the house I closed the door behind me Not being sure what I was looking for I walked around aimlessly trying to figure out if anyone was home or not my mind started to wander off into finding explanations I remember one being that they were playing a prank on me which wasnt a bad theory since the door was after all left unlockedI didnt check much of the first level of the house before I started walking up a great set of stairs leading me in a spiral upwards It was very creaky so if anyone was awake in this house theyd easily hear me at this point I figured no one was cause the entire house was dead silent with the exception of the noise I brought into it myselfUpstairs I found a bedroom just across the hall from where the spiral staircase ended It seemed to belong to a girl a small girl It was an empty bed in it and paintings on the walls you know the type kids do in preschool that parents end up pretending are works of genius to make the kid feel better and gain confidence Yeah those kind of paintingsI got shocked by my own textmessage signal that I stupidly left on way too loud it was from an unknown number I was hoping it was my girlfriend or her friend explaining the mixup or something The text saidAlright we are all set I hope you havent fallen asleep my little unemployed darling Make your way to th Radcliffe Street its not too far from the super market by the busstation Oh and this is Jessies phone sorry forgot to pay my fascist phone bill again Sorry that it took me so long to message Love you ,1385158023.0,Take Me Out,11,nosleep,top_week

irinax,21,5,1rnj6d,7,Previous part herehttpsrredditcomrnosleepcommentsriyrwhoisthiswomanpartSo I talked to my father He said he knows a lot but he just never cared much about any of it because to him its all bullshitAnd he said  Even if its real and it happens its still bullshitHe told me about this woman and her relation to my greatgrandmother And the reason my grandmother seems to hate her so much AND the reason my aunt and greataunt have great opinions of her He doesnt know her name thoughThe woman who introduced herself to me as Mija or Mia  not sure how itd be spelled so Ill just go with Mia was my greatgrandmothers friend They met at a dance  well type of a dance and probably not as most of you would imagine it But lets call it a dance because I dont know a better wordMy greatgrandmother would often go outside the venue where the dance was held and go for walks sit outside etc I do that too all the time DOne night Mia approached her and started a conversationObviously my greatgrandmother found it strange since shed never met the girl before but they got along and became pretty good friends During that time my greatgrandmother asked people about Mia but people just didnt know anything And they didnt care which was strange for that timeShe was about  at the time and of course she wouldnt be able to go out often  only occasionally and with her brother but since she became friends with Mia shed be allowed to go out a lot and people never questioned that it didnt ruin her reputation like it usually wouldSo yes thats strange and unnatural and Im not sure how exactly did Mia get people in that time and place to accept it all as normal  its strange but still not supernatural I guessMy greatgrandmother would often disappear  no one would know where she was and shed come back with stories about beautiful towns strange languages and interesting people Now again if someone else did this itd be a scandal and itd end VERY bad but for my greatgrandmother it was supportLet me just mention that my greatgreatgrandfather was NOT a person that woudl tolerate and accept that and he did not But when Mia came along he would accept anything Magdalena my greatgrandmother wantedSo when she wanted to get married  no it was not the guy they would want her to marry no But she was allowed to She liked him for years but when shed mention it her father would get terribly angry and say that is never happeningAfter Mia coming into her life Magdalena could talk about him openly in the house and not only would her father not get angry hed support her He was a different man but only to her nothing else changedPeople in the village still thought of her as a very nice young lady  which she wasnt so much by their standards but it was like they didnt even know or pay attention to itAgain that also started with MiaWhen she got married she got a wedding that was much more luxurious than their families resources would have allowedIt also went against some traditions of my nation  but again it was tolerated even though before it wouldnt have beenHer mother in law which was a very complicated woman hard to deal with actually accepted her and Magdalena didnt do much for her Of course in that time a wife would be expected to serve her in laws but she didnt They didnt ask her to and she didnt think she shouldGenerally she got a perfect life Her first child got sick a lung inflammation Lots of children died of lung problems back then but her daughter recuperated very quickly  after just two days Two days of Mia taking care of herTo put it simply  if it wasnt for Mia my greatgrandmothers life would have sucked really really badBut Mia was there and it was a fairytale She got everything she wanted Yet people didnt express any envyShe had no problems no issuesShed often disappear even when she was married and come back talking about different far away countries  and again no one was bothered by that She went with MiaShe helped Magdalenas family in WW All until her death she was very close to Mia and my father says she was closer to her than to anyone in the family Mia WAS family always there and always helpfulI dont see how my greatgrandmother could return the favors  thats why I doubt the deal may be something to pay for all that she got from Mia in her lifetime Now what surprised me is that Magdalena could have at least my father heard so remained young and healthy and well alive But she had to make a choice and she chose death because it made room for something good to happen We dont know what that good thing isI asked my father HOW can Mia remain young healthy and alive for so long  and how my greatgrandmother could have But he doesnt know He said that actually he doesnt even believe it He thinks Mia may be a descentant of the woman my greatgrandmother was friends withBut he also doesnt exclude the possibility of Mia being a nonaging special being He said After all the shit Ive heard in this family  that wouldnt be so surprising I mean were just so Fucked up you knowI asked for an explanation and basically everyone in the family sooner or later encounters something creepy and fucked up He said everyone gets through it but we did have some strange deaths in the family And a few wackadoodles that are well wacky And fucked up So I doubt everyone just gets through it without consequencesHe said that I probably shouldnt be afraid of Mia just careful as I would be with any new person even if they were completely normal and there was nothing strange about themHe doesnt think she wants to hurt meBut he did warn me that if she offers me to do things for me like she did for Magdalena that I should probably refuse until all this shit is cleared upAll of this did calm me down a bit I mean she helped Magdalena all the time shes probably not going to just hurt me out of nowhereThen again She may want someone to pay for all the favors she didI thought this would clear it up a bit but Im even more confused now,1385657171.0,My father knows a lot about her  Who is this woman  Part ,12,nosleep,top_week

deanjp,2,3,1re04y,4,When I was about  years old I started making home movies with my cousin Ben and my friend Mark My parents had bought me a new video camera for Christmas that year We filmed a ton of crappy short films some original stuff but mostly spoofs of existing films such as The Ring Saw and our personal favorite Dr Giggles This was probably because horror films were so easy to make All you needed was the biggest knife in the house and some ketchup packets Now it was midOctober nearly a year since I got the camera and we were getting tired of filming at my house and in my backyard We wanted to go somewhere exotic So we walked around the block where a small patch of woods stood next to the exit ramp of a highway that cut through my town This is where we would shoot our next film we decided The basic plot was supposed to be two hikers are killed by a mad man with a baseball bat When we had finished all of the planning which wasnt much we didnt write scripts the sun was starting to set This is what wanted We werent going to shoot a scary movie in broad daylight We made our way to the woods I carried the camera which had a light built into it Ben carried the baseball batmurder weapon an oversized bright red plastic thing that looked like something out of a cartoon and Mark carried three cans of tomato soup and a can opener in his backpack This was the basic layout of the area from the street of the block I live on there was about  feet of grass until you got to the woods The woods stretched for a little less than a mile parallel to the street The thickness of the woods varied throughout but reached a maximum of about  feet On the side of the woods opposite of the street was a small grassy ridge that made up the highway exit rampWhen we got to the woods we looked around for a spot where we could start the film There seemed to be somewhat of a trail running through the middle of the woods We decided we would walk the trail until we reached one end and start filming from there I turned on the light of the camera as it was completely dark at this point We started walking There was garbage everywhere Gas station fountain drink cups candy wrappers old tires The place was a dump I guess were not the first ones to pass through these parts I said jokingly Is this where garbage trucks dump their loads This must be Oscar the Grouchs summer home Ben said as he gestured to a small red tent we were approaching We all burst into laughter Anybody home Mark yelled Its Burt Ernie and Big Bird here for a visit The tent came into full view and I shined the light in its direction  Suddenly we all shut up A pair of big black boots were sticking out of the door of tent We stopped as if paralyzed My legs werent moving and neither were the legs in the tent I realized I was still shining the light directly on the tent and quickly pointed it at the ground Ben whispered Lets get outta here They started backing away leaves crunching beneath their feet but I still stood there terrified I dont know why I was so scared It was probably just some poor bum sleeping out here in the woods But hadnt he heard us coming his wayCome on man lets go Mark quietly begged me I finally got control of my legs As I was backing away curiosity got the best of me I pointed the camera at the tent No boots I couldnt breathe for a moment Then I ran Mark yelled at me What What I didnt respond but they ran with me I didnt know where I was leading them I just wanted to get away from there out of the woods away from whoever was now roaming around outside of his tent I spotted a pair of headlights driving on the exit ramp and decided to head that way We got out of the trees and caught our breath near the ramp guard rail No more cars in sight I told them what I had seen and we agreed that we didnt want to go back into the woods We would walk along the ramp until we got to the street and then walk back to my house from there We were just about to leave when Ben asked me where the camera was Shit I must have dropped it while I was running I wanted to just leave it but I knew my parents would kill me if I told them I lost it The three of us walked back down the ridge being as quiet as we could and keeping our eyes peeled for any sign of the cameras flashlight which I couldnt remember ever switching offWe had just entered the trees when I saw a dim glow just a few feet ahead of us I walked up to it slowly and as I bent down to pick it up another car slowly curved down the ramp its headlights illuminating the area for a moment In the brief second that the woods were lit up I saw a pair of big black boots sitting just two or three feet in front of me I almost cried I choked on my own breath and looked up slowly expecting to see a man attached to the boots but there was no one It was just a pair of boots neatly sitting there I was confused but that didnt stop me from running out of there with my friends as fast as I could gripping the camera tightly with both hands We reached the ramp followed it to the street and went home Needless to say we stuck to filming at my house from then onAbout a month later my mom and I were driving home from my aunts house after Thanksgiving dinner We got off on our usual exit I searched the trees for a sign of the red tent but couldnt see it We were stopped at the traffic light just off of the exit when I noticed an old beggar standing on the corner asking passing cars for change The street was full of cars but he eventually fixed his sight on our car I tried not to look at him but I couldnt help it Finally I realized he wasnt staring at our car He was staring at me I looked closer Black boots He was wearing a pair of big black boots Before I had time to think my window started rolling down Quickly I looked at my mom who was handing me a dollar bill she had just pulled out of her purse Give this to that poor man its Thanksgiving for heavens sake Ill slow down when get up to himI took the dollar from her as if in a trance and looked back at the beggar He was smiling at me with brown and yellow teeth My heart was beating fast I couldnt breathe again His eyes stayed fixed on mine We inched toward him as the cars ahead of us slowly turned right My mom stopped the car next to him and I cautiously held the dollar out to him Happy Holidays he said smiling Happy Holidays my mom replied as I sat there speechless his eyes never leaving mineEven as we drove away I could still see him in the side mirror standing there in his big black boots Staring and smiling,1385344535.0,Big

LadyVengeance,2,2,1rdv1z,5,I woke up stretched my arms and got upIt was midsummer already warm and sunny and the birds outside were twitteringI dont know why but I was in a very good mood I took a look out of my window a very peaceful neighborhoodMy neighbors were working in their beautifully manicured gardens I used to greet them but around  weeks ago they started to give me this strange look when I walked by It was obviously weird to them that I was trying to be nice to everyone Ive never been like that but I think I finally realized that life is more than just regrets lies and all that bad stuff that happens every day I mean I got a new job after  years of unemploymentI went straight to the bathroom and brushed my teeth I caught myself humming which I normally dont do But whatever I did I couldnt miss the feeling that I forgot something and I couldnt remember what it wasMan you look awesome today I said to myself and I gave my reflection in the mirror a wink Just like I said I felt good I went downstairs and headed to the kitchen I decided to prepare breakfast for me and my parents just because I felt like itGood morning everyone Good morning darling My parents sat there in front of the TV watching their favorite show They recently started doing that getting up early and watch TV I stood there in the kitchen and asked Scrambled or fried and they would answer Whatever you like sweetie pieSo what are you guys doing today Will you just stay here and watch TV again We should enjoy the wonderful weather as long its warm outside but Im really sorry I think I cant join you guess whyWell I have a new job as a barkeeper I think it will be a lot of fun but I have to hurry now before Im too late for my first day of work I know you dont like this and you would rather want me to have a normal job but I cant change it Itll do it for nowI was really excited I opened the door took a deep breath and realized that Mrs Cartridge from next door was watering her flowers I waved to her with a big smile on my face and there again she just responded with that distracted glance I dont know what this neighbourhood was up to but I could tell it was no good They didnt even like me from the start As soon as we moved into this house you could tell that these people didnt want you to stayI still can remember this one Halloween I think I was about  years old and Ive always been a big fan of horror movies My parents wouldnt let me watch them but I did it secretly when they were asleep So I wanted the best costume ever I only wished for a hockey mask and something similar to a machete I wanted to look like Jason from the horror movies My parents werent really happy about it but it was Halloween so what I really enjoyed scaring the other kids even the older ones There was just one problem about it for one kid this wasnt as amusing as it was to me He was so scared that he literally pissed his pants and of course he told his father about the incident He rang at our house and told my parents that they would regret buying me such a costume they should better take care of me and my strange hobbies and that I wasnt even close to normal What a stupid thing to say when you dont even know me Guess what he did the Halloween after He grabbed me threw me in his car and drove to the nearest lake It was at the end of October and damn cold outside He ripped my clothes apart and I really tried to fight back but this man was about  feet tall and very muscular He forcefully put my head in the water I thought I would die that he would drown me in that damn lake But he dragged me up again and asked me Who is scared now huh and then he would continue this over and over again He left me there naked freezing gasping but I felt nothing I was empty I went back home all the kids were laughing at me but I didnt care I just wanted to get home and get some rest I never told my parents about what happened that day but I could tell that this was just the beginning of it allMy relationship to my parents was never that good We argued a lot we insulted each other They really pissed me off sometimesGo and get a job already Stop sitting around like a lazy bugger I wish Id have never been pregnant with youHarsh tones rough times but in the meantime I started to understand their worries and doubts Maybe thats why our relation was getting better now every day I got up off my ass and did something I looked for a job Im cleaning the dishes from time to time because my mom started to rebel and stopped doing anything in the household Thats also the reason why it started to smell so bad in the kitchen I now was a busy man I couldnt clean the house all day long I had better things to do I dont even know if my parents liked what I was cooking for them They didnt eat at all sometimes they only tried one fork saying to me You did a great job honey but we arent hungry I know that my cookeries werent the best and they just wanted to be polite and nice So I had to throw away almost all of the food The leftovers started to moulder and oozed a disgusting smell Im a messy person I dont really give a shit if my room looks untidy or the dishes are dirtyMy first day at work was really exciting Ive worked as a barkeeper a few years ago I was still good at mixing drinks and serving them I really enjoyed the atmosphere in that bar It smelled like old wood and some of the lights were broken and therefore it was quite dark in there Most people who came in here were at least  years old The few women that found their way in here were prostitutes looking for a cheap jag I envied them so much you earn money having sex with other people And they made good money out of it You can judge me but I have my own opinion about that topic If I was a girl I would do exactly the sameSo and youre the new barkeeper here What a hell of a man you are such a lovely face You shouldnt even be here darling one of the prostitutes hit on me But I really like it in here Dreary places always attracted me And on top of that I got to know you my dear lady My names Adora Pleased to meet you So whats your poison We really enjoyed each others presence and talked a lot about her job about her family in Texas etc She asked me to come with her after my shift had finished One thing led to another and we ended up in her bedroom I waited til she fell asleep and sneaked out of her apartment I rather sleep in my own bed than somewhere else I was hoping that my parents were already sleeping but when I got home I saw them sitting in front of the TV It was am in the morning did they seriously stay awake til I got home Just to shellac meIm sorry that Im so late I hope youre not Its okay honey Dont worry I felt relieved I ran straight upstairs into my room and lay down on my bed with a big smile on my face My life couldnt be any betterI woke up stretched my arms yawned and took a look out of the window It was raining but still warm outside I strolled into the bathroom and brushed my teeth I recalled what happened yesterday and a smile lighted up my face Having finished brushing my teeth I headed downstairs to prepare some breakfast I greeted my parents delightfully and decided to make some pancakes The only problem with that was that all the clean dishes and pans were gone and so I had to scrape the mouldering leftovers off of them I know thats not really how you should do that but I had to hurry otherwise Id have been late for workI hope you dont mind that I used the dirty dishes to serve the pancakes on Ive got an idea Maybe we should go out for a ride tomorrow you both havent left the house in weeks now Dad I know you hate your boss but maybe you should consider going back to work next weekSo whats the plan Maybe we should drive to the lake and go fishing Thats a good idea Its been years since Dad and I were going on a fishing trip together I went to work and there again in the right corner sat Adora with her two friendsYou nasty boy sneaked out of my bed last night I thought we had a lot of fun We did I just wasnt comfortable sleeping in another bed than mine I hope youre not angry with me No its okay cutie Do you have plans for tomorrow Maybe we could stay all day long in my bed and do  you know  dirty stuff Im sorry but I promised my parents that were going to the lake for a few hours but maybe you could join us That would be great I dont really know honey Im not that kind of person you should introduce to your parents Dont be silly Were just chilling at the lake for two hours and afterwards we can do whatever you want Well then if its just for two hours Im okay with thatI was excited like a little kid on Christmas Eve I helped my parents to get in the car Adora said she would wait at the lake so that my parents didnt get to know where she lived because it was some kind of embarrassing for her showing her poverty When we got there Adora approached the car opened the passenger door and bursted out with a high pitched screamWhat the fuck is wrong I asked her Ohmygod With tears in her eyes she ran off What the hell was that I dont know that freaked her out that much Im sorry guys I really thought she was something special Its okay honey Dont be sad For everything theres a season Maybe she wasnt the right one for you Thank you MomDad I love you We love you too son Maybe we should go home for today Im not really in the mood for fishing right nowI drove back to our house and now there was Mrs Cartridge again She was cutting her rose bed When I opened the door to help my parents getting out of the car she dropped her garden shears and clasped her hands over her mouth She looked like she saw a ghost People these days just annoyingWe were sitting in front of the TV and watched one of my favorite shows I felt comfortable spending time with my beloved parents I cant remember the last time we just sat there without arguing being a family again Suddenly I noticed piercing sounds of sirens from outside Police cars stopped by near our house What happened Was Mrs Cartridge in danger What if something happened to her I would never forgive myself I could have helped herThis is the police Open up They pounded wildly against our front door What the hell was going on Open the damn door Otherwise were coming inWhat No I gave in and opened the door just to check out what the hell they wanted from us They bursted into our hallway and pushed me aside All of them were armed There were about  or  police cars parking in front of our house What the hell was going on Did Mrs Cartridge call the police Why One of the police officers went into the living room and yelledOh my fucking god guys two dead people in the living room Man thats fucking disgusting The police officer came back and gave me a disguised lookYou crazy motherfucker Get him the handcuffs on He might be dangerous What No Im not dangerous I was just sitting there with my parents watching TV This is not a crime You have the right to remain silent when questioned Anything you say or do may be used against you in a court of law You have the rightAll I heard were the sirens and all I saw where the lights everywhere I felt like I was in a movie that this wasnt real They cant arrest me Ive not committed any crimeEstimated time of death  weeks ago Thats why the neighbors complained about the smell The cause of death is currently unknown but what we can say is that they died an unnatural deathI just wanted to have a normal family without any rhubarb Ive never loved my parents that much as I did the last  weeks It was so calm and

Lnzy,2,3,1rdoii,5,My Grandmother made porcelain dolls filling her golden years and every inch of available shelf space in the modest desert home she shared with my Grandfather with small breakable people They were all dressed in elaborate frills and lace hand crafted bonnets and daintily painted faces They never scared me as a child as you would think a house full of unmoving glass eyes would Instead they compelled me to play and to dream For my fifth birthday Grandma gifted me with a pair dolls I named Lilly and Lanis They were twin baby dolls dressed in bright pink and blue corduroy overalls I took them everywhere and they filled me with the assurance that I would be a fantastic mother One day as I helped Grandma clean out her shed I knocked over a piece of wood that smacked int the wall A panel of the wall popped off the nails holding it in place and tumbled to the ground with a clatter Through the dust tinted air I spotted a large metal tin inside I instinctively went to reach for the item when my Grandmother slapped my hand away and quickly replacing the misplaced board securing in place with a heavy tool box Leave it be she told me sternly The next morning as we readied to leave and return home I slipped away and back to the shed With some effort I was able to push away the tool box and the board fell away with a sweep of my hand I quickly pulled the tin box out and opened it an unbridled urge to know pulling at me It was a doll Its dress was of a deep maroon lined with soft black velvet ready for the deepest of winters Its face white and pale as any porcelain was in fact made of wood Her eyes had been covered with a red ribbon Before I could examine the doll further the sound of my mothers voice jolted me back to reality and I hastily shoved the doll my bag When I got home I sat on my bed with the doll pulling my fingers through the wiry black curls The red ribbon was tied with an impossible knot so I went to the kitchen and fetched a pair of scissors Stripping off the ribbon I beheld the deep amber eyes of the wooden doll for the first timeand I felt a twinge of unease It was only after seeing the dolls face in its entirety that I realizedhow wrong it looked The eyes seemed to focus straight at me with unnerving intensity not the vague dead gaze of Grandmas other dolls The eyebrows were painted a tad too narrowand the sides of its mouth drooped ever so slightly The doll lookedangry I put the doll back into my bag and set it aside A few nights later we received an abrupt call in the middle of the night Grandma has passed away suddenly of a heart attack While I changed my clothes I looked up and noticed the items my dresser had been disturbed My pink bejeweled box of assorted costume jewelry and nick knacks had been pushed aside and in their place sat the wooden doll I stared at it for a moment trying to think back to when I had placed it there My mind was a jumble with thoughts of my now dead Grandmother and windowed Grandfather The doll was insignificant So it was only later after I had returned from a long day of mutual grieving with relatives that I notice the expression on the dolls face did not appear as severe as I remembered it when I first beheld it I chalked it up to being my own imagination and let the thought escape my mindA few days after the funeral I came home from school to find Lilly and Linus the dolls Grandma had made for me broken on the floor and in pieces Their brightly colored overall slashed I wailed at the sight of them and tried to put the shattered faces back together tears of anguish at finally having a real sense of my loss It was not just the dolls themselves but the glow of warmth from my Grandmothers touch seemed to have left them She was not coming back And I cried Above me I did not notice the vague smile on the wooden dolls lips I cried myself to sleep that night It was windy and the loss of my dolls had left me in little mood for food or entertainment I cuddled up with my well worn Little Mermaid blanket and eased into a dark nothingness without dreams I awoke abruptly during a particular powerful current of wind as it pushed the tree branches into my window I sat bleary eyed in the dark for a moment when I heard a soft sound of what sounded like foot falls They were soft and rapid seeming to come from under my bed I assumed it was my kitten Gizmo So I laid my head back onto my pillow and waited for sleep to return A clatter startled me back to alertness only a moment later and I looked around my room One of the doors to my closet which always remained closed because monsters you know was open a small crack Immediately my little brain began to race with thoughts of monsters with teeth and long claws and wide black eyes Almost as if to answer my thoughts there came another clatter from the closet I jumped out of bed grabbing the nearest piece of armament available to me a plastic princess light up wand I held it close to me as I approached the closet As I drew nearer I heard a most discerning noise as the closet door began to creek open A giggleI ran toward the door slammed it closed with all my might and rammed the princess wand between the handles of the closet doors just as they began to shake violently I pulled away and bolted out my door and down the hall to my parents room I slammed their door closed locked it and swan dived into the warm confines of their down comforter While far from happy with me they did not throw me out The next morning my Dad asked me what had scared meTheres a monster in my closet I told him He smiled patiently at me and got up to dress for the day He looked at the door and shook his head unlocking it and stepping out into the hall and paused looking down After a moment he looked back at me with tired eyes and asked Did you forget your toysConfused I looked over the edge of the mattress down to the floor where my father stood Just in front of the doorway to my parents room were the shattered plastic pieces of my princess wandlaying at the feet of the wooden doll with her mouth stretched into a wide grin ,1385335546.0,A Time for

along thinking about his friend hadnt been at school and he was a little worried he never missed one day He was walking when he walked into a lady she had things scattered across the ground he knew he should help her pick the items up He picked up the last of the items across the ground and he looked up and got a good look at this woman She was in her midforties or early fifties she had black hair was white brown eyes and her face was a little wrinkled He didnt even realize what he picked up when he handed it to her It was a knife covered in what looked like fresh blood when he saw that he started to back away She smiled and said Now dont run dear youll only make it harder on yourselfHe opened his mouth to scream but no sound escaped He turned and started running down the street trying to escape the woman with the blood stained knife He ran forward never looking back and he finally saw a house and he ran up to the door and found that it opened Grateful to this he bolted inside and closed the door He peeked out the window to see if she was following still he noticed she had slowed down and was laughing Hopefully shes just a crazy old woman who likes to scare kids for a laugh He panted quietlyI dont chase kids for a laugh He heard beside him He looked up and there stood the woman he opened his mouth to scream but she quickly covered it Now now dear be quiet itll be easier He tried to shake her hand off his mouth but she only clasped it harder around his mouth I said to be quiet dear He looked up at her terrified what was she going to do She smiled and said There we go my dear He closed his eyes hoping just maybe this was all a horrible dream Please please oh please let this be a horrible nightmareI dont want to die Oh how he wanted to speak aloud but that was not wise in this situation She said Now Im going to feed you some of my special soup I never get any visitors often to share it with Now he was beyond confused crazy woman with knife who chased kids was offering him soupShe steered him to a table and sat him down she sat a bowl of steaming liquid with chunks of meat in his face It smelled like chicken but it had an odd smell that lingered in the chicken like smell He made a face and said I think I should go home my mamma is probably worried about me maam Not till you get soup of my fine soup in your system  She repliedMy mamma told me not to accept things from strangers he said getting upWell then my name is Linda Now whats yours I aint allowed to tell strangers anything about me maam he saidAll you have to say is your first nameIm sorry

maam I dont think it works like that Im sorry but I really have to go At least eat one spoonful of my soupjust one please I never had anyone try my soup and be able to tell me if it tastes goodWell I guess one bite wouldnt hurt anyone He went over to the bowl and got himself a spoonful the broth was a reddish color the meat was dark like that of chicken or turkey He put the spoon past his nose and the smell that was lingering with the chicken like smell hit full force and it was so putrid he almost wanted to gag But he had to be nice to this ladyHe forced the spoon into his mouth the meat tasted like none hed ever had It didnt taste like chicken or anything else It had an odd salty taste with a metallic taste to it kind of like blood Wait that knife He tried to spit the soup out but she forced his mouth shut and said Now swallow dear She forced him to swallow the broth and he felt his eyes grow heavy she put something in thHours later he woke up the bed not his own and the room was different Please tell me Im dreaming where am I anyway She came in and the memory hit him He tried to get up but he was strapped to the bed He tried to scream but there was something knotted in his mouth like a rag Well Ive never had anyone to talk to but Ive always wanted someone to tell my secrets to you know Be able to be understood and all that She sighs He couldnt talk so he just laid there staring at her silently pleading for her to let him goYou know that soup I put special ingredients in that there soup It has my special red broth with my special meat I have to get it in a different way than any other meat Youll see how I do that lateror actually maybe very soonHe tried to fight against the ropes holding him down but she merely chuckled softly Dont fight dear I just want to talk to someone Now where was I ah yes During my days I must have this special food ten times a day its so addictive But with my running around to get it I can stay thin and not be fat like those lazy people who eat all day and night and never move Shame such waste of  oh never mind thatHe felt like crying and he felt salty tears start to form in his eyes Oh dont cry youll go home soon wellto the home most of us are promised in the end youll have a new body She sighed as if remembering something joyful She lightly patted his knee Well I really cant say much else about what I do its time I show you She untied him from the bed and said I shall lead you to your new living quarters She led him through the kitchen and into a dark roomThe smell inside was putrid he wanted to gag but the rag in his mouth kept him from doing so The lights in the room turned on and he saw the most gruesome sight He finally opened his mouth and screamed though his attempts were muffled by the rag The room was covered in dried red there was meat hanging up the freezer cool enough to keep it fresh like all other big freezers with meat in them But this wasnt ordinary meatit wasHe didnt finish his thought because he felt a stabbing pain and he fell down and felt the world go blackShe later came into the freezer grabbed one of the hanging meats and went to the kitchen and started to cut it up

irinax,10,6,1riy0r,5,Previous part herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrfxnwhoisthiswomanpartI couldnt find anything about this woman  no one in my family that Im close enough to ask knows about her except my grandmother who wont tell me and apparently my father who says its all bullshitSo I decided to find out more about my greatgrandmother I thought maybe I could find some clues about the woman too I asked my aunt who seems to know a bit about this because my grandmothers older sister told her before she died They lived together for a few years and were very close and talked a lot She said that my greatgrandmother was often absent which was very unusual for a woman in that time especially in a rural area where she lived She was married had more than  children but occasionally shed just disappear and was nowhere to be foundOf course her children would panic because their mother was gone  which child wouldnt But her husband my greatgrandfather never actually had a problem with that and he always seemed very calm about itHe didnt let people interrogate him or his children about her whereabouts and didnt put any blame on her like most husbands in that time would He seemed to know where she was because if he didnt how would he be so calmPeople thought of her as a very strange woman and my aunt agrees that she probably was Her life was always filled with events and actions that were in that time and place unacceptable and punishable but she always got away with it and people tolerated itNow if you can imagine a woman more than  years ago disappearing from her home from her husband and children and then coming back like nothing happened  AND them just accepting it the way it isWell thats how it wasIf you can imagine her father a very VERY strict conservative even for that time which was obviously much much more than  years ago tolerating her disappearances even as a young woman under his roof  well yes you can see why would she be thought of as weirdIt was a time when a girl could be punished for going for a walk if her father disagrees and my greatgrandmother would just disappear be gone for weeks and then come back No one seemed to be bothered by it no one caredNow obviously we cant be sure about this because we have not met our greatgrandmother or greatgrandfather but I think that neither my grandmothers sister or my aunt have a reason to lie about it Its not like the grandmothers sister knew about what would happen to me so that shed fuck with my head or that my aunt would choose to tell me strange things in a time like thisBut to get back to the story  there were quite a few strange events in my greatgrandmothers life and most of them she went through with a friend My aunt didnt know her name but she knows everyone elses names so that was strange not that I dont believe her she doesnt know it just seems as an unlikely coincidence that I cant in any way find out this womans real name and then theres a friend whose name my aunt cant remember even though she remembers everyone elses but she described her as a pretty energetic girl always on the run also strangeNobody knew much about her people didnt know her parents or siblings or any family in general  but they never questionedThats what I find strange Its a rural area in an underdeveloped country a decades ago Wouldnt people find it strange that theres a young girl just walking around and no one knew who she really was and anything about her familyWell Im sure people would try to interrogate her to spy on her to do a research I mean I bet there was all this womans honor talk going on about her behavior rightWell there wasnt No one doubted her for her ways OR the shit my greatgrandmother pulled while she was friends with herHowever unlike my grandmother who seems to be terrified of the woman  my aunt says that my grandmothers sister remembers that my greatgrandmother talked about a great friend you can always rely on and said something like if you need her shell be there shell ALWAYS be there whenever you need her and they were introduced to each otherMy grandmothers sister  which is actually called a great or grand aunt and I just found that out  seems to have liked her and had a very nice opinion about her My aunt told me she wouldnt be afraid if she were me because if my greatgrandmother liked her so much and even introduced her to her child then why would I be afraidNow Im confusedShould I try to talk to her again get to know her just let her in my life or should I listen to my grandmother and stay away,1385503184.0,Who is this woman  Part ,11,nosleep,top_week

kailey,0,7,1r8ylh,1,So about a year and a half ago my family moved into an old farm house that was built near the end of the s My whole family absolutely hated it there but I was oddly drawn to it and loved it I have no idea why On the first night we stayed there my best friend stayed the night with me because the first night is always creepy no matter what Now supernatural things were drawn to my best friend She could sense them and they always came to her Once she stepped foot in that house she wanted to leave But of course she refrained from telling me until after I moved out She also didnt tell me about what happened while I was asleep Before we went to bed we decided to watch a movie Then we just left it on the main menu and went to bed I guess around  AM she woke up to a bang in my room From where she couldnt exactly tell But it was definitely my room Then the tv went out to that gray and black fuzz and really loud for about  seconds then went back to the main menu She said she was shaking from fear She refused to come over anytime I invited her after thatAgain she didnt tell me about any feelings or anything until after I moved outIve always been interested with the supernatural but nothing of the sort is drawn to me Im kind of happy about that kind of sad But I mustve been the most interesting for whatever was in that house because it was drawn to me and it made it clearThis house had two bedrooms upstairs two bedrooms downstairs It also had a living room that was recently built onto it so it had separate air condition and furnaceIt was midwinter and the furnace on the original part of the house wouldnt work At all We got it checked out probably  or  times and they couldnt figure out why it wasnt working My sister and I had the rooms upstairs but she couldnt handle the cold so she ended up sleeping in the living room with the separate furnace so I was alone on that floor Around the second week we were there I was getting into bed with my  blankets and multiple pants and sweatshirts because of how freezing it was when suddenly I heard a huge BANG on my door This freaked me out so I just grabbed my bible and prayed for whatever it was to go away until I felt better Then it started happening every single night when I got into bed Eventually it didnt bother me Like whatever was out there was just wishing me goodnight or somethingIn my room I had a guitar and keyboard One night around  I woke up to the sound my guitar strumming Assuming it had fallen over I got up to pick it up then when I got there it was still exactly where I left it Confused and a little freaked out I just decided to go back to bed Then the next night I woke up to light I sat up and saw my keyboard lighting up like it was being played Then I got even more freaked outThe bangs along with this demon ghost thing playing with my instruments happened almost every nightDuring the four months I lived in the house I went into a depression Which is really only weird because I never have before or after I didnt do anything I slept all day I didnt eat I was mean to everyone I really hated myself and I contemplated suicide Also I had a migraine Not multiple migraines A migraine that literally never went away the entire time I lived there I tried multiple different prescribed medicines and all of them just made it worseThe weird thing is practically the day I moved out it all stopped I wasnt depressed anymore My migraine went away I was just happy againAfter realizing the coincidence I looked up some stuff knowing that there was something in that house Depression can be form of possession Not as bad as all the stuff you see in movies with them becoming demons and doing back bends and crap But Im positive that whatever was in there attached itself to me And by the way it made me feel it seems like it wanted me to hurt myself This story might not send chills down your spin like some others do but I cant even think about it without being terrified And the weird part is I have to pass that house everyday and Im still drawn to it It feels like home ,1385159349.0,It feels like home,8,nosleep,top_week

Foundations,0,2,1rhbzy,2,Read Part  here httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsyngvconnectedIt has been a little over a year since I last wrote  just over a year since the last nightmare  I was foolish to think I was somehow cured that as Dr Lough suggested getting it out of my head and into a journal would helpI read back over my last and only journal entry as I tried to describe the nightmare  It is so chaotic and scattered yet Im unable to find any other way to convey the details  That is the terror of the dream at its core  utterly chaotic  Jerking from one sensation to the next the hesitant probing of my fingers as they cover the smooth flesh where my eyes should be to the damp defeat in realizing those fingers have torn away the protective lids in confusion  All of this in layers of sleep  waking to the comfort of my mothers figure only to then know it is just another stage of the dream playing out with her eerie voice echoing through my bodyYoure connected nowEven now in understanding that my last entry seemed to bleed out through the pages Im struggling to form coherent thoughts onto this paper  Each detail seems to tie into the next only to fall apart when I try to see the whole  I wonder what type of clinical association Dr Lough could make  Is this what schizophrenia feels like  I have no way to explain it  It is as though there is a novelists grand plot line swirling around my body in paper shreds and each time I reach out I can snatch only a sliver of a scene unable to ever piece the parts into an understanding  Im fairly certain this entry and perhaps any subsequent entries will be just as erratic  I just cannot force these thoughts togetherSo much has changed in the last year it is so hard to recall my state of mind the last time the nightmare came to me  I have a son now nearly  months old  We must have just found out Rachel was pregnant around the time I last wrote  Could that have been a factor in the nightmare returning after years of peace  Was my mind so overwhelmed with the thought of being a father the changes to my life the responsibility it somehow dredged that old horror back from my subconscious  I cant help but think it must have played a role  It has been a blur so many other things seem to have fallen into place  Though they are exciting it seems predetermined somehow rushedOver the last decade I have had a slight obsession with the home I grew up in  I knew I would live there once again  returning it to ownership in my family  though I never anticipated it would happen so quickly  Rachels grandmother died leaving her an inheritance that allowed us to leap forward several years in our plans together  It was Christmas Day the day she died  I guess her last gift to us  Three months after my son was born we were moving back into the mountains back to the walls I had called home as a boy  One thing I feel for certain this home is the source  The nightmare started here always took place here was always fueled here  Im beginning to remember things or have recurrent thoughts I have not had for nearly two decades  It is as though these things are unlocked from muscle memory as I walk this houseAs a child I would reach the top of the second floor staircase which opened onto a hallway always with my head down staring at my feet  Left at the end of a long hallway was a guest room  Large floor to ceiling windows would reflect back a warped view of the person looking down to them  Right across a short landing was my bedroom  I had trained myself to never look left at night  as the small nightlight by my bedroom door would throw twisted shadows onto my reflection in the long guest room windows  If I would look up I would become stuck in fear with the reflection  The windows seemed to pulse with my heartbeat flexing my body larger then smaller in the glass  My feet became rooted in place the black of the windows and the emptiness behind them tunneling out for me  The nightlight would flicker in then out each time causing my shape to jump forward as though I were being pulled down the hallway towards the darkness  I never remembered breaking loose turning and walking back to my bedroom and going to sleep  I would wake up in my bed hours later staring at my hands inspecting for blood and knowing I just had the nightmare I learned I kept my head down and did not look to the leftOur first night in the home that muscle memory followed suit  After turning off the main floor lights I climbed the staircase  My son was sleeping against my chest his arms wrapped around my neck and shoulder  My head was down as I crested the top step turning to the right towards my room which was now his  As I neared the bedroom door his forehead left my shoulder  His back straightened and his arm peeled away from my neck  I felt his arm extend straight back behind my head  I didnt need to look at his eyes I knew  Those eyes followed his arm to his hand reaching down the hallway to the

dagronBorn,1,2,1rcebp,2,For some reason or another the paranormal loves my family No matter where would move or what kind of cleansing ritual we would perform something would make itself known The earliest account that I can personally remember is from the age of five when my family and I had recently rented out an old house in desperate need of repairs My father struck a deal with the landlord that if they were to bring the rent down considerably he would fix up the place which would in turn up the property valueThe house sat on a few acres of land and had toolshed in the back of the property which contained an old sealed off well this doesnt play into the story at all like the ring or some shit like that The house was a small single story home that was separated into two halves by dividing wall but were connected via an old red accoridonstyle doors that had been faded with time The left side of the house was cold Always cold even in the heat of the Texas summer we moved in There wasnt much to the left side of the house except for large sitting room and and old restroom that was filled with old junk that had been left behind by the previous tenants I can still fell the cold upon my skin and the invisible eyes that seemed to stare from every corner of the room Needless to say I never ventured into that room unless I was heading out the front door that just had to be on the left side of the houseThe right side of the house wasnt that bad I never remember it feeling uncomfortably or eerily cold and the feeling of being watched wasnt there The right side of the house contained the living room kitchen my parents room my younger brothers he was just about two years old at this time room  my room and the tiny bathroom we all shared  For the first few weeks everything seemed normal like this was going to be the first place in a long while we wouldnt have to pick and move suddenly my family was like a roaming pack of gypsies when I was younger never staying anywhere for too long But oh did we have another thing comingThe first unexplained phenomena I can remember was the soft sweet voice of a woman who I would sometimes mistake for my mother calling my name I would bound into whatever room my mother was in to see what she wanted only to find out that she had not called for me I brushed it off thinking that I was just hearing things that werent there just a case of a childs overactive imagination Until it kept happening Every God Damn DayThe second thing I noticed were my toys I had fixation as a child to set up all my action figures along my room on whatever ledge was available Window sill Check Dresser Check Makeshift step pyramid like display created from VHS tapes You bet Whenever I would leave my room to visit the restroom or get a drink from the kitchen and then come back to my room my toys would either be facing the opposite direction I had placed them or they would be knocked to the ground with enough force to actually break more than a few And like the voice I tried to explain it away until I eventually started to place my toys in a shoebox under my bed so that they would be safe I still miss all the brave action figures that I lost to that house Rest in pieces my dear friendsThe next few occurrences I witnessed firsthand and they involve my younger brother Cody my brother would be heard giggling and laughing and cooing in his room and if you were to check on him to see what was so funny the rocking chair in the room would cease to rock as if someone saw you come in and stopped rocking And if you attempted to remove Cody from his crib he would scream and cry and reach for the rocking chair When he was older but still young enough to remember he once asked about the ugly lady with the pretty voice who would sing to him and make him laugh One night when we were all sleeping soundly in out beds my father gets in from a long day of construction work only to be greeted by a crying toddler in need of a diaper change My father went into Codys room picked him up and set him down on the changing table After cleaning up my brother and laying him back down in his crib my father was free to go to sleep himself The second his head hit the pillow though he heard a commotion coming from Codys room He gets up grabs his  and checks it out thinking an intruder may have used Codys room as their entrance point Instead he is met with diapers strewn all over the floor There was a shelf above the table that my parents placed the diapers and wipes on and the diapers were stacked neatly enough were they wouldnt tumble He thinks nothing of it stacks them a few less this time and them proceeds to head back to bed Then he hears it again He walks back to the room to find the diapers on the ground again My father stacks them up a little less this time then goes back to bed This same routine happens for the next hour and half at one point he had put a solitary diaper on the shelf only to have it thrown on the ground soon after by some unseen force It was them that my father knew it was time to move againThat next week we rented a uhaul and began packing We had just finished packing and moving everything to the truck and my dad was the last person coming out of the house Everyone else was outside myself included My father had large box he as carrying out to the truck and was passing through the accordion door when something pushed the door shut on him hard enough that it took it my mom and myself to pry it open He at first thought I was playing some kind of joke on him but was even more fired up to leave once he learned I had been nowhere near that doorThe last I heard about that property was when I did a google map search only to find the parking lot of a WalMart I always wonder if they have a problem in the baby aisle Specifically with the diapers ,1385291574.0,First they want us gone they they dont want us leave,4,nosleep,top_week

whiskeythefoxtrot,1,1,1rqd1h,0,Ok so this starts out when i was living with my folks  They had built a house in an old field that was being turned into a neighborhood at the time  The house was completed in  i think so I was  at the time  First few months of living there life went on as advertised then about  months in my stepmom came home and found the backdoor was wide open  My parents checked to make sure nothing was stolen and installed a deadbolt on the door we thought that gusts of wind forced the door open  Another month went by without incident until my dad came home tobfind the back door wide open again with deadbolt unlocked  I should note that dad is a paranoid bastard and double checks all the doors before he goes to work in the morning and makes surevthe deadbolt and regular locks are locked in place  After that we got a security system installed and changed the locks to the front and back door and changed the code to the garage door again paranoid  For the next few months or so the door would be deadbolted shut somehow open when noones home trip the alarm system and send cops rushing to our house  Eventually it stopped on its own but we never did find out the cause  Skip forward to when i was either  or  and home for the summer  I was sitting in the living room by the offending door watching tv all of the sudden the damn door flies open and slams into the wall  I hauled ass out of the house to my buddys house and didnt come back until my folks came home from workNot long after the door made me run like a two year old girl from the house i started hearing humming randomly when i was alone in the house  I heard it mostly in my room but also in the living room where the back door is the kitchen and the laundry room  By this point I think my parents were starting to question my sanity because I asked them a few times if they were humming or heard humming and all I got in return were some wierd looks and jokes about my hearing  By the time I was  or so I started having dreams about a figure standing somewhere in my room and humming the same little tune I heard before  I decided not to tell my parents  Close to my th birthday the dream and the figure became more vivid the figure looked like a fairly short teenage girl with dark hair and wearing a baby blue short dress  I heard humming all the time at myhouse by this point  Then one night I was home alone and listening to my radio and cleaning my shotgun when all of the smoke alarms started going off at the same time  After running around my house with a fire extinguisher all the smoke alarms went off and there was no sign of smoke in the houseBy  the dreams and humming were a regular occurence with added bonus of seeing movement out of the corner of my eye  By this point my girlfriend and I would come to my house when my folks werent home tostudy  One time while we wereprestudyingwe both heard a woman scream and the door going to tje garage slam  Thinking my stepmom had come home early and figured out my girlfriend was at our house to study i tore into the kitchen after telling my gf to climb out the window  But when i got to the door noone was home  We were still alone  After stopping my gf from climbing out my window we both decided to leave and unfortunately she never came back to my house while it was just the two of us  Which sucked  After that the dreams got worse and the woman in the dreams seemed a lot more hostile  In my dreams she would stand directly overvmy bed and stare at me  She wouldnt hum or move Id get this intense feeling of dread everytime  The dreams got so bad that I wouldnt sleep  I was scared shitless to be honest  I would come home and stuff on shelves would be knocked over tv would be on nothing but static  I hated that house by this point  Not long after things got this bad I graduated and joined the Air Force  Ever since then I havent seen her or heard any humming  I think it helped that Im  hrs away  My Dad and stepmom split and they sold the house  But everytime I go home on leave I drive through my old neighborhood and that house is always for sale ,1385759360.0,Want someone to shed some light on a few older experiences,1,nosleep,top_week

ReiKoroshiya,0,1,1rgsca,1,Here I am and im going to write about some of the things that go on in my life Sorry for bombarding you with some trivial things and please just hear me outhow about I start at the beginning that seems easier Well back in elementary I was that kid the kid that really no one liked I had a friend here and there but thats about it I was basically a social outcast I never really got my work done I still dont Note that I was a very very angry child and no I was not spoiled if thats what your thinking im the oldest of  kids who had been and are growing up in poverty but my father is very good at managing money which means he is very cheapI had shared a room with my younger brother and for some reason I never grew out of the stage where you sleep with your blankets over your head I had always liked horror even though none of it really scared me even in elementary in the rd grade I found an author by thename of RLStine and I had read tons of his books which remotely captured my interestsA few of the simple things had scared me and I most likely have experiences that I have blocked out of my mind I dont remember much about my childhood at allI dont know why I cant but thats just how it is I do remember bits and pieces though not anything like birthdays mind you Here Ile give some examples I rememberwhen I thought my stuffed animal had red eyes I freaked out a little bit called my parents and my father calmed me down and took it away Years later I went back and found it and of course it wasnt scary anymore Another examplewould be when I saw a witch in my closet but again my father came in and turned the light on to show me that there was nothing there I had clearly saw something but it was gone as soon as the light turned back onOnce he had left and turned the light back of the figure was back again I remember when my body shot up in bed and I let out a blood curtling scream and my parents rushed into the roomand they had tried to comfort me and to calm me down I was bawling my eyes out while hugging my father he had asked me what had happened and I was just mumbling incoherently about it I cant remember what it was that had freaked me out so badly Something else that just pokes out at me was when I was lying in bed and I hear talking so I sit up strait in bed and I see my parents right there talking to each other I couldnt understand what they were saying because they were mumbling and I said hey and they say love you simultaneously and I said aww I love you too you guys I reached out to hug them and they both just vanished and I almost fell out of bedI got top bunk Then their are the things that I have learned from my family throughout the years not much reallythey dont seem to want to talk much about when I was younger I got that I was a horrible child when they brought me to church and that I would bite and snarl when anyone got within an arms reach of mekeep in mind I dont remember that about going to church as a matter of fact I dont remember going to church at all hmmm well skip forward to middle school where I hadactually made friends I did got in so much trouble in middle school its not even funny I could barely even go a week without at least one detention Saturday school and suspensions I had gotten a ton too nowdrugs are prevalent where I live and when I say that drugs were prevalent I truly mean that but honestly the thought of drugs never really appealed to me well I meancertain ones that is the only mind altering substance that I would actually want to do smoke drink etc would be alcohol cause it seems fun and really any hallucinogenic drug and thereis no way I could get ahold of hallucinogenic drugs without paying a ton of money and with my broke ass I cant afford it and because of that im drug free Not to muchhappened in middle school only a few things I started to get hellish demonic dreams oh and speaking of dreams I have always been able to feel pain in my dreams so ifsay I was to get ran through with a spear or had my flesh pealed off in a dream I would wake up and still feel it I also talk in my sleep which sucks ass The vast majority of my dreams became violent and with me being an avid gamer there was usually a sword nearby in my dreams and usually I could and would fight back and be homefree I enjoyed those violent dreams where I won even though I would battle hellish creatures and people I wouldnt consider it a nightmare I got my own room in the basement which was nice and well my brother he was how do you put it Gassy so yeah hot air rises and all that Electronic malfunctions had started occurring like waking up to my radio playing static my alarm clock started to malfunction etc I remember waking up minutes before my alarm clock went off I awoke with a shot of electricity to my left ear Skip forward to highschool in the th grade I found out what creepypasta and scp were it was amazing to find real horror for a changeI read the hell out of creepypastas and found some really cool narrators for them listening to those was very enjoyable I didnt read scps often and I found a very long series called the holdersNear the end of the year I started to feel a presence in my room which was interesting because it didnt have a bad feeling to it the only word that comes to mind to describe it would be light if that makes any senseJump forward one more year I had flunked my freshman year because I dont do my work On those professional tests that they make you take SATs or some shit I did insanely good on those like I should be an A student overall Now i reside in alternative ed Im  right now I declared to my parents that im agnostic instead ofBaptist a few months ago Anyway that presence in my room i hardly feel it anymore and now there is something more sinister and not just in my room anymoreThat thing I actually saw it I fucking saw it it was short like about a foot and a half tall I went to bed last night and you know how earlier I had said I sleepwith my blankets over my head Well I was moving around under the covers and I glanced out underneath the covers and there it was just staring at me a few inches away from my face I had to resist not to punch it because half of me was saying its just my imagination and the other half says that if its real  then im going to freak the fuck out and well I never did hit it and its creepy as fuck that its been watching me I tried to calm my breathing as to not alert it to the fact that I have seen it Ithink it knows I saw it because I have been getting glances of it all day It might have seen me and it might be watching me type thisIt is very short and I can never manage to see any features on its face it just looks dark like a shadow its really really dark everything distorts when I look at it like my depth perception gets thrown off and space distorts around itIf anyone knows what this might beplease tell me,1385432918.0,My

gogo,1,8,1rdw2r,0,You know when you are really young youre afraid of the dark You get a night light to make it better but there is always that sense of fear Is it simply because its dark maybe theres a monster in your closet or maybe its just in your nature Sure your parents tell you its nothing and when you get older you grow out of it but there is always something in the back of your mind that makes you afraid of it Maybe your claustrophobic of the thought of the darkness surrounding you consuming you to the point where you are trapped not seeing the light again Maybe your afraid something is watching you sleep Someone who you dont know just watching waiting for the right time to do whatever he or it wants to do Kill you Kidnap you to a horrible place maybe Then you think its all in your head and its just fine Until you hear a noise and you see the door opening and you dont even remember seeing whatever it is ever in your life its a tall dark humanoid staring at you with bright eyes It reaches its hand with such long fingers at you and it comes towards you It puts its hand over your mouth leans towards you it says shhhhh and it reveals a hideous smile  ,1385341510.0,The Dark,7,nosleep,top_week
cavs,10,4,1rd3m8,1,The following is a recount of a dream I had last night  This is my first time posting here and writing something like this so Im sorry if its poorly written or riddled with mistakes  Also Im awful at titles  Thanks for reading I struggle to stay awake at my deskGo home cavs theres nothing going on todayThank you  Why was I even here today its SaturdayGrumbling to myself I drag my feet to the car get in and turn the key  Nothing  Just great  Well at least its only about a threemile walk home  I pocket my keys and think about grabbing my rescue knife for just a fleeting moment  Its not the best of neighborhoods but I should be fine walking home  Leave itAs I make my way down the street passing one unspectacular building after another I notice an attractive woman walking a few steps ahead of me  I smile to myself and try to remember the last time Ive been with a woman  She glances back notices me leering at her like an inexperienced teenager She slows down  Is she smiling at me Hey there youre looking a little down  Whats wrongNnothing Its a wonder I was able to stammer out any sort of reply  Shes gorgeous why talk to me  Soft face with bright blue eyes that I could only stare at in wonder Plump lips coated in pink oily lipgloss  Her jet black hair billowing lazily in the wind  That damn smile  Well I was looking to have a good time and youre more than welcome to join me hun  For a price Oh now it makes sense Well screw it why not I nod my head in reply and agree  I follow her mind wandering onto moreprimal needs  I should have been paying attention to my surroundings noting the darker and more abandoned area where I was being led  Were walking up old brittle concrete steps that must have been laid down decades ago before I think clearly again  Too late to take note of my surroundings now  The iron railing I grasp is cold and worn down but rough from all the years of exposure  The air is thick heavy and smells moldy  How can someone even breathe in thereWe enter the loft  Was there something on the door  Did she give me a name I cant remember anything What was I doing here again  My view suddenly shifts to something out of an old video game  I get a birds eye view of the place Its all pixelated bit graphics  One other woman was walking around but I cant make out any of her features  This isodd  I feel a light touch on my shoulder and the whisper of soft words stealing my attention away from everything else to once again focus solely on her  Her breath was warm causing shivers to tremor throughout my body  My view violently shifts back to my own eyes  I look to the beautiful mysterious woman with nothing but a blank look in my eyes  Make yourself comfortable on the bed over there  Well have to wait for our bodyguard to get her before we can have any fun  He cant make it until the night so until then relax I should have found that last statement weird  What time was it  Wasnt it dark out when we were walking here  Why do we have to wait for a bodyguard now  Im already here  If I were to do something wouldnt I have already done it  Forget it  I flop onto the bed and lay down on my back right leg extended while the left is pulled up as if Im mirroring the number four with my legs  The other indistinguishable woman joins us  She cuddled up next to me on my right side further emptying my head of what little rational thoughts I had left  That sweet voice was back in my left ear talking to me as if I was the most important person in the world  When did she make it onto the bed  Wasnt she just standing by the doorway  She drapes her unnaturally soft leg over my left leg and blithely draws random designs onto my chest with her fingertips Alright baby relax well be having fun before you know itI cant wipe this stupid smile off my face  I close my eyes for what seems like a moment  When I open them something is wrong  Very wrong  The room that seemed so inviting is now dark and cold  I cant see a doorway just an empty shadowy space that seemed to stretch open like a hungry maw twisting my vision as the room seemed spin uncontrollably  My heart pounds in my chest  I look to my right where the other woman once was  Shes gone  The familiar weight is on my left but I cant move my leg  I need to get up  I need to leave  I cant be here anymore  Get off me  The form next to me shifts straddles me  Her arms are straight each palm flat firmly planted next to my shoulders  The long black hair is in my face  I can feel it faintly brush against my skin  I try to move her off of me but she wont budge  Im pinned down like a helpless prisoner  She slowly begins to raise her head  I notice her once beautiful eyes are now shut  Bulged gray eyelids are all that I can see  Her entire face is now dull pocked with blemishes  I start to breathe heavily close to hyperventilating  The head continues to rise  Wake up  Oh God wake up Sometimes wrong  I try to move again  My legs wont work  My arms wont work  I cant tear away my eyes from her dead leaden face  I start to scream  My eyes snap open  Im home in bed  I still cant move my legs  Theres heavy pressure on my chest and I cant stop breathing heavily  Theres a slight outline of a woman above me face now unrecognizable  I can still feel her hair on my face   Get it off  Was she laughter at me before I woke up Roll over  Turn on the TV or light or something Anything  RelaxrelaxIm never sleeping on my back again   ,1385320388.0,Lookin for a Good Time,5,nosleep,top_week

aVolforLife,4,2,1rp4hb,1,Most of you reading this probably have had a dream at some time that was so vivid so real that it becomes indistinguishable from reality I have And though these dreams ocurred when I was very young they still haunt me Sometimes at night under the correct conditions I find myself unable to move breathless  paralyzed  Im  now but this is the first dream that I can remember I can remember it vividly because for a period of about a year it is the only dream I had Before I get too far ahead of myself I should tell you about me I always feel bad talking about my childhood as comparatively mine was perfect I grew up in a very happy home My parents are well educated professional types and I was their first child We lived in rural Tennessee in a two  story house overlooking a lake My bedroom was upstairs and had a sliding door that opened onto a balcony overlooking the lake and miles of hills and open sky Beautiful We werent a religious family odd for rural Tennessee but my family was very conservative I wasnt even allowed to watch Nickelodean due to content that my parents deemed questionable Hell they didnt let me see my first R rated movie until I was about  Needless to say I was a bit sheltered I was very creative and my parents still tell stories about how self sufficient I was I would read and draw and build models I spent a great deal of time alone in my head by choice Like most kids apparently I hated bed time Dreaded is probably the more proper turn of phrase  My parents being intellectuals not given to emotional overreaction would tuck me in and insist that I stay in my bed this time It seems for some time that my parents would wake and I would be asleep under or in a chair next to their bed I have no memory of getting up walking downstairs and crawling in the chair Im getting ahead of myself Back to bedtime and dread that sticks with meEvery night was the same routine Bath Pajamas Bed Usually one if not both parents would sit and read to me from Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland until I dozed off Before they would leave they would turn off my bedroom light turn on an old transistor radio with a little lighted clock on the front my own version of a night light and retire Usually they would leave the stairway light on like it was the dark that scared me The dark was harmless it was the dreams that were the problemThe dreams were always the same I would awaken at  according to the old flip style clock on the transistor radio front The only sound was the hiss the white noise of the channel that my parents had left softly playing early s pop the station must have gone off the air I guess my parents thought Don Henley Hall amp Oates and the stair light would keep my monsters at bay The dream always proceeded the same from there After I would reach over to turn off the radio I would roll back over away from the light in the hallway facing the sliding glass door to the balcony and try to go back to sleep Even writing this my heart is racing It always seemed brighter outside than it should be at night and the groans and creeks of the wooden balcony seemed unusual The white curtain that covered the door to the balcony always shifted the same way when that slow grinding sound began You know the sound Im describing The sound of the heavy glass door shifting along the rollers in the tracks And thenIt was like I awakened from a dream but still dreaming Groggy in a blinding white room uncapable of the slightest movement Why cant I move I cant move my head to find out I know Im laying in what would best be described as a crib and there are no distinguishing marks anywhere Everything is just white bright smooth A low bass hum permeates through me Almost inaudible but it is a sound that is more felt than heard I begin to cry There is a feeling that someone is telling me its okay dont cry this will be over soon and everything will be okay Another personality I cant say a voice because there was no sound but another personality says to distract me A ball appears to my right hovering feet from my face It slowly moves from right to left floating until it disappears Then it floats from left back to right No ball travels this slow without falling Its as if Im weightlessThe dream always ends the same A pair of huge black eyes inches from mine Cold Inhuman Souless Clinical Without empathyI wake in my parents room Those dreams never returned but a few years later we moved to Louisiana This time we bought a house that overlooked hundreds of acres of swampy marshland My bedroom had a huge window I always felt as if I was being watched I never had the dreams but there were times when I would wake up in other rooms of the house Sometimes in my closet curled up sometimes in my sisters room under her bedYears later my parents asked if I remember that year that I had trouble sleeping They laughed at the story commenting on how thoughtful I was as a kid I mean I even apparently turned off the radio every night before I would find my way downstairs in the dark Several years after that a senior in high school I was at a friends house We decided to rent a movie to scare us He chose a movie I had never heard of We watched it and it shook me so much that I threw up Ive never reacted like that to any movie especially not one so poorly acted To this day I cant walk past a copy of Fire in the

already know what happens Well not really know but I can feel it Who wrote it I can only assume it was my dear Uncle Drewson if hes even my uncle What is this No clue A note obviously but beyond that speculation reigns Where did I find this My new house in a drawer Nothing is inherently terrifying about that  Oh except that it was under the clothing I had already packed there I just missed it before I keep telling myself I half believe it A few pills later and Im not worrying about it anymoreBefore this I didnt even know I had an Uncle Drewson let alone that I was to inherit his estate in the event of his untimely but now enacted demise With a heavily estranged family growing up in between various friends or close relatives passed around by uncaring parents looking to shirk responsibility one loses track of aunts and uncles It was in a familiar neighborhood a spacious three bedroom so I was in no way eager to turn it down As a poor regularly unemployed person Id been accustomed to sleeping on generous friends floors in the all too often occurrence I couldnt afford anywhere else I thought itll all be worth it one day the day I make it in the world I can pay all these people back tenfold The day I make it yeah right A consistent  and more pressingly free  living space was a welcome antonym to my recent fortunes So I was moved in within a couple weeks Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened Till that note seemed to start some kind of vicious domino effect on my life I was contentYou know when you think back to something embarrassing stupid or otherwise shameful act you may have done in your younger brasher days Once you recall it it starts eating away regret seeping in to every corner of your thoughts till you would give the world to go back and change it or at least erase the memory Imagine that only you cant remember what it was youve done Its simply gone from you The more you try the less you realize The less you realize the more you regret The more you regret the more you try Thats whats happening to me ever since I moved here But it even goes past that Its the sudden feeling youre being watched from barely out of sight And at the same time a crushing loneliness in that feeling I pop a few more pills Of course Im not being watched Theres no one else here If you think youre being rather clever figuring this out ohnosomeonesbeeninthehousewithyouallalong I was most certainly the only one here Anyway this was about the time I found the note If it was this Drewson what is he talking about Who does he want back What is his need Do I even want to know the answer to any of these Insatiable curiosity will ensure I do personal preference notwithstanding Putting it all to the back of my mind I chop up steak for dinner I like to think of myself as a fairly accomplished chef particularly where matters of slicing andor dicing are concerned I once worked a sushi bar as a side job to pay the bills and was quite proud of my ability to launch various morsels into the air and sever them in two with one fell swipe like you see in commercials Until the day my knife slipped and nearly skewered a customers eyeball Maybe Im not quite as proficient as I thought I grab the bottle of pills and take a few I dont really like thinking about that time in my lifeIm digging through my drawer later that same drawer when I stumble upon another discovery Instead of a clue it only deepens my mystery A USB stick is secured to the very back of the board I carefully remove it and spend a few minutes simply gawking at my find my inner curiosity again sparring with my better senses I think this will perhaps answer some questions about the note and hopefully clear up my imaginations conjuring brought on by its conclusions implications As per your previous assumptions I couldnt be farther from the truth I secure the stick in its dock View files Two folders Reminders and Media Reminders is empty media contains one subfolder Vids I open the folder Two more memories and triggers Memories is empty I open triggers Im confronted with one video file shotinthedarkwmv Its  long I press playBefore I continue if youll permit me one aside to validate the severity of this Im a massive horror movie fan and I like them brutal The more blood and guts the better I like truly graphic heart wrenching stuff and I very rarely squirm at it Three seconds into shotinthedarkwmv and I rushed over the trash can to puke what felt like my very soul out The scene Im immediately confronted with was a man on a chair wearing nothing but an undershirt and briefs There is a single light source on the chair but I can faintly make out a figure in the background Then without a word the mans brains are ejected out his face accompanied with a thunderous bang Bone and cartilage spew forth in the foreground Nearly black red sludge runs down his white undershirt accompanied with brain matter that had just been crackling with life likely flooded by fear but life I dont have too much time to process anymore Im preoccupied with regurgitating my expertly made steak into the wastebasket I think it must be fake but I know its not Ive got to tell someone about this I think the police someone Yeah Ill talk to the cops Then over my subsiding retching I hear a familiar voice utter Are you sorry now in the tone of a disappointed parent talking to their disobedient toddler Something in that voice is chilling Something I return my gaze to the computer screen where the barely visible figure now stands in full view smilingI recognize the smile tooIts me smiling back at myself gripping a smoking sawed offThe computer screen goes black My head spins I lie down,1385445807.0,Are you sorry Part ,3,nosleep,top_week
highchairchildren,6,3,1rgqmu,0,Im looking for any input If anyone has had experiences like this is there a way to stop itSo this started about two years ago In the beginning it was just a perpetual bad feeling like something bad was going to happen all the time  I was anxious always alert and never at rest I hardly slept primarily keeping myself awake in order to feel safer Then I started seeing thingsWhen I say seeings things I dont mean like hallucinations well not really Im not crazy There were never any voices and there never have been It was more like a blackout moment in which the worst possible scenario for my environment would play out seemingly right before my eyes Mostly accidents  It happened once while I was sledding  The hill was a steep drop and then inclined back up about  ft or so where it met a busy road Usually people lost momentum and slid back down the hill and came to a rest in the valley but sometimes people would make it all the way up and hit the metal road block that was put up along the hill A watched as a kid went down the hill and then it happened I continued to watch as he went all the way back up the hill and under the metal road block right into the speeding car that was passing by There was blood everywhere I snapped back to reality and looked around Everything was fine There was no blood nobody was hurt just kids sledding around having fun I continued to have random visions for the entire year They varied in severity The worst one left me shaken for a few days afterwards  I was home babysitting my younger sisters and boiling pot of spaghetti for dinner  I moved to the sink to strain the pasta and then went back to turn off the electric stove  My little sister approached me to ask a question and then I had my flash  As I was seeing it I grabbed her by her hair and pressed her face into the stove In that moments I watched as her eyes rolled around in her head and she screamed begging me to stop  I snapped back and couldnt speak I teared up and thought I was going to puke  I ran to the bathroom washed my face sat down on the ground and cried I had never felt such a mixture of fear and remorse in my life I got up and reentered the kitchen finished dinner and continued the night as if nothing happened  She asked me what was wrong and I played it off as a bout of sickness  I sat awake for hours that night and I still couldnt come up with a reason for why this kept happening to me  I asked my mom to see a psychiatrist but unfortunately it was a luxury we simply couldnt afford Then it stopped As quickly as it came in it left and I had no more of an idea about what it was than Id had before  It stayed away for a while I mean really a long time  I was vision free for an entire yearI was prompted to write this because I had another one the other  The first in over a year but I am scared I dont want it to start again  The most recent one was more subtle  I was shaving in the shower went as I brought the razor up my leg somehow or another I cut myself and there was blood everywhere  The tub was washed red with it and there was nothing I could do but stand and watch as it oozed out of my leg and swirled around in the water before going down the drain  Then I flashed back and it wasnt there I hadnt even cut myselfI know this must sound crazy like some Final Destination bullshit  I swear to you I wouldnt have posted it if I didnt have hopes that someone could help  Any input is welcomed,1385431650.0,Can anyone help,3,nosleep,top_week
InsaneFang,2,3,1rdykh,0,It was a very dark night I opened my eyes in the dark and I watched the shadows stretch over my room The trees moved in the night air and made the shadows in my room move and form together and look like monsters I watched the shadows which actually do not help to watch for they only offer uneasiness to the human soul and you find no comfort If I hadnt watched those shadows I wouldnt have noticed the slight movement that didnt go exactly with the shadows It was dark and I felt I was probably seeing something But I thought I saw a dark shape in those shadows It moved like the shadows but it moved slower and I thought I heard the soft scrape of a boot I watched the shadows ever moving I felt fear grip my heart I felt there was something there just watching me silently in those darkest shadows I wanted to hop out of the bed and rush out the door but I feared that if my feet touched the floor then that thing or something else would surely get me I heard a sound from behind me and being in the frightened state I was in I about fell out of the bed Clinging to the side of the bed tangled in the blankets and sheets I felt like I was about to die I looked up for the source of the sound and it was just a tree branch scratching the window I felt relieved at this and I kind of relaxed forgetting about the thing in the shadows I pulled myself back into my bed turned and saw a darkened shape at the end of my bed I felt the fear shoot through me again I felt no thoughts nothing only the cold dark fear I watched as the shape moved ever closer to my bed I felt paralyzed as if I couldnt move speak or let alone do anything The shape moved ever closer I felt a sound coming from the back of my throat but it never escaped my lips My mouth did not open nor did the sound fully come out The shape soon climbed slowly onto the bed and moved closer to the lumps under the blankets my legs I felt myself start to tremble but I still felt like I was super glued to my bed I wanted to close my eyes maybe it was a dream It kept climbing up my bed and I felt something off of it lightly slid against my leg I felt myself tremble and shake even more Soon the face was just inches from mine I felt its hot breath on me and the smell that emitted from its mouth wasnt that great either I wanted to turn away maybe get some fresh air but I felt still frozen It took one of its hands and pointed a finger at me Though I could not see very well it looked like instead of nails it had sharp claws It took the claw and lightly probed my face The pain of the claw protruding my skin was unimaginable It didnt feel like a cut from a knife or such It felt like someone was burning my face It took the claw and ran it down my whole face and the fiery feeling intensified Then I woke up trembling and drenched in cold sweat I was thankful that it was a dream But something about that dream made me still sit there terrified for my life I looked out the window at the cold moon shining its equally cold glow into my room making shadows Those shadows made me dwell more on my dream and I closed my eyes but all I could see in my mind was the dark shape crawling up my bedand then the unimaginable agony that came from that claw cutting a gash into my face I suddenly had the need to feel my face I reached up slowly my hand slightly trembling fearing that it wasnt a dream My hand finally connected with my face and from instincts I flinched but there was nothing there but cold sweat stained smooth skin I shuddered a sigh of relief I knew there was no getting back to sleep so I decided I might as well go downstairs and at least drink some tea or coffee maybe even milk Maybe itd calm me down I slid out of the bed and headed slowly down the stairs The silence was a little unnerving as I walked down the creaky steps The dream still haunted my mind I tried to shake the feeling that it gave me away but it just wouldnt fade from mind I finally reached the kitchen and turned on the light I opened up the refrigerator and pulled out the jug of milk I poured some into a glass and slid it into the microwave and heated it up Once done I pulled the warm glass out and I headed into the living room and turned on the TV to try to forget the dream The TVs light washed over the room and I watched as people spoke about things not at all important in this world I took a drink of my milk and watched the people on the screen I soon felt myself falling asleep I woke up the TV was off I didnt remember turning it off It was still dark out I looked at the clock it read  AM I swore it had to be later than that I pulled myself from my bed and I headed up the stairs to my room once more I laid there in my bed for what seemed like hours I rose up and looked at the clock it said  AM I blinked was the clock broken I walked over and unplugged it but it did not turn off It remained shining lightly in the dark reading  AM I backed into my bed and fell on top of it I heard something from the window I looked over and saw a face The features were inhuman I felt the fear paralyze me I couldnt look past the face staring at me Where its eyes should be were empty looming dark sockets the nose a pig snout and the teeth like a saber tooth tiger and it had black curly messy hair on its head It reached a hand up to open the window and I saw the unmistakable clawed fingers My nightmare had come to life I opened my mouth to scream but no sound emerged The window opened slowly and the creature quietly hit the floor It moved slowly towards me I heard its heavy breathing as it drew nearer and nearer still I closed my eyes hoping itd go away but fate would not help me there I felt a weight on my bed and my eyes shot open I looked into those looming sockets and then my mouth opened and I screamed The scream was not heard though It was as if the world was dead The creature took its claw up and slowly sliced my skin carefully and only in certain places as if it was a planned processfor some reason It finally crawled off me and left the room and closed the window softly I laid there in the bed bleeding slowly the pain ebbing out of my body feeling like hot hell fire Thats when I noticed my clock was off now I laid there relieved that it was gonebut those eyesthose dark looming eyes would burn my mind forever,1385343365.0,Dark Looming Eyes,3,nosleep,top_week
xcalubur,0,6,1r9pfe,0,This story takes place about  years agoI was working as a data entry clerk at the local newspaper  My hours were  but I would stay after  in order to complete my duties  I would also come in one Saturday a month to complete my month end duties  Often I was left by myself in my department  Nothing strange but I would always feel like I was being watched  Could never shake that feeling  I never felt that i was in danger and if I focused on the feeling long enough I would freak out a bitI finally came clean to some coworkers about that feeling  Of course they mocked me and asked the types of drugs I was using  Nothing major I knew they were having fun and just continued my duties  Later that same day my coworker Toon who was mocking me the most came to my desk  Mind you we had open cubicles two desks on one side  desks in the middle and three desks on the other side  I was part of the  desk area  She asked me to describe what was watching me  I explained to her it was a feeling and I never saw anything  oclock came around and everybody was gone  I was waiting for my  page end of week report to finish printing so I could drop them off on the desks of all the department heads  I was waiting at the  desk cubicle where the department printer was located  This was Gs desk  She had a whole bunch of pictures on her wall and I was just looking at each picture  Again that feeling of being watched came over me but stronger than before  I turned to my head and saw itrather her   feet away from me there was a head floating in the air  She was some sort of gray color  I was able to take in her features  Medium straight hair round face the hair kind of hugged her face  She popped like a bubble pops in the air  I was so anxious to get out of there so I could go home and get ready for my date with my girlfriend  I grabbed the report distributed them and I was out  On the  minute drive home I was reflecting on the day and playing it over in my head  Half way home I realized I came face to face with a ghost  ,1385182191.0,Face to Face,6,nosleep,top_week

many reasons But not to worry unless I specifically say that my posting days are over then the retelling of our experiences shall continueA recap on whos whowhat just for the heck of it Robby yo Thats me just turned  last halooween the slightly normal girl stuck with a bunch of crazy friends Regardless Im happy with the people Ive got even if they always end up getting me in trouble Since we needed to make official positions in the ParanormalJournalism Club and after seeing my posts in nosleep EthanClub President declared me as the clubs official writer My job description is to write down our experiences and basically be in charge of making memoirs of the group or whatever Indigo  yo  Hes my sort of adopted brother after the death of his father years ago Hes got night demon blood in his veinsbut I not very much sure what that means Ive seen him with glowing orange veins while kicking some peoplemonsters ass before so thats that Ethan  yo He insists on  A selfrighteous and selfproclaimed pedophile who is so proud of himself its basically narcissistic He claims to have ESP and has shown often times that this ability allows him to read people by touching them and gives him an enhanced intuition that almost makes him seem genius He tends to be impulsive but has proven to be a reliable leader of the groupand is now considered the founderpresident of the club Tania  yoAlso insists that shes younger than that Ethans childhood friend and current classmate shes a chronic blogger and spends most of her time in front of the internet or working as an assistant librarian for her scholarship An exmember of a Wiccan coven she carries around a strange book that only her kind can readprobably and occasionally practices spells in her free time Shes currently the clubs vicepresident Aiden  yo An almost stereotypical Asian kid with a penchant for studying he has a definingly adorable giggle that can be easily identified even in the noisiest of moments An unstable pyrokinetic he tries to balance helping the group outoften financially managing his fire  and trying to graduate earlier than everyone else Entitled to club researcherwe almost made him sponsor Jack  yoprobably Also Ethans childhood friend he has a tough guy act that tries to hide an incredibly sensitive and brotherly person Although usually absent during club meets he makes it up by being the groups muscle helping out with most physical activities and occasionally acting as bodyguard in dangerous situations He is called a Tikbalang from where he and Ethan came from but all Ive seen so far was his slightly inhuman strength and absurdly inhuman speed although research says he transforms to a halfhorse halfman kind of humanoid Right now hes just a member and not an officer until further notice Scarlett  yo ish in actuallity This cherublooking child whos the spitting image of a fairytale character with a red hood claims to have been born in the s with a paranormal twin stuck as her shadow Later on bitten by a werewolf her aging stopped while her adumbrant twin absorbed the doggy elements Having an unexpected knowledge in practical business administration she was given the job of being the clubs auditoradviser for future club events Claire  yo Shes my best friend but not a club member since shes already a part of our schools choir She and Ethan claim to be dating though I doubt theyll even get together since both of them tend to be immatureone way or another So far a normal person shes an avid fan of our club and has a desire to join us in our work Allonso  yo dog a nearly humansized Tibetan Mastiff God knows where Tania got itbut she said she and Ethan found it before while playing and decided to keep him He looks after everyone in the group and is very protective when threat arises He has no position in the clubfor obvious reasonsWhoo thats all so far and our introductionsemirecap was already long enough so I wont dillydally any furtherTime to waste some timeIt was sort of a fair but mostly for clubs and organizations The day was a Friday and most students were more than happy for a reason to skip class Although we nearly got disqualified as a club due to lack of members and org rules and all that Tania and Ethan managed to sweet talk our way in the OrgFair Aiden paid for all the supplies needed for our booth while Jack and Indie set it up Scarlett occasionally helps with her twin when no ones looking Before am our average sized booth was open for business with all members in high hopes to attract potential recruits Our booth was considerably discreet with just enough displays of urban legends and myths to attract but not to be superfluous We used most of Aidens budget to rent a milk tea standmuch to Scarletts objections so we could give free milk tea to anyone who inquires Claire was practicing for an upcoming mass so she couldnt visit us but promised to catch up once shes done Allonso was just loitering around doing dog stuff  I feel like were setting up the Mystery Shack I told Ethan as I tried  to pin some photos of ectoplasms and whatnot some probably faked Lets face it we faced some monsters all right but we didnt exactly get photos of them because we were too busy trying to stay alive    Thats what marketings all about Ethan replied acting proud of his major The truth comes second Illusions and tricks first Thats how society likes itright  People nowadays are very concerned more about image than anything else Tania explained with a smug grin in her face So weas future businessmen are giving them what they want  Nowadays Scarlett butted in holding a cotton candy she just bought Thats how it always was I call it the anglerfish mentality She started playing with her foodmoving it like a fish Attract them using a pretty image Then she munched on her food talking with her mouth full Thern lert ther ugry trutth swarlorw therm Its adorable how shes mature and childish at the same time Jack said from behind us brushing dirt off his pants Walking beside him Indie was playing with a hammer throwing it like a ball upwards and catching it as it falls As expected he missed after a while and the hammer fell flat on his feet It barely seemed to have fazed him I assumed his kind was probably built to survive those kind of accidents  Fuck I was proven wrong as Indie starts doing a jig while clutching his poor foot   I thought youre supposed to be invulnerable to pain or whateversince youre a night demon I told the dancing Indie  Im HALFNight Demon the invulnerability thing only works when Im in the zone He put a finger up to explain as he slowly set his damaged foot down Think of it having an on switch I need to be in the mood to actually activate it Ive been using it lately but havent figured out how exactly   All right everyonelook sharp Tania announced pushing us to our designated posts which is basically just handing out flyers  The events startingThe whole morning was just the whole group messing around handing out flyers that Tania designed and photocopied Our flyers which I wouldnt show a picture because its not very pleasing to the eye was just a bunch of paranormal photos combined in paint and a huge PARANORMAL JOURNALISM written on top in what looks like wordart Tania was very proud of her photoediting skills and none of us had the heart or the cruelty to shatter her enthusiasm I made a subtle note to Ethan to teach her how to use photoshop so hopefully next timeif there would be her art would be lessfatalWhen we were not handing out flyers we were explaining some of our experiences in the club Although we edited out some nittygritty partslike being set on fire or mauled by a werewolf the experiences we shared were mostly the same with what Ive already been through Of course since we were a parajournalism club we had to maintain the image of only investigating and writing down facts about supernaturalevents but not directly intervening Sometimes girls both young and old visit because of Ethan It seems he became famousor infamous for his effective life advice I have no idea how that worked though Ethan explained that some girls with problems just needed to hear a few nuggets of wisdom All he does is read their subconscious and base what he says on what they want to hear He said he does it for free but he still makes me feel like hes some kind of conman who tricks girlsBut most of the time our booth was ignored It was no shocker to me since we looked like a bunch of people who got drunk andor high and decided to make a worthless club Of coursethere were people with occult interests but most of them were smartasses who thought that we werent for real I cant blame them you watch too much horror movies that by the time its the real deal you have a hard time believing it  Their like those people who think watching zombie movies gives them a high advantage in case of a real zombiepocalypse Aiden said as one of said occult fans walked away saying our experience with a murderous book in the library was cliched and impossible He continued I mean sure you get a little smarterbut how you use that knowledge is still up to you  Take Ethanherefor example Jack said locking Ethan in a friendly head lock He watches so much porn and yet  Before Jack could finish Ethan countered him and in a split second he had Jacks hand behind himpinning him like a cop in a movie Youre one to talkBefore the two boys could even start roughhousing we noticed a boy about my age standing and watching us I recognized him and knew that he was also a classmate whose name I consistently forget Just like me he usually stays at the back of the room and rarely speaks up I looked him all over to make sure I was correct He had shortfrizzy hair that looks like it was barely combed He was a little taller than me but he was always slouched He wore a blueish checkered polo partnered with jeans Now if I could just remember his name  Davidright I askedhoping I remembered correctly He noddedthankfully preventing me any embarrassment I noticed he was holding some cotton candyScarlett ran up to him and asked how she could helpstealthily taking some cotton candy from the boy Instead of replyingthough he just smiled at her and walked closer to us We were all silentwaiting forsomething We didnt know what David wanted so were a little edgy  You solved problems withum He finally said with a smallshy voice He was struggling with what to sayso he looked around and pointed on a photo labeled POSSESSED OBJECT Possessed Objects you took care of those before  Yepwe stopped a cursed book from killing someone once Ethan said putting a hand on his shoulder A slight frown showed up on his face making me wonder if he read anything about Davids problem  My neighbors doll He said looking at each of uspossibly afraid that we would judge him or make fun of him I think its hauntedWe promised David wed meet him by his apartment after the fair which finished around  in the afternoon After a few minutes of walking around we finally found the place Ethan was sorry that he wouldnt be able to come with us because he had to accompany Claire home though he said that hell try to catch up In the meantime according to him Tania was left in charge of the group  Dont worry I remember her saying before we left school Ill be more responsible than you  That shouldnt be too hard He replied walking towards the university chapel where Claire was waiting for himAnyways we found ourselves in an average looking apartment You know the kind that looks decent enough but not too extravagant Its a fourstory apartment and David brought us to his room at the third There were five rooms in each floor although only three were currently being used Rooms  and  There used to be more tenants David said but ever since the hauntings people are moving out The only ones left includes his family a single middle aged man named Mr Jeff and the apartment janitor Guy and yes thats his name  If you ask me Jack whispered to Aidenalthough I can hear them as we were walking up the stairs the janitor is my prime suspect  For meAiden answered also in a whisper No evidence means no theory Im keeping my mind open for now He then crossed his arms like some kind of wiseguyWe were planning on introducing ourselves to Davids parents but found out that both of them were at work and wont be back until around  pm Deep inside I feel sorry for this boy whos stuck in an assumingly haunted place all on his own We huddled by their couch David explaining how he came to the conclusion that a possessed doll is somewhere in this apartmenthaunting tenantsgtThere was one time when he was fast asleep enjoying a saturday afternoon siesta  I didnt know kids your age enjoyor even do siesta Jack butted in receiving an annoyed nudge from ScarlettgtAnyway David was enjoying his siesta when he heard some light scraping in the hallway It sounded like a heavy piece of wood being dragged along the floorboards  Oh no Dont go outside Scarlett gasped loudlythen immediately covered her mouth when she realized what she did Jack was more than happy to return her nudgegtThe scraping woke David up wondering what the hell was going on outside With increasing curiosity he started walking to the door The sound of his footsteps were louder than he thought for the closer he got to the door the faster the scraping becamegtIt was as if someone was dragging somethingand is now hurrying up before someone finds outgtWhen David opened his door quick and without hesitation he looked around and saw no one on the hallway When he looked down there was a small porcelain doll lying on the floor near their roomgtBefore he could pick it up the sound of footsteps going up the stairs frightened him and he rushed back in the room He heard voices outside that sounded like on of the other tenants He heard enough to know that a young girl who lives in an adjacent room took the doll with herAs he finished a part of his story we began hearing something outside the roomAs if some strange movie cue we could hear a scraping sound The sound was definitely like wood being dragged on the floorsCrAaaaAPEScRaaaaapEThe scraping stopped right in front of the door all of us staring shocked at the possible source of the sound Part of me wished that Ethan was here so he could he read the door and find out whats on the other sideAfter an eternitywhich was actually just a few seconds of nobody moving or even breathing we heard it scraping away I dont know if my friends were genuinely creeped outthus preventing them from using their abilities or they actually listened to Ethan a while ago when he said  Now rememberguys I remember Ethan saying before dismissing us Im sure you understand how important it is for most of you to pretend human So only use your skills when really neededThats probably he reason why none of us moved to the door to investigate Or maybe they were really scared I know I am After a while when we were sure there was nothing outside Indie walked out to check if there was anything strange that got left behind To our dismayrelief there was nothing left outside  Not even markings on the floor Indie saidsitting back down with usgt David continued the story saying that a few days later the girl who took the doll was saying that it was haunted It sounded like something from a moviewith the doll occasionally found in different places every time they saw it One thing was for sure it looked like the doll was trying to leave David once heard gossip on how the girl left the toy in her bedonly to find it on the kitchen and afterwards closer and closer to their doorgt Unlike other parents the girls mom and dad actually believed her and decided to move out leaving the doll in their room  Is it still there Aiden askedraising his hand like a student Is the doll still in their roomDavid shook his head and continuedgt The janitorfor obvious reasons was cleaning room  in case someone else was going to rent it The janitor saw the doll andconsidering that it wasnt very clean put it in his trash bag for disposal The garbage collectors wont arrive until the next day so he kept his trash bags in an area by the buildings back doorgtThat night people from the second and first floor kept calling both the owner and the janitor to stop whatever animal was loudly rummaging through the trash bags The janitor and the owner checked saw the trash bags all disheveled with the garbage all over the place but no signs of an animal or anything that might have been there previouslygt After the doll started appearing in front of other peoples doorsand sometimes in random places of the building The rumor that it was haunted started spreading and more people started believing itgt Before long other tenants started leaving just to be safe Although the haunted doll hasnt exactly hurt anyone it still scared people enough to leave  If you just checked the rooms at random youd probably find the doll lying around somewhere David saidstanding up But you cant do that since the unused rooms are locked  Alright Tania saidlooking around Well see what we can find out First we need to ask aroundShe started pointing and appointing us on what we need to do In my opinion Ethan might be a good leader but Tania seems like a more responsible boss  Indie Aiden and Robby see if the other tenant is home and inquire David would it be alright if you go with them Tania asked and David noddedAfterwards she pointed to Scarlett and Jack to accompany her in talking to the janitor We were told to stay in contact through our cellphonesso that when we were all done we could ask the owner Even though the haunted doll was not considered a threat we still needed to be careful  Good afternoonsir I told the man who opened the doorinternally screaming because talking to strangers was not really part of my comfort zone We justumwe thought  We just want to ask some questionssir Aiden came to the rescue squeezing my hand impulsively I could tell he wasnt comfortable with doing this either For our school projectWe explained that we needed to make a short story for our project and we told him that we needed some basis David explained that the haunted doll would be our basis but we needed opinions from the tenantsTo save time and text space I decided to summarize what happened Nothing much happened turns out Mr Jeff was mostly inside his home when hes not working And when hes home hes too busy in front of the computer that he basically manages to waste a whole day in front of one he barely notices if anything was going on around him He had no experience with the doll whatsoever and if the haunted thing ever came to his room he never noticedWe thanked himinternally pissed at how oblivious he is and left the roomThankfully I received a text from Tania saying they have a lead She told us to meet her on the ground floor so we can go to the basement In hindsight I guess basements should be one of the very first places a paranormal enthusiast should investigate  So David Indie said out of the blue on our way downstairs I guess we better solve this before youre the only tenant left David nodded with a nearly inaudible yeah and Indie was grinning Otherwise youll be David Tenant   Your joke is ineffective if the audience doesnt get the reference I said with a grin showing him Aiden and Davids confused faces  But if they did it wouldve been funny Indie replied with a smirkWe made it to the ground floor pretty quickly each of us watching out for anything out of the ordinary I scanned the area for our friends and after seeing none of either Tania Scarlett or Jack checked my phone if she had any text regarding where they are  Thats weird I said aloud after noticing that there were no texts  Thats not like Tania Aiden saidchecking his phone as well Shes usually very meticulous in this kind of stuff  The basement David muttered almost a whisper We all looked at him as he points at an open door that probably leads to the basement  All right Indie saidleading the way Lets go where the creepy is And its obviously through that doorWe followed him all of us probably wondering why anyone would keep a doorway to a basement so dimly lighted and how come the path behind it seems so dark I always thought the whole creepyunnecessary door was just a horror movie stereotype but I guess I might be wrongWe went through the stale air going silent as each of us instinctively held our breaths Indie went through firstengulfed in darkness he feels around for a light switchHe cant seem to find any us David Aiden and I stumbled in to the dark doorway The doorway was big enough for two people but we still managed to pile up and nearly fall down like dominoes because none of us wanted to get deeper without a lightBefore any of us could even find a light switch the door slammed shut like another horror movie cliche Regardless I was scared shitless  Crap Aiden saidfumbling around with us in the dark We were all desperately finding the door All his hands managed to do so far was slap David on the face almost poked Davids eyes and accidentally feeling me up Sorry I thought that was a guy  Everybody stop moving I shouted swatting whoevers hands were on my face  Imagine if Ethan was here Indies voice came from my left so I assumed that was where he is Hed probable have his hands all overHEYWe were all alerted with Indies shout but we found ourselves screaming as well It was not because it was dark but it was because there was something slithering around us It was very thin and wirelike I thought it was either hair or stringDavid finally raised his voice as something grabbed his ankle and dragged him with IndieAiden almost ignitedsince I saw little sparks spreading from himbut he was stopped when he started getting dragged away His screams were starting to fade and with only me left I desperately clawed for the doorSomething wrapped around my ankle and started pulling me deeper through the hallway Before I was taken completely off my feet I managed to find the doorknob I kept both hands gripping on it hoping I was strong enough to hold on I kept holding on praying to God that whatever it was tightening its stringy tendrils would let go of my footI dont know how long I struggledbut it finally let go The sudden release of my feet dropped me to the groundI breathe a sigh of relief and let go of the knobAnd thats when the strings wrapped around my stomach and pulled me awayI dont know if the shock made me faint or I was knocked out Either way I woke up to a messy basement of the apartmentNot a morbid kind of messymind you The normal kind of messyAll kinds of stuff litter the floor from used toys to leftovers of furniture the whole basement seemed like a huge box where unwanted objects are thrown awaySomehow it wasnt dark in here A closer look revealed that there was a lightbulb on the ceiling I carefully walked around trying to look for my friends I had to cover my nose otherwise Ill end up sneezing from the dustThe basement was surprisingly large but I finally found my friendsThey were all tied up with strings perhaps the same that took us The strings were all connected to the ceilingleaving them suspended in midair like some strange cocoonsI checked if they were all there but saw that Tania and David werentI touched the strings that held most of my friends prison wondering if I could pull it off It was tightly wound there was in no way even Indie could get out of this I had to find something to cut it with before I find out what put them here and what it intends to do with my friendsI walked around fearful of every corner I have to turn to If theres anything I learned from horror movies or stories its that the monster is usually behind you or about to pop out from a cornerI looked behind me and sawnothingSo it was a shock when something met my face as I turn to keep walking Things were a little blur at first so I didnt manage to notice who or what was in front of me for a secondIt was Tania and David was walking beside herTurns out they were just like me who woke up without being bound in strings  I dont understand whats going on Tania whispered as we walked around This doesnt look related to the doll at all  Or maybe it does I replied as we saw heaps of broken toysmost of them dolls lying around Teddy Bears with ripped limbs Ragdolls with missing eyes and a lot of dolls with torn dresses or incomplete physique This place looks like a psychos play roomDavid was walking aroundpicking up and looking at discarded toys He saw an old Iron Manlooking action figure and stared at it  This This was mine He said letting the toy linger in his hand I thought I lost it  Whatever lives here it can get to any room in the buildiScRAaaaaaaApETania stopped talking the moment we heard that familiar soundsCRAaaaaApEWe hurriedly looked around for a place to hideor at least temporarily run away to I listened closely to pinpoint where the creature was coming from but the sounds stoppedI looked to see Tania motioning me to run over to her I obliged as quickly as possible We walked slowlylooking around for places to hide or anywhere the creature might come from The basement was big and it felt like a maze instead of a huge well basement There twists and turns almost everywheremaking me wonder what the hell was wrong with the architect who designed thisThe scraping noise started again and we listened closely hoping it doesnt come near us After a while the scraping stopped again and we hurriedly looked around for anything to cut our friends loose  Of all the times to leave my athame Tania annoyingly whispered and looked worriedly at us We need to go back to those toys We might be able to use them  But thats where the scraping stopped David mutteredshiveringTania comforted the boy telling him how its just going to be like hideandseek All we need to do was not get caughtWe managed to go back to the toy surplus area of the basement without any problems We assumed that the monster was here so we needed to be very careful I for one did not want to have to experience the whole string dragging thingThere were way too many toys I wondered if there was anything we could use to cut the string holding our friends captiveSo far we dont see anything that can be considered a threat so Tania proceeded to dig through the heaps of dolls and stuffed toys I tried to help toowhile David kept watchThe pressure of finding something before whatever was lurking shows up was starting to get to me I saw nothing of importance and I was starting to panic when I saw a very pretty toyIt wasnt exactly deep under the heap actually it was beside it On its own it was lying on the floor a puppetish porcelain doll It looked to be lifesized as big as an average woman Its ornate skin was a pale kind of white and looked very much like a porcelain or ceramic Nonetheless it was wooden when I touched it With my fingers I traced the engravings marking its skin Floral designs and different unrecognizable symbols made it look like the marionette had tattoosDavid saw what I was looking at and squatted next to me  What do you think these symbols are He asked quietly pointing to some symbols one of them looking like three oblongs intertwined to look like a triangle   Thats a triquetra we heard Tania whisper beside usshe was curious as to what we were looking at Unless Im wrong its a symbol for life The synergy of mindbodyand soul She tried to turn the huge doll over but we needed to help her because it was heavier than it looks This is a strange marionette Its woodenbut glossy Marionettes are usually use for puppet shows so why make one this big and heavyDavid was trying hard to help turn the doll overbut ended up slightly dragging it around the floor The marionettes body made a scraping a sound as its wooden skin skidded through the floorScRaAAaaapeWe all looked in horror at the lifesized marionette finally understanding why we didnt seem to notice it a while agoTania started backing up towards the wall and broke to a run when the wooden doll started moving on its ownIts limbs acted like it had a mind of its ownbut it moved in a limp way the strings connected to it magically connecting to the walls to help it standIt finally stood upalthough not straight its feet were on tiptoes and its arms limply raised sideways it was quite obvious the marionette relied on the strings to keep itself uprightOn instinct all of three of us broke to a sprint mindlessly running towards the closest corner we find Unfortunately none of us made it as strings wrapped around us againPulled closer to the doll we found ourselves suspended in midair like a toy being picked up and investigated Poor David was upsidedown but he barely screamed he was to entranced by our pale porcelainlooking captor I almost freaked out when the doll walked hovered closer to him but didnt do anything so except to inspect him from toe to head  Bozhe moĭ thats an ankh symbol on its chest  Tania was trying to keep her calm regardless of being held up by tentaclestrings This thing was brought to life by magic  Well thats your specialty I told her hoping she would know something that can help  Its a long shot Tania said looking worried and desperately trying to unbind herself But maybe I could use a counterspell to remove the ankhs lifegiving effect  Youre gonna kill it David finally shouted at us   All of a sudden the strings snapped tighter and slammed us on the ground Even with the pain of my body meeting the pavement aggressively I was just thankful there was not enough space to drop us higher fromBefore I could even catch my breaththe strings pulled us all up again I closed my eyes preparing for another punishing pounding when I head David shout WAIT at the marionetteI waitedtoo and thankfully so did the doll  Please dont get angry at us David said through fits of coughing  He held a hand up to my surprise he was holding his old Iron Man action figure the one he probably got from the heap We justwant to playI almost thought it worked but the strings raised us up againpreparing for another slambut instead it laid us down gentlyTania and I were dumbfounded We just watched as David walked closer to the doll now slumped down on the ground Its emotionless face was raised up at him and even with no pupils on its eyes I could tell it was looking at him  You just wanted to play toodidnt you David said calmly offering it the action figure It laid a hand on the toygently letting it linger on Davids hand Something caught his eye and he looked closer Lady He asked and the marionette nodded loosely And with a smile David said Thats a nice name  Its obviously a potential threat Tania whispered to me I should put it to rest For everyones safetyShe was tracing something in the air and I was worried she might cast some badass spell that might get us all killed What happened next was just Tania squeezing an injured handthe string mightve cut her palm and letting blood drop on the floorShe looked at me with worried eyes she was obviously not used to this kind of responsibility It was usually Ethan making the calls It was usually him carrying the burden of possible consequencesI shook my head and whispered Dont  Its too dangerous Tania repliedbut I could see she was having second thoughts David might keep it calm now but what if it goes on a rampage later Youve seen even felt what it can doThe blood that she had dropped on the floor started flowing towards the doll Moving like a sentient being the blood created some kind of circle around itWhen the doll noticed it became furious again and tried to shoot its strings out but it cant The strings barely moved  Im negating whatever magic is making this thing move Tania saidwalking closer to it The doll was looking around furiously and trying desperately to move From what I can see the marionette looked like it was dying  Please David shouted and tried to stop Tania on her tracks Dont kill her She just wants to play  She tried to kill us Tania said her hands shaking as she trace another invisible symbol in the air This monster is a jeopardy to peoples lives  SO ARE YOU David screamed at her and that stopped Tania Both of them were panting and just staring at each other Even if I wanted to help somehow I found that I couldnt move or speak up I just watched them If you if you do tthis David continued struggling to not to stutter from either fear or anger Doesnt that make you a monster too A jeopardy to peoples livesTania looked at the doll who had resigned to just accept its fatewhatever that may be It was still but it obviously still had life  I dont know what youre gonna do David continued But how could that make you any different  Im responsible for all of you Tania answered her voice trembling My friends are tied up and we almost got crushed by strings Why should I care about what I become My priority is keeping this group safe  Dont you get it it was Davids turn again Your friends are probably tied up because they fought back She didnt kill any of them She just wants someone to play with Thats why the little doll randomly made its way into other tenants rooms thats why the little girl saw her Can you imagine being alone in this basement for God knows how long  What if youre wrong Tania said after some contemplation of Davids speech  What if youre wrong David repliedTania walked closer to the marionette her whole body shaking with fear But perhaps not from fear of the doll but fear of the choices she has to make Something needs to be done was all she said and then she raised her hand to cast one more spell  What the hell happened to you guys Ethan raised an eyebrow as he visited us in Davids room Claire was with him and the two of them bought cheeseburgers for us Jack was not a fan of cheese and gave his to Scarlett We all had light wounds from all the strings and Ethan almost made a BDSM joke The explanation was not easy but a high five with each of us helped Ethan understand  But what happened to the doll Claire asked while Ethan was more than happy to wipe some ketchup off her cheek  I had to make a choice Tania replied looking at the bandage over her wounded hand So I let it live David promised that hed look after her  Her name is Lady David replied And shes a little shy but I know shes near I guess Ill have to teach her a lot of stuff especially social stuff  Thats cool Ethan told David and looked at Tania And good jobTania tried her best not to blush and smiled sweetlylooking down at her burger  I gotta give it to you kid Scarlett said patting his back You put the whole story together on your own Thats amazing maybe youd like to work with us  Yeah we could use a boy with his Lady Marionette Indie saidgrinningDavid smiled at the proposition but shook his head Sorry but I cant My fathers moving to another country in a few months we wont be staying here for so long either  But how about Lady Claire asked worriedly David shrugged at her question  Cross the bridge when you get there Jack said raising his cheeseless burger for a toast Lets just enjoy our success for now To Team Paranormal Awesomeness  NO We all saidstill toasting Jack groaned at our disapproval  Wellwe do need a name Ethan said chuckling  I could probably help with that I saidgrinning Ive had this idea for a name ever since I joined the group Since people probably wont believe us if we told what we are or what we do then why not a name used for those kind of stories I was thinking we could call our little groupI paused for effect everyone was waiting on me I smiled at them as I said the words I always did love adding unnecessary flair at stuff  Urban Legends,1385516443.0,Urban Legends

TheGroovyTurte,0,5,1rkk1r,0,So things have taken a turn for the weird during night float and the dangerous  Ill back up and say that the shadows and tappings are still present as ever but hadI guess hit some kind of plateau Over the past few days Ive gotten used to them to the point of completely disregarding themalmost Last night Jerry coded the overhead operator reported the code and I made a break for his room two floors below me  When I got to his room the code team was already on the job  I took over performing chest compressions while the defib paddles were put in place thankfully we have enough resources to not have those ridiculous old school ones that still seem so popular in movies As I was performing chest compressions I began to notice just how dark the room was despite the bright over head lights that are turned on during a code I looked at Jerry his eyes sunken into his head eyes that were once so desperate as he held my wrist tighter than I ever thought any gomer could  I wondered if I would ever see Jerrys eyes open again  I was becoming fatigued and relieved of chest compressions by another intern I turned and looked at the monitor it wasnt looking pretty but it had become a a rhythm worthy of shock V Fib for all you ACLSers out there  As I heard the senior running the code shout clear and deliver the shock the entire room seemed to brighten back up again the shadows briefly retreated but just as quick as the light came it left and the darkness swarmed in Immediatly we jumped back into CPR while keeping an eye on the monitor I took another turn at chest compressions this time paying more attention to the shadows around the room than to the fragile mans chest I was compressing  What seemed strange to me was that with every compression and release the shadows seemed to have an eb and a flow that corresponded to my compressions  Between performing them and monitoring the shadows instead of the monitor like I should have been I almost didnt here the senior yell clear  I got away to see another shock delivered with a subsequent burst of light but this time more of the light remained  Somehow I knew we had Jerry backI shouted that I had a pulse almost before I actually felt that reasurring sensation in Jerrys neck  I looked around the room and saw the shadows still present but distant  I couldnt help but feel a little cocky I thought of my favorite scene in GoTWhat do we say to the god of death Not todayI walked out of the room with more swagger than any intern has the right to  I turned around for one last look the room became almost pitch black as the over head light turned a muted gray  Jerry coded again We started again pushed drugs juiced him so many times a plug in generator wouldve been jealous and compressed his chest enough that I know quite a few of his ribs were broken  At the end of all of it he was pronounced dead  The rooms muted light returned to its base line as a feeling of nausea came over me I returned to my floor feeling confused angry terrified and guilty  The shadows and the tapping have once again increased in intensity but now seem to have a more malevolent playfulness to them instead of simply moving they seem to dance the tapping that seemed so rigid and mathetical now has the cadence of a nursery rhyme All of this scares me enough but what trully fills me with fear dread and worst of all helpelessness  The dark and the tappings seem to have taken a liking to the pediatric wing  I dont know what to do EDIT paragraph adjustments,1385559962.0,Night Float Part ,3,nosleep,top_week

ForrestKaysen,1,7,1rmyvd,0,So I had this dream At least I hope it was just a dreamII dont know anymore I was asleep It was some of that good sleep like youre just floating on a rainbow pool of skittles or some shit I was floating and it was nice and warm Then everything began to get darker  I came awake in my own room and I was staring at the black of my eyelids  It takes me a moment to realize why Im awake to register the painful ache in my arms and the pressure on my chest I cant move  My mind is still in rainbowskittle land and my eyes are closed Im lying there hoping that sleep will come back when I feel something soft and warm on my cheek  Like fingertips My eyes fly wide open I am so fucking awake right now Theres something in my room Someone a figure at my bedside I can see him by the moonlight streaming through the blinds on the window His pose is outlined in sliver stripes one knee on the mattress and an arm stretched out toward my face He strokes my cheek again  Its a nightmare now because I try and move and I cant My arms are burning stretched painfully across the bed and the pressure on my chest is like a sack of sand giving away slightly to allow me to breathe but almost crushing when I exhale I thought you were pretending to sleep I guess I was wrong the figure says  That voice theres something wrong with itNot that you could have tricked me Sleep has never protected anyone it just mutes the painIts my voice Hes using my voice  I can move my eyes so I can see his features  Hes got my hair my nose my chin acne  Above and below his eyes there are two bands of moonlight and I stare into that darkness  I dont know what Im looking for Maybe I can pin him down if I just focus hard enough I can control dreams because theyre not real rightSomething distracts me though a glint in the corner of my eye He chuckles as my eyes dart away from his taking in his other hand upraised Hes holding something silver a curved shape bathed in light A small pointed hook  a fishhook   I watch as he brings it down slowly  It passes through stripes of light and dark as it falls Flash Flash Flash  Until it stops shining silver and red its curve buried in my bellybutton Whatever control I thought I had is lost now I didnt even see it pierce the skin in the darkness it had somehow dipped through me and surfaced The barb is painted red with blood  This isnt real It cant be because the pain is slow I can feel it struggling to reach me through the pressure on my chest I should be feeling the pain And then he begins to pullThere it is Theres the pain like nothing Ive ever felt before Like hes pinched my smallest vein and hes tugging gently oh so gently pulling every singlecell capillary all of the big arteries out of me  I want to thrash and scream and tear my hair out or maybe tear his hair out But it takes everything in me to open my mouth and groan Distantly I feel my fingers turn in on themselves and pierce my palms My eyes are wide open from the shock and through the pain I see why hes pulling so slowly There s something attached to that hook a thick white substance that separates into fine glowing threads where its attached to my gut Pain and confusion but mostly pain is what I feel Through the haze I look at his face again His features are still in concentration but his head has tilted His teeth are offwhite like mine but his mouth set in a grimace A band of moonlight highlights his jewelred irises Everything else I saw before is now dark suggestion Hes wearing my face but he isnt me With a mindshattering jerk hes doneand the pain is gone Im empty hollow inside Im a body of aches and exhaustion and its all I can do to watch him as he shifts off the bed The white mass of threads is pulled along He flips the hook upright so that it looks like a gristly question mark and the glowing threads slide to the floor They coil and slide on each other like Gods Angel Hair pasta Their glow is a few shades lighter than moonlight soothing the emptiness inside meI keep staring at it as he stamps it out my eyelids closing my vision blurring as the light fades into nothingness and tears fall I just want this to end I dont know what fucked up corner of my mind this is all coming from but it needs to stop  I know its a dream because all of a sudden my view point has changed Im floating above where the glowy spaghetti was watching myself cry The impostor turns toward my body and kneelsShhhhhh he says No its okay Its okay Dont cry for him He strokes my cheek his voice is softDont cry youre free now Shhhh Youre free Come with me I can make the pain go away Im sorry it hurt you Dont cry Come I will make the emptiness go awayHe grabs a hand and pulls at my body but it turns away from my impostor curling tightly into the fetal position The impostor puts a hand on its shoulder as if to pull again but my body curls even tighter  Okay the impostor says Okay I will let you rest Sleep well He kisses my body on the foreheadCome to me when youre finished with him And between one moment and the next hes gone I stay at the spaghetti spot and watch the moonlight fade and the sun rise waiting to wake up  Its only when my alarm clock blares and my body slaps it silent by reflex that I begin to admit that somethings wrong I watch my body uncurl fully slowly as if its sore  It stands tall staring out the window as I stare at the back of its head  Slowly it walks to the bodylength mirror propped against the wall and my view changes as it moves Like Im a camera positioned in midair and my body is dragging the lens  It readjusts the frame and stares into it  I can see my face in the reflection I look like crap My eyes are inflamed like I have a pinkeye infection I wonder if Ior my bodyever stopped crying last night It doesnt look like it  I resolve to take a good long shower and wash this nightmare away But my body doesnt move It takes me a long moment to pay attention My reflection  Its not staring at the body in front of it but to a point above and behind its shoulder At me My body is staring at me  Its letting me see its face Letting me see its lips move Softly so softly that I think Im imagining it I hear a voiceSorry Im so sorry Please  Im sorryPlease Tell me what to do,1385631633.0,scarysilverrainbowskittledreams,2,nosleep,top_week

TreasureHouseofDoom,6,60,1rn6lu,0,Never before had I been so close to such  tragedy and the flood of emotions through me was nearly overwhelming  There was still so much to be done and I hadnt any time to spare  Before me the kitchen continued to burn   Melting to a fit of sobs Mrs Moseley watched in awe as fire so fierce it boiled sweat at her brow evaporated tears at her cheeks denied every last prayer she had ever made as Mama to Sweet Dulcie  The sheer terror of that purest heartache and helplessness wrenched a hollow spot into the pit of my stomach as my heart twisted in empathy  Big Roy joined by the Moseleys neighbors and their yard and house men from all along the broad street running through town began toting buckets from the well and even from the creek but there was no saving the little kitchen that had only moments before been filled with the warmth of joyous sisterly interaction rather than smoldering destruction  Theres no point theres no point Mrs Moseleys proclamation was plea too and I imagined that she might run again to the starving flames if given slightest chance reignite the blaze on the delicate threads of silk spun by little worms tended across an ocean worlds away and the soft pale flesh of her own dying body to reunite herself with her Sweet Dulcie   Ashes to ashes whispered itself into my consciousness and now I pushed myself away from the scene  But the scene did not fade with my removal from it  The anger in Dulcie had flared too I realized and the scene would play out  I teetered dangerously close to losing contact with my own world and time  Even Big Roy seemed oblivious to me as I moved from the heat of this moment to the apparent but not persistent calm of my own two moments united by space burning at different levels one fully blazing and the other mere flicker against the call of twilight  Against the steps of the kitchen stood an aluminum ladder fully extendable and definitely a product of my own century  Swiftly and with minimum engagement of the area controlled by mix of memory and tainted energy associated with the catastrophe that had happened here I pulled it up and back lowered to carry it parallel with the ground my left arm tucked over it and my right arm hitched through the rungs for balance and added support I was accustomed to carrying heavy loads of my mothers  antique acquisitions but the day had worn me down and I tottered beneath the shifting weight  Heaving it up the front steps I rested before turning the knob listening for any sign of disruption within  The potential for upset to the peace I had secured through prayer was great  Sometimes we carry such protection with us and I felt sure I had  Even though I had felt the heat and the sweat smelled the stench acknowledged the noise of Dulcies excruciating demise I had not been completely immersed in the moment  There was only one energy strong enough to protect me from such a violent visionNow I sniffed the air for signs of spirits in revolt  The scent of fudge and the terrifying sweetness of cooking meat progressed to something much darker sear and singe carrying with it visions of flesh turning to soft goo fat falling from thin delicate bone   Beyond the door humming zap and zing of energy in motion electric and unnerving  anger and her heartbreak Sweet Dulcie fed some greater entity opportunistic in its approach and I readied myself against its attackBreathing deeply even as the smell sickened me I turned the knob slowly beat of my heart countdown for entry  The foyer was completely calm but the energy flaring from within the study showed itself as light pouring through the thin space left between the door and the threshold  Hello Julianne Sweet Dulcie welcomed me from across the room  We are together now always together ForeverStanding in front of the bookshelves she held in her hand a thick book that appeared to be covered in faded purple velvet with lilies hand painted to the front cover  I recognized it as an album and shivered at the notion of the two of us pouring through pictures of happier times and other clues two girlfriends on a journey of discovery  The light emanating from within this spectral girl had tarnished or weakened no longer golden but increasingly brassy  But her eyes no longer crinkled in smile were more determined than ever mottled blue to red this in oscillation  Perhaps the blue was where I might find remnant of the sweet and bubbling girl she had been but the red was pure foreboding  Wouldnt you like to look at pictures of us And she opened the book slowly images seemingly forced out one by one first to hover then to race toward me  And I saw every one of these as if time simply halted as each presented itself  In every picture Dulcie smiled and when her parents were present too they beameda perfect family with happy expectations proud parents with their Sweet Sweet girl Five pictures came this way but after that something changed either about me or the images themselves  The first of the altered images danced in view nearly evasively playfully forcing me to react teasing my curiosity And when it stopped in front of me I was dazzled by the joyous faces of the adults gazing at a tiny bundle of life and hope not even large enough to fill the space from the crook of her mothers arm to her wrist which folded to secure her  And now the startling humming I had noticed about Dulcies smile in the very first tintype Seth had shown me seemed to imbue this image each of the subjects changing from flat image to robust energized spirit  Sepiatoned flash then momentary subduing occurred more rapidly until everything I saw there demonstrated a force of its own  First a kiss to the bundles cheek then the slow turn and rise of her dark shine head Mrs Moseley spoke directly to me Julianne there must be retribution for the murder of a child and her eyes were grave but the down turn of lips pretty curves and set rose slowly to finally make a smile that threatened the balance of my perception  Mr Moseley agrees wholeheartedly Her tone implied that we had reached some agreement together that I would comply and all would be satisfiedMr Moseley reached now for the bundle unfolding the blankets from the head to reveal the golden crown of tiny curls head turned to face her father If the truth be known this never would have happened under my watch  The cooks daughter a colored child Why they never shouldve played together at allMrs Moseley cast her eyes toward the ground considered the many errors she had made that may have contributed to the terrible events that had defined their young lives Mary Rose was a sweet girl too and her voice was compassionate heartache for the moment the humming slowing so that now Mr Moseley and the baby playing in  his arms moved as if in stopgo motion as if by the spin of a Daedelum stroboscopic player but Mrs Moseley grew increasingly animated looking into my eyes before I had thought to minimize this engagement slow speak declaration I will not be subdued before vengeance has been made and with that proclamation the image fell to the ground and others took its place with such ferocity that the dance of pictures became a flowing haltless delivery of film documentary to show me the lives of children two babies growing up together Marys Mama holding one on each knee Mrs Mosely clasping them together as toddlers in her lap smiling revelation of deep love in unkind times always the implication of birth and status station but in black and white  x  cuttings more love than most might have known over the great southern racial divide shone through  To my right a game of marbles rolled into view clay from the creek rolled in Marys Daddys hands two girls on their knees one atop a handkerchief but the other flesh to dirt giggling but bent so far to the ground to watch the marbles roll that I couldnt tell for sure which was whom To my left croquet near the garden acre I had never truly seen before and it appeared Mary was winning but Dulcies flashing smile with curls bouncing around it seemed to say I sometimes let her win Happy images in golden rays but my heart tightened more with each one and now I felt queasy from a potentially overwhelming sadness building in meThis was the crux of the matter I felt sure  Such a thin line I had heard somewhere separates love from hate jealousy defining the line at times that many unwittingly cross over it and sometimes such hate may be displaced or even on some level deserved  My father the preacher and counselor of troubled youths would have called this all part of the grieving process  I remembered his explaining this to me in the days when Aunt Lucia had been newly taken from us her death violent and unexpected my mother reeling from the blow that hit both their hearts different sorts of deaths one sister to pass on and the other to live through the pervasive sadness of losing her only sibling  He had told me  Hate is as natural an emotion as love but it isnt as easily fostered and if it festers it has the potential to infect everyone with whom it makes contactEngagement was no longer an issue of protecting myself  Perhaps no one has been in such concert with spirits before I allowed myself to think conceitedly only a moment before dismissing it for the truth that no one ever does anything anymore that hasnt been done before  There was one thing I might do differently from others before me though  I suspected most in such conversation with spirits lost much of themselves in the exchange  I would be diligent vigilant tenacious in my maintaining of Self but I would not be able to complete the work I had promised to do without succumbing to seemingly total immersion  Deep breath for strength and energy I analyzed as quickly as possible the scenes unfolding before me carefully electing one that seemed to generate an energy unusual from the rest  In this one Sweet Dulcie stepped delicately from spot to spot arms waving slowly in front of her eyes coved by a kerchief  Mary walked quietly kitten feet giggling in tinny tiny tones and every few seconds she said I see youDulcie giggled too and her laughter seemed to dance along the path between them  I hear you she responded every time taking her next step according to a blind but instinctively magnified sense of direction Stepping closer I thought for a moment that neither could see nor hear me but then Mary put a finger to her lips almost a  kiss to blow Shhh across them eyes friendly and lips smiling But Dulcie had detected me too I hear you JulianneI was exposed not merely by their sense of me but the knowledge Dulcie carried into this moment with her  Whatever hope Id had of observing these two without their sense of intrusion over time and space muddying it dissolved  Thank you for reading and for constructive insight you might offer  And Happy Thanksgiving  Today I am

Jaunt,56,188,1rff5i,608,I wrapped my dollie in her prettiest red dress looked into her cracked eyes and whispered I love youI held her tight I love you I love you But I started to cry because dollies dont love back No my dollie wouldnt do not anymore I wanted something of my own to care for Something soft I could nuzzle up to at night when I was lonely Something that needed me I wanted a real babyI asked mama how to make a baby She slapped me across the face and made me drink dish soap to wash the devils talk from my mouth The red mark still burned on my cheek when I got to school but no one noticed They never noticed me except when I fell and spilled my lunch or when Jenny and the other girls made fun of the holes in my dresses They only noticed me to laugh at meThat night after I said my prayers I looked at the stars through my window and spotted one I had never seen before Big bright and ruby red it seemed to get bigger the more I stared at it It was beautiful so I sent it a wish Bring me a baby I said bring me something to loveThe star grew bigger and bigger until ruby red filled the room and turned the air thick and rusty Something was there with me Black and formless like a storm cloud it floated above me You want a child it said speaking into my head instead of my ears I will give you a child but you must promise to love and care for him no matter whatI promiseWisps of black wrapped around my wrists and pinned them to the ground as sure as steel rivets My nightdress was lifted and my legs pulled apart Gritty black tendrils rough as sandpaper opened me and slithered inside They scraped my insides slowly at first then faster and faster It felt like I was being shredded to pulp from the inside out I tilted my head back to scream but black filled my mouth and nothing came out Shhh it said to love your child you must suffer for him first A final push in and shards of splintered glass exploded inside meThe thing loosed its grip and I reached down to feel sticky red goo oozing out of me onto the floor I was shaking and cold and the room was falling away Will I die I askedNo You must care for him It is your promiseI woke the next morning without a scratch Was it a dream I touched my belly No he is there I can feel him Tiny and vulnerable and perfect I would keep my promiseHe grew every day Soon my belly was round and full underneath my dresses Everyone noticed me now especially Jenny and the other girls Slut they said Whore Trash One day Jenny fell in front of a school bus as it was pulling away You could hear the tire pop her skull open from across the parking lot When the police dragged the driver away he stammered that he had seen something push her something small and black like a living shadowMama cried She held me in a scalding tub and scrubbed my body until my skin cracked and bled Not clean not clean she said She pulled me out of school and swore that I would never leave the house until it was over and done because what would the neighbors think I didnt mind As long as my little boy was safe inside me I didnt care where I wentI dreamed of him He told me his name but it was a sound I couldnt pronounce a sound like a cloud of flies buzzing through the air I couldnt say it but I could hear it in my head and that was enough He told me that he would accomplish great things but he needed my love to make him strong first In my dreams I held him tight looked into his dark eyes and whispered I will love and protect you alwaysMama dreamed of him too I think She would lay in bed with sweat soaking into the sheets whispering Please Please help us God She ate less and less until she was sunken and pale like a skeletonI was drawing pictures one night when it happened I reached up for a red crayon and pop yellow liquid gushing out of me Hes ready hes finally ready I called out to mama and told her it was time She phoned the doctor begging him to be discreet to hide it from the neighbors He arrived and offered to inject me with something to relieve the pain I refused To love my baby I must suffer for him firstPushing screaming breathing pushing again Hours and hours I was weak I was tired But the thought of him kept me going After so long we would finally meet I would hold him in my arms for real and give him the love I kept in my heart just for him I pushed again with the last drops of strength I had left I emptied out and collapsed down onto the bed sighing with reliefI am sorry dear but the baby didnt make itNo No youre wrong I kept him safe this whole time I protected him and loved him and spoke to him in my dreams I was going to care for him and make him strong he cant be he cant be he cantI am so sorry Here child you can say goodbyeI held him in my arms He was limp and motionless his skin a pale gray his eyes shut tightly He looked so peaceful I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life I clutched him to my chest and cried tears dripping onto his head Goodbye my love goodbye But no wait He cant be gone I can hear him I can hear the flies in my mindHis eyes snapped open and his head twisted around to look at mama and the doctor Mama fell to the floor and screamed Her legs scrambled to press her into a corner of the room and her eyes bulged as she shrieked and pleaded to God The doctor stood frozen for a moment before walking into the bathroom and quietly shutting the doorMy babys head turned back to me and I looked into his eyes for the first time Two huge pools of midnight black that seemed to suck the light out of the room itself I looked into those cold dark eyes and I smiled My son My beautiful son I am so happy to see youI stood up while mamas jagged screams scratched my eardrums and I carried my son to the bathroom I opened the door stepped over the spreading pool of red underneath the doctor and turned on the tap I bathed my son in the icy cold water as he stared up at me He was perfect He was everything I had hoped for And he was mineI saw things in my dream that night I saw great buildings and monuments ground to dust I saw waves of fire washing clean the cities of man I saw clouds of flies so thick they blacked out the sun I saw red Mists of red rivers of red chunks of oozing red heaped high in the moonlight And in the middle of it all I saw my son my baby boy Mamas so proud of you sweetheart I will always be there for you I will make you strong I will make you the man youre destined to be I will love you and care for you and protect you no matter what I promise,1385399840.0,The

ephique,86,158,1rikrx,493,I grew up in a small town in Ohio with my mom dad and big sister We were a normal family neither happy nor sad somewhere in between I was always interested in music as a kid so I spent most of my time playing piano practicing guitar or trying my best to write my own songs It was also some sort of medicine for me it helped me drift away into my own world when my sister and my mom had disputes You see my sister was one of those rebellious teenagers at the time that had to have their own way or the rest of the world had to suffer their unfair ranting I hated it I hated hearing her yell at my poor motherDuring a lonesome walk home from school one day I got a call from my dad making sure that I didnt have any plans and telling me that I had to come home as fast as possible My dad never called my cell phone unless he really wanted something so I knew right away something was up I remember jogging most of the route home since my dad sounded so serious It gave me the creeps to say the leastI jumped over the fence surrounding our villa and paced myself into our house The kitchen was the first room youd see upon entering and it was empty so I assumed they were in the living room upstairs As I was making my way up the stairs I could hear my sister sobbing uncontrollably something had definitely happened My dad was standing up as my sister was sitting on the couch he told me to sit down as wellI was scared and curious at the same time Dad and my sister never really spoke or had any arguments since my father didnt bother caring too much about any of my sisters business so I could figure out that this wasnt about my sister I remember sitting there in dead silence with the exception of my sister shedding tears and trying to keep her crying as quiet as possible My dad was looking like he had no idea what to do or say as if he didnt know how to explain something to meFinally after a long pause my dad made an introduction to whatever I thought this was about at the time He said Your mother and then he needed to grasp some air and he continued Your mother has passed awayI was eight years old and I couldnt grasp that concept I didnt understand death or that my mom was eternally gone I just sat there as I was developing an irrational anger towards godknowswhat I remember thinking how unfair this was I do however forgive my dad for telling me so bluntly he didnt know what to do and he was in shock at the timeMy sister continued crying she asked dad how mom died although it was obvious she didnt actually care to know at that precise moment She was just being desperate and no one could blame her I thought it was my sisters fault when I was there I thought that was why she was crying so much I didnt shed a single tear I kept it all inside Of course that didnt mean this incident didnt haunt me for years I never stopped thinking about my mother The aftermath of my mothers death is what has been shaping my life the recent years My sister was very weak emotionally and it basically drove her insane My dad had to take her to an actual mental hospital Something I didnt even think existed when I was eight This resulted in that I didnt get to meet my sister very often my dad kept telling me she was in a special school for students that wanted a challenge but I overheard enough conversations to know where she really was I guess my dad was trying to keep me out of it and I didnt blame him I was guessing that my sister wasnt doing very well at the hospital since we got to see her less and less as years went by something that troubled me I hated living in this big villa of ours with just my dad It felt so dead and my dad had been more kept to himself after mom died We didnt do anything I literally spent all time at home in my room making or playing music Me and my dad didnt even greet sometimes when I came home from school it was depressing My theory for his change in behavior has always been that he blamed himself for my mothers death something that Im about to get intoYou are probably wondering how she died by now and its a legit question to be asking The best answer I could give you is that I dont know My dad has always told me she died of liverfailure but for some reason that has always sounded like a lie to me It didnt add up my mom never had any problems with her liver before and she didnt drink I think it was something he made up when I was younger because he assumed I wasnt mature enough to hear the truth In addition to this whenever I asked my dad about this matter hed get heavily upset Nowadays I never ask about my moms death nor do I even bring up mom as a topicYears went by and I ended up being fourteen It kept going like I just described I spent most times in my room playing music as my dad did whatever he was doing on his own in the house My dad did work he had the nighttime shift at a local bottle factory Im not joking he actually made glass bottles for a living He had higher ambitions but most of them got crushed when he and my mother got my sister they had to move and dad basically had no other financial option than to quit the university he was attending at the time and get a quick and close job You guessed it the bottle factoryI was riding my bike home late at night after spending the evening in the school library at one point when I was fourteen My school was the type that had an afterschool library that didnt close till  pm I didnt need any of the books or supplies that the library offered I just studied there sometimes since it felt less depressing than my father and our lonely villa Either way I hadnt seen my sister for two years that night and I was starting to get the idea that I wouldnt see her again for another two When I arrived at the house the front door was open This is odd I thought Upon closer examination I realized that someone had taken the spare key from its hidden spot underneath one of my mothers old jars Its never smart to have a spare key hidden right next to the door number one mistake people do when it comes to spare keys It did look like whoever had taken it did suffer a struggle before finding it The rug outside the door was all muffled up and there were scratches on the door around the lock I suspected we had been robbed so I pulled out my cell phone ready to call the police This is when I heard something coming from inside the house I was dead scared to say the least this could have been armed robbers or maybe something worse I didnt know It sounded like someone was grinding furniture against the floor trying to move it It was so dark as well I remember not seeing more than pitch black looking into the open door technically if someone was in there they would have seen me because of the street lights I started to slowly pace into the house walking towards the noise This is where I had to make a decision was I going to suddenly turn on the lights in order to reveal whatever was in there or was I going to approach it in the dark I picked the former I was just going to switch the lights on when I could see someone strafe into the light coming in through the kitchen window It was my sister naked My entire mindset had to change into a totally different way of dealing with the situation it took me a good couple of seconds to assume she escaped the hospital I switched on the lights in an instant She had redecorated the entire kitchen in the dark Of course it all looked hideous and random she didnt know what the hell she was doing I remember being in a slight discomfort I had never seen my sister naked in my entire life I also hadnt seen her for a good couple of years at all She didnt look very comfortable either she looked like she didnt know who I was and was wondering what I was doing thereI uttered Linda out loud that was her name She didnt respond she just continued standing there looking at me Dont you remember me Im your brother I still couldnt get any feedback out of her it was as if the wheel wasnt spinning at all I wasnt sure what the protocol here was not knowing the number to the mental institution or anything I figured Id try to call dad before I got to press the call button on my cell phone she uttered Dont call dad This is when I realized she couldnt be completely empty inside after allYou dont want to call dad She continued  I had no idea what to do I assumed this was part of the reason she was in the mental hospital in the first place Luckily my dad got home at that point not coming from a finished shift at work He had a good five hours at least left I assumed the hospital had phoned him and told him about the situation My father ran into the house as fast as he couldThis is when something I didnt expect happened he told me to leave He pointed at the door as if I had no idea how to find my way out of my own house I asked him where I was supposed to go he told me to wait in his car Judging from how serious my dad seemed I didnt think twice about it I ran out to the car As I was sitting in the car I could see my sister walk past the kitchen window a couple of times I remember how she made no effort to cover her breasts I had no clue what the two of them were discussing although I never saw my sister move her lips so Im guessing my dad did most of the talking After a couple of minutes my dad started to walk to the car he joined me inside I remember asking why he didnt bring Linda with him Dont call her that name he shouted in response I was so confused at this point Dad started the car and drove me to my only friends house I didnt see him very often though I was a lone wolf growing up and I still was at this point I didnt really create any friendships I remember sitting in the car as he ran up the steps to ring my friends doorbell his mother opened in her night dress and looked confused I assumed my dad made up some emergency story to cover what was going on in order to get me a place to stay overnight I didnt even know what was going on to be fairWhatever he told them worked I got to spend the night at my friends place Tims place to be exact It was pretty awkward I remember I only saw Tim a couple of times a week and that was when we shared classes in Spanish We got to be deskmates because the teacher made up whom to sit next to each semester so we werent very close It was a Friday so there was no school the morning after I guessed that made it easier for my dad leaving him the freedom to pick me up whenever he wanted to He did but not before giving me enough time to fully experience the awkward breakfast conversations with Tims parents both trying to justify me as Tims best friend I dont know Tim didnt have many friends I guessOn the way home I asked my dad what was going on the night before and he basically stopped the car and stared at me as if I was mocking him I remember how desperate he looked as if he had no fire left in his heart He uttered the words Do you think I wanted any of this as he grabbed his hair in regret All I wanted was a normal family with no circumstances and Im not blaming you when Im saying this because frankly you are the only sane member left in this livelihood of ours Is what came out of his mouth next I tried to comfort him telling him that he had done a good job raising me and what not I really didnt have a lot of cards in my deck at this point I mean my dad was basically losing itWhen we got home he told me that he was sorry and that I should go up to my room I did go up to my room but I got to tell you I was starting to get very anxious about my dad I really wanted to know what the hell was going on I spent that night recording some guitar sessions for a song and reading books while listening to some ambient records I had found online I couldnt sleep so pulling an allnighter was my only real option I was reading A Brief History of Time for a science project in school I was somewhere in the middle section of the book and started to get dry eyes I figured Id go downstairs into the kitchen to get myself something to drink when I got shocked upon opening the door to the hallway I saw my mother standing just outside looking right at me for a fraction of a second Had all this hassle from the last couple of days driven me insane It freaked me out so much that I ended up never getting a drink The image of my mother outside my door haunted me that entire night I kept thinking about it as I couldnt sleep She looked deranged scared and raw The shortage of light sources in the hallway made her look like she was from a black and white s movie I kept begging for the sun to rise up I even did that thing when you close your eyes and try not to open them because you never know what youll see I might have been fourteen but I can openly admit that I was dead scaredIt finally came to be morning and I ran downstairs still not fully opening my eyes while passing the hallway I remember greeting my dad who was sitting in the kitchen drinking orange juice I was just about to pour myself a glass when he said I think I need help While holding the glass of juice as if he wasnt sure he was going to drink the rest of it I asked him what he meant and he said that he wasnt sure that he had felt very uncomfortable and unstable lately He also mentioned that he was thinking of joining some people from his work in playing golf he thought that could give him some relief I told him that sounded like a pretty good idea jokingly adding that its better than hanging around the house doing nothing He looked offended when I said that something I didnt really understand since he obviously worked all night so that would justify him sleeping through the daysI understand that some of you reading this are wondering how the hell I could have been fourteen and still not know how my mother died Well its hard to explain how uncomfortable of a character my dad was at times and it felt a bit like I was offending him whenever I had to ask because part of me did actually believe she died of liverfailure I mean it was possible Imagine if it was true and I kept asking my dad as if he lied to me Thats the type of thoughts I had in my head about the whole thingHaving that explanation out of the way I did summon the courage to confront my dad one last time It was a couple of days after the conversation about my dad picking up golf I just walked into his room unexpected A part of me had wanted to do this for a long time because I really never knew what he did in his room it looked similar to an office which is nothing hed ever need since he was a labor worker in a bottle factory He was actually sitting at his desk Not only that but the desk was flooded with paperwork of some sort maybe he had picked up an accounting job for the factory during the day something he could manage from home I didnt ask I had a big enough question for him as it wereI dragged out a small chair he had behind the door and figured Id sit on it It was somewhat squeaky and not very comfortable better than standing up anyway Then I leaned forward and I was just about to ask when he interrupted my train of thought by saying You want to know about your sister and what happened the other night Dont you This is where I started to play along because he was already looking emotionally hurt bringing up mom here would have been a carcrash I told him that I was indeed there to ask about my sister He took a good pause before he bluntly exclaimed it to me Your sister is not right in the head shes in a mental hospital I couldnt believe he hadnt figured out that I would have known this by then Not wanting to make a scene I just pretended like I didnt know He explained the context telling me that she couldnt take our mothers death A tear started climbing down his cheeks and then he asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about There was no way I could bring up something as sensitive as my mother at this point so I told him that everything was fine and then I left the roomI realized on my way up to my room that my dad was fragile and very close to losing his mind in this problematic family business I had no idea how Id ever get the truth about my mother out of him When I finally had landed on my bed in my room again the image of my mom started crawling back to me The grey scaled portrait of her in the hallway was my mind playing tricks on me I also had a slight feeling that I remembered it from somewhere I mean it was my mom but that exact stare and look she had not only did it frighten me but I swore I had seen it before Night landed again I hadnt spoken to my father again that day I was facing the same obstacle that I had the other night I was too afraid to go downstairs because I thought Id see my mother again We all know you can imagine things in the dark kids do it all the time Its as if your mind fills in the gaps but that incident the other night was different I got more scared the more I thought of it and figured that Id open the door to the darn hallway and turn on the lights in order to feel slightly safer Im not going to lie I did open that door very slowly but as it turned out there was no sign of my mother I turned on the lights and went back into my roomStill not wanting to go to bed not only because it was spring break at this point but also because I was a bit scared I figured Id listen through some of my older songs I had loads of them most of which werent very good however I was still learning how to create music and I never really thought of myself as particularly good especially not at writing my own songs I guess I was decent at playing other peoples songs I basically went through my songs in chronological order it was interesting because was able to hear how much I had improved over the years It took me a good three hours to get past most of my songs and I was reaching the more recent creations of mine I heard something in one of the songs that I never had paid any attention to before it was a slight breeze of white noise in the middle of one of my guitar riffs Knowing that this wasnt an overworked track yet it was made just days ago and I hadnt gotten around to mastering it yet I figured I wasnt going to give it more of a thought That was until the neurons fired that track was made the day I couldnt sleep the day I saw my mother in the hallway Being a bit gullible I figured that Id give it a go using my acoustic headphones I tried everything I played the song backwards I cut out bass middle frequencies high frequencies and even listened to individual recordings of the instruments and samples I couldnt hear anything suspicious just that white noise I was a bit disappointed at the same time relieved Although that white noise shouldnt have been there nothing in my room could have made a noise like that I didnt want to overthink the situation so I ended up hitting the bed Later that night as I still had problems sleeping I was laying in bed listening to the same ambient soundtracks that I was using nights before slowly dozing off to sleep I hadnt been asleep for much more than ten minutes when I started to ascend into that state of sleep when youre in a dream at the same time as real life is somewhat happening to you I could hear a thumping sound coming from somewhere Before I knew it I got woken up by a loud bass noise it sounded like some kind of a technical disorder I continued lying in bed trying to figure out if I just dreamt about the noise or if it actually occurred this is when I heard a much dampened sound coming from the other side of my room It sounded a lot like someone was trying to get some kind of sound device to work It got quieter and quieter and when I thought it was about to disappear I could hear a voice very distorted and unstable speaking in what I believe was Russian It took me a couple of minutes but I finally realized what I thought the sound was coming from I had left my old amplifier on from when I was playing guitar I bounced out of bed in order to turn on the lights I was overlooking the entire room as I hit the switch for the blink of an eye just next to the amplifier I saw my mom again just as the light went on The same stare same face still that black and white filtered look from before I got so shocked I fell down on the floor the noise coming from the amplifier stopped in the same instant I wasnt sure what to make of this and I definitely didnt want to tell my father about what I had seen knowing he has already thrown one of his kin to a mental hospital I had a lot of sleep to catch up on but unfortunately this wouldnt let me sleep I just couldnt sleep at all I never believed in ghosts or anything growing up these two small incidents with my mom being my only experience in what could be categorized into the matter I thought and assumed I was becoming what my sister had become Whatever this all meant and needless to say I didnt get any sleep that night eitherI met my father in the kitchen the next day he was looking a lot better than the last time I had seen him He kept going on and on about how much he was looking forward to playing golf with his workcrew later that afternoon I was happy for him he deserved some time out of the stress After the conversation about an afternoon of longing for a spot in the shade and waiting for your turn on a grass field he added Have you been thinking of your mother lately As if he could read my mind I told him that I was always missing my mother and that I had indeed thought of her a lot lately He stated that he thought I had I had no clue why  Short after that he left for playing golfI kept thinking of why my amplifier was acting up that night I started recalling a clear memory of turning it off after I was done playing In fact I knew I did since the amplifier was connected to an electricity hub that I used to turn off a small lamp I had next to my bed how could it have been on I had no idea Since my dad was out of the building I figured I could use this afternoon without his presence to get some answers I stepped into his room to investigate what he had been doing sitting at that desk of his all those hours I grabbed a bunch of paperwork and sat myself on the double bed next to his desk it got me a slight reminder on how he hadnt gotten rid of the bed he shared with my mother yet The first paper I started examining looked like a letter of some sort as if it was a letter inside a legal template of some company I dont know how Id describe it better than that After further examination I found out it was a letter from my sister sent to our address I remember wondering why dad wouldnt show me something like this Daddy why didnt you visit me last weekend I thought you were coming back I was waiting for you Im sorry if I made a scene I thought something had happened to you I ran to you because I wanted answers no one has answers here Ive been getting visits lately why cant you come to me at the same timeI fixed some grammar and a whole lot of spelling errors for the sake of explaining this to you my sister had the linguistic abilities of a five yearold in this state On afterthought I guessed my dad didnt tell me about letters from my sister since they would inevitably prove that she wasnt in a special school for people who were after tougher challenges Although thinking about it that doesnt sound ridiculously different than a mental hospitalThe rest of the papers seemed to be a real mixture of workrelated things and records of local policeinvestigations Why would my father be looking into cases of murder pedophilia rape and almost anything you can think of It wasnt really my business what he did with his spare time but this was just outright messed up I knew he had a friend in the police force that was either the reason he had these or just the tool he used to get them I didnt even want to know at the time I had enough stuff on my mind already and I hadnt slept in far too longI apologize to whoever reading this if it seems that Im dragging it out with details a bit too much here and there Im only taking precautions to make sure that Im telling it right If Im finally going to tell my story I want it to sound right My father never came home after golfing so I assumed he went directly to work which made complete sense It was starting to get late into the evening and I had absolutely nothing better to do than to once again sit in my room I was trying to figure out ideas for new songs on my guitar This time I wasnt using the amplifier since I was legitimately scared of the noises occurring again My amplifier has been known to pick up foreign radio broadcasts before something that explains the distorted Russian speech last time I wasnt worrying about that I was thinking about my mother showing herself again Not that I was sure that it had anything to do with the amplifier itselfNot too long into that night I started feeling sick of being indoors for so long and I felt like I could use some kind of fresh air as a vacation from all this unexplained mystery I had been experiencing I remember being on the sane side of the fence thinking critically and trying to find solutions not marking everything as if it was a conspiracy from hell I figured Id take my bike down to a local gas station not more than ten minutes from my house I wanted some chips candy and maybe a couple cans of soda I scrambled together some change I found in my room and took off I got there faster than I thought I would It wasnt cold outside either it was a pretty smooth night After grabbing some generic brand of chips Skittles and a couple cans of coke I paid for it and left I didnt spend much time in the store but apparently enough time to get my bike stolen With no bike feeling like a stupid idiot for not locking it I had to walk home Something out of the ordinary happened after this and I wasnt even sure if I was seeing things at first I was walking on this huge open road I guess you could say it was somewhat of a country road It was tied together with the forest behind our house It was the type of road that didnt have any traffic other than truck drivers passing once every couple of hours at night I didnt want to believe my eyes at this point but I saw my sister standing alone wearing what youd imagine someone coming from a mental hospital would wear I assumed she was looking for me she was definitely staring at me I continued walking not necessarily fearing my sister It somehow still felt as if I had a bond with her that she would never have done anything to hurt me As I approached her she didnt give me any response what so ever she was just staring at me in a lightblue scrubcoat looking lifeless I had reached talkingdistance I couldnt believe this was happening It felt surreal like one of those scenarios you cant be prepared for in real life She had started to shake a bit I couldnt tell if she was freezing or if she was nervous I asked her if she was looking for me out there and if she had escaped the hospital She didnt respond I got the notion that she was slightly scared of me as if I was a threat to her After a short gap of silence I noticed that she was holding something behind her back I got a bit worried that she had some kind of a weapon or a blunt object to swing at me so I stepped back when I spotted it She started to slowly bring it forth it was a plastic bag From the way she was holding it I could tell it wasnt heavy or dangerous for that matter I withdrew the step back I took earlier and tried to peer down into the bag then she started to stretch it out to me I took this from your house the other day Im sorry I think this belongs to you Jonathan I do realize that I never told you my name it is indeed Jonathan I was slightly astonished that she had remembered my name even she seemed to be so out of it I remember grabbing the plastic bag she wouldnt let go of it too lightly either it was as if she still wanted it After I had gotten whatever was in the bag we shared another brief moment of silence she wouldnt stop staring into my eyes during these Then she told me to never mention any of this to our dad Shortly after she started walking towards the forest as if she knew where she was heading I saw the headlights of a car coming straight at me and my sister whoever was in this car was driving way ahead of the speed limit I noticed when it started to get closer to us that it was my dads car acting on impulse I threw myself into a nearby ditch as I got to witness my dad chasing after my sister I didnt even know if I wanted him to catch her or not she was purposely running away from him He dragged her into his car and they both drove away heading the direction he was originally going This was the second time she had successfully escaped this mental hospital and how the hell did my sister make it so far both times Something wasnt right I knew from when I was younger that the hospital wasnt anywhere close to where we lived since my dad sometimes was gone for ten hours upon visiting her Of course at the time it was supposedly a special school but that doesnt change the logic of it He never brought me with him whenever he visited my sister since he kept me in the dark about the whole hospital thingI ran the rest of the way home trying not to drop anything I still had all the items I bought at the gas station I wanted to make sure that I could get home before my dad did I had no clue whenever he would get back and not wanting him to find out whatever was in the bag my sister gave me I couldnt spot my dads car in the driveway so I felt relieved as I stepped into the house I didnt bother putting my drinks in the fridge or anything I made my way back to my room as fast as I could I dont really know why but I locked the door after me as if there was something to fear I sat myself on the bed with all the lights in the entire room switched on I made sure to put all the bags with snacks in them aside as I was getting ready to dig into whatever my sister ran into the night to give me I never really thought of something until now and that is how my sister could have found me It must have been a coincidence or she had been following me for a while knowing she couldnt approach me in the store I dont knowI looked into the bag it seemed to be random belongings from the drawers in our living room and maybe some stuff from one of the cupboards we had in the kitchen After sorting out stuff that had no relevance what so ever for example there was a roll of tape in there I planned to spend more time on the more interesting items The first thing I picked up was a small collection of family photos most being after mom died The next thing I could grab was a couple of rocks they werent even dry I guessed she must have gotten those just before she passed me the bag There was only one thing left in the bag an usbstick I took the stick out and threw away the bag Then I started looking at the photos as I was trying to reason why she would have taken any of these from our house The only thing that somewhat made sense is that a couple of them were from when she wasnt sent to the hospital yet but it was pretty much pending already In fact most of these photos took place a couple of weeks after our mother passed away On one of them its my sister showing off her prom dress she was planning on wearing she actually wasnt acting too badly the first couple of weeks I guess she didnt process our mothers death until later or something Another photo is of dads old car he had to sell it in order to compensate for our familys financial depression from when we lost the main income our family had my mothers candle business He loved that damn car with his entire heart we even used to joke about how mom was jealous of the car There were more photos but I stopped going through them when I realized a couple of them had a handwritten marking of the letter x behind them It noticed this when I was flipping them as I was trying to get them all to be facing me I sorted the photos with no marking away and started to focus more on the ones with the marking I figured my sister must have had done this for what reason I was about to find out I kept staring at the first picture it was the one I told you about earlier the one of my fathers old car It was a Pontiac from the early s and it must have cost him a fortune I never had any particular memories of the car I remember it spending most of its time in our garageI kept looking at the photograph and the more I stared at it the more I started to wonder why my dad hadnt used the car more he obviously loved it The photo was taken for an ad in the newspaper for selling it of course I was just about to put the sad photo away when I caught a glimpse of my mother sitting in the backseat It wasnt very clear and she seemed somewhat transparent She had the same drainedout appearance and blank stare that she had from when I saw her in the hallway outside my room and this was taken after her death I couldnt believe what I was looking at I remember dropping the photo out of shock so many thoughts started circling inside of my head Part

floydnimrod,132,117,1rhxtb,461,Id just come from church for some reason Im not sure why Id gone into the church but it was the weirdest service Id ever been too Everybody was there It was a packed house Rich people poor people criminals middle class folk It was all people who didnt normally go to church I looked into the coat room as I walked in and some guy was snorting cocaine on this little counter top Right in a church I was like what the hell Ive never see thatI sat in a pew and looked up There was no minister They were just playing a movie of an old church service on the screen Some little old lady was playing a hymn on an organ and the minister was applauding her She seemed happy But the audience was restless not really paying attention not sitting down just kind of wandering around talking to everybody And then I saw a woman I used to know someone I worked with years ago I went to sit down next to her and she sort of jumped on my lap and hugged me saying she was so glad to see me I wasnt sure if she was sad or drunk or terrified or just lonely but she whispered in my ear offering me sex saying shes always wanted me ever since shed known me I sort of pushed her off my lap thinking this was hardly the place for that kind of cheap pickup And then I got up and walked out There wasnt really a church service going on anyway I dont even think it was SundayAnd then for some reason I was in a car with this old lady I dont even know who it was or why I was with her She was old like my grandma Freddie but it wasnt her We were driving down the street She was driving too slow because she was kind of lost I dont think I was in Winnipeg I was on a large street almost the size of Portage with several lanes But they all seemed to be deserted like very early on a Sunday morning Im not sure if it was early in the morning or near sunset but the sun was low in the sky I think it was late in the day The streets were mostly clear thoughThe lady pulled over and for some reason she got out of the car I think she was going to ask somebody for directions I looked at the GPS thing she had on her dashboard and suddenly the direction went all fuzzy and scrambled like the satellite was confused or just no longer there And then the whole sky got this weird greenish tint to it for about ten seconds It basically turned green instead of blue but only for a moment and then it was back to normal Everybody stopped and looked upI was still in the car but I leaned forward and looked out the window The sun was over in the west low in the sky And I saw what looked like a second moon fly over the sky in a direction that was diagonal to the suns normal path It was huge And my stomach got queasy for a moment It made your stomach sick because it was so big it actually pulled on you with its own gravity like the moon pulls on the tides but much bigger and everything inside you just got tugged aroundBut it went straight across the sky without hitting When I realized how close it was though I knew it was gonna hit somewhere probably on the other side of the world The gravity of the earth pulled it in and it slingshotted around to the other side somewhere I jumped out of the car and grabbed the old ladys armCome on We have to find shelter Its gonna hit We just abandoned the car in the street and I dragged her toward a nearby fire station or hydro office or whatever it was Im not sure which it was but there were large utility trucks with lifts on them It was also deserted for some reason except for two guys loading one of the trucks We banged on the doors but it was locked up We ran from door to door trying to get in but everything was locked And then I felt a great rumble under my feet It nearly knocked me down Ive never been in an earthquake so I dont know what its like but it felt like the entire planet shivered Car alarms started going off in every direction and I heard a weird sound like gravel tumbling down a hillside except there were no hills I think it was pieces falling off houses in all directions We were able to stay on our feet though A few moments later the sky in the north went dark If I assume the sun was setting in the west and the meteor or asteroid or whatever flew over the sky in a northwest to southeast direction then it was north the black came from And I mean the entire sky Like a wall of blackness smoke and ash suddenly filling the view from the ground to the upper atmosphere from west to east as far as you could see in one huge wall of black cloud And it was coming toward us Well sort of going towards everyone everywhere I guess It came over the horizon like an charging army fast and steady advancingIt hit on the other side of the world somewhere Come on we have to get indoors We wont be able to breatheThe air started turning yellow Ash started raining down and bits of rock and debris from the blast where ever it hit I took a deep breath and held it as I was running I could already smell a weird burning rock smell like sulphur like burnt matches but more metallic Me and the lady finally got into some doors but it was just a little foyer We ran in and shut the doors behind us The inside doors were locked But it was somewhere to hide There was a fire alarm I pulled it not really knowing why I was bothering But I was sort of in a panic and not thinking straight The sign said In Case of Emergency so I pulled it The alarm went off and we looked out the window The yellow air turned brown and then dark red Then everything went black The black cloud fell over the whole sky with a clattering rumble that sounded like it was raining gravel instead of water And all light went out of the worldThe world as we knew it was over Even if we survived life as we know it would never be the same Wed be set back  years reduced to hunter gatherers again living out of caves If we survived the impact that is I honestly dont think anybody would have survived the shockwave Something with that

Exxile,99,162,1rbws0,422,Hello reddit Im a killer and I have no problem admitting that Many people have fallen victim to my gruesome attacks and I live life regretting none of it Im only sharing my story on here  so that someone out there can know about it Whether or not you choose to believe it is up to youI was a normal child but normal is relative so who am I to make that call What I should say is that I grew up how you would expect a kid to grow up My parents treated me properly I did great in school and I had many friends It wasnt until high school that I started feeling the need to kill It was all so spontaneous I was just sitting in class one day staring at one of the students when the image of him dying popped into my head I zoned out and focused on the image his body lying in a pool of blood leaking from his head His arms were snapped behind his back  and his feet were missing the big toes A few weeks later that daydream became a reality and I got away with itEveryone in the school was whispering rumors to one another as I walked to classes Some were saying that he joined the army others were convinced that he just moved like so many other kids did before him I was the only one who knew the truth and I had to hide my devilish grin from the rest of the school That was my only murder in high school but it ignited the flameWhen I reached adult hood I landed a successful job and had plenty of money to obtain the tools I had always dreamed of using on my victims Thats when I began to develop a signature style I would always sever the big toes but I no longer snapped the arms behind the back Honestly the sound of the bones breaking didnt sit well with me Every day I would watch the news expecting to see that one of the victims had been found but they never were Years went by and I targeted another twelve victims They were no one in particular Women teenagers it really didnt matter to me A dead body is a dead body in my eyes I dont care who it belongs to Very few of them would put up a fight and that was fine with me I wasnt trying to drag out the last moments of their lives I just wanted them to die I wanted to savor the warmth of their blood on my hands as I slit their throat  About a week after I killed my final victim I met a girl that I ended up falling in love with She doesnt realize how close she was to becoming just another undiscovered body She wasnt able to have kids which was fine with me I never really saw myself as a father Neither of us believe in god so we saw no point in getting married I was okay with this as well I felt like my life was finally going to be normal again After we had been together for a few years I decided to tell her about my past I made a special dinner for her to lighten the mood However when I told her she just laughed and thought I was being ridiculous It turned into her treating it like some type of role playing fantasy I had and she ignored me as I told her it was the truth I didnt know how to prove it to her so I killed someone in front of her One night I brought her with me on what she thought was a date When we got to the spot I opened the trunk so she could see my victim She still thought it was a joke and asked me how I got my friend to agree to this I think she finally understood that it was no joke as I sliced the mans throat Her face turned pale and she reached into her purse to get her phone I was prepared for this though and I knocked her unconscious After I finished with  my signature killing pattern I drove back to the house My secret was not safe with her but I loved her too much to kill herRight now shes kept in my basement I dont treat her like a prisoner mind you she has everything she could ever want Im hoping in time I can start leaving her untied at night so shell quit trying to escape I know one day shell accept who I am Maybe one day shell help me fulfill my new fantasy of killing together Or perhaps you guys wont believe me either and youll brush this off as just another made up story But thats the funny thing about being a killer,1385266368.0,The funny thing about being a killer is that no one believes you if you tell them the truth,584,nosleep,top_week
ephique,71,123,1rlj0w,391,Part  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrikrxiwanttotellaboutmymotherOne of the ideas that spawned in my mind was that my sister was trying to tell me that our mother wasnt dead Another one which I didnt even want to think about was that this was our mother being back from the dead I assumed after giving it a couple of minutes that my sister had edited the photo somehow or that it was just random shades in the leather of the backseat forming what looked a lot like the face of our mother I was feeling very uncomfortable at this point but I still made the decision to carry on and look at the other photo with a marking on This one was a photo of dad holding up a big worm we had found in the backyard I hadnt seen him as happy as he was on that photo for a long time I remember feeling some kind of sensation looking at it He was standing in the middle of the woods not too far away from where I met my sister earlier I could tell where the scene took place from the utmost right part of the picture where half my tree house I once built with my dad peeked out I tried finding something as disturbing as I had found on the former picture when a sudden banging on my door started It was violent and heavy before I knew it I could hear a voice I know youre in there did you speak to your sister when she was here It was my dad had he seen me on the street next to my sister I didnt know and I didnt exactly have the time to think either I hid all the photos under my bed and opened the door looking as if I just woke up Your sister has been in the house again hasnt she I told him that I hadnt seen my sister since that one time she was found naked in the kitchen Alright thats good Im just checking since I figured she might have been here again After that I told him once again that I hadnt seen her and then he finally left me alone I couldnt figure out why he seemed so upset and angry especially considering what I recently witnessed out on the road Something wasnt right about any of this On top of that I had a photo of what seemed to be my dead mother in the backseat of my dads old car Thinking about this reminded me about the second photo now when my dad had gone to bed I could examine it freely I guess the second photo gave me some kind of a nudge reminding me that my sister wasnt the only one who changed after my mothers death My dad looked so happy I dont remember too much about the incident in the photo I was assuming they took it as a joke since my dad was holding the worm as if it was a huge sea monster he had found at the bottom of the ocean I didnt even know who took it I assumed it was one of my sisters old friends I ended up putting the picture back under the bed in order to get some sleep Again it wasnt easy sleepingI finally did get some sleep that night although not before I spent a good couple of hours thinking of the disturbing image of my fathers old Pontiac I wasnt as scared when it had gotten bright outside and I could hear my father vacuum cleaning downstairs So I was tempted to continue my investigation into the second photograph something I started doing before I had even gotten my pants on I just couldnt spot anything out of the ordinary I guess I never filled you in completely about the details of the picture It wasnt just my dad showing off the worm my sister was actually in the picture Just next to my dad to the left She was walking towards the camera looking somewhat blurry since she was in motion I had no idea why my sister would mark this one it really seemed like a normal photo out of any family album I ended up putting it on my desk leaving the rest of the photos under the bed This when I remembered the usb memory I had found in the bag being excited as all hell I powered my computer up as fast as I could I didnt even let the sorry thing load fully before I mashed the usb stick into one of my empty slots I didnt actually expect the drive to work It looked very rugged and old I was expecting that dialogue window telling me that I would need to format the drive in order to use it But it did work the suggestion box on what to do with the drive showed up making it easy for me to explore it right away On the root of the stick there were two folders Revision and SelRevision I had no idea what any of that was about I figured Id start with the former It consisted of a very long list of documents all named in chronological order starting with the date and ending with some kind of code When it came to the codes I couldnt see any pattern what so ever maybe the inside of the documents would explain that The names of the files looked like  GKQ or  YYB Inevitably I started opening the documents all of them were pdffiles I got a bit disappointed when I realized that it was nothing else than what my fathers desk was already drowning in it was the local criminal records I even recognized some of them from before I didnt even bother checking most of them You have to understand that these were all within the same template and they included loads of information of the kind that I believed was completely irrelevant I went back to the root of the memory stick to check out the second folder not expecting anything else than what I just saw in the first folder I guess you could say I was right it had the same type of information that the first folder had Although not as many documents in fact it only had two of them Out of curiosity I compared the files in this folder with the former folder and it turned out they were copies from the first folder I had no idea why someone would do that Let alone my dad who I guessed this originally belonged toThe two files in the second folder were both records of rape and psychological torment both unsolved cases left with no real evidence The documents were connected to eachother the police suspecting they shared a criminal Both had dates around four years prior to me finding the usb stick although a lot of the information inside them took place later Stated in the records was an anonymous victim In fact it seemed to be the only victim listed who had phoned in to alarm the police about these incidents long after the crimes were committed I didnt even want to know what I was looking at after that It had detailed descriptions of what this person had done apparently very sick and sexually violent crimes I wont get into detail but just know this was the type of information that would let some of the best of us to empty our stomachs readingI wasnt sure how I was going to get rid of the usb stick I had no clue were my dad originally kept it Even if I did I had no idea if he knew it was gone or not if he did he would have known I put it back in its spot I ended up putting it in my back pocket along with the second marked photograph I remember wishing I had more friends at this point since I could have used a break from the atmosphere of our house I could still hear my father vacuum cleaning downstairs not having anything better to do I figured Id see if he could use an extra pair of hands it was after all a pretty big house for just me and him When I had paced myself downstairs my father wasnt anywhere to be seen I followed the sound of the vacuum cleaner into the kitchen The vacuum cleaner was left on my father still wasnt anywhere to be seen I turned off the noisy thing and dedicated a minute of silence to figuring out where my dad was and why he would have left the vacuum cleaner on It didnt even look like he had gotten started cleaning the kitchen it was dirt and dust all over the floor I also had thoughts about dumping the usb drive in one of the cupboards but I never did I didnt notice when I stepped into the kitchen but I noticed later that it seemed like someone had been looking for something in there some of the drawers were open and even the fridge had been moved I was guessing someone had been taking a peek behind it I figured I might as well push the fridge back to its original position As I was using all the energy I had left after these sleepless nights in attempt to move the fridge I kept staring out the window which I could just barely see gazing into our living room I could see the forest I used to play in growing up I remember it was a quite windy and chilly afternoon That didnt exactly invite me outdoors I could even see my old tree house in the distance I couldnt believe my father spent so much time with me trying not to make it fall apart something it kept doing Since I had spent something close to an hour examining an old photo that partly took place in the view I got outside the window I figured Id walk into the living room and take a better look at it Upon entering the room I could see my mother staring at me through the window next to it I reacted with impulsively retracting to the kitchen as fast as I could I think instincts took over I summoned the courage to walk in there again and my mother was no longer to be seen She looked scared this time as if she was hiding from me It gave me the chills to say the least I didnt feel like peeking out the window anymore but I did notice something out there that was suspiciously different from the picture I had in my back pocket I noticed one of the trees in the photo had been slightly damaged a lot of twigs missing the bark looking weak at some spots None of this took place anymore whatever originally caused it must have stopped Id also like to mention that you would imagine that the nature would have grown a noticeable chunk by the years but I could barely tell that this photo was taken any earlier than a week before judging from the forest alone My dad looked younger of course This is when I noticed a cluster of rocks piled up behind our flowerbed a bit into the forest I wasnt sure if those rocks where there days ago or not I had never seen them The photo happened to cover a view behind the flowerbed and not a single rock was visible My dad must have done some sorting out in the woods recently not that he had ever worried about taking care of the forest behind our house before Not giving it more of a thought I made plans to head back to my room upstairs Later night was closing in I didnt know what to make out of any of this all I knew is that I thought something was wrong with me since I kept seeing my mother I remember blaming it on all those sleepless nights I had experienced I originally planned on sleeping when I entered my room I couldnt take much more madness But as I was expecting I couldnt sleep It felt as if I had a weight on my chest preventing me from relaxing or breathing easily I didnt even want to listen to music or read a book I was just laying there with my eyes closed in my dark roomI kept thinking that I heard something A small tap from the other side of the room or a creaking noise from the door I remember putting my hands over my ears while constantly telling myself that I was just being gullible that I was just sizing up small coincidences because I was scared Wanting to become one with reason I figured Id remove my hands from atop of my ears and open my eyes so I could prove to myself that there was nothing in my room I just wanted to sleep I opened my eyes it was dead silent in my room I looked around from left to right and there was nothing to be seen in the room That relieved me a bit but it wasnt enough to convince me I was safe I figured Id get it over with and turn on the lights again so I did I was more than happy with seeing that there was nothing unexpected in my room I hit the light switch again and started to climb back into bed when I heard a tired voice from the other side of the room Jona I wasnt sure if I imagined it or not I was so full of fear that I couldnt move I was halfway into my bed and it was impossible to stay as still as I wanted to I remember the springs in my bed making a constant noise as I was halfway into the bed It didnt sound much like my mother but no one else called me Jona I turned around slowly and saw my mother looking at me from outside the window as if she was standing on the garage roof just outside This time she didnt disappear she kept staring at me I had no idea what to do she looked completely solid as if she was a still image I remember not even having the courage to say anything and at the same time I couldnt take my eyes off of her Her face was deranged and disfigured so sad with a look of misfortune I made an escape from my room and ran down the stairs as fast as I could apparently I fell before reaching half the way downI woke up the next day in a hospital it was a doctor and my father standing there looking at me as if they were waiting for a sleeping pill to lose its effect Upon waking up I remember telling my father about what I had seen he assumed I had a nightmare and told me to get some more rest I yelled at him again I explained how it wasnt a dream also adding that it wasnt the only time I had seen her I remember the doctor telling my father that dreams could seem more realistic after you had been knocked out My father leaned in and told me to shut my mouth or I would end up where my sister was I didnt know what to thinkLuckily my legs werent severely damaged my father only took me to the hospital because I passed out I guess that would explain the minor pain I was feeling at the back of my head Both of them went away somewhere leaving me alone in my part time hotel of a temporary bedroom It wasnt that luxurious it was like a normal room in any American hospital I felt ready to go home but I wasnt sure if they would let me go I could just barely hear my father discussing that matter with one of the nurses outside it sounded like they came to a conclusion My father walked into my room and told me that we could leave I wasnt sure if he threatened them to get that option I made it back to my fathers car I guess I cant say back since I had no memory of travelling in his car on the way there but I had to assume I did During the trip home I remember my father acting nervous as if he didnt fancy passing that side of town I dont think he was used to driving there The hospital took place in the opposite direction from where the bottle factory was relying that being from our house of course When we got home he dropped me off in our driveway then he told me he had to go golfing I personally thought he looked way too serious to be going for a golf session maybe the stakes were high Shortly after saying goodbye his car was around the corner nowhere to be seen I paced myself into our house I remember feeling relieved and anew as if my accident in the staircase had given me a fresh start I wasnt worrying as much but I still wanted answers You know that feeling when you just know something isnt right I had it all over me Before moving on I made sure to empty our mailbox it was almost fullI realized when I entered the house that my dad had finally gotten around to cleaning the kitchen maybe he figured out that the vacuum cleaner needed manual handling Although at the same time it didnt make much sense where did he find the time to clean the kitchen It was still dirty when I fell down the stairs late the other night and this was early morning the next day I guess my dad was one flexible cleaner Or maybe I was mixing up the times I did get a pretty solid hit to the back of my head I was going to grab something out of the fridge but I remembered the snacks I bought the other day I never got around to eating them Knowing they were in my room upstairs I started to make my way up there As I was sipping on one of the soda cans I tried making my way through the mountain of post I had collected from the mailbox There wasnt much interesting a lot of it seemed to be bills my father hadnt gotten around to paying yet with the occasional letter from my fathers bank I assumed the bank was sending him statements maybe for buying half a ton of golf equipment online Although I had never spotted any golf equipment what so ever maybe he kept that in the trunk of the car I came around to a letter that fitted the template I remembered from my sisters letter I had no idea what to do of course I wanted to read it but my father would inevitable find out After giving it a couple of seconds I figured I could just open it and never show it to my father at all How would he know that he ever got it Upon opening the envelope I noticed a tearoff slip attached to the main letter this must have been torn off already when I found my sisters old letter I wasnt sure what to think of it it was a returning to sender notice Not knowing how that made any sense I figured Id dig into the actual message of the post Before I started reading I couldnt help to give some attention to the layout it just didnt make sense It had this template that I had seen before wrapping the handwritten message from my sister into a box in the middle I couldnt find a business or a company name anywhere on it and it seemed to be in a pretty sloppy quality It looked a lot like someone had printed it out with a printer that was just running out of ink not only that but it also didnt look like an original copy of the template You could see that aligning of a muffled shadow copy that you would get if someone scanned the document and printed it out I didnt know what type of mental institution my sister was at but it sure couldnt be an expensive one I jumped into the messageThank you for seeing me daddy I had started to think you didnt care about me anymore Ive always felt relieved and secure in your presence Sometimes it might not seem like it but I have always respected you for teaching me wrong from right Sometimes I think this home isnt helping me it was better before Visit us againI love you daddy Sincerely your little darlingOnce again I had to correct a huge load of errors for the sake of this story Id also like to add that the absolute last word darling was more of a guess than a correction It was mostly faded into the white background and accounting for possible spelling errors there was no way I could be sure it said darling I felt somewhat eased after reading the letter I didnt know my sister and my dad had a bond like that There was a date signed underneath her message it wasnt in the same handwriting as my sisters I figured she was too mentally incapable to remember dates someone at the hospital must have been handling the dating I had to either get rid of the letter once and for all or hide it somewhere my father would never find it Not over thinking it I ended up putting it under the bed with my other stuff from earlier when I realized all of it was gone The photographs and the rocks I didnt even remember if I had put something else there as well either way it was gone The usb memory that I had put in my back pocket was surprisingly still there and so was the picture of my dad holding the worm Suspecting my father for taking the stuff under my bed I figured I had to find a new hiding spot for the letter My room was a bit like an open field there was no real good hiding spot in it I finally figured I could put the letter under my doormat knowing it might not have been the best spotJust before sliding it underneath I took a last glance at the signed date it was the day I met my sister on the road Now the message made less sense she didnt seem to be acting very positive about seeing my dad that night I also wouldnt call that incident a visit They must have had a lot of letters going in and out of the mental hospital making the posting of some letters somewhat late Thats the only explanation I could think of It wasnt my sister who signed the date after all it wasnt even the original letter since they scanned her handwritten message onto the template I didnt know if they did that out of convenience or safety maybe bothIt was starting to get a bit dark outside and my father was still away hopefully enjoying swinging a golf club Not being sure what to do and not having any motivation to do anything musically I ended up walking down to our kitchen in order to manage a way to get something to eat This is when I noticed all the photographs from under my bed laying on a coffee table we had in the corner of the kitchen My dad definitely found them Luckily I had nothing to fear since if you think about it it wasnt anything else than old family pictures taken from our house I dont know what reason I could have had for having them but making something up shouldnt be too hard if he ever were to ask meWe had a big mirror in the kitchen It used to be kept clean when my mother was around now it had collected dust and a bit of what I believed was grease from my fathers hair products I put some microwave pizza into the microwave and started to check out the bruises I had gotten on my legs using the mirror They looked gruesome and painful but to tell you the truth they didnt bother me too much It was as if most of the pain that got caused to me when I fell down the stairs got past me during the time I spent dozed off in the hospital I guess I felt lucky considering that things could have gone way worse I didnt want to believe it anymore I caught a glimpse of my mother staring at me through the window behind me once again from our backyard I didnt want to turn around Even though I had lost the sight of her in the blink an eye I was still staring into the mirror making sure nothing was behind me It was just me and the humming noise coming from the microwave I might just have seen her for a fraction of a second but I could tell she looked older this time Much much older Part of me felt like I should have known better than to look into a mirror its hard to explain what I was thinking during these moments It was as if every experience I had could have been a coincidence or could have had a psychological explanation rooting from the loss of sleep I had been having After each and every incident it felt like it wouldnt happen againI turned off the microwave before my pizza was finished and stepped into the living room I wouldnt be able to tell you today why I did this but it felt as if my mother was leading me to it I ran out to the backyard I was getting so sick of this I wanted it to end It felt as if I had nothing to lose anymore It was dark outdoors by now night had fallen over the town faster than I expected it to I made myself to the miniature mountain of rocks behind our flowerbed I was scared and I didnt even know of what anymore I kept pushing rock after rock off of the gentle hill someone had formed Some of them went to the left some of them went to the right I tried to distribute them as evenly as I could When most of the rocks were out of the way I was standing on top of a soft soil I couldnt tell from how dark it was what color the soil had but it seemed somewhat greyI ran as fast as I could back to our garage where my fathers old Pontiac used to be parked I knew we had garden tools somewhere in there I was out of luck the bigger shovel I believed we had was nowhere to be found and all I managed to get my hands on was a smaller shovel made for picking up plants from a home garden I made my way back to behind the flowerbed It was getting really dark now I could barely make out what anything around me was I kept digging as fast as I could I believe my sanity was starting to fade out for an instance After a while I was about two feet down into the ground and still nothing could be found I wasnt expecting to be able to see much so once every five inches or so Id feel my way through the dirt in order to make out if there was something down there This is when I heard my father park his car in the driveway I didnt want to know what he would do if he saw me digging in the forest not far from our backward it didnt help that it was dark outside I remember saying to myself Why couldnt he go directly to work after golfing tonight It felt like God was playing a trick on me I left the small shovel in the newly dug hole since it already was obvious someone had been digging out there anyway I tried to be as quiet as I could not wanting to take the route to the other side of the house since I hadnt heard the door shut yet something that implied my father still hadnt entered the house I was sitting where I earlier had witnessed my mother staring into the house I was doing the same Being ridiculously scared of my father seeing me I kept my head held low waiting for him to enter the house I eventually heard the trunk of his car close followed by him entering the house I was thinking of sneaking around the house in order to enter the front door while pretending to have been at Tims place something that wouldnt work since I had dirt covering my waist and down I sat there looking at my father in the kitchen knowing that I had no reasonable explanation to what I was doing if he spotted meIt took almost thirty minutes before he came into the living room I had no idea what he was doing in the kitchen for that long I could hear as he walked around he never took his shoes off As he started to move his head in my direction I dashed down under the window just in time I could hear the footsteps coming closer to me I couldnt see anything but I could tell he must have stopped just next to the window I guessed he was staring out the window looking for something Out of fear I started crawling trying to get away from the window I spotted one of our old outdoor tables standing next to the same wall as the window knowing the risk of my father spotting me I figured Id give it a try anyway I thought I made it to the table without being heard or seen something that I believed was a miracle at the time My father looked confused he was still staring out the window I didnt know what he was looking for I could only have feared he had noticed that the pile of rocks was gone He started to move I was relieved I was hoping he would be heading for bed but it turned out he was heading for the light switches Leaving the lights in the living room alone he turned on the outdoor lights Now he could clearly see that the pile of rocks was gone he started to look anxious and puzzled I remember still sitting under that table as he ran past me heading into the forest As soon as he was a good distance into the woods I started to sneak around the house making my way inside I was panicking to say the least and I had to find a new pair of jeans Luckily for me we had the washing machine just as you entered the house to the left I threw my old pair of jeans onto the floor and grabbed a new pair from the washer we had the type of washing machine thatd have a drying mechanism as part of the washer so the pair I got a hold of wasnt terribly wet Before running straight up to my room I grabbed my old pair with me all would have been for nothing if he could still find those on his way in I remember seeing my dad standing out there in the woods looking at a note of some sort He looked a bit confused almost as if he was reading instructions for something Once I had made it to my room I locked the door after me I was very stressed out and I had no idea what was happening anymore I knew I had to hide my old pair of jeans somehow and you know from earlier that my room wasnt the best place in the world when it came to finding a good hiding spot After not too many seconds of thought I figured I could throw the pair out the window onto the garage roof Before I did that I thought itd be a good idea to empty the back pocket It felt like my heart rate went full force when I realized the pocket was empty My mind started spinning where could I have dropped the photograph and the usb stick I had no idea At first I thought I must have dropped it when I took them off or on the way up to my room since I was holding my pants pretty sloppy throughout most of that running That was when it hit me in the chest my father wasnt reading any instructions out in the backyard he must have been looking at the photographLast

tellmewhatiswrong,54,71,1reivz,243,Arghhh I have no idea what to make of this situation I find myself inI started off  as being in the most amazing relationship Ive ever had I married the girl of my dreams last year after being together for  years prior to that She is the most beautiful intelligent interesting person I have ever met and I knew that as soon as we met each other Immediately the chemistry between us was electricDont get me wrong we are extremely different in a lot of ways but up until this point that has only helped to make our relationship stronger Im an atheist a kind of scientific nerd I guess She on the other hand was morenew age I guess you could say Not particularly religious but interested in the paranormal philosophy anything that cant really be explained It would not surprise me to see her out hunting for UFOs however for the most part this side of her was really just limited to reading about such events and watching the odd documentaryHaving said that she is so sensible and smart Shes a very curious person thats what I put her hobbies down to really Its never been more than a passing interest of hers She works as a personal assistant to the CEO of a law firm in the city Everyone says she should study law because her talents are wasted as a secretary But she seems content enough at the momentwell she didThe reason I find myself in this mess is because she has changed her mind about something we used to agree on  kids When we first got together we both agreed that we did not want to have children We based our entire relationship on that premise We were content with travelling the world expensive wines and sex on the kitchen bench All that would change if kids came into the picture I have never wanted children and dont feel like I ever willShe used to feel the same Until her sister had a baby She started to get a little clucky she said She started to see us with a baby of our own At first I thought it was just a passing comment but the longer time went on the more I realised she was serious Thats when the fights started Fight after fight every week Her crying and yelling and begging me to change To compromise Me dumbfounded and annoyed that one of the foundations of marriage is suddenly being challenged Things have been said in the heat of the moment and both of us have been deeply hurt by the other She makes me feel like I cant give her what she needs that Im denying her her happiness I make her feel like shes not important she says That Im being selfishMaybe I am I dont knowSo we found ourselves in a stale mate She posted something on Reddit asking for advice and most of the suggestions directed us to attend couples counsellingI was reluctant to say the least But I was willing to give it a shotSandra our therapist was actually not what I expected She seemed rational and quite straightforward not the Einsteinesque shrink that I had imagined She advised that we really we had two options  either she could stay with me and be without a child Or she could leave me for someone who would give her a baby We seem to be stuck in secret option number  staying in the circumstances we find ourselves inDisregarding all the fighting she was still her normal self and we have been managing to keep it together and still spend some quality time together We have still been going out with friends and going for walks with our dog and I know we still love each otherI stopped going to couples counselling I sort of felt like she couldnt give us a real answer she was only there to listen My wife kept attending on her own though I think she takes some kind of comfort in itShe came home last week and told me that shes going to be attending a Self help seminar and would I like to go I said definitely not I couldnt think of anything worse than to be honest Even the counselling sessions were too much for me She asked if I minded if she went She said it was with some famous psychoanalyst and that her therapist would be in attendance on the Assistance Team I said whatever she felt would help She said she feels it will help her clear her head on the baby issue Im all for anything that could help us get back on track so I told her to go for itThe seminar seemed pretty intensive It was  hours a day Friday Saturday and Sunday of last week It was also very expensive but I bit my tongue She got home last night and just seemed exhausted I havent gotten many details out of her as every night when she arrived home she went straight to sleep and we barely had time to speak Today we both had the day off which was recommended by the people who organised the seminarToday we woke up and she wasintense I woke up with her clinging to me for dear life She was stroking my face and staring into my face It was quite nice actually Nice to have some affection We cuddled in bed for a long while She seemedok Her eyes definitely looked brighter but she didnt say much just was very intensely affectionate She got up to have a shower and I went out to have some breakfast After about half an hour I knocked on the bathroom door telling her to leave some hot water She must have had it on so hot steam was pouring out of the door into our hallway and the walls were dripping with condensation I knocked a few more times and yelled out to her but got no responseI opened the door and waited for the hazy steam to clear to see her standing there fully clothed and staring in the mirror The shower was on full ball and extremely hot and I reached over the turned the tap off She didnt take her eyes off her own reflection She was very vague when I questioned her and sweating profusely I managed to get her dressed out her pyjamas and shes in the other room now watching TVI assume this weird behaviour is something to do with the seminar I dont really understand all this new age crap has anyone else ever been to one of these seminars Or know someone that has Ive tried googling more information but cant see anything about this specific group Any advice would be appreciated Im a bit weirded out right now to be honestUpdate

afewsmallrepairs,13,64,1rff0q,243,Theres always some chipper real estate agent waiting at the door with her flyers and her toobig smile and her nails painted to match her pantssuit  Theyre nosy and smothering but today I see that this one is busy with a bright young couple pointing out how much eastern light the kitchen gets with one perfectlylacquered finger the same goddamn shade of melonred as her smart little blazer  I still take a flyer from the cheery wicker basket in the front hallway out of politeness more than anythingThe house smells like cookies  Its an old realtor trick make someone think that they could be happy in this strange new place picture yourself cozied up on the couch with a plate of freshbaked chocolate chip cookies and a mug of hot cocoa and suddenly the price doesnt seem quite so steep  People want to feel like theyre homeIts a candle I think  Smells soursweet and artificialI realize suddenly Ive been standing alone in the foyer for a few minutes staring aimlessly into the house  Where to begin  The living room I guessTheres a big ugly fauxleather couch along one wall  The cheap kind you find at Big Lots  It doesnt serve much except to fill up the space  Its flanked by two particle board end tables little doilies on top of these  Miss MelonRed Blazer doesnt have much of a sense of style if this is her handiwork  The room looks like a scene straight out of a s Sears catalog  I can feel one of my headaches coming on like the low rumbling of summer thunder on the horizonThere are little dimples on the walls paint covering old nail holes left behind from family photos that once hung there  Scenes of summer vacations children playing smiling happy faces  You only put up pictures if the people in them are smiling rightWell the realtor hasnt put up any pictures  The room feels empty skeletal without themI move into the bathroom  Nothing special here more mementos from Walmart in the form of a seashellshaped soap dish and a tacky plastic shower curtain but Ive found the cookiescented candle so I blow it out with deep sense of satisfactionThere are two bedrooms  One at each end of the hall  I choose the one to my right feeling faintly like Alice in Wonderland as the real estate agent babbles away in the sunny kitchens eastern lightIts a small bedroom  The baseboards look brand new even though the house is several decades old whoever replaced them was an amateur  This looks like a shitty piecemeal job done by someone without nearly enough time or care  Its a shame is what it is  This would all have to be redoneTheyve set up this room as a home office but it should be the childrens bedroom  Where the thriftstore desk and bookshelf sit I can picture two tiny pink beds with matching flowery comforters sweet shiny stickers placed haphazardly across each headboard as little girls sometimes doThe headache is no longer approaching its here spidery sensations of dull pain spreading across my brain  I tap my knuckles against the space between my eyes but it holds fastFocus  I brace myself against the doorframe and there it is the telltale trace of someones childhood tiny little ticmarks carved in the wood to indicate height and its progression through time  I run my fingertips along these marks still so visible through the fresh coat of paint  It even looks like someone tried to sand them off  who would do something like that  Who would try to erase the remnants of someones lifeIf I dont leave I might faint all the blood is in my head with the headache so I do leave I move down the hall to the other roomThis one is the master bedroom  Looks like they couldnt afford a bed to properly stage the scene so this one feels even emptier than the den  The walls have been repainted a cheerful robinsegg blue but its wrong  Its all wrongThey did a fantastic job covering any sign of the fire but this color I hate this color it clashes with my bedspread and I wouldve never slept here beneath this hideous shade of blue  though there were many nights I suppose I didnt sleep I lay awake for hours trying to comprehend what had gone wrong where he was and why he thought he could fool meI drop to a knee to touch the outlet in the wall  Its new of course they wouldve had to replace it  Faulty wiring that causes fires well that just wouldnt do  When the bank takes a house it cant sell one with such a serious problem  Sometimes things need to be replaced resold  A fixerupper thats what theyd call itThe headache is in full force now yet a small smile tugs at the corner of my mouth when I remember everything hed promised to do to this damned house all the little projects he swore up and down hed finish someday to make this place perfect for me things that went forgotten when he decided his energy would be better spent fucking any secretary at the office that looked his wayIt wasnt hard  I went to the library two counties over and did research on arson  I was careful used the private browser on Google Chrome and still cleared the history wore a wig  Id seen enough about Casey Anthony to know how careful you have to be even if she did get off  but no one will ever truly believe she was innocent shell be a pariah forever and thats simply not how I planned to live the rest of my lifeIm really sorry about the children  My daughters  I truly am  I didnt know theyd be in our bed that night  They were supposed to be at a friends house but they came home early someone had pulled someone elses hair and that set everything off like a line of terrible fateful dominoes and the headaches were getting worse and it was probably all for the best anyway  I didnt do anything that couldnt be fixed with a few small repairs both to the house and my lifeIt makes me so angry  He was still acting like father of the year when every night for months he slipped under the sheets beside me reeking of some other womans sex  He couldnt even bother to take a shower and rinse the stink off his dick but he was still being a model dad letting our daughters snuggle next to him when the boogeyman came in the dark and mommy wasnt there because she was away at her own mommys the perfect alibi for when the police came to tell her Im sorry maam theres been an accident could you please come with usIm still crouched next to the outlet when I hear Miss MelonRed Blazer behind me inquiring politely if theres anything she can help me with  The bright young couple has gone and it smells like shes relit the candle in the bathroomI straighten tucking a strand of the long blonde wig behind my ear and smiling in the way that makes members of the service industry smile back at meI explain Im just looking  The price on the house is so low though what could possibly cause such a dramatic drop in this recovering economyThe real estate agents smile falters and she hesitates  I know shes bound by law to tell me to explain what happened here and why the pricetag on a little creampuff in a nice neighborhood is next to nothingI know the old saying about returning to the scene of the crime how dangerous it is and how not careful Im being right now but something in me cant resist because I can still see the little matching beds the stickers across the headboards and the ticmarks on the doorframe and something inside me needs to hear her say it to quantify each and every step I took to get hereWell she says slowly about a year ago there was a fireI nod and smile and as she tells me my story in her own words and somewhere in the back of my skull the headache lets go the pain in my brain dissipating at last leaving behind just me and the real estate agent in my old bedroom standing in the same place where about a year ago my plan went into motion and I set my husband and children

ephique,111,105,1ro3vw,245,Part  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrikrxiwanttotellaboutmymotherPart  httpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrljwiwanttotellaboutmymotherpartI had to make a snap decision at this point I couldnt just stand there My father obviously knew I had been out there since he already had gotten hold of the rest of my photo collection from underneath the bed My first initiative was to open the window and see if there was any chance of escaping the villa altogether a plan that probably would have worked if I didnt get interrupted before even grabbing the handle Needless to say my father had already gotten to the door He tried opening it by force but luckily I had remembered to lock itWhy is the door locked is Jonathan in there with you He shouted and continued pounding the door as if it had a threshold for pain I assumed he thought my sister had locked herself into the room Had he seen my sister around the house At least he wasnt suspecting me for doing the digging Open the door we can talk about this I want to know what you did in my backyard Darling I think he gave up on the possibility of me even being in the room he probably figured I would have spoken up Not being entirely sure what to do I figured Id take a social turn of events Linda isnt in here what do you want dadI remember how quiet it got after I replied to him and not just because of the banging Your sister was uhm Your sister was acting all crazy out there today she has escaped again Im starting to think theres something seriously wrong with this hospital Im paying my good money for He really sounded like he didnt expect me to be in there after all I cant lie though a part of me thought he was bluffing to get me to open the door I had a lot of twisted feelings about the whole thing but I figured I would have to give in he didnt sound too angry toward the end Luckily for me he didnt seem to be too much of a threat after I had finally opened the door I remember thinking If he wanted me dead he wouldnt have taken me to the doctor when I fell down the stairs He acted completely normal he even asked me if I wanted something from the store he needed to head off to work That reminded me of when I was a kid he would always buy me a snack on his way home from work I told him I could use one or two cans of soda I wasnt very comfortable speaking to him at this point as you can imagine He also seemed a bit unstable like there was some quick task he wanted to get out of the way I did what I could to keep the conversation short Before leaving he told me to give a call if I spotted my sister adding that the hospital had phoned him about itI cant express with words how relieved I felt seeing him leave the house again I was also very confused I didnt even know what I thought of my father at the time let alone my sister Was she in close proximity had my father seen her I had no idea When I was completely sure his car wasnt just out of sight but also out of hearing distance I knew I had to finish what I started Something gave me courage I knew I should have been more scared but something kept me going I gathered a flashlight from the cupboard in our kitchen and headed back into the forest behind our backyard I knew something was underneath that flowerbed especially judging from that anxious stare my father had when he noticed the pile of rocks was gone I thought I was imagining things out of the stress I felt as I was digging deeper and deeper into the soft soil I thought I could see my mother staring at me from a distance always at the end of my vision No matter where I looked that feeling followed me I could barely see anything I kept the same strategy I used before feeling my way through the soil every five inches or so I was losing my mind in fear of being watched I kept hearing twigs snapping and that distinct sound of someone walking on leaves No one was ever to be seen a notion that wasnt very comforting since my poor flashlight didnt reach much more than ten feet   I remember hitting something of a different texture with that small pointy shovel of mine I could barely summon the willpower to point my flashlight toward it It was a hand a pale lifeless hand I already thought I knew whose hand it was but I wanted to make sure I followed it with my source of light finding the torso it was attached to I couldnt breathe and I wanted to cry but the fear of someone hearing me was stronger than that I pointed my flashlight at the face and ended up dropping it in astonishment Now I couldnt hold it together anymore I screamed and I cried as loud as I could I tried to cover up the body with what dirt I could grasp giving up shortly after I ran back to the house that was the only reasonable thing I could think of I felt so tumbled inside of my head I didnt know what to think anymore It felt as if I was under the influence of a mindmelting drug I was so full of fear and anger that I couldnt tell if I was thinking or not I was standing in the living room of our house completely out of reason for the moment The neurons finally fired and I grabbed the landline phone and called the police I knew that the first thing to do upon phoning the police was to add all details concerning where you are after that I added Im in serious need of help right now I could be in danger Make your way here as fast as possible Very obvious additions I was scared and I dont think anyone would blame me My father has killed my sister I found her buried in the backyard I was crying as I threw these hard lines out there It was as if not saying them out loud would keep them from being true I felt helpless The woman on the other side of the line told me to hang on as she was about to ask me questions about my situation I thought Id be safer upstairs so I carried the phone with me and locked myself in my room it felt like a habit at this point The woman told me that officers would be at my destination within minutes so I felt relatively confident ending the call Shortly after that I noticed something unsettling in my room the doormat wasnt pointing in the right direction It was one of those doormats with a short greeting on top Mine wasnt anything out of the ordinary it said welcome home It caught me offguard the letter from my sister wasnt underneath it anymore My father had known all along I felt chills running down my spine as I kept thinking about how I had potentially been running into his trap there was no way he went to work I made a run for it I wanted to run as fast and as far as I could On my way down the stairs I spotted him in the living room She brought it upon herself Jonathan He said as if it was an obvious fact I was scared as I got to witness how my father acted in his true colors I always knew mom didnt die from a liverfailure and now I know what you have done to my sister I shouted as I walked backwards away from him as he slowly made his way closer to me Finally I could hear police sirens it felt like time couldnt go fast enough My father snapped he ran toward me and knocked me into one of the windows in the living room  I was dozing off I didnt make it hard for him to pick me up and carry me on his back into the forest He ran past my sisters lifeless body and onto the road where I had spotted him chasing my sister at one point His car was already parked behind a cluster of bushes Upon arriving at the vehicle he threw me into the backseat He seemed to know his way around a shaky road into the woods He even knew it well enough to make it through without the headlights I was barely conscious the slam into the window really got to meI remember hearing the sound of sirens getting less and less noticeable as he drove me further into the woods After at least twenty minutes I could feel the car stopping My father made very solid and strict movements it was as if he knew exactly what he was doing He grabbed my leg and pulled me out of the car violently This is what happens when you interfere with other peoples personal business He implied as he started pushing me toward what I believe was a very old wine cellar in the middle of the forest He opened the heavy and sturdy door and threw me into a pitch black room saying And you thought I was playing golf What a lousy sport I didnt know what to make of it I couldnt see anything in there After a brief moment a vile stench started crawling into my nostrils it was so concentrated and thick that it felt like it would stay in my nose forever Shortly after I was throwing up I couldnt take that odor it was too much My father stepped inside and turned on what I believe was an electricity engine that went on gas It started flickering and after a couple of seconds I could see clearly inside the entire room It was indeed an old wine cellar not in good condition at all I knew the stench came from behind me I had purposely turned away from the smell in order to save myself from throwing up a second time I was sitting on the floor wondering what was happening as my dad started walking past me He was walking toward the other side of the room I followed him with my eyes in case he had plans on doing something spontaneous to me I noticed that he had put on a fake mustache and a hat while I had been throwing up How are we doing today Mrs Rose did you take your medication He said in what I believe was an attempt at British not to me though He was speaking to the corpse of my dead mother which he had tied up against a chair forcing it to somewhat sit up It was beyond rotten it was barely anything left that resembled a human being As you see we have a new patient today maybe this one will appreciate his family at home Speaking of which Mrs Rose perhaps you would like to write a letter to that husband of yours today I believe you hold him dearly I started running for the door smashing and hitting it all I could It was too thick and way too heavy for me to be able to make an impact Are you missing your family already little Jonathan Dont you worry youll get to see your father again I bet he misses you every day  Summary by R Jorgensen officer in chargeWe got a call from what the emergency center thought sounded like a teenage boy He seemed terrified and scared while telling them about his father having murdered his sister and supposedly hiding her underground in their backyard Minutes after the incident our officers had made their way to the villa in Ohio We couldnt find the boy who alarmed us about the crime suspecting it had something to do with a broken window in the living room positioned downstairs We directly started a search for the boy using police dogs in the lead Not far from the villa we found a female corpse identified later as the sister of the young boy who reported the crime Our police dogs didnt take us further than to a road not more than a couple of minutes from where we found the corpse We spotted tracks in the road nearby leading into the woods on the other side With that being our only lead we followed the tracks as productive as we could It wasnt easy to manage on that road our vehicles kept getting stuck in pools of mud It wasnt an official road by any meansAfter what I would believe must have been something around thirty minutes we found ourselves next to an old wine cellar It was so broken down that youd mistake it for a cave The heavy door made of stone was locked and it took us five minutes to get through it by using vehicles tied to ropes basically forcing the door to open up Most of the cops that started sneaking inside ended up backtracking the smell creeping out of that room was beyond disgusting I myself was stood outside peering into the old wine cellar After maybe ten seconds we could see the boy running out he was bent forward in order to move with the chair that was tied to his back He looked confused and scared as you can imagine The father was stood inside just next to a very old corpse of a woman that he had tied to another chair He didnt seem to be threatened by us I was under the clear assumption that he was a psychopathWe interviewed the boy Jonathan Rose We also did our fair share of psychological research on the father whose name was Henry Rose He seemed to be a horrifying example of a psychopath as well as a schizophrenic We had him tested by experts in every relevant field we could think of We do this with every criminal that have no clear motive behind their actions in order to understand them In the fathers own mind he wasnt committing crimes at all he thought he was helping his sister and wife by treating them in his wine cellar or mental hospital if you asked him Henry had no sense of emotion he couldnt feel empathy His brain basically had no active mirrorneurons he didnt see himself in anything humanlike At the same time was he for some mysterious reason still interested in compliments on being a good father and husband He made his captives write letters promising them that itd go straight to Henry Rose someone he didnt know he was during the times where his other personality had taken over It was a very curious case I still havent seen anything like it during my entire professional career ,1385673836.0,I want to tell about my motherpart  Ending,350,nosleep,top_week
tellmewhatiswrong,70,64,1rhbuc,215,OriginalPosthttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsreivzneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeinsomeThanks to everyone for your responses I have taken a lot of your adviceIll just give you all a quick update on what happened after I posted yesterday She ended up having a nap after sitting in front of the TV for a few hours I was going to walk our dog Zeus but I decided to wait until she woke up just in case she woke up and was confusedShe woke up after a couple of hours and waswell Happy Really really happy Almost manic She woke up full of beans and smiling like a maniac I was initially relieved I asked would she like to come for a walk with Zeus and I and she happily agreed We set off for our normal walk and she was extremely energetic bounding off in front of Zeus and I Zeus is a Labrador and although he is a big boy hes still a pup We usually just meander along on these walks while he sniffs at everything along the way But she set a cracking pace and Zeus and I struggled to keep up We got up to this park where we usually let him off his lead for a while as were trying to train him to not run off on us and to be sociable Its always been a real task getting him back on the leash though he never ever comes when hes called Anyway we let him off and hes running around and smelling everything and peeing on anything that stands still long enough My wife shes picking flowers and sniffing them and singing She gets on the swings at the park and I push her for a bit as she sings under her breath I was feeling quite content at this point Figured she must have just been over tiredShes swinging vigourously when all of a sudden she comes to a dead halt She yells in an almost unfamiliar masculine voice Zeus Here and points in front of her feetI stood in disbelief as I watched Zeus the most disobedient rascal of a dog I know solemnly trot over to where shes pointing sit in front of her and stare up into her face They both sat there for a split second very still looking at each other I picked my jaw up off the floor and asked her Umwhat the hell How did you manage that and that seemed to break both their concentration and Zeus shot off like a bat out of hell again and she started swinging again  Oh she said I used my mind to call out to himits something new I learnedShe seemed kind of sheepish about it to be honest I pressed her for more details but the more questions I asked the more defensive she got She knows I dont believe that for a second Im just happy that Zeus is finally starting to be trained Thats really the only explanation I asked her to do it again but she refused so I think we both know it was a flukeThe rest of the afternoon wasnice Kind of odd Its like theres something thats amiss Like when you walk into your messy bedroom and you can tell that something is not how it should be but you cant pin point whatWe talked a bit about the seminar She said that it was very intense The days were very long She said that the premise of the seminar is to get to the root of any emotional upset to explore the root causes for whats going on in your life I asked if any hypnosis was used as suggested by you guys and she said no They talked a lot and were assigned to small groups and encouraged to open up and explore their inner beings She said she felt a lot better since attendingStill something was not quite right For instance we were talking about my sister who lives in another state and how she had recently got a new job A few minutes later my phone rang and it was her I picked it up and said Emma Speak of the devil and my wife smashed me up the side of the head causing me to drop the phone and shouted Emma is NOT the devil How could you say that Emma is NOT THE DEVIL I told Emma I would call her back and tried to get my wife to calm down She was very upset at what I had said She sort of went silent again and was very still She seemed rather annoyed at me but by this point I was nearing exhaustion myself so I let her beShe fell asleep early about pm on the couch I covered her with a blanket and noticed that her eyes are kind of half opened I used to have a friend who slept like that at school and Ive never noticed it before I think that in my state of hyper vigilance I am being overly perceptive of small details I read more of my original post and all your comments and decided to step outside and call our therapist just to find out more about the seminar as I knew she was there assistingI walked out onto our back porch and lit a cigarette and rang her She answered on my first ring What she said has really weirded me out Only because although she gave me a lot of information she has raised many more questions as well as answered them She said these seminars are more like interactive workshops run by a man named Brian and his wife Linda who are both selfappointed psychotherapists She said that there are psychologists such as herself on stand by to assist because sometimes when people are in such a vulnerable state they may need assistance She said she has referred a lot of her clients to attend these workshops and has found them to be helpful in most cases Basically the course is about discovering your inner self and using different methods to connect to your inner voice to find out what the cause of your worries are She said that it is incredibly demanding and intense Each session goes for  hours with only an hour break During these sessions many different activities and topics are explored including regression Apparently Brian does this  hour session on the second last day where he gets everyone to meditate and be still and he regresses them back to childhood or even in some extreme cases past lives Our therapist said it was so intense that she had to fight from being regressed herself She did make comment that she had been concerned initially about how my wife would handle that but that she seemed brighter had a clarity about her after this experience They discussed what my wife had gone back to in her mind and the therapist was happy that it hadnt caused her any great distress but reminded me she couldnt discuss the specifics She said when she wakes tomorrow I could gently try and open the lines of communication with her and she may explain her experience I told her about my wifes strange behaviour She said it is normal to be a little out of sorts after one of these sessions but nothing major I dont know if its just me but I could sense a tiny bit of alarm in her voice I dont know maybe I imagined it She said to call her if theres any further problems I hung up and as I was putting out my cigarette I turned to go inside and my wifes standing there staring at me I jump and say Jesus Christ honey you scared me and she replied Not as fucking much as Im going to scare you Ummm ok I had to physically turn her and direct her into the house In the moonlight she almost looked like a stranger to me Her long blonde hair was hanging in her face and her face was fixed in this awful scowl I figured she must still be pissed at me from before I put her to bed and she goes back to sleep And well thats where she is now she was supposed to be off work today too but I was meant to go back to my job But when my alarm went off I just had this weird feeling that I should stick around and make sure she was ok I rang in sick for work and Im just doing some household jobs waiting to see if shes better when she wakes up and googling what regression means and what these intense emotional exercises can do to someone Still nothing that convincing though I dont know Maybe Im too skeptical I just dont believe this crapThe whole thing sounds a bit stupid to me if Im honest But I have to say it has caused some kind of change in my wife She is very extreme in her emotions at the moment and Im worried because we both have to go back to work tomorrow and her work environment is very proper She is always a perfect employee and very dedicated to her work I cant help but feel concerned that she might wake up tomorrow and still be in thismood Do you guys know anything about this regressionis it the same as hypnosis She was adamant she wasnt hypnotised but it sounds like it to meFINAL UPDATE HEREhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrnsafinalupdateneedsomeadvicemywifeseemstobeEDIT Ok now Im getting really freaked out I went to check on her and she was talking and singing her sleep I cant quit work out what song shes singing Ive never heard it before But shes saying something about being someone called Azara or something Its really fucking unnerving it doesnt even sound like her Ill try and get a recording and see if you guys can shed some light EDIT TWO Ok I managed to record a bit of itshes singing but I dont know what has anyone heard this before Ignore the TV in the background I was watching it in the lounge room to drown her out and it was really unnerving when I turned it off and all I could hear was her Im kind freaked out now Ill admit it Here it ishttpsoundcloudcomuseraynmqytetesjECMW,1385448974.0,UPDATE Need some advice My wife seems to be in some weird tranceZombie like state

chimeraphantasm,46,54,1rbg7n,209,My name is Ramiel and I want you to read this right before you go to sleep Trust me its better this way If its the middle of the day for you or perhaps youre not quite tired yet bookmark this and read it when your eyes are starting to itch with tiredness but youre not nodding off yet I dont want you to forget what youre about to read Im on the tall skinny side of my arabic family I guess I take after my mom in that respect Though im pretty sure she didnt have this much facial hair She named me after an angel that is responsible for divine visions I wonder if she knew how right on the money she was  Why does my name and physical features matter I suppose it doesnt but if Im going to share something this personal with strangers for help or some kind of catharsis id rather you had a good idea of who I am and not just a blank slate  I dont want you to forget me when this is over Before we begin heres an interesting fact to wrap your head around Your brain produces extremely high amounts of a psychedelic compound called DMT Dimethyltryptamine two times in your life Once when you are born to help cope with the pressure it puts on your fragile infant body during the painful process of birth and once again when you are seconds from dying to ease the burden it puts on your body and mind as they both shut down for the very last time This is often why people claim to see their loved ones who have long passed on by their side bright lights from the sky or feelings of elation This process is so strong that it has the capabilities to erase everything in your mind like a mass wipe of your hard drive Now you might think that isnt too important if youre just starting out your life or simultaneously moments away from it coming to an end but I ask you to entertain the notion that you possess a soul or an inner essence of sorts what if that soul that consciousness that essence of you simply continued on without the knowledge of a past existence What if at the moment of death you saw something so undeniably horrifying and inconceivable something youd only seen in fleeting dreams and nightmares throughout your life that your brain compensates in the only way it knows how by erasing any prior memory of it before allowing what makes you you continue onto the next stage of whatever is out there Your brains last failsafe a defence mechanism to ensure you wont carry the burden with you But like any kind of defence mechanism theres always a bypassand theres always a black box  DMT is a chemical produced by your pineal gland and it is responsible for us dreaming every single night Not the reason however We have no idea why we dream we just do As soon we enter REM sleep our dreams become their most memorable and malleable It is at this point we have dreams which take proper form that we feel most real and perceive to be the most accessible though we seldom ever remember the dream itself Because like a drug trip our brain is determined to protect us from that experiencebut what if that wasnt the only reasonConsider this The older we get we sleep considerably less hours As babies we sleep for up to  hours and by the time we hit  years old its half of that amount What if this is a defence mechanism our brain develops so that we dont spend too long in that realm No im not talking about the further from Insidious or some kind of Nightmare on Elm Street knockoff before your already horror obsessed minds make some kind of parable to an existing franchise for comfort or relatable aspects Youre still very much within your own mind but theres something else there with you  Now I ask you to suspend all beliefs or nonbeliefs and read on to hear my story and why I no longer sleep and why despite being an Atheist I pray to something to anything hell even Hypnos would be a welcome evil right now that should my mind succumb to sleep and my body fail me that I dont dream Im a counsellor at my local university I took on the job in September of last year as a ditch effort to bump up my resume and to reduce rent through living on the campus It was your usual run of the mill kind of work talk to terrified st years whod never lived away from home before and were simply not used to their newfound freedom dealing with homesickness new friendships one night stands etc The nd years were dealing with social troubles within their housesapartments deadlines mounting and the occasional unplanned pregnancy The final year students were typically near breakdown over their dissertations and end of year exams so youd offer them all the appropriate advice your own experiences at the university as an example and then ultimately hope it all sinks in If not well theres always next week and beyond that a private therapist But like all forms of employment that deal with face to face interactions theres always one encounter you never forget For me that was Milo Moraga a nd year student studying Psychology amp Philosophy The first time he came into my office he struck me as a little bit gaunt his striped longsleeve top hanging off him like itd stretched in the wash Strung out but shy That would have been my first impression I think he sensed my preconceived notions avoiding making eye contact with me as he shuffled inside He was apprehensive sleep deprived his hair greasy under a black beanie and his eyes laden with heavy dark bags underneath like someone had put on eyeliner while he slept He sat down glancing around at the windows and leant forward cracking his knuckles and rubbing his hands over one another hastilyHello Milo how can I help you I understand you asked for this appointment because ofanxiety Do you want to tell me about that I looked through the brief set of notes the receptionist gave me and tried to study as best I could while he spoke Nothing that would ultimately help me ascertain the problem it just gave him time to compose himself He didnt respond just kept shuffling in his chair I guess he wasnt  sure he should come here  Your lecturer sent you here didnt they I said bluntly feeling a slight headache come on as I felt an awkward  minute session rearing its ugly monotonous head He nodded but I noticed something in that moment that made me think there was more to it His expression was almost like he was pleading for his life as he quickly nodded  I leaned forward placing my hands under my chin and up to my lips as I observed him I had to be very careful with how I handled this If he was suicidal one wrong statement could leave him with a noose round his neck  Milo what happened in the classroom to get you here Can you tell me that muchHe mimicked me leaning forward as well though his posture was the furthest parallel from my own it looked like his spirit was broken The lecturerMs Armstrongshe was talking about solipsism and I just gotlost within it Do you know what solipsism isI did but I shook my head I didnt want to interrupt him when he was being so open Its a philosophical belief that everything an individual perceives is only in his own mind it is a construct of his own psyche There is no other human beings no other individual thoughts just his or her ownI guess I found the idea kinda comforting and I broke down I raised an eyebrow thats certainly not a usual response Comforting Milo You mean to say you enjoy being alone amp isolated  No the opposite actually I have a lovely group of friends a loving family and a fiancé but it was comforting for another reasonif Its just me then what hurts me is just me I know what im capable of and it makes any kinds of threats a moot point It means thatthat He put his hands up to his mouth and began crying silently the picture of this situation was getting uglier and murkier the more he explained It means that I might not die after all I rolled up my sleeves my flannel shirt was already beginning to chafe me First signs of stress I suppose I looked down at my charm bracelet my wife brought me and took in a deep breath I knew this was going to be rough Itsits my dreams doc Theres something in my dreams I cant sleep anymore Each time I do its like I can sense im going into that place again journeying deeper into the void with every evening Ive tried taking coffee shit loads of red bull and any cheap ass energy drinks I can get my hands onI even took those pills truckers take so they can stay wired for  hours butwell you know the problem right doc He looked down and started rubbing his hands together again his knee bouncing as he struggled to keep it under control Withdrawal symptoms combined with sleep deprivation this kid was getting more tweaked by the minute The problem being that we all have to sleep eventually no matter how long we put it off I exhaled Milo I want you to start at the beginning I know youre anxious to get some kind of help but if I dont know the route of the problem I cant give you the correct advice okay Now I want you take in  deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth Can you do that for me And you dont need to call me doc im just a volunteer counsellor You can call me Rami if you like He nodded and did as instructed his demeanour improving slightly with each successive inhale though this was hardly a permanent solution to his paranoia I didnt want to ask at this point how long hed been awake for but I could tell itd been more than a handful of days Once an individual goes past the  day mark they will begin to lose their grip on sanity and brain cells will start to die I was silently hoping I could find out the problem to this sooner rather than later  Alright I picked up my laptop to take notes Go ahead tell me what started this all offWhat follows is the unedited conversation this is verbatim what was said between the two of us If I can find the audio recording later I will attach it to the post  Do you know much about lucid dreaming Rami  I know a little just that its something practiced and allows for complete control of the dream by the dreamer He nods before continuing Theres a learning curve to it you need to lie in bed and shut out all outside sounds and impulses The typical things really the sensation to scratch your arm to roll over to block out the voices He stopped and stared at me with fear I didnt mean to tell you that  Its alright well get to it later lets just focus on the why and not the how for the moment What made you decide to lucid dream in the first place  He shifted in his chair and suddenly looked very timid I kept seeing him in my dreams at first hed just be a random appearance and then hed start to try and approach me friendly smile and hand outstretched like he was greeting an old friend Never threatening or hostile just attempting to make contact with me Though hed never get to Every single time id be distracted by something at the last second or my dream would veer off in another directionHe shifted in his seat and closed his eyes before continuing I remember in the first few dreams we had hed just be lingering in the background If I was walking through a street hed just be standing with the crowd my brain created and not really reacting to anything but me Id see him watch me but then my dream would shift and I guess id just ignore it and carry onafter a few weeks I began getting better at controlling my dreams Id start to mess around with the world I was inhabiting like Inception I guess but morepersonal Id turn myself into a member of XMen or id go on a date with my perfect woman yknowthings that you can only dream of literallywell thats when he started to become more apparent Id usually wake up before he actually got too close but Id always remember the look on his face before I did His eyes widened He always looked so angryFormer abuse victim I thought adding it to the list of potential issues and solutions I didnt want to stop him while he was on a roll I nodded to show my attentiveness and he continued I still remember the first time he managed to speak to me I was in a park id visited as a child with my mother It was a small piece of heaven in London back then a mental safe haven when things got too stressful I guess But this was nothing like I remembered it the trees werent trees they were corpses stacked on top of one another some overlapping andmeshing with one another in unspeakable positions to form branches I could feel the atmosphere almost turn to pure disgust as they noticed me unable to move or even speak to me But their eyes their eyes said everything Because at first they fixated on me with hatred then quickly away in sheer terror Theyd seen something far more terrifying than the fate they were already sufferingsoI His eyes welled up with tears unblinking as they streamed down his face  I looked Rami I looked and saw him standing some  feet away down the path his head bowed He wasnt moving and yet he was His body was almostrippling The closest way I can describe it is the way a signal on a TV channel in the old days used to bend and flicker when the signal was weak Every time I blinked he came closer I tried for the longest time to not blink reallyI did But the brain betrays your conscious impulses The more you try to put off a basic function the more your brain wills you to do it When he was  feet away he simply vanished By the time I had registered that he was gone I heard a whisper in my earhe was standing right behind me I could feel his breath on my neck Ramiit didnt feel humanThere was an awkward silence he took in some deep breaths and shuddered Obviously reliving the memory wasnt going to be something pleasant for him butthe way he reacted it was like he truly had experienced this I stared at him nodding and silently encouraging him to continue When he didnt I leaned forward and quietly asked him what im sure he was waiting me to ask What did he say to you MiloMilo shook his head Im sorry I dont remember That was when the dream ended I didnt see him again in my dreams for a whileWe talked for a little while longer mainly about his anxieties in crowds and eye contact then our time came to an end and we scheduled an appointment for the following week This would be our last session together  It was a Monday morning and id just come back from a friends wedding my wife and I had been drinking so by the time I got to the office I was nursing a hangover my flannel shirt covering the bruises id sustained falling over and my best pair of jeans smeared in alcohol It was a day my mind was not in the work I suppose I just wanted to get home and go to sleep    Milo came in earlier than planned he looked desperate He was pulling at his hair biting his fingernails and pacing constantly It didnt look like hed seen any sleep at all I sent a text to my colleague asking for security to come over as soon as possible He was going to need to be sectioned for his own safety How on earth hed managed to go this long without his friends or fiancee doing something is beyond me  I remember what he said Rami I remember it clearly now He said between pants and more nail biting Okay Milo Well why dont you take a seat and well talk it out He ignored that but stopped pacing and stared intently at me  Ill be right here always He put his arms around himself a self defence mechanism when a persons personal space has been violated That was what he said I heard it again and again every time I closed my eyes He started bashing at his temples IT WONT FUCKING STOP  All I could do at this point was try to keep him talking and calm until security got here  Did this make you afraid to dream Milo  He started laughing his face showing the complete opposite of his vocal expression Pure incredulity and fear on his face against the guttural sound of his manic laughter  You dont get it do you He didnt mean just when I dream He meant always Now I knownow I know for sure He took a deep breath in and his demeanour shifted he suddenly looked like a man almost at peace Not content but willing to let go  Thanks for listening Doc sharing this with someone was important to meand to him Hes going to have his work cut out for him im sure And just like that he got up and left I followed him out naturally concerned for him I watched him leave the building and cross the road  Then he did something I wont ever forget  He turned to me smiling and outstretched his hand crying openly as a vehicle struck him I didnt even see it coming I was so captivated by his expression  I couldnt even bring myself to go over to his body I gave my statement and went straight home All I could do was look in the mirror wondering what it was that was bothering me so much about how I looked and why Milo outstretching his hand was so disturbing to me When I looked at myself I didnt see a  lb brown coloured hipster I saw someone troubled someone who didnt look like theyd slept much lately someone like MiloI got a phone call from the hospital later on that evening Milo was in a coma and on life support He was nonresponsive and likely brain dead His family were choosing to keep his life support on in lieu of their religious and moral views I think deep down they just didnt want to let him go Id been asked to go into his apartment with a member of his family to see if there was anything to indicate why he would willingly stand in front of oncoming trafficI wont bore you with the traveling details but his apartment was surprising I was half expecting a filthy run down place filled with half eaten food and human waste given his obsessive and unstable state Guess I just watched too many detectivehorror movies growing up His place was immaculate everything was extremely clean and organised hed already packed up a lot of his material possessions into boxes with names on the front this was already beginning to look like premeditation He had a desk beside his bed this was the only place in his room that showed any signs of his lack of sanity rubbing off on his living conditions Books on demonology the science of sleeping DMT some sleeping pills and a journal His brother went through the boxes while I took a look at the journal ill include photos later if I get permission from the family names have been changed and anything too personal will of course be blurred out It initially contained legible competent insights into his nightly journeys as he began to lucid dream But as this other entity began to make himself more known and aware the content shifts and the writing becomes hastily scrawled certain words appear larger than others he questions himself on numerous occasions and draws the mans face more frequently as the journal comes to its end  The final entry is barely legible but it details a conversation he had with the man in his dream and that a reminder that he would be with him always  After this there is just a single word on the hardback of the journal rewritten over and over almost like its been carved in DREAMWhich brings us to the final part of this story the present Im sure youd all love to discover im actually cursed or that this story will follow some typical archetype of horror shorts and im moments away from death passing on a final message But as im sure youre all coming to realise that is not the case  I just woke up from a lucid dream ive never had one before nor do I know how I had one but it was definitely a lucid dream I was able to control my reality my own physical form and everything around me It was here I saw Milo He approached me slowly and before I could even say anything he asked me a favour  Pull the plug let me dieI was so taken aback that my rational thought process dissipated and for a moment I wonderedwas this perhaps a shared dream I cant take the torture anymore Rami Please tell my family I love them but I need to be let goIts okay you dont need to suffer anymore in the real world ill do what I can to convince them I croaked placing a hand on his shoulder Milos smile faded  Im not talking about the torture there Rami Im talking about the torture herewithout being able to wake up he has complete control Im his new puppet and he wants to play forever He has no physical form this is where he resides This is where he plays  He looked over my shoulder and back at me with a sad smile on his face   Now hes chosen you as his new playmate He knows youre going to take my place Look at my journal again look at the drawings youll need to rememberHe turned to walk away leaving me feeling completely helpless in my own lucid dream  Oh and Ramidont turn aroundI didnt but my entire being was willing me to Its that same feeling of anxiety you get when youre home alone at night and you have the feeling something is watching you A crushing horrifying feeling I woke up in a cold sweat and did as he said I looked over the journal and in addition to scanning the drawings I found a theory Milo had documented in between the pages of his journal An idea is manifested through suggestive stories and cultural signifiers we can plant ourselves a character or a concept into our subconscious and our dreams with enough hints both subversive and subliminal An idea be it malicious or noble can grow and manifest in one mind before being shared to the masses through any kind of information supplement  The second section detailed a supporting theory  Within every story told fictitious or semibiographical exists a universe that we have created that is as real as our own For how can we truly know if our reality is more valid than the one we have created How can we truly know we have not just been added into a story of our own by a neutral writer we know as god This reality is as malleable and relevant as the one within which we dream Our dream world or coma world it can be argued are the realities and our concept of reality is but a dream in itself that our brain creates to escape the chaos uncertainty and pain of our dreamsYoure probably painting a very good picture of what is happening right nowIve attached an image of the man in this story and im sure youre all familiar with him  If you are youll understand why ive done this  Why ive made you awareThere is no Ramiel that name is a subliminal plant in itself it means Dreamer in Arabic I described him perfectly for you as a defence mechanism against what is going to happen in the coming weeks months and years I gave you plenty of physical aspects for your brain to put together you only know a basic layer of who he is so that your brain can put in the key elements which will make you trust him You know its funny but I found out what Milo meant by Dream its an acronym Dream Rami Evil Always ManifestsThats where I got the idea for RamiHe exists now to help fight off him  Because now youve read this read my experience and Milos youre aware on a subconscious leveland he needs new playmates This is no warning that implies you can do something to change it You cant your dreams are his playground not yours  You can shrug this off as another horror short if you like if that makes you feel better and sleep easier But he doesnt just strike the night you fall asleep he strikes when you allow your dreams to become more open and easier to mould He only enters when the reality is in flux  But with Ramiel in your head now too you have a guide a protector to help you  I didnt At least Milo is at peace hopefully I will be soon too Ive been putting off sleep for days I cant keep doing it much longer   Im beginning to feel drowsy I took a large amount of sleeping pills before writing this last section I cant put off sleeping forever I dont know whether im going to wake up or not but at least youve all been warned about him Feel free to reverse google image search the hosted image learn about him and if you do feel a sense of familiarity please be carefulDream of Ramiel you will be safe I wish you all the best you might not know my name or my face but do not forget my story  I will do my best to answer any of your questions in the comments later Do not forget about him Because believe me he wont forget about you when you fall asleepThe worst thing about all this Im not sure he stays in the dream world anymore When Milo looked at me I think I mistook his expression and his gesture At the time I thought he was crying and happy stretching his hand out to shake my hand Now I think he was terrified to see his worst fears manifested in the real world and he was stretching his hand out to stop him getting to me in the real world Why say this now Well ive been getting steadily drowsier and Ive felt something breathing down my neck for the last  minutes Who knows maybe its just my paranoia Sweet dreams

kimmiekissies,22,53,1rgt5c,202,I never even met him I didnt know his name or face I was blissfully unaware of his very existence I will never know why or when it started Im glad for that I guess I moved into my very small apartment in February last year My landlord Olivia was a sweet older woman who would cook to much and bring me much appreciated leftovers She was great to me even after telling her my problem Im antisocial but she didnt mind renting to a reclusive young girl who reminded her of her daughter Every few weeks she would knock on my door then leave letting me know she was leaving something for me I loved that Not even my family would cook so well The next morning I wash and leave her empty containers outside my door and by an hour or so she would take them back again My other neighbors seemed fine but I never talked or visited with them I work from home so anytime I ever was forced to go out I rushed out and into my apartment avoiding an uncomfortable situation I loved living alone it was everything I hoped for I could just breathe By April though I started noticing things were not right They were moving or plain disappearing I was convinced it was just anxiety caused by my new medication and the move another side affect was it would make me so drowsy Since I hated seeing the doctor I just dealt I took naps during the day now and eventually stopped caring Until one incident doubled my paranoia Olivia brought me some sort of greek tossed salad and dressing for lunch one day and I enjoyed it with my friend netflix I fell asleep in the middle of Portlandia and woke up that evening at pm Per usual what was not usual was my bedding on the opposite side of me was disturbed I only sleep on the right side Always Even more it felt warm My first thought was I must have rolled around a lot but I knew it was to odd to dismiss I got up and searched my apartment gripping my phone with  typed in Nothing else was disturbed everything was exactly like it should be I let it go for the next few weeks everything was normal pardon the occasional misplaced shoe or drawn back shower curtain I thought about telling someone my parents maybe Olivia but if its not life or death I am not reaching out to anyone I wasnt scared I was nervous maybe a little stubborn But I stayed I am not letting some stupid anxiety ruin my lovely lonely world May came and It was getting worse My panties toothbrush hell even my food was being misplaced Every time I woke up there was this strange odor in the air I finally realized this wont go away by ignoring it I called my mom and begged to come stay a few days when I got home I told them everything Saying it out loud solidified any creepy suspicions That weekend my dad went to my apartment and what was found was true horror Written all over that walls COME BACK BABY PLEASE He ran out and called the police There was no one living in my apartment but someone definitely had access besides me The investigation revealed a man Henry the son of my landlord Olivia was in a projected relationship with me They showed me his confession on tape He admitted coming into my apartment every night and everyday with his mothers extra key He claims we were in love and he had my permission He drugged his mothers food she left out for me causing my drowsiness and falling asleep so he could come in and watch me sleep touch my hair kiss my shoulder The leftovers I had in the fridge were tested and confirmed I was absolutely horrified and disgusted A man I never knew existed collected my drain hair clothes and trash and practically lived in my apartment for four monthsedit paragraphing,1385433488.0,I used to live by myself,255,nosleep,top_week
Charliesfriend,48,40,1rhapg,202,A friend of mine posted a story here not too long ago and he was pretty well received by your wonderful community so I decided to create an account to share mineWhen I was a little girl about nine years old my family purchased a small ranch in western Kansas My father had just gotten out of the Army and I suppose after seven years of trotting around the world and spending two of those years in active combat zones my dad just wanted to go somewhere the world would leave him alone He couldnt have found a better location for this purpose anyone whos ever followed Interstate  westward through that area knows there isnt much between Topeka and DenverI still remember the day we my mom dad older sister and I moved into that old ranch house It had been built in the early s and being something of a history buff I was pretty excited to live in a house that had stood through prohibition the depression both world wars and everything since The house itself sat at the bottom of a small incline from the main road backed literally into a hill This setup meant the back half of the home sat underground buried in the hillside Outside the house was a little grassy yard area and across this yard was an old barn We didnt have any horses but my dad held a particular love for classic cars and he turned that barn into an amateur autoshop where he worked refurbishing old cars from the junk yard in his spare timeMy sister and I were given seperate but adjoining rooms upstairs while my parents took the master bedroom oddly on the first floor My sister and Is rooms opened onto a sort of landing that looked out over the living room and kitchen and the stairs led down from thereIt was only our second or third night in the house that I began to notice some strange things occurring I was unable to sleep one night and I laid awake in bed long after I heard my parents and sister go to bed The house was incredibly quiet both from being in the middle of a very isolated area and by virtue of being half buried Just as I was reaching the halfsleep stateSLAM I heard a door downstairs slam shut At first I tried convincing myself I had just dreamed it but I couldnt make myself believe that And the next thing I heard chilled me to my core I heard footsteps coming up the stairway I could tell from the sound that the individual must be wearing shoes so it probably wasnt my parents coming up to check on me I heard the steps reach the top of the stairs and then begin down the landing I was frozen with fear when I heard them arrive outside my door pause for a moment and then continue on When the stranger was apparently in front of my sisters room he paused again and again he continued He reached the far end of the landing and then turned around and came back the way he came He continued for what seemed like an eternity pacing around outside my sister and Is rooms I finally worked up some nineyearold courage and crawled to the door I could still hear footsteps coming from just outside I waited until he was moving away from me and I was between him and the stairs planning on making a mad dash for my parents room when his back was turned I barely cracked open the door and looked out and sawnothing The footsteps had stopped and the whole house was empty and still I was confused and afraid but even then I knew if I ran to my parents they would think I was nuts So I slid a chair in front of my door and crept into bed A minute later the footsteps started again back and forth all along the landing Eventually they lulled me to sleep I didnt mention the noises that night to anyone fearful of my parents thinking I was a whacko and of being made fun of by my sister But over the next few weeks everyone in my family began to notice strange happenings on our ranch Objects moved on their own Small things would disappear for days only to be returned exactly where theyd gone missing from It was what I guess youd call typical poltergeist activity nothing harmful or malevolent just noises here and there and odds and ends moving around And practically every night I heard those footsteps outside my room My family eventually began referring to this entity as Charlie He seemed to be a harmless ghost and sometimes downright helpful Occasionally my parents would wake early in the morning for work only to find a freshly brewed pot of coffee waiting in the kitchen The coffee maker had no automatic timer Sometimes when one of us had misplaced something like car keys or the like wed search the house frantically only to turn around and find what wed been searching for laying on the ground behind us And sometimes Charlie would slam a door or walk around loudly or turn a sink on seemingly just to let us know he was there And always those footsteps at nightCharlie always seemed particularly active in my dads auto shop My dad would occasionally find car parts hed been working on had been tinkered with despite the fact that he was the only one who ever went in there Sometimes tools would go missing only to be returned a short time later Once my dad came in from his shop one evening as white as a sheet When we asked what was wrong he just said Charlie was walking around out thereJesus I thought you all were just hearing things I wasnt sure why Charlie loved that shop so much but incidentally that was where I caught my first sight of him It was a Saturday and my Dad was hard at work putting together an old Chevy Fleetline My mom mad him a sandwich as a working lunch and asked me to take it to him I eased open the barn door and saw my dad seated at his work bench his back to me And I saw another man next to the car also out of my dads field of vision He was about  with dark hair and eyes He was dressed in what looked like typical s clothing black slacks a pinstripe vest over a grey work shirt and topped off by a brown paper boy hat cocked to one side He looked right at me for a second a big mischievous grin on his face and then he simply disappeared I didnt even realized I was still holding my dads sandwich and continued to stare at the spot Charlie had stood until my dad snapped me back to realitySo passed the next few months My family was happy on our little haunted ranch Charlie seemed happy enough to share the space with us and life was good And his nightly vigil outside my room began to seem almost comforting One night in late November however I learned just how utterly terrifying Charlie could beMy dad had some kind of dinner event for work in Topeka almost two hours away and since my Sister was almost  by then and there was virtually no crime in our rural area my parents figured we would do fine by ourselves until they returned the next morning Of course to my sister and I it meant we could stay up as late as we wanted watch scary movies all the kid stuff you cant do with your parents around At around midnight I was in my Sisters room with her watching some movie on her TV when we heard a loud CRASH from the living room My first thought was that it was Charlie playing another prank by this felt different somehow Charlies noises were simply little bumps to remind you he was home But this noise sounded violent and angry Before I could really react we heard another loud crash and another My sister cautiously peeked out of her door and down into the living room I swear I saw her go white She began trembling and her hand covered her mouth I peeked around her to see what she saw and felt y blood run cold We could just barely see two men outside our from door One of them was kicking it in As we watched a final smash from this man caused the door jam to give out and they both entered our home shining long flashlights all over My sister and I crawled under her bed and held each other tight This was easily the most terrified I have ever felt But as the two men began to go through the living room another loud crash came from the kitchen One of the cabinets had opened and slammed shut a favorite trick of Charlies The man who seemed to be leading the show shined his flashlight into the kitchen and shouted Is there anyone in here If you are you better come out now We will find you and we will FUCK you up My sister and I had to cover our mouths to keep from screaming out loud At the mans words though Charlie apparently got angry We heard another loud crash and a skittering of metal on the floor as one of our silverware drawers apparently threw itself across the room I heard one of the men say Whatthe FUCK And then Charlie decided he was do e fucking around All at once every door window and cabinet in our home began opening and closing violently and loudly Small objects all over the house began to fling themselves into walls across the floor even at the intruders At this point the one in charge just yelled FUCK this and turned and ran out his buddy close behindAs soon as the men were out of the door everything stopped and the house was again silent It was a long long time before either my sister or myself finally worked up the courage to move She had left her cell phone downstairs and and she needed it to call the police and our parents She began slowly creeping downstairs to get it and since there was no way in hell I was being left alone I followed As we got to the bottom I looked into the kitchen and for just a moment Charlie was standing there exactly as I saw him before with the same grin on his face A moment later he was goneThe police arrived shortly and my parents not far behind The cops determined that the disorder in the home was caused by the robbers ransacking the place for valuables and they must have been scared off by a passing car Lucky for us My sister and I didnt even try to tell them what really happened and within thirty minutes both men were caught still fleeing After that night hearing Charlies walk around my floor gave me a serene sense of security every night When he played his little pranks I would always look for him And every now and then I would catch just a glimpse of him and smileSeveral years later when I was a junior in high school I was working on a school report at the local library The topic was the history of our town and I wanted to see if the library had any old news clippings that mentioned my familys ranch I typed our address on the search bar and the first result stopped me dead in my tracks The date of the old article was July   and at the top was a picture of a man about  with dark hair and eyes It was unmistakably Charlie The title of the article read Local Man Murdered While Defending Daughter It seems the man we called Charlie was actually named Brian Davis He had lived alone in the ranch with his only child a daughter after losing his wife to a bad case of the Flu On the night of July  the article said Mr Davis was returning home from his job as an auto mechanic in town When he pulled up to the house he found the door had been forced open He ran inside and found a man on top of his daughter The girl was sobbing her dress had been ripped open and the attacker held a knife to her throat In a moment of sheer instinct Mr Davis threw himself at the intruder tackling him of his daughter and as he held the attacker Mr Davis yelled for the girl to run to the neighbors and call the police The girl made it the mile and a half to the closest neighbor who promptly called the sheriff When deputies arrived they were able to apprehend the attacker who had been beaten half to death Unfortunately he had stabbed Mr Davis three times in the chest Brian Davis died right on our kitchen floor,1385447812.0,Charlie,242,nosleep,top_week

but I wasnt enough I couldnt protect her I wasnt there when she fucking needed me me her husband the one person on the face of the earth who swore to her that I would be the answer to all her questions the strength in her weakness I stepped outside and I called that fucking shrink And I tore her to shreds with the words that I spoke I told her that she has fucking destroyed my wife and she better start fixing what she had broken She told me to take her to the hospital I dont know what took me so long but I bundled her up and got her in the car and I drove faster than I have ever driven in my life I rushed her into emergency and we got to see a psychiatrist right away What a waste of time that was Because even though she was fragile and seemed to be slipping away there was nothing techincally wrong with her Because she was back She wasnt vacant like she was the day before She was present she was there she knew she needed help But that doesnt make you a crazy person That makes you a sane person A sad sane person yes But she has no history of mental illness She had no thought disorder or suicidal ideation at the time of presenting All the questions they asked to assess her she answered and the psychiatrist said she needed rest He prescribed some sleeping tablets and sent us on our way Ill never forgive him for thatHe told her that he thinks it would be good for her to go to work the next day For us both to go He said once she got back in touch with reality with her normal life then things would begin to improve He said emotionally draining experiences can take time to recover from and we should go back to busying ourselves so the mind has other things to think about rather than stewing on past emotional issuesSo stupidly we got up the next day and got dressed for work She was out of it again She looked like a ghost Like a shell of person a person that was loud and funny A person that was talkative and animated Someone who ate peanut butter out of a jar and sang Ice Ice Baby into my big toe I helped her change her clothes She was talking in a baby voice again whispering to me I said I didnt think she should go but she said it would be better It would all be okI said at the very least she should let me drive her and pick her up When I dropped her off she walked out into oncoming traffic Cars slammed their brakes and honked but she didnt notice I called out to her but she disappeared into her building I called her office and spoke to another PA there Penny I told her that my wife was a bit out of sorts She said she would keep an eye out and it would all be okAnd Penny did keep an eye on her She kept an eye on her and was able to recount to me in horrifying detail the events that unfolded My wife got to her desk and seemed extraordinarily happy She told everyone she had a life changing experience Its hard to believe that the broken person I saw aimlessly step out of my car that morning transformed into a glowing happy woman in a short few steps But thats what Im toldEveryone was glad she was back Everyone had missed her she ran a tight ship and no one knew the work as well as she did so there was a lot waiting for her when she got back She sang a lot and couldnt settle on a task which was their first inkling something was off She was usually nose down at her desk from morning til dusk but not today She paced the halls and wandered the office But people thought that maybe she was still in holiday mode They didnt realise how bad things were Just like I didntI thought of her all dayWhen pm rolled around I was already in her car park waiting for her I called her at  to see where she was but got no response I waited and I waited I was about to go up to see what was going on but then I saw herI saw my beautiful wife Not coming through the lobby doors where my eyes had been trained but standing naked in the frame of an  storey window She wasnt even holding on She was standing there so casually like she was waiting for a bus I got out Time slowed down It was like a nightmare where you open your mouth to scream and nothing comes out I ran I ran and my brain tried to process what I was seeing As I ran I saw her turn and glance back in the building at whoever was on the other side andsmile Then she was falling Then she was gone The sound is something that will haunt every corner of my mind for eternity I justI SheMy wife MY FUCKING WIFE The rest was just a blur I collapsed on the bitumen and everything was dark I woke up and screamed for them to take me to her But they wouldnt They said that I would never recover if I saw what happened to her Its too late for that though I had to see Penny I had to find out what the fuck had happened WHAT THE FUCK GOES ON IN THAT FUCKING CUNT OF A BUILDING Who the fuck let this happen WHY HAS THIS HAPPENEDPenny said that around  oclock she went to go into the CEOs office who was away in Germany She found my wife in there staring out of the window Penny asked if everything was ok My wife turned around singing a nursery rhyme and twirling her hair around her finger Penny went to get her a drink of water and when she came back my wife was standing on the desk undressing and singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Penny grabbed another girl and they tried to her down She got off the desk and hovered near the window They called security who said that they would send an ambulance By this stage my wife started talking about me Repeating over and over again that she was a good wife That she was a very good wife That she was a good daughter That she was daddys little girlAnd thats when everything changedShe started saying increasingly disturbing things They had never heard anything so awful come out of her mouth and they knew then that this was very very seriousAnd then just like that she jumped into the window sill and looked out That must have been when I saw her Her final words were I winAnd like that she was gone,1385641079.0,Final Update Need

Grubbery,28,69,1rkkgk,174,Ill try to keep this as short as possible apologies for the title Im not a creative person Im studying computer forensics Take a hard drive or device and get the information from it While working on a project to see if age of drives affects how much data can be pulled off a disk I came across something I dont know how to approach this Ive been to the cops with it but they just think Im playing gamesI bought  of the old recall Dell systems from around  I had one so I bought them out of nostalgia really they were all going really cheap they looked in perfect condition but none of them booted up I had  HDDs in total to test Not booting up is common in such old units but perfect for me it makes my research cheap I plugged in the first hard drive using the usual forensic protocols write blockers taking notes etc and started trying to get information It was surprisingly easy the fault with the laptop this drive was in was likely on the motherboard It was a pretty clean disk an operating system web browserhistory MSN Office and some text files The folders the text files were all numbered like this   all the way to  Within each folder were three files Beginning Middle and End I was more focused on the percentage of recoverable data so left the files I figured the machine belonged to some author who was weirdly neat with his file systems I put in the next hard drive from another Dell system    Beginning Middle EndI couldnt believe it I stared at my screen dumbfounded I broke out of my temporary trance and checked I wasnt rescanning the same drive Sure enough this was a different drive the first drive was sealed away where I had left it But I didnt get how this was happening they were bought from buyers over  miles apart I checked the tracking history to confirm and theyd been sent within an hour of each other I scanned each drive every Dell drive I had was numbered and constructed the same The files werent deleted they were just there present within the system I checked and each listing for these HDDs said they were just old laptops the sellers wanted rid of I contacted each seller asking them for the story of the laptopThe first one who replied said they had moved into their house and found it in their shed six months after moving in they tried to get it working and it didnt so they just put it up for sale I waited a while for the other replies The second to come through stated they had found it in while insulating their attic The third reply found the laptop in a second hand car he had bought two years ago and just put it up for sale because he saw a couple more on eBay fetching  a few quid as he put it The final response I got contained profanity about me being nosey I never heard from the fifth laptop owner I just wanted to know why they all ended up with me when theyd come from separate locationsI gathered whoever owned these laptops left them to be found Id scanned all the drives at this point for my project prioritising getting that out the way my findings were more important than reading some sick poems Now I had everything stored I could start looking through each diskI had disks I refer to them by their numbered folders for ease             and    So I was missing two assuming  is the last folder whoever owned these made    and     I started reading the files  Beginning Theres nothing here its only the first Im just practicingMiddle Theres nothing here its only the first Im just practicingEnd  Theres nothing here its only the first Im just practicingPracticing what you cryptic prick I asked out loud I decided to skip to  hed be done practicing then He was Beginning The poor girl cant breath Im sure someone should take the bag off her head  I took the bag off her head and now she is happy Itd be a shame if she lost a toeMiddle The poor girl doesnt have any toes and she cant stand Im sure itd be a shame if she lost her arms  Her arms are gone where did she put them Itd be a shame if they were in her foodEnd It took a month but she ate her arms and even her legs what a greedy little tart   Its such a shame she lost her headPoetry I didnt even know I started to check every file and sure enough the same wavelength There were time lapses between each file creation the longest being  months Odd numbers were males even numbers females That was clear I was peering into the thoughts of someone with too much time and imagination Every description of death was different One lost his ears and died to infection Another woman was described to have mysteriously gone bald and have no face I stopped reading them it was just becoming silly at the mention of battery acid I got on with my life and kept them in a cupboard I had better things to do really but the files I always kept readily available in case I ever wanted to read from where I left off I read    before I gave upThen two months later a news story hit me in the face at a million miles an hourPolice revealed that the remains of Missing I will call her Joy youll see why were found just outside of OMITTED Thursday evening the police are investigating what appears to be a clear case of murder The remains of Joy were found badly mutilated with large portions of her skeleton not present at the site and the body was significantly decomposed she has been missing since March  age  It looks as if the body has been moved from a previous site and dumped A note was found on her body in a sealed bag presumably with what looks like three poems describing how she diedMy mind thought about those HDDs  fit the timeline they were all bought prior to her going missing Three poems discussing how she died No details of the mutilation were on any article I found so I went in blind During my project I was working on how much data could be found not WHAT data Id used automated scans to see if everything was there and hadnt manually done it  I had left most of it alone I began browsing web histories I came across searches for hardware shops and found various fake Myspace and MSN accounts I started to get a geographical picture of where each laptop had been used some were used on the same day with time lapses whoever was using these laptops was doing so on an almost simultaneous level I found Joy Number  created March  the only female in that chain which was mutilated according to the poems The laptop was less than two years old at the time th person The data on the laptop showed it was in the area Joys body was found This little girl so small and coy if she were mine Id call her Joy Ill make her mine and then shell see Joys the one Im happy to be I love being Joy it feels so fun Im sheltered inside her from the sun My skin is covered and she is not she smells as if shes begun to rot Joy left her I dont know when shes stopped gurgling again I want skin I want elbows I want knees Ill take her skeleton as I pleaseWhat do I do rnosleep I think Ive found hard

narratioextraneus,21,27,1rm2j4,118,I used to eat breakfast at a café near my office Every day scrambled eggs on toast and plenty of butter and crackedblack pepper Thats where I met Olivia She started coming in to the café around about the same time as I did ataround the same time as I did every morning We were both early risers and we almost always had the place to ourselves I would sit at one table and she had hers One morning she just came over with a smile on her face and sat with me She told me that I shouldnt eat so many eggs She said that it was bad for me Too much cholesterol in them apparently I explained to her that Id had that same breakfast since I was a kid It reminded me of home and I didnt plan on changing the habit anytime soon We got to talking some more of course I found out that she was a performance art student at the university She worked parttime at a local dog shelter She had a sense of humour enjoyed the outdoors and her hobbies included bodypainting and magic She was cute Real cuteI thought Id leave the body painting for a more opportune moment so instead I asked her about her interest in magic She smiled fiddled with her hair and told me about how her father had been a professional magician and how that had led to her interest in magic and performance art She picked at the last of her breakfast looked at her watch and told me that she had to go Just before she left she told me that she would show me a magic trick sometime that might put me off eggs altogether Does it actually involve eggs I asked herOf course it does She replied She grabbed her bag said goodbye and left the café giving me a little wave through the window as she crossed the street outside I sat and watched with a smile on my face I waved back just as she disappeared behind a garbage truck pulling up outside doing its morning roundsAfter that she sat with me every morning Our conversations almost always ended in the same way I would always ask her when she would show me her eggtrick One morning I even brought a box of eggs with me so she had no excuseI need something else though She saidWhat I askedWell to do the trick I need some eggs some gloves and a dog she replied slightly blushing I told her that I really had to see the trick now but before we could talk about it any further she grabbed my phone from the tableLook Im going to put my number in your phone and I want you to ring me later around  oclock I have to go to a party and I dont really know anyone there so Id like you to come with me Is that ok with youI certainly had no problem with that It was unexpected but I jumped at the opportunity I rang her later that evening and arranged to meet upI met her at a converted loft on the other side of town She held my hand as we walked into a crowded room full of performanceart exhibitions artistic types and generally trendy people We looked around for a while helping ourselves to the cheap Champagne It didnt take long before I noticed that Olivia looked every bit as uncomfortable and outofplace as I didI dont even know what Im doing here She laughed God I think I made a big mistake in my career choice I think I need to get out of hereWe ended up getting a cab to bar had a few drinks and ended up in my place She stayed the night I woke up the next morning at about six oclock but Olivia had gone All that was left was a small note on the bedside locker which read XXXIm not going to pretend that my heart didnt sink a little I took it as an emphatic Goodbye it was nice while it lasted Life must go on I thought to myself as I got out of bed and wandered into the bathroom giving myself the usual pep talk Theres plenty more fish in the seaIt wasnt long before I found myself sitting in the café again staring at my eggs on toast Alone I didnt really have any appetite I thought about taking the day off work and just going homeThen I saw her running down the street towards the café a smile beaming across her face and waving like a maniac at me She was wearing a ringmasters outfit complete with tophat and tailcoat and running alongside her on a leash were two small golden retriever puppies In her other hand she held out a box of eggs If anyone else saw her running down the street that morning she must have looked like a complete weirdo but I dont think I ever saw such a pleasant sightShe burst in the door giggling to herself powering through her own embarrassment and selfconsciousnessAnd now for one morning only I will perform for you my greatest trick How to get eggs  from dogs she said as she took a bowI gave her a quick round of applause She turned and picked up the two puppies and placed them on the table in front of me She then turned to pick up the eggsThats when Olivia lost her footing on the wet tiled floor She slipped violently forward then back colliding with the tables edge and then hitting the floor Her head landed with a force that cracked one of the tiles and blood poured from a wound on the back of her head She was out coldEverything else happened very quickly All I remember is being on the floor trying to talk to her screaming at the owner to call an ambulance Then she opened her eyes For a brief moment she gazed into mine as though everything was ok A single tear ran down her cheek then suddenly her demeanour changed A look of horror ran over her faceShe let out the most bloodcurdling scream I have ever heard and tossed me aside as though I wasnt even thereWhat are they She screamed as she swatted the air in front of her Get them away from meI tried to calm her down but she was like someone possessed She ran through the shop screaming and overturning tables finally running out the door She went to cross the street It was like she never even saw the garbage truck coming She was killed instantlyI could not believe what I had just seenIn the weeks that followed I met her parents on several occasions I had to give several statements to the police and the coroner so it was unavoidable They were distraught Utterly inconsolableI remember getting that letter from her mother in the post one morning explaining what the coroners findings were The official cause of death was deemed via motor vehicle collisionThe contributing factors went some way to further elaborate on what I had seen that morning in the café An autopsy revealed that Olivia had been suffering from asymptomatic Ocular larva migrans Undoubtedly they said this was as a result of prolonged contact young dogs at the shelter she worked at who were carriers of the eggs of Toxocara canis The worms had gone unnoticed in the back of her eyes trapped in a granulomatous mass That is until she hit her head on the floor and ruptured the tissue When she opened her eyes that morning it took only a moment before they floated into her field of viewTheir wriggling and wandering must have caused hysteria disorientation and terror they noted which led to her irrational behaviour and unfortunate loss of spatial awareness,1385599456.0,How to get eggs  from dogs,145,nosleep,top_week

TheGroovyTurte,12,22,1raatv,77,So Im not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told if only for my own piece of mind  Im an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously underserved community  The hospital itself is old its been standing since the late s it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium Ive never really encountered anything supernatural but I havent written off the existence of such phenomena  That being said a shadow in the night isnt enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the nightSo when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty well  Id have my admissions Id take care of the current patients without issue  Then one night I got an admission Ill call this patient Jerry  Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any would be physician that trains at this facility  He has a whole boat load of medical issues kidney problems diabetes high blood pressure  He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia Before meeting Jerry I was told hes actually a really fun guy hes always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here  So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen I was a little anxious  The admission was done the orders were placed and I didnt think more of it  He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night  It was around  in the morning when I went back to see Jerry  I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up  When I went in there Jerry wasnt in his bed  Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying not crying but rather whimpering as if he didnt have the stamina to make it a full cry  I tried putting on a brave face and said Jerry whats going on For an old guy Jerry was quicker than I thought and stronger than I would have believed  He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him  They wont leave me alone they wont let me sleep they wont let me eat  He continued on in this line of things the phantom they wouldnt let him do  I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home  As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this I still needed the blood and this wasnt the first time Id dealt with a confused older patient  I helped Jerry back to his bed  Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK  Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient it was something familiar  I tied the tourniquet in place then I cleaned his arm found my vein and went for it  Im not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing I was filling up my vial it was about half way full when Jerry started screaming LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONE He began to jerk violently somehow the needle stayed in place but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerrys body was pulling it back  I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm but the needle didnt budge  In shock I pulled harder my efforts still could not budge the needle  In response I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing  The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being  full to maybe being about  full  After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerrys arm leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise  Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me Can you see them  I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room  I walked back to the nursing station one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming  I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill  With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep  I made my way to the oncall room which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital  I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes  All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerrys eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing and a senile sick old man  The only trouble is since then the shadows Ive seen in dark rooms seem darker the lights unable to pierce them  The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings

TrickyTiger,67,24,1rjwb3,66,Ok so Im not sure if this is the best place to put this This happened to us about  weeks ago and Ive told friends but theyre all like man thats pretty creepy and then kinda drop it So I kind of wanted to post it on Ask Reddit but it doesnt quite feel like the kind of thing that would go thereSo my wife had been rearranging our bedroom since we got some extra furniture my mum died earlier this year so my dad gave us stuff One of the things was this old cheval mirror which looked kinda cool and I liked itSo anyway one night were sleeping and she wakes up heaving for breaths absolutely terrified out of her mind and starts crying After a while of consoling her she tells me she was just dreaming about this guy middle eastern in appearance who was wearing all white robes with a hood and he stood with his back to her surrounded by nothingness for what she said felt like about half an hour And she was growing increasingly uneasy and then he just turned slowly to face her and she never saw his face like her dream kind of erased that part He never said anythingSo she says this guy doesnt like that we have two mirrors facing each other and he wants us to move oneSo Im basically not sure what to think about it and we look and see the new cheval mirror is directly facing this other mirror on the wall and our bed is directly in the middle of itIt weirded me out enough that I immediately took the mirror out and we went back to sleep So nothing has happened since then and Im kind of just unwilling to let it go because it seems so weirdI guess Im just wondering if anybody has any kind of input on thisEDIT Spelling,1385528931.0,Need advice Does anybody know much about mirrors in dreams,90,nosleep,top_week
moduspwns,10,20,1rjvbc,60,His mother was so pale Her eyes were blank except for a trace of what I took to be urgency I know better now She gestured toward the crib as though it were an afterthought He should stay asleep while were gone He sleeps right through the night most nights I offer mothers varying degrees of assurance when they leave their children in my keeping for the first time Its something to intuit A mothers face will tell you how much assurance she needs It seemed to me at the time that whatever pressing matter she would be tending had overshadowed her reservations about me whom she had just met And a man Of course just to be a man calls for suspicion But then she did show some concern  or what I took for concern I know better now  for her eldest Sam a boy of three who had yet to speak It was nothing unusual she said The doctors say some children just speak when theyre ready Before she left she looked tentatively at him almost apologetically She hesitated a moment as she clutched the door handle as though shed forgotten some instruction Its best he remains in the crib unless theres an emergency Hes likely to get fussy if he realizes Im gone She shut and locked the door in one fluid motionSam would not look at me I understood he might take some time warming up to me but he showed almost no emotion at all I asked him silly questions for a time and gave up in the absence of any acknowledgement I didnt blame him His mother was peculiar to say the least and something about this house was oppressive I had the strangest inclination to bolt straight out the door and never look back to leave Sam and the baby They would surely make it on their own for the evening What could happen to them really locked safely in their home She did say the baby sleeps through the night and it didnt seem that Sam would so much as take note of my absence I managed to fend off such absurdities just well enough and just long enough to remain at my post It wasnt long before I heard the baby stirring and I felt in me some irresistible grim inclination to see him Id begun to wonder whether he was inflicted with some bizarre malady the way his mother and son behaved I sneaked quietly into his room which was just down the hall from the living area His door was wide open yet the light of the hall was dim and strained to reach the crib at the far corner of the room I made my way to the crib easily enough but it was terrible standing there waiting for my eyes to adjust Panic gripped me in the darkness as though I was in immediate danger and yet I did not fear for the baby or for his elder brother in the living area I feared for myself more deeply than I believed possible and for the first time not merely for my life My life was a trifle Id have gladly disposed in half a moment to escape that roomI looked down at him and labored in vain to convince myself that what I felt then was relief It was only a baby My façade was quickly overcome for it was immediately evident that something was very wrong with this child It was oddly sexless and not merely in the manner common to most infants Its skin looked a pale grey  an effect of the light I hoped Its plump features were wellproportioned and smooth everything one might find endearing in a baby and yet none of it was right There was something unnatural drawn in every feature of this child in his crib in the dark His face was a perfect mockery of innocence but only that And that was not the whole of it Though his eyes were closed and his chest rose and fell steadily I knew he was aware of my presence at his side He perceived me with a dark malice even as he slept I imagined reaching out in affection to caress him as one might an ordinary baby and let out a wretch His eyes opened but not both at once There was an almost imperceptible delay between the opening of each and with his eyes open his features took life His skull was oddly lumpy his skin perfectly smooth How could I have missed those tumorous lumps mere moments ago He reached a hand with uncanny deliberation and began massaging his face in a most grotesque fashion His skin yielded to his grip like dough and to such an extent that I could peer into his eye sockets The whites of his eyes were webbed with red which matched his bloodred gums He was all pale grey and red with none of the vivacious pink of a child It looked as though he was haphazardly resculpting his own faceI noticed then that there was something more to his breathing My mind must have prevented my hearing the truth in the first place for the sheer impossibility of it but in light of the absurdity before me then I was able to discern words My face it breathed My face my mark then My face my milk and after some seconds My markmy facemy faceIt noticed me then It froze flesh firmly in its grip It trained an eye on me It was at first a look of mild curiosity an appraising look But soon malice crept in and the force of it struck me backward I wanted to swoon in revulsion or to run from the room I wanted to scream but its will  its choicest weapon  held me firm I heard a noise behind me and somehow managed to tear my eyes from the crib It was Sam at the open door tentatively standing outside It was obvious to me then that he knew and refused to enter His mouth was moving His eyes were wide with fear but he seemed determined to articulate I walked to the door as though wading through thick mud I could not turn to the crib could not face it but nor could I bear the thought of it at my rear I stepped out of the room and in the light of the hallway found the courage to face the room The crib remained as it was in the shadows I could not see inside I bent to one knee and grabbed Sam by the shoulders What is it Sam I asked and shortly repeated What is it There is only one baby he started but despair took him A groan escaped him a groan in which I could hear pure inarticulate dread more dread than his three years could possibly have contained I shook him gently and he sobbed back a quick sharp breath There is only one baby in hell he choked I heard a stirring in the crib And then the breathing No words this time There was something unsteady in it something that suggested laughter It was a humorless pitchless laugh that we felt more than heard I looked to Sam and for the briefest moment the fear fled from his eyes In its place it left the deepest disgust the most profound loathing I had yet witnessed The expression vanished so quickly I wondered whether it had been a trick of the low light and terror resumed After some minutes I summoned the strength to take his arm and usher him to the living areaHere we sit in an age which never ends Both of us this room the house and everything in it are fears subject He is our eternal tyrant The truth must be that at some point I died and some power was there ever any power but fear  saw fit to condemn my soul to the bottom circle of hell Hellwhich has only one baby When I first arrived odd though it seems Sams presence provided some relief Yet I have come to realize he is just another tool of my tormentor Sam serves always and only as a reminder to meSam reminds me that I am helpless to save myself or anyone that I have no more strength than a child He reminds me that my terror is not for him I would cast him into the very crib itself if it meant I could feel a beam of true light from the window The window Every long while and the gaps grow longer still I find my eyes drift to the door expecting its mother to return Then the window expecting the red sun to peak over the horizon Sam reminds me of the truth Fear has no mother There is nothing outside The night never ends,1385528075.0,There is only one baby in

MrAlfredo,7,21,1rnx3s,60,I got home late last night from work and noticed that I had a new friend request on Steam I accepted and the person began messaging me claiming to be my brothers fiancée and she urging me to buy the new Thanksgiving DLC for Borderlands  before the three dollar price shot up in an hour so that we could play it together This was already a red flag to me because just the other day I was talking to my brother and his fiancée about Steam and she asked Whats Steam but never mind that It got stranger still when she refused to download Mumble my preferred VoIP software so we could play together more easily insisting that she had a friend who used a different program called DXE Ultimate which sounded ridiculous but was supposedly some other VoIP and her friend didnt want to download Mumble either So I figured what the hell Ive already got Mumble Ventrilo and TeamSpeak simultaneously installed whats another VoIP I went to the site she linked to download this thing and first off the site was riddled with ads and popups for all kinds of unsavory things Red flag number two The onsite description of the software didnt sound like a VoIP or chat program at all in fact it was pretty clear about how bad it was going to fuck up my computer and the download button said Please let me in which DEFINITELY left me unsettled Red flag number three So I turned my sights back to my brothers fiancée in the message box I began by asking flat out who is this really The response was pretty obvious the person restated that they were my brothers fiancée I followed up by asking questions that pertained to interactions wed had in the past mustache humor Borderlands  as well as prior conversations I asked about her friend too because that kept sticking out to me Who was this OTHER person she was playing games with The person on the other end was nailing the personal questions and skillfully dodging the questions about their friend but the answers seemed somehow robotic too methodical practiced or perhaps extracted from the real source I continued grilling the person in question until I had exhausted the possibilities and told them Id download it in the morning and went to sleepI wouldve posted this story sooner but I had to go to work this morning yep on Thanksgiving Fortunately Ill be getting to see my brother and his fiancée today Im planning on asking her about the exchange because it was extremely odd Ill update this post with more information when I can break away from the Thanksgiving festivitiesEDIT Okay so the story gets a little bit weirder she was at Thanksgiving which is good because now I know the mystery person didnt have her tied up or something But when I asked her about the messages she got oddly defensive citing that she hadnt heard of Steam before the other day when we talked about it She almost seemed offended like I was accusing her of something She continued wigging out until I mentioned the malware by name I saw the change immediately her eyes went wide and her jaw dropped Apparently someone had messaged her through Skype claiming to be me and was trying to get her to download the same software She had also been suspicious of the event but was being more tentative about asking me about it Apparently she had gone through similar steps that I had and was greeted by the same cold calculated types of responses I asked her what time that happened thinking the person used information they gathered from both conversations to answer each others questions She said it happened at pm last night Now it was my turn to go wideeyed and drop my jaw I informed her that I was at work from pm to pm with no available internet Whoever it was who did this knows me and used that knowledge to fake being me to her and get information from her to use talking to me Ill update again if I receive anymore messages from this person,1385668084.0,My Brothers Fiancée,81,nosleep,top_week
childrenofsamhain,23,9,1rhdoj,59,My friend Jaime purchased a new home about six years ago when his wife was pregnant with their first child Until recently he lived there with his wife Claire and their two daughters Sarah and Emily Sarah is now five years old and Emily is three Within the first two years living in the house Jaime said that he never experienced anything out of the ordinary It wasnt until his daughter Sarah was around two years old that he started to notice she talked to herself Jamie thought nothing of it she was just learning to talk and he figured she was just entertaining herself One afternoon when Claire was out at the grocery store Jaime overheard his daughter in the upstairs hallway whispering and giggling Curious he asked Sweetie who are you talking to Sarah replied The woman standing in the hallwayIs she your imaginary friendI guess Amused he went upstairs to find her staring blankly at a wall whispering quietly Whats your friends name he asked her Her name is Helen Mary she said And what are you two whispering about Sarah looked at him and paused before she piped Im not supposed to tell you Suddenly the front door opened downstairs and they heard Claire come through the door Sarah rushed down the stairs to greet her Jaime didnt think about that again for a few weeks Over time the two noticed that Sarahs interactions with Helen Mary became more frequent but they attributed this to the fact that they had just given her the news that she was going to be a big sister About two weeks before Claire gave birth to Emily Jaime was at home alone with Sarah He heard her playing upstairs chatting away with her imaginary friend when suddenly he heard glass breaking He ran upstairs as quickly as possible to find his daughter standing in the hallway holding a hammer She was staring up at the wall of family pictures that were now smashed to pieces There was glass everywhere Jaime picked his daughter up and carried her down the stairs He told her to stay put as he returned to the upstairs hallway to clean up the shattered fragments of their family portraits When he returned to the living room he asked her directly Sweetie why would you smash all of our family pictures She looked at him Helen Mary told me to do itWhen Claire returned home that evening from her girls night with friends Jaime told her about the incident The crept up the stairs so as not to wake their daughter so Claire could view the damage with her own eyes She gasped silently at the sight When they returned downstairs to the kitchen they started to discuss possible explanations for her behavior Suddenly the color ran out of Claires face and she looked at Jaime Theres no way she could have done that aloneWhatThere is no way she could have smashed all of those pictures by herselfJaime was confused I told you I caught her with the hammer She told me that she did itBut it wasnt until his wife said it aloud that it dawned on him But some of those pictures are almost five feet off the ground How could she have reached thoseHis mind was racing She must have moved a chair or somethingShe was adamant There are no chairs upstairs that she is strong enough to move without you hearing it and you would have seen her carry one upstairs rightJaime was silent He didnt have an answer They went to bed that night without any answers The following morning their daughter had little recollection of smashing the pictures and Jamie wrote it off as sleepwalking Though he didnt have much time to think about it as two weeks later his second little girl was bornEmily was two years old in the summer of  and one afternoon when Claire was at home alone with the girls she heard Emily alone upstairs whispering She called up to her Who you talking to kiddoThe woman standing in the hallwayClaire thought that her Sarah must have told her about her imaginary friend and that she was simply trying to emulate her big sister Then she spoke againShe doesnt like you MommyWhy doesnt she like me Claire responded surprised I dont know Suddenly her daughter came bounding down the stairs as if nothing had happened Even though both Jaime and Claire both found this slightly creepy nothing about the situation ever felt threatening or malevolent Until one night last monthJaime had put the kids to sleep around eight oclock in the evening and he and Claire had got into bed soon after Exhausted Jaime and his wife fell asleep extremely quickly Jaime was awoken by the sound of screaming He was disoriented and had no idea what time it was but he could tell that it was his wife screaming right next to him He turned to see what was wrong and saw it His  year old daughter Emily standing beside the bed with a hammer in her hand Blood poured from Claires forehead Jamie jumped out of bed and grabbed the hammer out of his daughters hand He turned to his wife She had stopped screaming now and Jaime grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wiped the blood away from her face She was going to be alright but she did have a deep cut to her forehead Jaime picked up his daughter and carried her out of the room He went and checked on Sarah who had awoken to the screaming but was clearly unharmed He told her that everything was alright and closed her door He was standing alone with his daughter in the upstairs hallway and he finally asked her Emily why would you hurt MommyShe told me to DaddyWho told you to The woman standing right behind you She told me to hurt Mommy And then Jaime felt a chill run up his spine when his daughter leaned into his ear and whispered And she told me to hurt you too DaddyThey moved last week ,1385451179.0,The Woman Standing in the Hallway,68,nosleep,top_week

WontThinkStraight,17,17,1rcy69,48,I just had a long overdue catch up with Brad and to check on how Emilys family were doing since their tragedyhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentspclnotes In some welcome news they are now expecting a new child to join their familyBrad had another story for me though one that has kept me awake  the past couple of nights Ive captured it below to help get it off my mindIn a universe filled with choices but with only one life in which to make them regrets become inevitable Regrets for things done or left undone for words said or left unsaidAt that moment when our life is fading and we see it all over again how would we feel about those decisions weve made  Would we be proud of those moments that defined us Those moments alone when we think no one else is watching How we treated those we loved and those close to usBrad was not the only child in his family He also had a younger brother Paul They could not have been more opposites to each otherWhere Brad was brash and wild in his youth Paul was introverted and contemplative And like many siblings their childhood was one of constant warfare with each other Looking back Brad admits that he was an arrogant possessive and obnoxious brat Any of those traits alone would already have given him an excuse to hate on his little brotherBut it was really the fear of the Burnt Man that really started it all As an only child Brad enjoyed the attention and adulation that brought him That changed when his brother Paul was born three years laterAt first Brad had loved the idea of a brother to play with He imagined they would play together and be best friends That idea disappeared when he discovered Paul was a useless baby that only cried smelled bad and demanded constant attention The second year wasnt much better with Paul starting to get a larger share of Brads toys and presentsIt became really bad in the third year when Brad had to give up half his room and share it with Paul He found they had nothing in commonWhere Brad liked being loud and attention seeking with others Paul just babbled and talked with himself Brad loved being outside and active Paul preferred to stay indoors and draw with his crayon setWhat unsettled Brad though was what Paul would draw There would be the usual things every child draws  houses animals trees and family What was unusual was every drawing of their family always had an extra personTheir parents would be there and Brad and Paul all drawn in rainbow hues Right next to Paul would be a mysterious figure drawn in black and redThe family faces all had big smiles but the stranger was a disfigured mess two big black circles for eyes and a shapeless mass for the mouth In every drawing of the stranger he was missing an arm and had red streaks running through all overOver time this stranger began to feature more and more prominently in the drawings Brad and his parents would no longer appear in them  just Paul playing with the stranger inside the house or outside in the yardAt first their parents thought it was just a phase but eventually became concerned enough to ask Paul who that was He told them it was his friend the burned man He had always been there for as long as Paul could remember He never said anything  he just stood there watching and listeningThey concluded it was just an imaginary friend Granted it was a bit more unsettling than having a dinosaur or elf for a friend but at least Paul wasnt drawing some reallife predatorOne night when Brad was  and Paul was  they stayed awake after their parents had tucked them in Brad wanted to know more about the Burnt ManPaul said that he had been in an accident a fire that had burnt his entire body and face It had melted his eyes away and made his arm go missing He was very sadPaul didnt find the Burnt Man scary though He had always been around and never did anything Just watched and listenedBrad told him he was stupid for having an imaginary friendPaul yawned and simply replied that he wasnt imaginary He was in the room with them right now In fact he was standing right next to Brad watching and listening as he did every nightBrad felt a chill go up his spine He had always been a brave child but for the first time in his life he felt fear He looked around in the darkness not sure if the shadows were his imagination or the Burnt Man waiting for him to go to sleepBrad didnt go to sleep that night and concluded that he needed a room of his ownHe could no longer share a room with his annoying brother and his creepy friend But he couldnt admit that he was afraid either so his  year old mind came up with an ideaHis plan was simple  to make it so painful for their parents to keep them together they would be forced to keep them in separate rooms So began their adversarial relationshipThey fought over everything for many years and often physically Each prank they played each other escalated into new rounds of retaliation all to the chagrin of their parents It would take six more years until they moved to a bigger house and they were able to have separate rooms at last before the feuds started to die down the Burnt Man had been all but forgotten by this time replaced with pure animosity for each other But on the first night in their new home Brad remembered waking in the middle of the night and seeing a figure sitting on his bed watching him It stared at him through hollow eye sockets and moaned at him through an open jaw It reached for him with a horribly burnt hand the other hung uselessly by its side with the lower half missingBrad screamed so loud it woke the house and the figure had disappeared by the time he blinked When Paul came into the room to check what all the commotion was about Brad told him he saw the Burnt ManPaul laughed and said he hadnt seen him in years In fact he could hardly even remember him In any case he couldnt see him in the room now Paul closed the door as he left then reopened it quickly and shouting Boo before laughing again and walking back to his roomFor Brad the memory of it seemed very real though It wasnt just the terror but the overwhelming sense of sadness he felt from the encounterAnother incident was when Paul was  and involved in a hitandrun accident He was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and the doctors werent sure if he would survive Paul was lying in bed with a coma with his parents crying around himBrad could could see a figure through the corner of his eye standing by the walls It was the Burnt Man watching Paul intentlyJust go already Why are you still here Youre not wanted Just leave us Brad remembered shouting at the figure He got a severe reprimanding from his parents thinking that he was shouting at his brotherPaul is dying Brad Its time to put your stupid feud behind Were family for gods sake Act like it his father had rebuked while his mother criedThe words stung Brad especially since he couldnt explain that he wasnt shouting at Paul He quietly fumed then stormed outPaul did recover two days later though and was out of the hospital a week laterThat last incident was  years ago The Burnt Man was never seen again by either of them since Brad had become a serious and buttoned down computer analyst since then Paul married had two children of his own and had saved countless lives through his job as an EMT They had developed a grudging respect for each other though their lives had drifted off in different directions over the yearsThe Burnt Man was just another long forgotten childhood memory filed away and never thought of again until recently Only a recent tragedy brought it all back into sharp focusA few months ago Brad learnt that his brother had died while on duty He was on scene with other emergency services dealing with a factory fireA chemical storage tank had unexpectedly exploded near his location dousing him in burning chemicals The flying shrapnel had sheared off his left arm at the elbowPaul was In a life of many regrets Brad now has one more for the list He never did let Paul know how proud he was of him and that despite their differences he loved him as a brotherHe regrets that his last words to Paul werent goodbye but a text message which read You suck Ive shat better excuses than that It was said in jest about why Paul didnt have time over the weekend for a beer but it was devastating knowing it would be the last memory both had of each otherSo every now and then Brad talks to the silence in the room hoping that his brother the Burnt Man is still around to hear Now much older and wiser he no longer fears the Burnt Man  but fears that the only one listening might just be himselfOne that can only observe in silence powerless to stop whatever fate awaits him judging him with regret for the decisions hes made and is yet to makeLinks back to the earlier stories in order A Curious Mind is a Terrible

iampatheo,11,18,1rcqug,45,  This is my first Reddit post so please excuse my mistakes I live with my parents and my grandfather who is my fathers uncle actually so basically not my grandfather      I am going to jump straight into the problem here because there is something definitely weird going on in our house There have been this series of events which have occurred throughout my childhood which I have always put them at the back of my mind maybe because as a child I didnt look into it enough but I never forgot But with the most recent event I cant help but ask you guys for advice     The first event occurred when I was around  I guess I was probably getting ready for school or something and the only people in the house that morning was my mom and my grandfather Mom was helping me put my tie on  we had a school uniform  and I remember glancing towards the living room which is visible from my room I saw my grandfather walk into the living room after which he proceeded to go towards the balcony and out of my sight I got out my room and I was walking towards the kitchen to get some water Now the kitchen is right next to my grandfathers room and its on the other side of our house As I reached his room I saw him sitting there reading the paper I got a bit surprised because I clearly remembered seeing him in the living room just a few seconds ago and there is no way he could have gotten back here before me or without bumping into me I asked him about it and he said he had no clue what I was talking about So I just put it at the back of my mindThe next incident happened a year back or so It was after  pm and I was locked up in my room listening to really loud music through my earphones while doing some reading I like doing that getting a whole background score feel for the things happening in the book After a while I heard my parents banging the door and shouting at me and I figured they must have been knocking for some time When I opened the door I saw them both standing there with concerned looks on their faces I asked them what happened and they said that apparently they could hear me crying out  for help from my room in a really panicky way and they thought had probably slipped and had broken a bone or something I obviously had no clue what they were talking about and they swore that the voice they heard was mine and no one elses It freaked me out a little But even then I didnt put it together with the incident from all those years back     And now something has happened again last night and this time I am pretty freaked out I was having my dinner in my room as I was watching a movie on my laptop As I finished I got out of my room and headed for the kitchen On the way I noticed my mom dad and grandfather in the living room watching TV As I walked past my grandfathers room I saw him Sitting on a chair by the window The room was dimly lit but it was enough to see everything I did a double take I looked towards the living room and he was still there with my parents  I looked back and he was still there sitting in his chair by the window He was looking at me but for some reason I couldnt see his eyes Not because they werent there or anything but it was as if I was feeling this weird force which was trying to make me look away from there I also got this head rush which you get when you stand up too fast As soon as I recovered from that and my head cleared he was gone from his chair My parents and grandfather were still sitting there in the living room chatting amongst themselves as they watched the TV I told them what happened but they obviously did not believe me and thought I was making it upI really need to know what this is Is this a doppelganger And if so what should I do Is this thing going to be harmful It hasnt done anything harmful so far ,1385309994.0,DOPPELGANGER Problem,63,nosleep,top_week

JustAnotherLondoner,9,10,1riwe6,43,I was twenty six years old when I had finally saved up enough money to move out of my apartment My fiancé James and I bought a house in the British countryside We were both cityborn people so we wanted somewhere in the peace and quiet That was our first mistake The nearest town was  minutes away  if youre walking and willing to push your way through fields of wheat There was only one house within that distance it was around a  minute walk from ours on the other side of the field backing onto our back garden We were told that the house had been vacant for years so as far as we were concerned there were no other humans around We were in our own little bubble and we were loving every minute of it Due to part of my family being Irish I was used to a bit of silence Every year I would visit and every year I would sit at the window of my guest room stare at the cows in the field outside and just take in the silence It wasnt something you heard a lot of in London James had never experienced that growing up he had spent his whole life up until now in London Though he initially liked the idea of a bit of silence I think he found it a bit unsettling It was a bit too quiet for him Whenever there was a bang or a whistle of the wind outside hed jump and wonder what it was I would reassure him that it was nothing but he was always a little tense About a month into our new home James and I were watching TV in our room before we went to bed It was around pm Jaaames fancy closing the curtain while youre up I plead as James got up to go to the toilet He sighed and walked over to the window to close the curtain He paused and stared outsideKate He began Has anyone moved into that house I havent seen any moving vans so I dont think so Is there a car there I replied He shook his head Why I asked confused by his sudden fascination in the house Because the light is on Someone must be in there He said giving me a confused and concerned look I reassured him that its probably nothing that someone obviously must own it but might not live there all the time It was probably a holiday home or something similarOdd place for a holiday home James responded in a tone which suggested he did not believe my reassuring explanation this time He kept his eyes on the house for a minute longer and then finally closed the curtain Maybe we should go over there tomorrow and see who they are Introduce ourselves as the friendly neighbours we are I suggested James thought about it for a moment and then agreed That was our second mistake The next day after James and I returned from work we went over to the neighbours house It was getting on  oclock and so it was getting dark out I suggested we take the car but James said we should just walk as its only  minutes away I didnt mind too much it was only  minutes after all I took some cookies with me to gift the neighbours with in order to make friends On approach to the house we noticed a few odd things First the scarecrow in the field separating our two homes was dressed in a suit The suit was torn and had what appeared to be blood on it We also noticed that there was a face on the scarecrow  two crosses for eyes and a stitched up mouth Well thats fucking creepy James said pointing at it I agreed Is it wise to meet these people Im not getting a good vibe He beganWe have to now Theyll be able to see us from their window Itd be odd for us to just turn back now I interruptedWhat if this was all placed to ward off visitors He replied I had no response I just continued walking to the house and he followed In the place of where a knocker would normally be on the front door there was instead a sigh It readTRESPASSERS BEWARE GUARD DOGS WILL BE RELEASED WHEN I SEE YOU Well thats a good sign I see no dogs he might not mind that were here James said looking around worryingly I knocked on the door The sound of multiple dogs barking began James worry grew stronger and he tried to persuade me to go home It wasnt safe here Lets wait one minute and if no one answers well know we arent wanted I replied I saw the light was on again They were inside I wanted to know who my neighbours were A minute passed and nobody came to the door I sighed in disappointment and turned to leave with James When we reached the scarecrow I took one last look around to see if anyone had come to open the door Thats when I saw himA shaded figure stood at the entrance of the house watching us leave I couldnt see his face he seemed to have deliberately stood in the darkest spot of the garden out of sight I stopped and looked at him wondering if this meant he wanted to speak He slowly raised his hand and waved before stepping back inside and closing the doorWell that was odd I whispered Could you see his face  I asked James I turned back to see he was about  steps ahead of me still staring at the house NNo He replied His gaze fixed on the house of the mystery neighbour Lets go He said before taking my hand and pulling me home When we got home James locked all the doors and windows and closed all curtains He was paler than I had ever seen him and he was sweating Are you alright Whats wrong I asked I was beginning to panic as he looked ill with fear We have to move soon He replied He then proceeded to open the laptop and load an estate agency website James weve only been here a month We cant afford to move now I replied trying to make him thing logically againWewe have to move though He replied still scanning the laptop screen Why I asked No response More typing on the laptop and scanning of the screen I repeated my question No response again I slid my arm around James and closed the laptop The question of why was once again askedThe neighbour He began I recognize him From whereMy nightmares I was officially lost Then James opened up his laptop again and Googled The shadows of Cambridge Sure enough pictures similar to what we had experienced popped up A shaded figure with a raised hand apparently waving but in the dark so that we cannot see him The physique was the same throughout  it was probably the same person There was even a picture of his scarecrow Okay so What is this exactly I asked This thing isnt a man hiding in the shadows He is a shadow He can get into any place with light nearby and pretend to the the shadow of an object by clinging to the floor or wall but he is some sort of I dont know three dimensional shadow being He became known in Cambridge after a series of murders the CCTV cameras showed this this thing show up It suffocates people and then slumps into the darkness so nobody can find it It leaves no footprints fingerprints loose hairs or skin flakes It leaves nothing behind because there is nothing to leave Its a shadow But its D I dont know But its dangerous We need to leave Kate Before it kills us and nobody is around to hear us or find our dead corpses rotting in that damn field out there There were tears in his eyes but he was too focused on finding a new home to cry The estate agency website was open once again and he was scanning He was even looking at apartments again I awoke the next day to find James still on the laptop I had crashed around an hour or two after the events of the night before but James hadnt moved He was still tense his skin still pale and sweaty his eyes still wide with determination to find a safer home Oh morning He said quietly as he glanced over to see me sit up Ive found a few potential homes Most are in London suburbs but thats alright Its still not as loud as the central city areas and that thing wont be there I nodded in agreement I didnt want to move but seeing James in this way scared me and I was beginning to see it was the only thing we could do Otherwise hed be living in fear and paranoia over the neighbours or worse we could actually be in dangerThe next week a for sale sign was posted outside our house The day after that the sign was missing It returned a few days later covered in a bloodcoloured red liquid I refused to touch it We got the sign replaced but this one went missing too This one returned black as if it had dipped in ink We tried to clean it this time to avoid bothering the estate agents again Underneath the ink was a message scratched into the board it read YOU CANNOT LEAVE This is the point in which I began genuinely worrying for mine and James safety This neighbour of ours didnt want to meet us but he didnt want to see us leave either A conflicted character it seemed A month or so passed and nobody wanted to buy our house We knew why  everyone knew about the shadowed neighbour I began to accept the fact that we were probably stuck there and James began accepting the fact that we were doomed to die soon He stopped eating sleeping bathing and began obsessing over this thing He looked up how to ward it off how to protect yourself and your home from it remedies for if it scratched or bit you the list is infinite Eventually he got fired from work for failing to attend for two weeks without so much as a phone call His hair and beard grew long his clothes dirty and damp from sweat He was a broken man One day I came home from work to see an empty desk with the laptop open James I called No reply I checked all of the rooms in the house but to no avail  he was missing I looked out of the window and noticed that the light in the neighbours house was on He was there I knew it I had to knock and see if he was inside                              ContinuedI drove to the other house to avoid walking alone in the dark for ten minutes On arrival I instantly know something had changed The light was now off and the front door was wide open I turned off the car engine and sat there staring at the door waiting for something to happen Maybe James would come out maybe the shadow would I dont know If nothing was to come out it meant I was meant to go in I waited or a few minutes and stared at the door intensely hoping praying that someone would come out so that I didnt have to go in Nobody did I took a deep breathe and got out of the car As I approached the open door I noticed something was pinned to it A note In what I hope was just dark red ink the words Come on in Kate were written I entered a the house into large hallway I was immediately met with an old musky smell Everything in sight was covered in thick layers of dust Slightly to the left of the centre of the hallway was a large staircase The wall going up beside the staircase was covered in old portraits  all of the eyes had been scratched out and the mouths torn and ripped My instincts told me not to go upstairs straight away I instead walked into the room to the left and called for James I didnt really expect any response and sure enough I didnt get one either I was now in what appeared to be a study There was a large mahogany desk at the back of the room in front of a large leather chair On the desk were piles of papers but no pens All letters on the desk were written in red I walked over to the desk to see what these papers were only to realize they were all the same They all read Wrong turn Keep looking There were hundreds of them all spread over the desk I turned and went looking for another roomThe next room I entered was on the other side of the hallway It was a living room with an archway connecting to the dining room There was a large metal fireplace with a large red rug in front of it The rug was covered in black soot I walked over to the fireplace to inspect why the soot was on the rug Inside the fireplace was a letter It read Stop messing around downstairs and find your dear James Hes waiting to be rescues Kate This confirmed it James was upstairs I frantically ran upstairs trying to ignore any creepy alterations to the paintings and decorations and staying focused on finding James I called for him but again got no response Suddenly a door creaked behind me I swung around to see it slowly open Nobody came out This was the shadowed neighbour directing me I cautiously approached the doorI walked into the bedroom of a child There were no toys except an old rocking horse covered in dust All mirrors had been covered and the curtains were closed There was a thud from the inside of the wardrobe As I stepped closer the musky smell began to clear and I was instead met with the smell I had become far too familiar with since James and I saw the shadowed man the first time  sweat and dirt I opened the wardrobe to find James still pale as a ghost and sweating more than I had ever seen him sweat before He was drenched in sweat and stunk horrifically He was tied up and blindfolded I quickly untied him and lifted his blindfold Without thinking I jumped back and gasped in shock His eyes had been scratched to an oblivion and he as unable to open them There was surprisingly less blood than I would have expected the neighbour must have collected it for his letters SickI put the blindfold back on him and directed him through the house constantly reassuring him that it was me and no one else He was tense and silent the whole time When we got to the front door it was locked with a note on it It readGoing so soon But he hasnt had his mouth fixed yet I turned to James and asked him what it meant No reply He instead took a deep breath and opened his mouth Inside were lots of tiny cuts over the insides of his cheeks on his gums and even his tongue I looked at the paintings near the staircase  their mouths had been sewn thin strikes of paint had been put over to repair the rips in the mouth area of each portrait At that moment James snapped He ripped his hand out from my grip and stomped into the office room I had been in earlier He soon emerged holding various stationary equipment  a holepuncher a stapler even a large pair of scissors What are you doing I asked He handed me the scissorsI dont know but if it approaches try to stab it with these He replied He then proceeded to throw the holepuncher with all his strength at the window The window shattered Never mind He said Was that a window or the glass of the door He asked trying to feel the window frame Window I replied He grinned and tried to climb out Careful of the glass I warned and tried to help him out He then proceeded to pull me through We were outside We were nearly free I took hold of his hand again and dragged him to the car And then typical to any horror movie or story the engine wouldnt start Shit I yelled slapping the steering wheel in frustration James can you feel for the manual in the compartment please Maybe thatd help In truth I wanted to find an explanation in there first before going out there and trying to fiddle with the engine alone The shadowed thing was out there somewhere and I didnt want to be out there with himJames opened the passenger side compartment and sure enough a note written in red fell out This one red Come back soon neighbour I frantically turned the car key in the hopes that it would start without me having to get out Success The car eventually started We drove off out of there as fast as we could and went home to pack our stuff and leave that area for good It is now two months later The house remains unsold but still for sale We are renting an apartment back in London again and havent been back to the house since James lost his sight in one eye but the doctor was able to recover one His mouth is fine Every now and again we find notes in random places in our apartment saying things like Im watching you and You wont get away so easily next time We burn them and hope that one day theyll stop One day that thing will leave us alone One day well really be free ,1385502108.0,The Shadows of Cambridge,53,nosleep,top_week
ohthankheaven,6,16,1rbpkl,47,I dont have an exciting life I wake up each morning at exactly AM and by AM Im starting the engine of my poorly kept up with vehicle and begin my venture to work Im late every single day by about fifteen minutes to be precise I dont care they could fire me if they wanted but Im the kind of guy who comes to the office keeps his mouth shut and gets the job done They also figure that the fifteen minutes of tardiness isnt so bad compared to the hour and fortyfive minutes of unpaid overtime they sentence me with every day I would describe my job as dull repetitive and relentlessly boring and correspondingly so is my life My house isnt particularly lavish Living alone as a male really doesnt give your residence that home feeling Im not your average lonely I lack companionship I do not have a family I do not have friends Every day is the same Its winter time and the days freeze together My alarm goes off I hit snooze Again the obnoxious ringtone I set on my phone crackles out of the tiny speaker I hit snooze After a third ring Im out of bed and on my way to work Its freezing this morning and the heat in my car does not work My weatherbeaten jacket doesnt provide that much protection either I scrape through the day counting the minutes The drive home from work offers my only source of human contact and this lies in the sports talk radio station I listen to Their snide remarks always make me laugh and I sometimes call in to dispute some of the commentary they are making It also feels good to have somebody to talk to especially when youre as solitary as I amI dont choose to be this way I am a single child and my parents died three years ago in a car accident It was a tough loss it put me in a downward spiral until I hit bottom which just so happens to be where I still reside I try to socialize and be friendly but it seems like Im lost in the masses Maybe I should be more interesting or funny or wear nicer clothes Im not good with these things I started taking comfort in the internet For me it felt safer more secure from the harshness of the real world Not that the internet isnt any less relentless the only difference is Im hiding behind a screen and a handle I do not have a Facebook I dont know if its because I dont see the point of having one or Im too scared to deal with the fact that I would lack companionship on there as well I visit my favorite sports websites browse Reddit and enjoy YouTube None of those things could ever satisfy my primal need for a physical partner in life so eventually I started using a dating website A website that I dont feel the need to name They are all the same anyway It was slow at first Slower than it took me to fill out my profile and eventually take a picture anyway I didnt know what to write about myself and even convincing myself to finally publicize my life in an attempt to get anyone to talk to was an effort in itself  Months went by and I received no glimmer of hope Suddenly a chat prompt appeared on my laptopHello she saidHer name is Julie and she is beautiful I dont know what she saw in me but for the first time it is real it is there We spoke for years Endless chat logs phone calls video chats We shared tears laughs and something I never felt before love Two days ago I asked Julie to meet me for the first time and she said yes I was nervous at first but extremely happy I asked her if she wanted to have dinner but she said she would rather just come to my house instead Yesterday she came over she really is a special girl We hit it off so well that she decided to spend the night She really is excited to have me now I can hear her calling for me now I have never felt so happy and so confident There is one thing that is for certain she will never leave me Even if we fight even if we argue she still wont leave me We are going to have a great time together and we are going to play Even if it turns out she doesnt like the games we play she still wont leave me There is that chance though that small chance that things wont work out That chance that the love will fade and that abominable lonliness will come back It scared me at first because I cant go back to being alone again I wont go back I dont worry anymore though because Julie loves me and the games we play Julie loves to be with me and Julie isnt strong enough to bend the bars of her basement cell To be continued,1385259704.0,Julie,63,nosleep,top_week
hotforhautbois,16,21,1rlo21,44,Like many dumb kids who move away from home for college I had a series of extreme changes to my life right away Within first year I got involved with some stupid boy I didnt even see that coming Im attracted to women Ive gone  years of life believing that I was a lesbian But I digressI always found the boy to be aninteresting character He was that kind of douche who makes life hard for certain people always going around making fun of the girls and being a loud obnoxious nuisance A bro People like that always made me nervous and uneasy because by nature Im introverted Being social always sort of took something out of me if you will It would make me wonder how do people even get to be extroverts How can they do it I always joked that there was something sinister to it From my point of view I felt that extroversion has a selfish quality selfish yes but sinisterI was only kidding I just couldnt understand their casual blindly confident nature I was fundamentally differentThis extroverted character was the dude everyone else knew though I got to knowwell something elseAt first he was nice Too nice Im not stupid and besides I know how it goes I like girls too I knew he was trying for something I just kind of humored him for a while because hey free stuff from nice boy Occasional free food Free alcohol I put his obnoxious extroversion aside to be friendsHe took my virginity on my th birthday after we got really drunk I wasnt even angry I was using him tooWeeks go by and soon were having sex pretty regularly It wasnt great sex but at the time I was depressed I liked the warmth of another person Additionally he was a lot larger than me as in larger and a lot of upper body muscle not fat and I kind of liked that feeling of being almost entirely engulfed by another person This was only to a point though Once we were both entirely too high and he sort ofcollapsed onto me He just lay there I couldnt breathe He was heavy and I couldnt move him I just had to wait until he recoveredcame down from his high a bitThat was the last time I could remember before we both left at the end of the school year Over that summer I came to the conclusion that I would probably be better off not sleeping with him anymore but that either outcome would be acceptable Its not like I missed the sex very muchI guess neither of us got laid at all that summer because literally on arrival he came to my apartment again and we had sex Again So much for being able to do without it Honestly it just got really goodThat year he started coming over all the time even though it was difficult He moved out of my building and across the city It became kind of rushed and hasty sometimes half the time hed not even remove his socksIn this process of coming over and having to make use of the time he learned that I seem to enjoy rough sex though it was never really my idea Either way I became familiar with this version of him that no one saw I found it hilarious He was like a dumb animal Id always have to find creative ways to hide all the bites and scratches all over my neck and back and then go about my lifeAt school I would just ignore him This had its practical reason being inconspicuous but mostly I hated talking to him He was just flat out annoying I didnt even know how to talk to him When I would see him Id walk in the other direction I dont think he liked being ignored though Not five minutes after seeing him and avoiding him Id get texts asking if Im free later And usually Id say yes Sometimes Id get really strange texts though Once he wrote that he knew I was on the th floor because he could smell me first Lo and behold I showed up about a minute later according to him Thiswasnt all too creepy to me but only because I knew what it meant Personally my senses are pretty mute so I have only been able to identify the smell of two people in my whole life The first was my best friend who I was in love with in high school The second was a girl I fell for shortly before I got into this situation Similarly I could find both of them by smell first even before seeing them It is entirely a sexual thing and I knew itThis was anodd situation to say the least even from the beginning but certainly not a bad one At some point I think I got a little bit sexaddicted I would wake up soaking wet most mornings I found myself spacing out all the time Honestly I wanted nothing more than for him to stay over and have sex the whole night because somehow that had never happenedI asked him once or twice if he would but he would always act all dodgy about that question I didnt ask why I didnt particularly care given that his answer was no every time As it were he started getting kind of selfish though that had already been happening to some degree When wed hook up generally he would listen when I would tell him to ease up or slow down or what have you This was no longer the case and he just kindadid what he pleased So I dumped his assHe wasnt angry he didnt really react at all We pretty much disappeared from each others lives because well we werent exactly friends to begin with Not much to dumpI was still waking up soaking wet though Maybe not that weirdly being a gross  year old I just had to deal with it myself now and that was going okay I was kinda happy not to deal with this dweeb from school anymore So life was just pretty mundane Until the nightmaresActually I didnt know if they were nightmares but it would kinda go down like this I would hear things or hallucinate noises while I slept and occasionally awaken in the dream paralyzed to a crushing presence Whatever that presence was Id feel it embrace me but too tightly Sometimes Id dream hallucinate or maybe actually see for all I know my door open or that I had forgot to lock itId wake up with bruises sometimes Id wake up and find panties missing I was scared and my sleep schedule became irregular I know that the dudes who work the desk downstairs have keys to all the rooms and this was my initial theory to the missing stuff I started deadbolting my door and things stopped going missing Even so I set up a cameraI watched nights of footage sped up Nothing remarkable I was not surprised by my own actions occasionally Id flail about in my sleep and it explained to me the random bruising I would wake up with On one tape I saw something I never did end up slowing the footage down but it kind of resembled eyes They looked like a photo negative I just decided in my head that they were light reflections I mean really what else could it be Maybe I could get some sleep given that I was finally trying to use some logicI was continuing to have dreams about a presence in my room though it had morphed pretty much into just sexual dreams I would still have that weird crushed smothered sort of feeling sometimes but even so I wasnt scared anymore If anything it felt kind of comfortingId wake up with bruises still Sometimes even wake up feeling sore as if the sex were real I probably was flailing about in my sleep again I could have set up my camera again but I had already seen myself do it and I thought what would be the point of seeing it againAt least I could sleep even if Im too turned on all the time Ive always liked sleeping a lotI became kind of reclusive I stopped hanging out with people Sometimes Id skip class I must have been sleeping about  hours a day I wasnt really happy about this but hey Guaranteed vivid sex dreamsThat bring us to the present dayIm so tired I havent slept in four days The last few times I fell asleep I woke up wet again but wet with blood I am going to succumb to the lack of sleep sooner or later and when I do Im not going to wake up Its going to be the last timeI feel like Im going crazy Just sleep I think to myself Theyre just dreamsI now know that they arent dreams thoughI know because I managed to drag my sleepdeprived self to school the other day and I saw that kid I used to hook up with We walked past one another without saying hello but I looked back at him and he looked back at the same time making a blank sort of eye contact with meAnd then I realized something having made that eye contactI realized what I saw on the tapeI realized that I should never have asked him to stay the nightEdited for claritys sake,1385588753.0,Stay the

conspiracydebunker,10,13,1rjvg5,42,I work as a police officer in the eastern part of the Netherlands Me and my colleague Bert patrol the countryside during the weekends at night Nine out of ten nights are boring and nothing happens We might give some drunk guy a fine for riding his bike home without a light or catch a group of people drinking in publicWere always on the lookout for troublemakers Contrary to what you might think drunk people staggering around and being noisy are a low priority More worrisome are small groups of men who walk outside and carry large bags or cars that seem to drive with no particular destination in mindLast weekend something strange happened that still frightens me as I think back of it We had to drive to a neighboring village but road maintenance had blocked of our usual route We figured we would take a short route that goes directly through the local forest although it is unpaved and poorly lighted As I drove to the next village my colleague tapped me on the shoulder On the right side of the road ahead of us I could make out the silhouette of a figure As we drove nearer it seemed to me an old woman as the figure wore a long dark coat around knee length narrowed at the waist She did not seem in a hurry but rather appeared to walk at a timid pace understandably afraid of her surroundingsAfter catching up with the figure I slowed down our car and stopped by the side of the road Its not uncommon for us to encounter old people suffering dementia and wandering around in confusion at night However to my surprise I noticed in a glimpse that the figure was not an old woman but rather a young person aged  at mostThe person pretended not to notice us and continued walking My colleague yelled for them to stop and the person turned around I saw what appeared a very androgynous young person whose thin and elongated frame was accompanied by delicate facial features and pale skin I suspect it must have been a young man but all strong virile features expected of boys his age seemed absent in his demeanor and appearance Most peculiar of all was his clothing which reminded me more of a th century dandy than a modern day teenagerIt would be easy for me to dismiss this as one of the local goth kids playing hide and seek in a forest at night but I felt in my gut that something was different here I had never seen anything like this around here before and it seemed to my admittedly untrained eye as if all his clothing was authenticMy colleague asked him where he was headed I am just headed my own way The young man answered in a fearful voice I could tell from his accent that he was not from anywhere around here but I had difficulty placing it Do you need a ride out of here My colleague asked Nno but thank you He answered after slight hesitationMy colleague became visibly upset and asked him if hes aware that its illegal for him to wander here at night to which the boy gave no answer Alright thats enough I said and asked him for his ID Please do not bother me He answered to which I responded that he could either show his ID or spend the night behind barsWhy do you people always have to bother me He insisted again as he appeared to be on the verge of tears I noticed that his nose began to bleed apparently from the stress Look what you did He said as he held his hand against his nose before demonstratively holding up his bloody hand in front of himMy colleague then informed him that he was placed under arrest and patted him down for any weapons or ID but found nothing whatsoever except for a long hemp rope in his coats deep pockets which my colleague seized As the three of us entered the car and we began to drive I noticed that his bleeding did not seem to stop I handed him a box of tissues we store next to the drivers seat As I turn around to hand him the box of tissues I notice that the engine stopped running I grow nervous as I never have problems with this car Im forced to stop the car to try to restart the engine After a few attempts it works again as sudden as it stopped and I breathe a sigh of relief As I accelerate I look in my mirror and notice to my shock that our passenger has vanished Did you lock the doors I ask in shock to which my colleague answers in an aggressive but affirmative manner I stop the car but leave the engine running We both step outside We look around for what seems like eternity before realizing that neither of us at this point really dares to leave the vicinity of the car Alright lets get out of here My colleague states We both get back in the car in a hurry and Bert promptly declares I dont get paid enough for this crap to which I respond with a chuckle As we get back to driving I have a sudden realization Bert I begin in as calm of a voice as I manage Where did you keep the rope Bert slowly turns his head to look at me before answering Its in my pocket Could you check for me I ask him No He states in a firm manner Bert look in your pocket for me I repeat Bert opens his pocket and sticks his hand in Both of us are silent for a moment DRIVE DRIVE GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE He screams in horrorI hit the gas pedal Luck has it that the end of the unpaved forest road is nearby When the trees are far behind us and I notice the first other car I finally slow down By the time we get to the next village our second to last destination for the night my heart is still bouncing fast I only calm down when Im back at the police station and finally free to head home after saying Bert goodbyeThe next day after returning home I told my wife what had happened Do you think these kind of pranks are funny She responded in a visibly angry manner What do you mean I asked her After she calmed down she explained to me what upset her Apparently her greatgrandmother was of noble birth In a stack of papers she inherited she had read that her uncle had hanged himself on hunting grounds owned by his parents after being disowned by them because he had impregnated a girl The family sold the land to the government and even my wifes grandmother was told never to play in the forest as a child,1385528197.0,Why I hate the Night

grandmaslipboogers,19,14,1roaik,43,Hi rnosleep my name is Dave I am  Im gonna tell you about myself quickly okay I need you to know these things so you can understand my storyMy mom has more heart than brains and she loves me more than I deserve to be loved by anybody I gave her hell when I was younger and she has yet to yell at me My father used to beat the fuck out of her and while she defended herself she would clean and bandage his wounds when the fight was over And my father hes a different story I dont understand how a man this rough ever landed a woman as loving and delicate as my mother He was  erm is a big guy about  Slim as they come but with some muscle on him He was so strict For as long as I can remember he made me call him Dom which is his first name If I ever slipped up and called him Dad I would owe him anywhere between  and  pushups He said it was embarrassing I was not allowed out of the house if the sun was setting and certainly not when it was dark If he did not have the license plate number address and positive impression of the parents at whoms house I would be over I was to stay home If he did not have the drivers license number of my teacher I was not allowed on field trips He was just a very terribly paranoid person In fits of rage triggered by paranoia he would beat my mother and I while accusing us of betraying him He was also if you did not already assume a moderately heavy drinker Between  and  pints of brandy a day and always a tall can of beer or two between dinner and bedI rebelled Like all teenagers my age I rebelled fueled by pintup fury over the abuse that I took so quietly It was rough I did many weekends in detention centers for fighting and unnecessary petty crimes And eventually in the heat of all this I fell in love A beautiful girl Olive with an awesome singing voice and the same passion that I hadThree years ago I got Olive pregnant I was  Olive was  Her parents were mortified my mother was heartbroken but very serious about teaching me to be a father She was waking me up at all hours of the night with a sack of flour and a tape recorder playing a baby screaming telling me what the baby needed diaper change feeding cuddling whatever and then she would watch me do it only stopping the tape when I did it the right way She really whipped me into shapeMeanwhile I was not allowed by my father to see Olive The beatings were worse I was flunking school and skipping a lot to pick up extra shifts at work My father was furiousThen one day Olive went into labor When her and my daughter was almost ready to come out our parents came to wait in the living room I came out to update them only to be greeted immediately and startlingly by my drunken father He grabbed me by my shirt collar and motioned to Olives crying mother slurring Look what you did to this girls family This obviously caused a scene Everyone was getting upset Then for once my mother spoke upDom I do wish you were a sweeter man He let go and turned to her His arms went limp as he walked towards her She rose from her vinyl seat and he got reeeeal close to her face He said very slowly and very defeatedly A Sweeter Man He looked around at the people gathered in the room and nodded slowlyThen he walked out of the hospital There wasnt enough time for anyone to worry because just as he made his grand exit a nurse came out and told me that my daughter was readyIn less than an hour my mother was a grandmother and Olive was a mommy Our daughter Ava was born healthy and kickingMy woman and my girl changed my life I calmed and settled for them And now we actually have a house I keep Ava and Olive both happy and healthy And Im happy tooAnd as for my dad I never saw him again Nobody did except for my mother She was summoned to pick his body from the morgue a month after he disappeared They said he died of cardiac arrest that may or may not have been alcohol related and they found him on the side of an underpass two towns over But life went onThis year Olive and I hosted Thanksgiving We expected many guests but nobody expected Dom to show upCuriously enough Dom did show up He showed up completely sober and in great spirits My mother was upset and my aunt went home because she was petrified Everybody else was just thankful to see him Olive and I were both stunned and cautious When he showed up I took him outside to see if it was really him In his wallet he had my dads expired drivers license and all of his credit cards It was himDom ate dinner with us played with Ava mingled with the family and then left to go see his mother Olive and I watched him walk down the road hands in his pocketsI apologize for my typos and if this was scrambled Im on my second bottle of Sutter Home and Im honestly a little afraid I dont know what my next step should be or if hes going to come back or if that was even him at all My brain is racing Im just going to kill this bottle watch Ava sleep for a while and then watch a movie with OliveEDIT Good morning Reddit Its AM and today I am going to work until  While Im at work Im going to get Doms Moms ha number from my mom After work Im going to stop by the underpass that

Brodiche,28,14,1ra24j,38,The Eighth CrusadeOn the outskirts of the large city known as Canto a small cathedral stands unscathed by the horror happening not twenty miles away There were some smaller towns outside of the city but most of their residents fled as soon as the vague news reports of cannibalistic citizens came flooding in In the end those who were smart enough to run at the first sign of trouble were the only ones who made it the hesitant died along with the rest of the city However this small cathedral was different It was located in the middle of nowhere and had been long abandoned and forgotten by everyone aside from the city itself the closest town to it was almost an hour way and a small dirt road was the only thing that even hinted that there was another world past the miles and miles of flat plains The glow and black smoke from Canto can be seen in the distance  Short flashes of lightning filled the air just long enough to illuminate a figure on top of the cathedral his legs swung over the edge of the roof and head leaning against the lighting rod The faint glow of a cigar intensified as he put it to his mouth With a small grin played on his lips he gazed dreamily at the cityWhat a sight Obliteration has never looked so divine He whispered to himself Images of a crumbling Jerusalem played through his head Well I guess you cant get much more divine than thatFeeling a little foolish for talking to himself again he took one last drag of his cigar and flicked it behind him The man noticed that there was a thin layer of ash that had settled on to his body Slightly irritated by this the man glanced at his watch while getting to his feet ruffling his short black hair in an attempt to get as much ash off his head as possible His long black coat blew in the wind as he brushed it off The temperature was dropping fast it wouldnt be long until the rain began to pour The man wondered if it would be enough to quench the flames of the city The Vatican ordered complete destruction they wanted nothing standing of what they thought to be a heathen city The man wouldnt feel accomplished if the flames were so easily disposed of Glancing at his watch again figuring he had roughly another half hour before the he was picked up and debriefed He leaned back against the lightning rod and lit another cigar daydreaming of the day beforeOne bite one citizen and his work was done His mission was to just get the ball rolling nothing more Being as potent as he was his victims often became immensely strong They were puppets sure but also unstable The more of them that were roaming the streets the more dangerous the mop up was for the church The man was frustrated that he only got one snack he was tired of the left overs from corpses and the donations from Italian blood banks He was craving prey with more life to it one he could enjoy stalking before the killThe Vatican dispatched him and a helicopter to the abandoned cathedral Along with being the drop point the house of God was also were he was supposed to rendezvous with the evac crew His orders were to simply enter the city light the spark and watch God cleanse the Earth from the cathedral You zealots are no fun he would tell them Im doing Gods work for you lazy ass holes the least you could do is let me off the leashThe hungry man could not help but feel disappointed when they were offended They preached how the last crusade was such a failure due to the fact he had so much freedom the mobs of the powerful undead nearly completely consumed the Holy armyIt pissed him off that they never got over thatHe resolved that it was never really his fault humans were frail weak creatures They are easy to corrupt in every way None of them could handle the thirst and they tore everything apart Turning their victims into for lack of a better word zombies The Pope himself preformed the unnecessary but ritualistic blessing before he set offVai quarto Locke e fornire i nostri nemici a DioDeliver them I shall He sarcastically whispered to himself with a smirk The helicopter was taking off it was time to go to workLocke could not stop thinking about his one victim regardless of whom it was he planned to savor every last second of his feastThe man found himself seeking a challenge In the back of his mind he knew he wouldnt get one but the fantasy of a dangerous prey kept his thoughts occupied as he made his way towards the glistening city With the pace he was traveling at it wouldnt be long before reached the edge of Canto his long strides covered more distance faster than a highend sports car going ninety on an open freeway The cool night air was refreshing to him its not often he is allowed to roam out in the open like this He slowed down a bit to prolong this finite feeling of freedomBeing cooped up under Vatican City for so long had begun to take its toll on Lockes sanity Other than living off nothing but the scraps of Roma he had no real connection to the outside world Its not like he longed to live amongst the humans no the thought of that made him sick The only reason he could stand the Men of God back at the Vatican was because they were as far away from human as possible Hes seen them put on human masks sure seen them absolve the masses with a crooked smile seen them preach peace and the word of God to a thousand ignorant faces No no behind their masks they are every bit a monster as LockeThe city was drawing closer massive sky scrapers were lit up in a brilliant fashion A sense of intrigue radiated from surrounding smaller clusters of lights What were the humans doing at this hour Were they working overtime tucking the children in late night binge drinking at the local bar They were all so very ignorant of the malevolent fury of God that was about to rain down upon them Sure it looked pretty from a distance but Canto was the antithesis when viewed up close The Vatican made it clear to Locke that this was not a city that deserves pity even though he never considered giving it anyways he asked to be briefed on the citys situationCanto was dying almost all whove entered abandoned all hope for it when they saw what a hell hole it has become Corruption plagued the citys central government all of the representatives power focused on how to make the wealthy more capable of shitting on the poor As a result crime was abundant Drug trafficking prostitution child labor plagued the down town streets Whole families were often caught in cases of indentured servitude as the wealthy put it where even the children would have to be at the beckon call of the privileged doing strenuous and dangerous work that led to more than a few deceased children Anyone who cried foul ended up dead too it was just the way it went And it was reason enough to cleanse itLocke reached the edge of Canto he could now hear the grumbling sounds of the suffering city a siren blared unceasingly somewhere among the throngs of buildings Looking at his watch the man whispered to himselfTime to light the matchUpon entering the city Locke found to his disappointment that there was no shortage of easy prey The homeless aimlessly wandered the streets practically half dead already prostitutes looking vulnerable as ever He was slightly surprised however to find a couple of security guards having a smoke outside of a large ominously lit building A young woman dressed in rags stumbled past them she was appeared very exhausted and in need of medical care The guards just looked upon her and laughed asking the woman unrepeatable questions When she didnt respond to their cat calls one of the men grew frustrated and ran after her She let out a quick yelp of pain as he put his cigarette out on the back of her neckIn a very swift motion the girl whirled around grabbing the guards wrist and pulling him close The mans face was within an inch of hers his expression showed that of pure pain She had broken his wrist In a split second she revealed a small revolver put it to the mans chin and pulled the triggerThere was a bright flash then a spray of crimson red The mans body crumpled to the newly painted sidewalk with a softball sized hole where his skull used to be The woman was already on the other guard before he was done unhooking the strap to his sidearm Landing knees first on the guards chest she pinned him to the ground Grabbing a firm hold of her preys head with both hands she lifted up his skull and brought it back down to the concrete Over and over again she did this until the guard was pulverized into the sidewalkIt was all over that quickly She stood up without a sound her face expressionless except for a small smirk that crept on the edge of her lips she bent over to pick up her revolver that lie next to body of the first guard She shot Locke a quick glance and disappeared around the corner While the look she gave him was quick it was more than enough to excite him She had piercing brown eyes that screamed strength and short dirty black hair that was almost just long enough to veil her left eye Locke knew her just by that single short glance He knew her struggles knew her strength and knew her will to surviveHe knew he had found his preyThe building the two guards were once protecting let out the piercing wale of an emergency siren snapping Locke out of his mystified state It was then he noticed the streets were completely empty not a piece of human filth to be seen Whoever the guards were protecting called for backup and he had mere minutes to escape A thought crossed his mind and made him almost consider revealing himself to the approaching authorities before pounding them into dust Not wanting to risk compromising the mission Locke reluctantly retreated into a dark alley way He scaled his way to the roof tops from there and began the hunt for his new found prey The mystery womans scent was still live and growing stronger as he strides across the apartment building rooftops Lockes mind wandered back to the two guards how efficiently and violently she dispatched them Two full grown armed men could not handle the slender girl half their size Where can a human learn to kill like that Without mercy or emotion just pure unadulterated instinct After searching for a short time he came across her entering a dimly lit liquor store only to return moments later with a bag clenched in her fist The hunger was starting to get to him it was a ravenous gnawing that made his whole body tremble with anticipation He knelt down on one knee and gazed down at her from the roof tops Across the street from where Locke sat perched he saw her lean against a brick wall and begin chugging whatever was in the paper bag Locke felt his heart sink he had to stop her quickly or that alcohol will kill all the fun What was the fun in feeding from intoxicated prey He let out a small sigh and leapt off the building and descended to the street below The woman let out a small yelp as Locke landed safely in front of her A small cloud of dust and filth from the city escaped from under his feet leaving a small clear circle around where he landedFor a moment she just stared at him as he rose to his feet Only a dim street light illuminated the empty street the only thing she could make of the man was a pair of piercing red eyes that glowed like the moonThere is something magnificent about the moment you make yourself known to your prey spoke the man His voice had a crisp raspy tone to it full of anticipation and a hint of sensualityThe womans eyes widened at this not out of fear however it was more like she just received a jolt of electricity the grip on her bottle tightened She put on a smirk and spoke with an authoritative tone  Listen Ive had a long day I already have had to deal with two assholes today she lifted her hands almost defensively to reveal that they were caked with dried blood I caved both their heads in before they learned their place maybe I should take my time with you so I can really make a statement around hereThe man cocked his head a bit to the side at this threat amused and intrigued by her intensity He opened his arms wide as if to bow and took a step forward The woman reacted quickly and swung the bag at Lockes head The sharp crash of the class mixed with the sound of cracking bone traveled all the way down the street The woman expected the perfect stranger to be on the ground bleeding begging for his life like she has seen so many other men do However the man was still standing Aside from a small shard of glass that was lodged in the left side of his face he was completely unfazed by the vicious attack Locke licked his lips as the remaining alcohol from the bottle trickled down his faceHmm Im not much of a whisky man I prefer a more  he paused for a moment as he watched the panic in his prey begin to rise  exotic spirit He began to chuckle to himself in all reality the whole situation was darkly humorous to him This is the most pain hes been in in years and that is saying something His chuckle escalated to a howling laughterThe woman wore a look that held a combination of shock and excitement Even though she was beginning to panic a smile spread across her face Not once in her entire time in Canto has she met a man who could last more than  minutes in fight with her much less one who could so easily brush off a whisky bottle to the headShe watched as the mans laughter grew his bloodshot eyes screamed madnessIts time to put you down you crazy sonofabitch she said with a smile She slowly removed the revolver she used to kill the security guard the aged blood glistened in what little light was available The sight of the gun just seemed to incite a stronger laughing fit out of Locke The woman extended her arm and placed the barrel of the gun into the mans open mouth and pulled the triggerAgain there was a quick flash His head snapped back with full force but he remained on his feet never ceasing his laughter that grew into the howling of a demon He lowered his head fixing his blood red eyes on the womanHe was able to stop his laughter long enough to respond to the horrified look on his preys face Whats the matter baby doll You seemed surprised you cant dispatch me as easily as those two security guards Locke began to laugh again Honey they are nothing compared to a true monster     Locke took one last look at his victim then opened his jaws to reveal several sharp teeth The hole left by the bullet can be clearly seen as he made the final move on his prey                           The man wiped his mouth and looked down at his meal The womans eyes were glossed with fear but there was an eerie smile that still crept on her lips as she stared blankly into the night sky Locke allowed the womans essence to dissolve and flow throughout his body Fresh blood from a living victim holds a piece of that persons life and personality Anyone who takes that essence inherits a part of that persons life All their thoughts feelings information becomes a part of the predators body and soul Veronica He whisperedThe womans body began to violently shake She was beginning to reanimate Locke felt a slight pang of worry in the back of his mind A human of her caliber would be a serious threat as a vampire everything about her will be augmented and enhanced Locke looked back at the shaking body Give those zealots hell for me VeronicaTurning around he began to make his way to the edge of the city the sun was going to be rising soon it was in his best interest to get back to the Cathedral as fast as he can He had lit the match Canto will be devoured by flames by tomorrow night Locke finally said with a smile                                The enveloping darkness cascaded across the night sky Leaving the silhouettes of clouds drift overhead like veils of moving sentinels suffocating the very light out of the stars The scent of moisture and smoke hung thick in the air The sound of distant thunder boomed across the sky echoing into the midnight horizon A light from below slightly illuminated the world trails of thick black smoke were dressed in the light painted on by miles of inferno It was as if the gates of hell opened under the earth releasing and delivering throngs of angels utmost nightmares unto Gods domain The pounding hearts of a million terrified saints could be heard as the sky boomed again Below the heavens true evil incarnate devoured the world Sky scrapers wore flames from head to toe fire danced on the water under decimated bridges streets were in chaos destroyed vehicles littered the crowed avenues Exposed hands and limbs peek out from under of overturned cars burning corpses are contorted in horrible positions behind the wheel of their tombs Police stations show no sign of life a constant siren blares somewhere in the city with nothing living left to answer The city its souls everything was devoured by chaosWell almost everything,1385199684.0,The Eighth Crusade,52,nosleep,top_week
jdpatric,7,13,1rird0,38,I was told that this would fit well here I have a few more and one recent that Ill try to post up as well Sorry for the wall of textI lived in Pennsylvania until I was one month shy of being  I know that exact date because you had to be  to hunt in PA and I was looking forward to it Anyways we moved to Florida and I get to hunt down here too so thats OKI had a few good friends that lived right down the street from me We lived out in the country My address was literally   Road Middle of nowhere So wed hang out at my buddies place or wed go up this hill for about half a mile until we reached the burn pile and cabin at the topIt really was a basic cabin Outhouse No lights Nothing Wed hang out there use it as a fort for Nerf battles manhunt CTF etc Well one night my friend invited a few of his friendscousins up to the cabin so we could roast marshmallows and play manhunt There were something like  of us to start but the number slowly went down to  by nightfall So we played manhunt  vs  in the dark Around  pm we were in the middle of a game and two of my friends had hung back with me because we were the fast ones We realized that there were only three of us left on our team and that we hadnt captured anyone from their team We tried to make a jailbreak and lost my friend Well call him F It was just myself and another friend that well call L L and I were  yards from the other team and they had  of our  players now in their jail They began to press our side more and mess with us until one of them told us we were cheating L and I looked at each other unable to figure out why Our side had about  of it covered heavily in trees The other side was about the same with both wooded areas near the back of the sidesAt one point when we were chasing someone off our side I saw L and I running in the same direction and someone on the other side of L I quickly cut behind L and intended to surprise the other person and nab them on our side I was probably the fastest person there and I didnt want to be on the team to capture nobody Once I emerged from behind Ls trajectory we were both running I saw absolutely no one Nothing no trees no scarecrow absolutely nothing that I could have mistaken for a personI surmised that there had to be someone from the other team hiding behind our lines waiting for us to cross over and then tag us there Well the game ended up dwindling down to us with two left and the other side with  We capped one person and then all parties were exhausted I asked the other team mostly Ls cousins who was behind the line waiting to cap us No one claimed responsibility I figured it was someone trying to mess with usBack at the cabin we start cooking hot dogs and marshmallows over a fire We were all ish with one person being maybe  older cousin so we were drinking soda and not beer Note If this had been beer and Id been older Id just chalk this up to booze All  of us are around the fire when we saw someone coming up the hill Its hard to see outside in teh dark when youve been staring at a fire for a while but at least  of us had seen the person so we figured it was one of the people who left coming back or someone new After about half an hour no one came up We went and looked and found no one Being the intelligent young kids we were we decided to investigate further Its summer after  am and were out playing with fire and flashlights looking for a mystery person Yeah we were not honor students We went to the path that led down the hill and could clearly see my friends house in the distance they left the outside lights on for the dogs and no one in between Someone was trying to mess with the group so they ran into the woods and came out directly on top of us scaring the crap out of everyone After we all changed our pants and regrouped we headed back to the cabin only to see someone on the very far side of the clearing There were three of us with flashlights and all of us attempted to illuminate this person but we were too far away to get a good look as soon as we lit himher up heshe disappeared into the woodsOK then now a few of us are freaking out Six people decide to go down to my friends house to spend the rest of the night where the ax murderer from hell wont be able to get them Since they have  and the  of us who decided to rough it are only  the group of  got two flashlights I was the only one left with oneWe decided to figure out who this was L had an uncle who was only  years older than him who we figured was just fucking with us We knew his place was less than a mile from where we were big extended family large family plot of land L Fone of Ls cousins gonna call him C and myself began to walk across the clearing Once we were about  feet from the edge of the woods we could hear someone moving around in the brush Not stomping or anything but very carefully moving through the fallen sticks and underbrush trying to make as little noise as possible We figured it was Ls uncle well refer to him as Uncle JSo we split up again and two people waited in the clearing F and Ls cousin and myself and L went into the woods to try to flush out Uncle J We figured F and C could see OK from the clearing and to be honest they actually could L and I eventually were about  feet INTO the woods further than we thought wed need to go when we heard this low rumble noise This is one of those times when I regretted trying to act macho L and I kinda looked at each other to make sure it was neither of us rumbling and basically just stopped dead in our tracksI shined the flashlight up in the direction of the noise directly away from the clearing and the fire and couldnt see anything There was just nothing there It was to this day one of the most eerie noises Ive ever heard Like a noise a Halloween decoration would have made but real We stayed about  feet into the woods never venturing much further in and searched the general area Never found anythingAfter about half an hour of this its now past  am we heard a noise just at the edge of the clearing and both of us turned around I had expected it to be F and C coming to figure out what the fuck was taking us so long But instead I see one person basically hiding halfway behind a tree looking at us Ive never not wanted to shine my flashlight on something before that moment If it was dark I wanted to see what it was But in the distance well past the shadowy character I could see F and C milling about by the fire I had this awful feeling that there was no way Uncle J was being this creepy I didnt want to see who it was and I really just wanted to get away from this person I mean the hair on the back of my neck stood straight upL must have seen it too because he started slowly backing FURTHER into the woods We moved in as wide a circle as we could around this shadowy person and managed to make it back to the clearing We got back to the cabin and grabbed F and C and began to make our way back to Ls place When we were about  yards from the cabin we heard its door slam and we fucking boltedWhen we made it back to Ls house near the bottom of the hill we debated what to do should we call  Was that a trespasser Or was that simply a family member messing with us L went to notify his parents who we figured would be overjoyed at the premise of being woken up around  am by a bunch of sweaty terrified  year olds They werent home Apparently Ls grandfather had a heart attack around  pm None of us had cell phones as it was  and so no one had been notified except for Ls  year old step cousin I never really figured out this relationship TBH who had drank himself near blackout drunk as soon as the adults left him in charge of all the younger kids up at the cabin Seriously he got reamed the next day by basically every adult in attendance That meant that uncle J and basically every other of Ls family members who could have been messing with us were at the local hospital with the patriarch of the family whod had a mild coronaryAt  am we knew sleep wasnt an option and began to watch and wait for the shadow guy to show up at the bottom of the hill Less than  minutes later I hear a sound coming from upstairsonly problem istheres no upstairs to Ls house Theres something someone on the roof L grabs his pellet gun cause thats going to be super effective and we go outside cause you know were smart and stuffWe shine ever flashlight straight up at the roof and see a completely black silhouette jump off the far side of the house in a mad sprint The way Ls roof was shaped the part he it jumped off of was over  high there was a huge vaulted ceiling in the back room of the house and the roof was even taller to accommodate for the attic We watched it run away from the hill and towards the creek  wide maybe  deep and we followed it until we realized how much faster it was than usOnce it reached the edge of the creek it stopped and looked back at us This rumble thing came back and it jumped the creek and we lost itThe next day we told Ls parents and they informed us that the cabin was being torn down A cow had been killed and dismembered IN THE FUCKING CABIN early that morning presumably after we left It could have been a panther cows werent uncommon on that part of the property but they tended to avoid the people it could have been a bear but fuck we never went back up that hill at night No way no how Never saw that thing again Might not seem like much but to  year old meI had a new face for fear,1385498927.0,The woods of Pennsylvania,51,nosleep,top_week
youngsterjose,3,13,1rd8lb,34,My mother once told me a story her sister had an encounter with the paranormal that eventually lead to her suicide this is that storyMy mother had a sister once I remember my earliest memories of her she was always so depressed and I always asked why was she sad She never had an answer My mother told me it all started one night when she came home from work She was walking the streets around midnight heading home when she noticed a man walking behind her It wasnt the first time she had been followed by this man Only difference was this time he tried to talk to my aunt He asked are you happy with your family arent you tired of living in a house of religious fools She was scared and asked who are you and my mother told me as soon as he stepped out of the shadows my aunt saw his face he looked rather normal except for his long hair and ember red eyes He smiled and said your people call me the devil and she started to run She ran as fast as she could Eventually my aunt got the house of my mother and she explained what happened My mother tried to calm her down my aunt was breathing heavily and could not control herself Soon enough she passed outA few days pass by and my mother sees that my aunt has a serious problem She didnt go to work for about a week and she felt as if she was not safe at my mothers house So she moved back to my grandmothers house They were extremely religious and for some reason my aunt felt safe at her house The same night she moved back in to her mothers house something happened that drove her into being institutionalized It was around  in the morning and my grandfather and grandmother were fighting My aunt knew she was awake because she could see her mother she was in the kitchen and she was looking through the crack in the door she suddenly felt something brush up against her arm Her breath taken away her eyes wide open she turns around and sees the man claiming to be the devil He says tell me whats wrong I know I know somethings wrong let me take you away from all your troubles she screamed as loud as she could until her mother and father came into the room they turned on the lights and she kept staring at the empty space next to her bed My grandmother started yelling at her are you crazy do you have any idea how late it is why are you screaming she kept going and going until my aunt finally screamed the devil hes after me mom my grandmother was religious still is but for some reason she did not believe my aunt and they put her away in a hospital for about a month or twoWhile in the hospital my aunt told my mother what she saw in there They had to put her on several medications before she stopped seeing the man Every now and then she would try to fall asleep in the hospital while the man watched she said she heard him bragging you know theyll never believe you or you know they cant see me When the lights went out she closed her eyes She could hear his threats she could hear him mocking her life She always kept her eyes closed she did not want to see his silhouette even less his ember red eyes She described him as a physical being yet at the same time he did not exist At some points she thought she was arguing with herself until she realized the voice was overlapping her voice her thoughts She had nightmares almost every night in that hospital Around  month goes by in there and she pretends to be fine they let her out a week or so later My mom did not hear of her for about  months after she got out of the hospital My mother was worried and she sent out search parties she called cops Yet she never found her Turns out she was hiding in the woods She didnt want see anyone my aunt told my mother that she never gave in I dont know the way my mom told me I can only assume she was lying She told me how she lived in the woods for a few months living off whatever she could find She explained to my mother how he never left her side he was always there talking to her he did not want to let her go My mother told me that the last thing my aunt told to her was something this man the devil said to my aunt  i want you she ended up killing herself a week after She was weak and brittle and was basically a walking corpse A few members of the family came to her funeral not many though thats what my mother told me My grandmother did not go She was embarrassed of her daughter and the fact that she killed herselfA few months later after the funeral my mother gets off work around pm its still light out so she thinks why not visit my sister she needs it so she walks to the cemetery It was almost sunset and my mother told me she sees a man placing flowers on her gravestone My mother has never seen this man before and she starts running towards him as he walks away she starts running faster He disappears into the woods and just before he did he looked back and my mother saw his ember red eyes She told me some things in this world happen that cant be explained and that was one of those things,1385324165.0,My Aunt,47,nosleep,top_week
ultrafilthy,14,24,1rpa86,36,No sleep No mother FUkInG sleep Im not trying to address the readers here Im describing the past few days Wait Weeks Wait Months Im describing the past few months of my life BackgroundIm living in Asia right now doing a three month internship I attend a particular university in the US im american that requires  internships upon getting a degree Students can go anywhere they want as long as they get an internship in their field of study Why did I choose Asia To get as far away as possible from what happened to me in the US From what I saw From what I may have caused That being said Ill begin my story Two years ago I was hanging out with some friends What I call my crew I wont name anyone because its not important Instead ill describe our communal interests There are five of us that make up the core crew My brother a information systems student a fashion student an electronic media student a philosophy student who is into djing and producing music and a city planning student me We are all generally creative people and we like to collaborate on ideas events art projects or what have you We build off each others inspiration For example one time we threw a fashion show at a bar in the downtown area of where we live I brought art to the picture the fashion kid brought the clothes the other three brought a unique style of music atmosphere We like to do things in the public eye Often this leads us to do online promotion of our events Nothing too crazy you know Facebook invites and that type of stuff This leads me to another common interest of ours The internet The internet is amazing Everyone here knows it Upon the thousands of uses it has our crew tends to use it for inspiration There is a grab bag of sites we all pull inspiration from One being chan Okay I know this is reddit and its a constant war between the two communities but seriously there is a lot of good content on chan After you filter through the dicks Car Parts and gore that is chan was not in my personal queue of sites to check everyday untill the fashion design kid sent me a link to a thread with really wild art work With my interest immediately sparked I go to the link and of course the thread ed I feel like I dont have to explain this but threads  on chan after they go idle for a short period of time and everything in the thread is lost I said fuck it cut my loss and closed the link After a few days my friend told me I really missed out and if I go back and request the thread someone might post the pics I do as told Got called a nigger faggot Lame Regardless I decide to browse b and see whats good I ended up seeing why people go to b and frequently returned over the next few months until I finally understood all the humor and inside jokes Hooked at that point I would log onto b before I would even check my email Because its an awesome site After class on day I get home go to b and see a TOR thread Most of you know by know what TOR is but I doubt you have explored it Even if you have gone in have you really gone deep No probably not PM me if interested though I got the good links Seeing this I decided to explore it because why not Keep in mind this was about  years ago Thus the silk road Snowden bitcoins and all that were not popping up on the front page of reddit everyday I have a naturally curious mind so I got really into this whole deep web thing and pretty much dedicated all my free time to it This really wasnt easy It takes a lot of time to filter through all the bull shit dead links avoid Cheese Pizza and not get hacked Fast forward one year If your keeping track I said this started two years ago spent  months on b and one year on TOR So thats  months before I fled to Asia At this point I got passed layer one of the deep web This took the ability to learn and find the software on hidden in TOR that allows you do to do Layer one was pretty much mild Yes there were hit men drugs and mild porn Layer two is where things begin to get weird Going to layer two I started to find the dark side of the dark net In short snuff Im not talking creepy pasta snuff im talking pictures and videos I may sound sick but I was interested in this It wasnt for fap material if youre wondering I am interested in this because if I hear something exists I need to see to believe The snuff videos I saw were generally low quality and had their fair share of errors By this I mean I could not reaaaallly tell if the vids were real I thought it might just be people with somewhat good special effects and props reducing the quality of their videos and making things seem real Dont get me wrong though Some of it was real for sure But some seemed to unbelievable to think humans would do such things Three guys one hammer doesnt even hold a light to this shit After seeing what my stomach could handle I was ready to leave Till I saw a strange link All weird tech TOR shit aside This was my path to layer three The bad stuff The new born hurt core stuff Twisted I know but I had to go to see if humans could be that sick in the head What I saw I can not forget and I do not recommend This stuff was bad Simply bad After seeing a certain video containingwelllets just say I closed my computer took a long cold shower staring at the wall and could do nothing after but take a xanax and go to bed Waking up the next day I immediately thought about what I saw I go back to my compute and remembered I forgot to close TOR I open it try to close it and I cant Every time I move my mouse to the close button it goes the opposite direction wutjpg After five minutes of trying this I say fuck it and power down that SOB and assume restarting it everything will be closed Wrong So wrong I opended my computer and a txt program was opened with a bunch of text I read it and took a huge dry gulp Everything personal on my computer was in this box My adress bank stuff personal notes everything My first thought was NO ive been hacked Wrong again I tried to use the mouse and it worked fine except with the problem of not being able to close TOR I was able to use everything else I open google chrome and do some searching for a key stroke logger I figured if I can download and install it maybe I could find what program or phising code whoever did this was using and I could undo the mess I got the logger and installed it Now the waiting game I didnt do anything once it was installed and just sat and watched If any thing was done I would know it was not me I put the logger window next to the window that had all my personal information so I could see both windowsAfter a period of wait something happened Someone hit the enter key   The thing is the key logger didnt tell me this I could only tell because  of a shift in the txt window a bit later a new paragraph begins on the txt box Could not copy it but it looked like thisrgsdvsssssssssssllwatchingandwaitingda fuq i thought I look over to the key logger and only one letter appeared The letter J No idea whats going on I keep watching  more lines go by similar to the one above Each one caused only one letter to appear on the key logger after about  more lines nothing happens The key logger looks something like jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth Fuck this I thought and leave my computer For the record I froze all my bank information and important accounts because of potential theft I had been away from my computer for three days when all the sudden I had a thought TOR links at level one start out onion from there they get stranger and stranger I go back to my computer and move the mouse to the jfjfjtrxxxxdffgdth and it changes color from black to grey indicating a link I clicked that shit Yeah it was stupid But I really had no option whipe my drive clean and start all new accounts or see if I can get to the bottom of this Clicking the link brought my to a new window In tiny deep red letters it said my real name I clicked it All the sudden my computer goes black hhhhhhhhhhhhh this is where it happens I just got wicked chills The computer goes from black to matrix style green zeros and ones flying doen the screen Slow at first then fast Then faster Then faster Then A photo of me One that I have never taken One that was in a place where I have never been It was a photo of me standing there with my hands behind my back in a abandoned where house Looking at it freaked me the fuck out till Only three or four seconds passed till my head moved in the photo It looked left two seconds later my head turned back and slowly turned to the right Wait This wasnt a picture this is a video Right then and there I decided I had enough Whoever was trying to play a sick game with me was going to loose because I was not having it I stood up I picked up that computer and I smashed it I smashed it good It was a cheap computer I got off ebay that I used to play around with Not my main CPU At that point I felt better because I had released aggression But the thought of what I saw could not leave my mind I tried to tell my friends but they simply would not take me seriously Cops Yeah right no point Parents Nope not going to bother them They wouldnt give me two words before they would stop believing me After the smashing I didnt use any computer for a few days I tried to shake it off and eventually did A few weeks passed and I forgot Until a dream hit me I was sleeping as usual and I had a dream of the video Except I wasnt watching the video I was in the video It started just like I described earlier I was standing there hands behind the back looking left then right To the left dusty old factory walls to the right same After looking right I looked down and brought one of my hands in front of me and stared at it Red Blood red This freaked me so bad I woke up screaming and did not sleep the rest of the night The next day I was shaken but continued life That night I Tried my hardest to not sleep but I couldnt help it and passed out No dreamsRelief The next two weeks had no dreams I began to forget everything Shortly after in class one day I was making a model of and had to cut some foam core with an exacto knife I was cutting along till a kid accidentally bumped me and a got a small cut on my hand I looked at it and there was only a little bit of blood Hardly did any damage The kid who bumped me said oh shit sorry man are you okay I looked up to my right to tell him its nothing but I could only see a dusty factory wall I looked to my left and saw the same I looked down and saw my hand covered in bloodThe kid put his hand on my shoulder and I snapped out of it you alright dude yeah im fine im going to go wash it I went to the bathroom washed it And just left and went home I got to my room and sitting on my bed was that mother fucking computer still smashed into pieces Okay reddit here is what makes my story different I didnt see this and ignore it I saw that shit and I turned right around and left the house I wasnt about to be all investigative and demon hunting on this I noped right the hell out of there and got in my car and started driving I didnt know what has happening but I did not care I just drove It took me about two hours and a refilled gas tank to get my shit together Pretty much I just drove on the highway randomly When I got back to my neighborhood I didnt go home I went to my brothers house I called him up and just asked if he wanted to kick it Of course he did so I went it He tossed me a beer and looked at me you alright yeah just tired from studying mass ya hear me fool chea drink that beer though and you be alright word lets watch eastbound and down There was no way I was going to tell him I could hardly understand what happened let along vocalize it Fast forward a few hours and I passed out on his couch The dream started again Same story but the new event was after I looked down at my hand I looked up I saw myself Not in a mirror I saw myself standing there in the exact same position except my arm on the me I was looking at started to come out from behind my back Thats when I woke up I woke up to being thrown into the wall by my brothers roommate I had been told my brother was sleeping and I sprinted up stairs to his room and started pulling him by the arm With more strength than normal Retard strength He freaked out yelling and I guess his roommate came in saw us and threw me off into the wall My brother said my eyes were closed the whole time and in the end he chalked it up to some sleep walking shit He was pretty pissed and we didnt really kick it for a week Regardless After that happened that day I went home and I was going to grab that broken computer mess and burn that shit Oh yeah I was going to burn it to pure ash Nothing bizarre ever happened in my life till all this started I wasnt able to put any sense together so I was just going primal mode I got home Stormed to my room and there it was But Back in its pre smashed condition The screen was black but powered on right after I saw it Sorry Will write part two later Have to do some stuff right now,1385717996.0,TOR,60,nosleep,top_week
WILLingtonegotiate,12,11,1rdxhm,31,Well to start things off I have a hard time convincing myself that any of this is supernatural Just extremely weird somewhat scary It may be due to the fact I worry about my families safety more than anything Well I will start from the beginningWe moved into our new home around the end of August We resettled here in San Antonio due to my wifes employer requiring her to live here  I say new home because it is just that a NEW home The neighborhood is new as well All the homes are brand new the oldest being around a year old We love the area Awesome neighbors rural setting though stores still within walking distance We know absolutely nobody in this town so we have pretty much stuck to ourselves in the short time here so far We live in a  bedroom house with our three childrens rooms upstairs and my wife and myself sleeping in the master bedroom downstairs Our room is literally  feet from the front door I say this because my story revolves quite a lot around that very front door  Around our third night in the new home is when it started DINGDONGGGGGG The second part of the doorbell sound was separated by about  seconds I dont know why I find that eerie   DINGDONGGGGGG DINGDONG DINGDONG DINGDONGThese three were quite rapid taps on the doorbellI must have woke on the first ring but did not quite have my mind working yet much less my body I open my eyes and hear the long drawn out sound of the doorbell being pressed firmly Then three rapid taps My room is completely dark only lit by the blue lights of the alarm clock This same clock showed me at this moment it was  am Wtf I thought I immediately started fidgeting in my drawer for my handgun its a Glock  with an extremely bright light attached just under the barrel It would be quite handy in a few minutes  I grab a magazine slide it in and chamber a round With a flick of the switch the super bright beam illuminates my room and my clear path to the front doorAs I sleepily stumble my way to the front door I hear another rapid ring of the doorbell followed by a deep loud booming knock  I check through the peephole and can make out the top of a mans head as if he were leaning on the door listening for any type of movement coming from within my house I place my weapon on the door around where I figure this persons head to be and I speakWho is it I shoutedMy question was greeted by only what I can describe as the loudest silence I had ever felt wash over meAgain I shout Who is itAnd I hear him for the first timeIts me Daniel replied the dry calm yet exhausted voice of the man outside my door I do not know a Daniel I replied sternly What do you want I askedIve been left here I do not know where I am and I just need a place to sleep Replied the oddly calm voice just inches away from the barrel of my gunYou have  seconds to leave my property or I will shoot you where you stand I said this with a very loud and booming command In retrospect this seems harsh and I am not proud of it It was after am and I was worried for the safety of my family I mean no good person would do this type of thing to a stranger rightI start to count  just then I look out the peephole and no one is there  the  was noticeably quieter than the previous two in the countdown I have a bathroom just off the foyer and its window has a clear view of the front door  I peer out of it no one there I think to myself okay he got the point Oh shit what if he didnt and this asshole is now taking revenge on my wifes car or worse my baby truck I decided I would need to go outside against my inner monologue telling my white ass to stay insideI enter my room to grab my shoes and got a shock as my wife broke the silenceYou are not going outside after that She exclaimed She must have heard the entire thingDo you want this asshole screwing with our cars I askedI could care less you are NOT going out there She again rattled offBaby go back to sleep I will be fine I assured herI get my shoes on go to the front door and that is when I saw something so  simple yet extremely terrifying The door had been unlocked this whole time I do not know why but this had a huge effect on my nerves at the moment that it was noticed I check the bathroom window once again a quickly snap open the front door while sweeping every bit of the front porch with the barrel of my weapon the beam from its attached light painting my yard as if it were the broadest brush in the pale Nothing I step outside and onto the wet grass I check the side yard closest to my door and then start towards the driveway The vehicles looked fine as I could see them clearly due to the very bright street lamp illuminating my driveway No sign of Daniel I start to check the other side of my home when I hear it Thinking of it right now sends chills all the way down my body Im right here Replied Daniel in a scratchy but clear whisperThis was so chilling at the time that I could not bring myself to turn around right away It felt as if he were inches from me Right behind me staring I feel a little embarrassed to say it took quite a lot of courage to turn around but when I did I was surprised Daniel had not been directly behind me but about twenty feet away sitting on the curb beside my driveway facing away from me His silhouette small and twig like There was a lot of light coming from the street light across the street yet he seemed strangely dark As if he were able to escape the lights grasp ever so slightly I remedied this with the light beaming from beneath my pistol When I illuminated him it was not what I was expecting Maybe my being terrified at the moment had me thinking irrationally I was expecting an old bearded ghost of a man waiting for me to peer into his cold dead eyes only to grasp my soul and rip it out through my throat I know too many movies right This was a noticeably unkempt young man but not dirty more of a grungy type of look going on He was wearing a vertically striped orange and green striped tight fitting sweater he was african american and seemed to be in his early twenties He sat there seemingly in no hurry to turn around and greet me legs stretched out into the street hands placed palm down stretched out behind him fingers noticeable grasping at the blades of grass between them What do you need I rattle off with an understandably shaky voiceOnly what I asked for He replied again way too calm for the situation I suggest you get up and move on before I call the police I say I crinfe now thinking of how I reacted to this young man That will be fine would you do that for me would you call them for me He spat back as he peered slowly over his right shoulder at me his eyes closed tight seemingly due to my extremely bright light beaming into the back of his headSure do you fucking realize how close you were to being shot man I askWhy on earth would you shoot me I could have walked into your home without ever knocking right He said this the way a mother would say it to her child when revealing she knew a secret the child thought nobody knewAlright move the FUCK on dude NOW I shouted but noticeably terrified nowHe rose to his feet seemingly in one movement Turned to me his hand stretched out as to block the beam of light so he could open his eyes and look at me He opened his eyes which were noticeably bloodshot and just looked at me staring as if he were asking me to lower the light which I did As I did this he showed me his hands first palm then the back of his hands like a magician would when assuring his audience he had nothing up his sleeves He brought his hands to his face and covered it while rubbing it quickly as someone would while washing their face He slowly lowers his hands to his side and then looks straight up into the sky and then slowly down towards me He smiled and said in a hushed but very deep voice Call them motherfuckerI raise my weapon back up and start to back into my driveway towards my door every few steps I make towards my door he makes one towards meCall them motherfucker He screams As if he knew what the outcome of the call would beTake one more fucking step and it will be your fucking last I shout my finger fighting the urge to squeeze of a round into his torsoHe stops in his tracks cocks his head at an angle and presents a very dramatic frown Followed by a snarl His face seemed to twist and contort while staring at me with the most anger I had seen on a human face everI get into my home grab my phone a run upstairs to a window to get a view of this motherfucker while I call the police My wife was already up there she must have been watching the whole thing I quickly dial  while ushering my way to the window As I peer down at him he slowly looks up at us still snarlingCall them motherfucker His scream muffled a bit by our walls but still noticeably louder than beforeI get the operator on the phone never breaking eye contact with DanielI explain everything to the operator as they assure me she has officers on the wayShe calmly starts to ask for more details What is he wearing physical description what has been said did he physically attack me was he still there did he have any weapons do I have any weapon The questions seemed to go on and on She then saysSir you should be able to see the lights from the unit arriving can you see it She askedYes I exclaimShe then asked for me to stay inside until the officers knock at my door I immediately head down stairs and there is the knockPohleece A male voice shoutedI opened the door and was greeted by an officer The cop was about mid s portly and visibly sweaty You called in a disturbance He askedYeah did you grab him I repliedHell no is he still here He snarked Well he was ten seconds ago I saidWe both walk out into the yard where we had stood No sign of Daniel I explained everything to the officer as I have just done to all of you He seemed to believe it all and was also a bit shaken Damn thats some crazy shit He said with a look of astonishmentYoure telling me I replied He retreats to his car for a few moments and comes back He explains that a family had just reported their  year old son missing Their son was african american tall and most importantly his name was Daniel He explained further that Daniel was a diabetic and they worried he may be going into some sort of diabetic fit Everything started to fit perfectly There was a reason he was so irate and up and down This wasnt a maniac it was a young man that was simply ill My emotion went from scared for my family to scared for this young man As we are standing there in my yard the cop and I We hear itCRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACKFive very noticeable gunshots rang out Followed by my neighbor a  something asian widow running from her house handgun swinging wildly back at her home She was screaming quite literally bloody murderAs I stand there paralyzed with shock the officer quickly draws his weapon and starts shouting commandsPut the weapon down now He screams thunderouslyI killed him She shouted while simultaneously throwing the handgun to the ground recklesslyThe officer orders her to the ground approaches her slowly and quickly handcuffs her He starts to search her stands her up walks her to his car and retrieves the thrown weapon All while I am standing there in horrorHe shouts for me to go into my home and stay in there  It turns out Daniel saw the lights about the same time I did He must have quickly ran to my neighbors and ran through an unlocked door My neighbor found him standing in her living room naked and apparently slamming her cats head into the wall She said he had the cat by the tail and was swinging it violently into the wall blood splattering everywhere She retrieved her handgun and shot him  times running out her door immediately afterI was told he was dead before he even hit the floor She hit him with three bullets One through the neck one through the thigh and one the fatal one through his temple I met the young mans family who actually was pretty hostile towards me They wanted quite surprisingly to sue my neighbor for wrongful death or some shit I cannot judge them as I do not know what they must be going throughOh yeah I forgot the craziest part After the police officer ordered me back into my home my wife and I found something that send chills down our spines Lying there at the foot of our bed a pair of shoes and socks You guessed it They were Daniels ,1385342598.0,ITS ME DANIEL,42,nosleep,top_week
psycheko,13,14,1rlcmm,30,Note So I posted this on here a couple weeks back but then I got really nervous and scared and incredibly intimidated by so many of your amazing writing skills I deleted it  This time however Im going to muster up the courage to post it and keep it posted Im only mustering up the courage because I was reading something on here which brought on this whole discussion of mirrors in dreams and how theyre bad news  And well having a nightmare containing a mirror twice in the same night was ratherunpleasant So I figured it was damn time to shareLet me start off by saying I do still get bad dreams but nothing on this scale hence why I say that this was my final nightmare up until this point in my life Its weird because its one of the two memories I can remember vividly to this day the other being when I was sexually assaultedanother story for another day  This nightmare however was like walking through fire doused in gasoline where my bad dreams now are more like a slap in the face  Im just trying to stress the fact that nothing compares to what Im about to sayIt actually was this month when the nightmare happened  I was in grade  at the time so this was  years ago The day was pretty average I didnt watch any scary movies wasnt around anything frightening or any of that jazz  I didnt eat late or have any food that normally does have a tendency to create nightmares which is why this one was oddI dont remember what time I went to bed but it wasnt that late  And to be truthful with you it didnt start the moment I fell asleep either  No the nightmare didnt begin until midway through a dream I was having  And so this is where it beginsSo like I said I was having a pretty average dream  All I can remember are green hills  I cant tell you anything else but I distinctively remember green hills  And all of sudden sort of like when youre watching TV and a special news statement pops on the TV and the news anchor goes sorry to interrupt this broadcast my dream interrupts without the lovely warning I was in my parents bathroom They have a long horizontal mirror that spreads across from the corner of the wall to the edge of the sink so its the entire length of the sink  And I was simply staring at myself in the mirror combing my hair with this pink comb they have  I was just mind my business when I noticed these ghostly white hands around my waist  I blinked and turned to see this little ghost boy behind me He was pale as sin and had black hair He looked up at me grinned this Cheshire catlike smile before disappearing into nothingness  In my dream I screamed and blacked out  The weird thing is my dream continued for the moment it was interrupted The exact moment I ended up waking up and was fucking freaked the fuck out  I was terrified of going back to bed because normally if I have a nightmarebad dream they dont stop  But it was a school night and it was  in the morning I had no choice but to curl up in my sweat soaked bed and go back to bed  And it was a stupid stupid mistakeSo once again normal dream everything is fine and all of a sudden BAM dream is interrupted once again  Once again I was upstairs in my parents combing my hair  I was minding my own business when I noticed those damn ghostly hands again but this time the hands contained a knife which rested against my throat  I whipped around like it was nobodys business and watched as this little boy slowly began to back up with his head down his face obviously covered his arms at his sides  I watched in horror as this boy slowly continued to back up and was forced to stop as his small frail body reached the bathtub  As I write this Im getting chills The little boy raised his head ever so slowly and I automatically notice blood seeping from his eyes down his cheeks  Empty eye sockets met my gaze  He lifted an arm from his side and of course it had to be the one with the knife  Suddenly he grinned that Cheshire cat grin and disappeared just as quick  I once again freaked the fuck out blacked out but this time I did not wait for my dream to continue  I woke up  It was am and I still had an hour to sleep but that was SO not happeningTo this day I still get creeped out when Im in my parents bathroom because of how vividly I remember this nightmare  Im terrified sometimes to be up there so much so Ill turn on all the lights  And I always feel uncomfortable looking in the mirror  I guess a part of me is terrified that one day Ill see those hands and those empty eye sockets againThat is not a sight I want to see,1385581184.0,The Boy With No Eyes,44,nosleep,top_week

thedarkhalf,7,8,1rhyj5,30,You know that feeling when youre all alone and hear your name whispered Maybe youve walked into a room only to suddenly feel a sudden temperature drop Had things go missing only to reappear in odd places Maybe youre like me and you lie in bed at night only to feel like someone stroking your hair but when you become fully conscious and turn around nothing Think you walk through a cobweb or hair falls on your arms or neck and brushes against your skin delicately tickling you You check and nothing was there Im sure your parents tell you its nothing from a young age perhaps because they themselves are deluded enough to believe that it is their imagination They probably deep down fear its a ghost or apparition Even they couldnt know how much worse it really is  Stop deluding yourself Its not a cobweb Its not the wind Its not nothing Its something far more sinister an insidious force which slowly grows stronger the more you feed it your fear and attention Some of you Im sure will be fortunate enough only to feel cold spots and occasionally hear creaks and footsteps in your house Its such a common occurrence that people barely notice it and if they do its the spookiest part of a generic horror movie because those suits in Hollywood havent seen what these creatures are really capable of If you believe in the paranormal you may experience the whispers of what I can only loosely refer to as their voices Im sure not many of you have had the misfortune to awaken to them standing over your bed taking the forms of whatever creatures or person your subconscious fears most because its real form is so terrifying youd probably die instantly or become paralysed with fear a zombieesque state youll never awaken fromand that would ruin their fun too early If you dont die instantly seeing their faces will make your eyes bleed hearing their voices unrestrained will shatter your ear drums and Ive heard of cases where insides have been liquefied skin melting and bleeding seeping out of every poreThe first time I awoke to one in my room with me it was after Id given the footsteps and banging on the walls attention I had thought it was cool I even bought a stupid Ouija board and told them it was okay for them to try and talk to me I had been lying in bed after a night of drinking so I passed off the initial taunts and laughs as nothing more than my intoxicated imagination until my door slowly opened and in came one large hairy leg followed by more spindly legs followed by many eyes and two huge fucking fangs Yep a giant spider bigger than a horse came into my room I tried to scream but that just resulted with me hyperventilating then vomiting all over the floor It strode in all beady eyes on me and as it slinked atop my bed I tried to pathetically crawl away but it held me down with its two front legs piercing into the flesh of my shoulders as I whimpered like a small animal about to be devouredwhich I was  I felt the sharp pain of its fangs tear through my skin and inject me with poison that made my blood burn I lay in bed delirious desperate muttering for help My ears were greeted with a cacophony of voices screaming horrible things that were so foul that before that night had been unimaginable to me I passed out shortly after from fear blood loss or the venom and awoke a few days later believing to have all been a dream I clung to that hope until I stepped outside my bedroom door and found dozens of small animals birds mostly wrapped up in what appeared to be spiders webs discoloured drained of their blood and insides All dead I ran to the bathroom to throw up and caught sight of myself dried blood caked on my body and face puncture wounds all over me and strands of silky web still wrapped around my breasts my stomach my legs and in my hair The second night I encountered one of them they took the form of my uncle I lived with my uncle for nearly  years while my father was travelling almost every week for business I know my father loved me and desperately needed the money that he had to work from dawn until way after the sun set and had to leave me for long periods He didnt know what his brother did to me That night as I became increasingly aware of the noises in my apartment and the feelings of someone touching me and whispering in my ear I rolled over to see my uncle grinning at me He crawled onto the bed and tied me down I struggled but when I did he beat me with his belt like he had started doing when I was eight years old I fought as hard as I could tears burning my eyes and sobbing uncontrollably but he kept cutting away at my clothes with a pocket knife and telling me to be a good girl The torture that night lasted for many hours possibly days I try not to remember it I thought I had moved on from those childhood years and buried them a few years ago when my uncle died This was not the last time the monsters took on forms like this to break me Theyve only grown stronger with every drop of blood with every scream and with every hopeless sob Ive given themTheir true form will only appear to you in dreams at first because they get to torment you in ways that wont instantaneously butcher you or drive you insane yet they like to take their time with their toys The dreams for me started after those incidents I have seen what those beings really look like andjust thinking about it is enough for me to start violently shaking unable to stop retching The other day I wasnt careful and thought about one of them and a stranger had to hold me back as I unconsciously started walking in front of a train In my dreams it is pure hell as they have my undivided attention for hours and can do whatever they want to me without my body breaking and bending the way it would in the waking world but it all feels real Part of me stares at length of rope on my coffee table and considers leaving this tormentbut what if when I die I get sent to their realm to be their plaything forever Its not just the occasional brush against my skin the odd floor creak and the rare moment of is someone calling my name Now I feel them on me at all times their rough sharp skin cutting mine scratching me violating every single part of my body Their voices scream and howl at me maniacally taunting and laughing at my neverending misery Even when I shut my eyes I still see them their hideous beings beyond any words the human language has to describe them to you Most of you think of those household noises and strange occurrences as the work of ghosts of spirits Yes it is so comforting for humans to believe these presences are the souls of dead people who are just sad and wandering isnt it You want to be able to talk to someone no longer alive you open your mind and let them in Dont Whats out there isnt human it isnt some person with unfinished business whats out there wants you to think that to get comfortable with inviting it in and letting yourself become aware of it Did you just hear that faint noise outside your window like a soft breeze carrying a faint whisper That creak outside your room That faint sensation on your flesh I hope not because now you know whats really there and theyve always known about you,1385479012.0,Dont give them attention,38,nosleep,top_week

Moncheriebourbon,2,6,1rowsn,25,Her name was Mary She was in charge of looking after the girls in the dorm It was a great thing the president of the university had done creating an all female dormitory so the girls didnt have to walk to the normal school in the harsh Midwestern weather Mary loved her job The girls were so young and full of ambition Theirs was the generation of Elizabeth Kady Stanton Jane Addams and Alice Paul The world was slowly changing for the better her girls would be teachers on the great prairie and this hall would be where it all began This particular night only a couple of girls remained in the building due to the Easter holiday Ingrid who hailed all the way from Kankakee Emma from Shawneetown and Bridget from Chicago Bridget was a restless soul she found the prairie too dull and devoid of the exciting life she had grown accustomed to in Chicago She had seen the Worlds Fair for herself ridden in Pullman Cars and volunteered at Jane Addams Hull house She was only here to appease her mother who insisted an education would endear her more to Jonathan Moore the wealthy factory owners son Unable to sleep Bridget made her way up to the fourth floor music room Her long white nightgown and matching housecoat lightly drifted across the floor as she made her way to the piano Something soft and sophisticated would remind her of her mother and soothe her to sleep she chose Beethovens Fur Elise The song was so ingrained in her mind she was able to close her eyes and let her fingers naturally flow across the keys So lost in the music she didnt see the gruff groundskeeper drunkenly enter the room At first it was the enchanting music that drew him in but then seeing lovely fairhaired Bridget in her dressing gown his thoughts turned to something more sinister Poor Bridget who missed the city she never imagined something like this would happen to her The groundskeeper believed she was dead after he had finished ripping her gown and her body he fled before anyone could catch him Bridget the resilient Chicagoan dragged herself down the stairs If only she could get to Mary Mary would help her After an eternity she was at Marys door Bridget tried to knock but didnt have the strength so she scratched and scratched and tried to call out with a hoarse whisper but Mary wasnt roused In the morning Mary woke up pulled on her housecoat and opened her door intending to go to the community shower room Instead she found Bridget lying lifeless at her doorstep Mary couldnt tell you what happened after that Only one thing was clear to her she needed to protect her girls She began wandering the halls all night locking doors that were left carelessly unlocked occasionally entering a room and sitting by the bed of a girl having a nightmare she made sure not a single candle was burning after lights out windows were to be kept locked and absolutely no one went anywhere in the building after dark without Mary escorting her Mary only grew worse as the years wore on She was convinced there were men waiting for her to sleep to stop walking the halls even for a second in order to pounce on her girls The doctors said she had hysteria and she was sent to the asylum in Kankakee She panicked in the asylum and knew she had to get back to her dorm or else her girls would all meet the same fate as Bridget She gained the trust of her nurses and one night asked for some knitting yarn and needles The nurses obliged because Mary was such a good patient Mary took her needles and fled back to the hall She was buried in Kankakee in a paupers grave The dorm remained all female through The Great War prohibition the Great Depression The Second World War after coed dormitories became common when AfricanAmericans were finally allowed to attend college through records tracks CDs Mps and iphones And Mary always watched over her girls She no longer needed to sleep so she was able to freely roam the halls every night checking for unlocked doors Walls no longer kept her out so she could sit up all night with a homesick girl who was too embarrassed to talk to anyone else Mary loved her girls but her very being in the dorm attracted less friendly spirits and as the years went on and debauchery became commonplace amongst the girls these bad spirits grew stronger I come in to this story in the fall semester just a few years ago I was living on the second floor of the Marys dormitory with one roommate Rachel my roommate left for home nearly every weekend so I was frequently left alone in the old building Rachel and I were always hearing strange things at night footsteps piano music scratching at the door On more than one occasion one or both of us would fall asleep with the television radio or computer on and wake up to find it had been turned off Other girls said they had similar experiences and we all laughed it off as Mary our friendly ghost looking out for us I became obsessed with the story of Mary and Bridget The fourth floor had been locked up years before I came to the University but you could still walk up the stairs to it and peek in through a crack in the door Most of the girls were afraid of it but the landing just outside the fourth floor entrance became my personal study nook As the year wore on I became increasingly aware of an eerie feeling at the back of my mind I started seeing shadows hearing scratching and waking up terrified for no reason One blistery weekend in December Rachel went home like she usually did The cold weather had kept me indoors for the majority of the week and I was feeling a little stir crazy I went outside to have a cigarette and out of habit looked up to the fourth floor Surprisingly a light was on I stared up wondering how and why someone was up there It was only a second but something was in the window It was big and had red glowing eyes I screamed and dropped my cigarette A couple of girls going into the building looked at me strangely when I looked back up the light was off That night I could hardly sleep I kept seeing those red eyes and my body felt like it was in a constant fight or flight mode Something was just wrong the air felt too heavy there was someone in the room with me even though Rachel was gone I drifted off to a light sleep but was awakened by the sound of growling There was something in the room I tried turning on my lamp but it wouldnt work I spun around in bed and saw in Rachels corner of the room what was making the noise It was a big dark creature that looked like a cross between a giant wolf and a horse Its eyes were glowing red and I could just make out shiny white canines barred at me Panicking I pulled my covers over my head and started saying a prayer begging that the thing be cast out in Jesus name I dont know how but I fell asleep again I woke up sometime later it could have minutes or hours and knew the thing was gone There was a peace that radiated throughout my body before I even opened my eyes When I did open them I saw a woman sitting on the side of my bed She was dressed in very old clothes and was humming something familiar I drifted off to sleep feeling protected It wasnt until I woke up to the sunlight that I realized the song she was humming Fur Elise I had other equally and more frightening things happen to me while living in that dorm I think that Mary was looking out for me that night and all the other nights similar things happened Mary really is still looking out for her girls over  years after her death but there are other things out for the girls too I just hope Mary continues to be there to protect others the way she protected me ,1385701703.0,Marys Hall,31,nosleep,top_week
NeonPaint,12,8,1ra0o4,24,I need someone to help me I need to actually be able to go to sleep and not worry about what Im going to wake up to I need it to stopThe past few days have been enough to make me pack up and check myself into the crazy house It would have to be better than this I work at a nursing home Its not a luxurious job for sure but this nursing home makes my job interesting Its haunted I know it sounds stupid but it really is We have a shadow that haunts one room and our residents will act in ways that will set you on edge I guess the most recent example is Dessy I obviously cannot provide you her real name but this is a nickname I have given her myself Dessy is a cute little old woman She is the grandma you wish you could have Weve always had a pretty good companionship A couple weeks ago she changed Her appearance and her personality completely shifted Her eyes become sunken in hair was constantly messy when it used to always be well groomed teeth started to turn a nasty yellow and her feetdear god her feetthey looked like they belonged to a creature who only resembled a human in the slightest way The best way I can explain her feet is that they looked like long fingered hands with jagged finger nails they didnt look like they belonged to some little adorable woman of  She started saying things to me There was one conversation that has stuck with me Dessy do you want to go to the dining room tonightFuckfuckyou little whoreExcuse me Why are you saying that Honey you can eat in your room I just wanted to make sureHow does it feel whore Little slut you fucking slut you whore you SLUTYou need to stop being mean How bout we go into the bathroom and you can go before dinner At this moment she shuffles into the bathroom with me and I grab her pants to pull them downYou fucking slut Does he do this to you Does he put his hands in your pants Does he fuck you with his hand He fucked that little virgin ctvirginwhore slut fuck youwith his handvirgin ct ct ct I went white as a ghost I was close to Dessy but this old woman never knew anything about me other than my age my name and that I wasnt married I never spoke a word to her about anything sexual but she knew things My personal life isnt something I want to share but her mentioning those last words did relate to me in a very personal way I looked at her as if the devil himself were standing in front of me And then she smiled I cant explain to you guys the smile this woman gave me how it made me cringe how it made me sick Fast forward from that moment to a few days ago Stuff starts happening to me at my house It began with scratching One night I heard scratching coming from the walls then it was above me in the ceiling then back to the walls I didnt think it was too scary until it started to follow me around the house If I went into the kitchen the scratching would follow I couldnt get away from it But I soon realized there are much scarier noises out thereThe moaning is what followed and its been driving me to the brink of insanity Every night I hear this awful moaning Like someone is in this house crying out from a pain I can never imagine I get up I search for who ever or what ever it is If it sounds like its coming from the living room I run to the living room but as soon as my feet hit the carpet the moaning is now in the kitchen It plays with me Toys with my mind and makes me run around here on an endless hour consuming search of where it is coming from If I even want to know where it comes fromThe sound is so sad but it feels unmistakably evil to me I cant explain it but when I hear it I know its a cruel joke I know people say that they are sensitive to spirits all the time but I have always felt like I have been I cant sit down and talk to them like all these psychics out there but I will get random thoughts or names or feelings If a spirit is around I usually can get a name and maybe a fact or two but this has no name nothing What it does have is a moan that makes me instantly nauseous and it has a smile I havent seen it in its entirety but I got a glimpse of something that has made sleeping and living here nearly impossible One night when the moaning was louder than usual I went on the pointless search again trying to find it and figure out a way to stop it When I walked into the living room I saw a shadow and it had a smile on its face that made me throw up right there It made everything in me want to come up in my throat After I cleaned up and calmed down I realized that the smile was familiar to me Maybe thats why it caused me to get sick it could have been that my body knew instantly where that smile had been before Sweet Dessy showed me that smile that day in the restroom in her room She has never smiled at me like that again but I cant handle the thought of seeing it again whether its with or without a faceThe moaning and that smile haunts me It keeps me running around my house every night because I want it to STOP I havent had a real nights sleep in days  Im exhausted and Im working a full time job on a quarter tank of energy Things I usually love to do I dont have the energy to do I always liked to post comments on reddit but its been a couple weeks since Ive even done that because the thought of actually reading a post and commenting is too exhausting its pitiful I need someone to tell me what I can do Any ideas will help ,1385196781.0,Maybe Im losing my mind,32,nosleep,top_week
Jaaaaz,8,13,1rnwuj,22,When I was a kid I stayed with my great aunt while my mom was at work My best friends were the twins whose backyard came up against my aunts yard There was a park nearby that the four of us would ride our bikes to We always loved to play there with the old playground equipment but even as a kid the place seemed off There were never other people at the park no matter what time we went despite being on the edge of a newly built subdivision with plenty of kids In the middle of the woods were the remnants of house a foundation and the chimney Further out the woods had a clearing an access road to a private club and then more woods with a creek we liked to play in The clearing had a place where it pushed into the woods a little more like a culdesacIt wasnt really visible unless you were looking from the park side of the woods Down by the creek there was a fence to sneak around and a few rusted out cars on the edge of the pathI remember one time I saw my aunt leaving a little dish with some food scraps in a blue porcelain bowl in the old chimney Id never noticed it before but thinking back I probably just never noticed it tucked back there Shed tapped the bowl a few times against the brick and walked us down to play in the creek One summer there was a rickety treehouse on the culdesac part of the clearing I remember my aunt and uncle talking about it not long after we found it The kids who pieced it together were gone itd fallen and they didnt survive To this day theyve never found any remains nor can I find any records of it happening Over the years Id forgotten about BushDell Park Recently I was in the neighborhood and something told me to go check on the old place It has been fifteen years since I last visited the park but not a thing had changed The slides and swings were still in the same mediocre condition they were in back then My aunt used to always hum a certain melody when we were at the park and as I got out of the car it was like I could hear her humming faintlyAs I walked further into the park the melody seemed to get louder I was walking towards the entrance to the woods and it occurred to me that it was someone in the woods singing not just my fond memories I snuck up off the trail and followed the noise as quietly as I could Eventually I found my singer standing over by what was left of the old chimney It was my aunts neighbor though last time I heard she could barely walk or see for that matterI sat and watched her She tapped the bowl inside the fireplace a few times just like my aunt did Then I heard  gentle clanking of metal I looked around myself but nothing appeared out of the ordinary The trees rattled in the wind I assumed the fence was rattling The sound was creeping up on me but there still wasnt anything around me Lydia was gone the next time I looked at the chimney Out of nowhere this stench hits me The closest thing I can compare it to is some mixture of death and excrement I made the biggest mistake of my life when I looked up The long scarred muscular arms stretched out in the branches the weathered bearded face The metal sound wasnt the fence it had to have been the chains wrapped around this things wrists ankles and waist His mouth just hung open with these big vacant eyes He didnt notice me or just didnt careHe moved through the trees not in the nimble way that a monkey would but also considerably better than any person He jumped down onto the crumbled foundation and started gnawing down whatever was in the bowl From behind I could see that it looked like some chains had become embedded in his back He rose up and released an inhuman scream to the sky I stayed as still as I couldI turned and started to slink back towards the park I could already hear grunts and chains behind me I took a sharp turn I dont know why I was running as hard as I could and it seemed like the chains and grunts kept going as if I hadnt turned I started to notice the smell of death again The telltale grunts and chains couldnt be heard but as I kept running the smell got strongerI probably ran past the first few warnings that I was in the wrong place As I ran I started noticing bones hanging from the tree limbs from wires If I had to guess some of them were probably human femurs by the size and shape but its hard to say since they appeared to have some of the ends gnawed almost to a point The trail turned small the size of trail youd expect a few kids on bikes to wear in after a few summersJust off the edge of the trails every now and then Id spot a small animal skull usually resting against a tree I crept along the path the bones hanging grew in frequency and started to look more and more carved I came to a clearing and there was Lydia She threw some kind of raw meat into a stone circle and started walking straight towards me What is that LydiaSomeone your aunt wanted taken care ofI heard the rattling of chains behind me I turned around but I couldnt see it Not on the ground not in the trees I turned around Lydia was gone I turned and there it was towering over me Im a little over six feet tall and it was still a couple feet taller Its mouth fell open and let out  deep groan the smell should have knocked me over I hit it I hit it with everything Ive ever had or ever will have Right in the mouth right in those jagged brown yellow and black teeth The thing didnt even stagger it grabbed its mouth and its eyes filled with hate I ran through the fence through the park back to my car Every step the chains and tree rattling got closer to me The last I saw it was standing in the gate of the fence I called the police from the car I told them about the bones and where they were I figured theyd sort out that thing if they found it I drove to Lydias Everything in the neighborhood was quiet I banged on the door Her daughter opened the doorHi is Lydia homeShe hasnt been here in a long timeIs there any way I can visit with her I have a few questions about my auntShe paused Is it about the thing in the parkI was floored how did she know Yeah I saw her feeding it or somethingShe told me shed promised your aunt that she would try to keep him calmWho is it Im not really sure She said privately that it may have been your aunts son That thing isnt human though is itI dont think soOur conversation was cut short by a phone call It was the police station They said I was too old to be making prank calls Apparently there was a clearing there but no bones no burrow I excused myself from Lydias house If anyone knew what was in those woods it would be her sisterI made the call in the driveway Grandma did Aunt Genevieve ever have a sonThe line was dead for a moment I suppose she did give birth to one He died shortly after birth he had so many things wrong with himAre you sure she didnt hide him away in the park by her houseI love you but please leave that monster alone All Genie ever wanted was for thatthing to find a place to

irinax,12,9,1rf7xn,21,Previous post herehttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcopwhoisthiswomanpartThis night I had a friend over Its not related to the woman or this story at all  it was planned much earlier I needed some help with my new place so shed help me and sleep over because we had no idea how much time it would really takeShe had to leave really early before  AM so I thought I can just sleep until  and then goBut as soon as she went out I felt something weird As if theres someone still with me Someone watching me I just knew someone is thereKind of like when I lived with my parents and I just KNOW theyre here even though the door of my room is closed And I know so I have to get up and checkThats how it was So I got up to check Nothing I couldnt see anything but I could still feel it I figured the feeling would go away when I look around the apartment and see that theres nothing there It didnt It just felt like I was chasing after something and it kept getting away Like when you try to hold onto something really slippery I felt helpless and very hopeless in that moment It was much deeper than just not being able to find something I felt was there  it was just an ingeneral feeling of misery and despair not related to something specific So I figured maybe I was just getting sick maybe I was too tried too stressed maybe its really nothing and I went back to bed I fell asleep really quickly Then the doorbell rang I woke up It felt like I slept for hours and hours but in reality it was only like  or  minutes I went to open the door guess who it was The womanYeah I was terrified and for a moment I thought  Im done Its over Byebye cruel worldIt  wasnt  regular fear like youd be afraid when you know theres a reason to like a gun pointed or an angry dog It was more like fear of the dark you dont really know what exactly you fear but its still scaryAnd just to make it clear once again  she doesnt LOOK scary She looks normalShe speaks in a normal tone with a normal voice But theres just something about her that makes me want to get away but in the same way intrigues me  I feel that I HAVE to knowSo I was really holding back the what the fuck are you doing here you mad bitch rant that was forming in my mind I just greeted her instead because seriously what good could come out of getting pissy Not like that would help nowShe says hi Im like uhumm yeah hi And then she tells me she just wanted to visit me to see how am I doing hows life etc etc So Im like wtf you saw me yesterday and the day before and the day before She ignores me She asks to come in but I tell her I was just planning to get out I have things to do so  I wouldnt be a good host right now She says she doesnt mind it all I say I feel embarrassed about having such a messy home Maybe when I fix it I know  she knows Im lying But I just HAVE to say that I cant tell her the truth She just walks in and I immediately escort her outAnd the truth is I just DONT want her in I cant let  her I know she cant do anything more than she could do in the hallway or from the door or in the park or in an alley or anywhere else really but I just didnt feel like letting her in and still dont I know it was rude as fuck but so is trying to force someone to let you in their house at  in the morningShe keeps trying to get me to make her coffee or breakfast or something And the pushier she gets I get less afraid more angry She then asks me about my old town my friends family my new friends my new place what am I planning to do here I dont tell her shit I just ramble about unspecific things getting more and more angry She makes me feel dizzy Not in a Ohsoniceandcute way In a very bad way In a Icouldpassoutorevendie waySomehow I get through the conversation and then she just suddenly stops talking and stares at me Youre really not going to let me in I explain to her again that Im going out now and the place is a messSo she glares at me and nods AlrighttttI really thought she was going to attack me  I was really waiting for her to try to hit me or stab me or whateverBut she turns around then she turns back to me and says See you soon Maybe Ill come again tomorrow I tell her itd be better if she just lets me invite her when Im ready for visitors when I can actually provide a good stay for a guestBut friends name stayed the nightI get terrified again  bitch how the fuck do you know but I just say that friend is helping me with the apartmentShe nods again And then she says bye see you And walks away Turns around once again stares at me and says I still cant figure it out Thats why I just have to come back like you had to interrogate me at the park And then walks down the stairs I try to stop her but she ignores me Wont talk anymoreNow the thing is nothing about her except the knowing my greatgrandmother part seems supernatural otherwordly She seems like a silly but creepy lost cause And if it wasnt for my grandmothers warnings and the woman claiming to know Magdalena Id even consider her a cute wackadoodle But I still have NOTHING to explain WHY my grandmother appears to fear this woman and NOTHING to explain HOW could she a woman

lamenteddreams,4,11,1rgqu8,17,I love the dark I really doI dont mean going gothic and pagan and all that but I do like the dark I like to sit in my room for hours on end into the night watching videos researching diseases and the supernatural and writing storiesAnyways Ive recently come across a quote from a game called Knock Knock And let me say its utterly terrifying for not just the player but the watcher too Theres nothing but this overwhelming sense of dread throughout all of the gameYou thought about it and now it is inside Knock KnockThat quote has seemed to have seeped into my brain Multiple broken theories have been written down in my notebooks and journals and Ive seemed to have come to a conclusionThe mind isnt wrong Reality is And with that imagination often holds more truth than what we acceptThink about it When you were a small child things like fairytales and horror stories were much more real to your innocent mind In fact there is a theory that children have a sixth sense that they gradually lose as they progress into adulthood Also when you were a child you thought of monsters and what they would do to you as well as how terrifying they lookedAnd when you thought about these things you didnt want to turn around Why Because what if for the slightest moment you were right All those lone yellow eyes in the darkness the sinking feeling of being watched out of all those times what if this was the moment you were right Or moreover what if you were always right and they just didnt want you to know until nowBecause honestly we used to think the Earth was flat Then that it had the sun revolving around us So what makes us so absolutely sure that we are the only ones out there nowThis is my theoryI shared with one of my colleagues about two weeks ago and five days later she called me screaming about how there was something in her house The police showed up and they took her to the hospital She had three slash marks down her back resembling that of almost a wolf She also had multiple bruises on her neck They said there was no signs of break in and the wrecking of the house was most likely the result of her having a psychotic episodeThis could be true but I dont like how unsettlingly close it is to when I told her about my theoryYou thought about it and now it is insideThis is the phrase that keeps me from imagining creatures When I went to the hospital to visit her she was curled up in the bed shaking with her knees up as close to her chest as possible When I asked her what happened she wouldnt tell me who only that it got inside She just had this empty look in her eyes something very uncommon since she was always so hyper and nice When I asked how she just said I thought about it and it came inKeep in mind I never told her about the quote at all Those were her own words So this is more than unsettling for me It may be possible that this theory spooked her enough for all of this to happen but I dont like the coincidencesWhat do you think,1385431800.0,The Theory,28,nosleep,top_week

Hangingtree,4,6,1rosmv,16,I love my jobIm a butcher you see You may think I sound cruel or maybe even crazyBut I really doWhen I was a kid my father would always take me to work with me It was a family owned butcher shop His father before him and his father before him Weve owned it for the longest time My father taught me all the cuts of meat The thigh the neck the ribs I always liked ribs but I feel bad eating them The best ribs I ever tasted was after my grandmother died She never approved of the store and had arguments with my grandfather and my father about it She wanted to keep me as far away from it as possible Didnt want me See those things when I was a kidI didnt mind though Blood was never a problem everything has blood in it technically tree sap is blood It wasnt a problem to see though I always liked to tease my friends who feel sick when they see it Id cut off a foot of one of the animals and chase them around the field with it My father didnt mind he was actually really lax about letting me do what I want He liked me at the shop I kept things nice and clean Like I said I dont mind seeing the blood or even messing around but I just liked to keep the place clean For sanitation reasonsMy mother on the other hand was the one that always yelled at me for doing anything she didnt like Shed yell at my father for letting me go to the shop saying it was wrong She was a vegetarian after all She would say things like They feel pain Theyre living things You shouldnt be killing them and eating them They were just animals It wasnt like I was hurting peopleMy father had a lot of headaches from her always yelling Though I still remember when we were eating the day after she passed away Hed stare into his plate of potatoes and steak and just cry He really did love herHe started bringing me to the shop more after my mother died A sort of father son bonding experience He got a little sloppy with his work though To stop the animals from crying out you had to slit their throats first and let them bleed out He forgot to do this The noise hurts your ears like when youre sitting in a restaurant and some kid wouldnt stop crying High pitch and it drills into your ears I always hated it My father gathered up the cuts of meat he needed and took them to the other side of the shop I had gotten into the habit of cleaning his knives when he left I picked the knives off the table and was about to wash them when the creature spasmed on the table I didnt think it could move anymore most of its limbs were gone and it was cut open Its skin was all dirty almost black but you could still see pink underneath it The thing looked me in the eyes I saw fear in them like a deer in headlightsH Help meI stared at the animal It shouldnt be able to talk None of the others had talked before My father returned wiping his hands on his apron He saw me standing with the knives Whats wrongI must have looked worried I didnt mean to scare him I pointed at the animal on the table It talked My father just gave me a quick frown Thats not right He walked past me taking one of the small curved knives out of my hands He stuck his fingers into the things mouth opening them wide It gave no fight Ah here He reached the knife in and wiggled it around I saw blood dripping out of the animals mouth He pulled out a small pink thing You have to cut out the tongues Otherwise they talk just like usI looked at the animal on the table Its four limbs missing its shaved head and bleeding mouth But they arent like us right No matter how much they look like usNow you got it slugger My father gave his warm laugh I always liked that nickname,1385697831.0,My fathers shop,22,nosleep,top_week
schizoidvoid,2,3,1r9u3h,14,This is shaping up to be a big project which is good for me and hopefully for all of you as well Turns out ten thousand characters isnt nearly as much as I hoped it would be Thanks to those of you who have commented on parts one and two Here are some links to get you started into my storyThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart  Manifestationshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrxtthesilverladypartmanifestations Part  SpiritshttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrcvthesilverladypartspiritsI remember a story arc in Greys Anatomy where the ghost of a doctors dead lover followed her around and only she could see it Thats when I stopped watching the seriesI was eating cereal watching reruns of Scooby Doo I couldnt recall cereal ever tasting better and I couldnt recall Scooby Doo ever being so entertaining But thats how it goes when the embodiment of good is sitting beside you on the couch giggling musically at the television Today was a day of firsts for the both of us Dad walked in at some point looking haggard as I had ever seen him His eyebrows shot up when he saw me curled up on the couch neatly groomed and with color in my cheeks I gave him a halfsmile equal parts enthusiasm and sympathy Make no mistake I hadnt forgotten my sisters death but no therapy on earth could have matched the aura of the silver lady I stood up smoothly walked the three paces across the living room and wrapped him in the biggest hug I could muster He was apparently speechless but when I looked up at him I saw that the worry lines around his eyes had softened a littleI reflexively looked back over my shoulder at the silver lady and she expressed her joy at my desire to comfort my dad I smiled at her and then glanced back at my dad who was looking at me quizzically now I brushed my hair back over my shoulder and smiled at him againWere going to be okay DadHe only nodded and wandered off He had taken time away from work to grieve and so he had not even dressed himself In the silence that followed I looked around I had to laugh and then I was shocked at the inappropriateness of my laughter Sitting on the couch was a ghost that only I could see a ghost that magically took away all my pain and trouble Yeah I must have snapped Two deaths was one too many My laughter had drawn the ladys attention She looked at me and frowned a little I shook my head at her incredulous and turned away Things like this didnt just happen to peopleI was grateful though at least I didnt get the ghost of deathly melancholy or something There wasnt much of an earthly nature that could upset me with her around That and the fact that I had an entire day to kill considered I decided I might as well make the best of it Everyone grieves in their own way I suppose Jurassic Park was showing and I figured Id go see it The movie wasnt for several hours though and so I grabbed up my things and went for pancakes at IHOP The silver lady sat across from me and I couldnt help but laugh The entire restaurant was going about its business and yet here sat a figure so obviously paranormal as to be hokey like a ghost bride her hair and gown blowing in a wind that only she could feel She noticed my disdain and expressed a mild indignance within my mind I shrugged it off and asked her what she could expect from me but quickly shut my mouth and looked around when I realized that I looked like a total schizophrenicI still had an hour to kill after breakfast so I decided to spend off some of my allowance though it had been meagre from week to week I had saved up almost a thousand dollars over my sheltered years I drove down main street and visited several little boutiques built into the slightlyrenovated shells of old department stores and hotels from the towns conception way back at the turn of the century Several tops caught my eye and the lady waited patiently as I tried each one I asked her what she thought of them from time to time but she didnt seem to have an eye for clothes having probably worn the same ghost dress for hundreds of millenia I was just wrapping up at the last store preparing to break another fifty dollar bill when a little girl in front of me in line turned aroundShe smiled wide and began tugging on the hem of her moms skirtMommy MommyWhat is it honey the woman asked a little exasperated but apparently feeling indulgentShes so pretty mommyThe mother looked at me and smiled and I smiled back Yes shes very pretty hon Now come on weve got to get to the bank She halfwalked halfdragged the girl out of the store the girls eyes were locked back over her shoulder that cheesy grin still on her faceI would have felt flattered except the child wasnt looking at me She was looking five feet to my left Right where the silver lady was standing My heart dropped right onto my stomachA sense of surprisingly smug satisfaction filtered through my mind simultaneously with a surge of grief and longing Satisfied though she may have been about my reaction the silver lady desperately wanted to follow the girl Suddenly I was along for the ride as the silver ladys desires became my own in our shared headspace I paid quickly at the checkout counter and trailed along behind the mother and daughter as though in a daze We walked out into the sunlight and I sneezed as my eyes adjusted Their car was parked twenty paces from the storeBy the time I had halved the distance between us they were pulling out And then shrapnel was everywhere I dropped to the ground reflexively and was peppered with safety glass Truly in a daze now I staggered to my feet and wandered it felt towards the smoking ruin in front of me Their little blue sedan was wrapped around an old steel truck I walked up to the passenger side window got as close as I could despite the truck and felt a warm breeze blow past me The silver lady was in the car then embracing the husk of what had just been an adorable baby girlBlood trickled from every orifice in her head Her skull had split open from front to back stretching her face oddly and she was staring vaguely off into the distance blinking outofsync one eye and then the other A couple arterial spurts sprayed the chrome bumper of the truck One moment there was a girl fighting for life and the next there was a lifesized gory mannequinI never got used to that part when life leaves the body the body ceases to be a person and becomes a shell inanimate as though it never breathed or laughed or ate or drankSound returned to the world and I heard choking gurgling screams Oh my god oh god no my baby oh god no My legs went out from under me I sat down hard on pavement kicked my legs until I bumped softly against the curb The silver lady was crying againI dont know how long I sat there but the next thing I knew the street was lit up with red and blue lights The din of sirens was crashing through my skull I was nearest the crash when it happened and so I had to give a statement I must have done well enough at it because the police let me go with the promise that I come in later to write everything out The driver of the pickup was clearly drunk and he must have been going twenty over the speed limit I made my way back into the boutique with stuttered steps and asked for a phone My dad was there in ten minutes flatI stared out the window blankly all the way home held aloft solely by the presence of the silver lady Dad tried to get me to speak several times but his words were a dull chatter in the back of my mind I closed my eyes as the tears began to roll down my cheeks I curled up inside myself and felt a welling spring of warmth rise inside of me as the tightness lifted from my chest I fled into it covering myself with the warming blanket of the silver ladys loving embrace like a child afraid of the dark I breathed deep and opened my eyes My gaze was drawn down to my own body My skin had taken on a silverwhite glow and an opalescence like polished marbleI glanced over at my dad wondering if he was seeing this My heart skipped a beat as I took in the dark sicklyhued vapor sticking to his skin like lake fog on a cold morningSarah Sarah what is it he asked seeing my face tight with shock and alarm His voice was jarring I could hear new and unfamiliar tones of worry and sadness layered within it But I couldnt respond I was busily looking around at the world which had taken on an alien cast The flora radiated crystalline hues and the sky boiled with color like something alive I could see the air itself buzzing with activityThis is the true world I thought to myself in a voice wholly not my own We seem to have  merged I felt my inner eye flipping through my memories and thoughts like the pages of a book each moment replayed and recast in the new light of a foreign perspective Simultaneously I felt my mind open to a tome of memories not my own as though a hidden eye within me had opened for the first time So much suffering so much death I was a failure For aeons I had tried to stem the tide of pain and misery that ran rampant across the earth like a plague but all my efforts amounted to a drop in the oceanI was being shaken My mouth tasted of ozone Dad had stopped the car and I realized I was doubled over and screaming Dad was near hysterics trying to get a response from me My voice shaky and otherworldly inside my skull said Sick  stomach Home Please take me homeThe introductionhttpwwwredditcomrnosleepcommentsrqlthesilverladyanintroductionPart

JUVIEMAKER,8,4,1rhq9j,12,I have a nose for things No seriously all my life Ive had a very strong sense of smell and I dont mean for the average person I have an abnormally freakishly ridiculously absurd sense of smell Its been that way since I was a kid Heres a prime example when I was about four or five I used to visit my grandmother god rest her soul every month in Daytona Beach for the summer My grandmother was notorious for making the best homemade cakes in the neighborhood I would always leave my Grans house at least ten pounds heavier each summer after gorging myself on her delicious treats One Saturday after a day of playing outside when kids used to play outside I instantly smelled the aroma of cake wafting through the air but something wasoff There was another smell lingering behind the cake scent It was kinda tangy bitter sorta nutty just all around unpleasant Being so young I couldnt quite put my finger on what the smell was but I knew I didnt like it Then out comes my Gran from the kitchen with a big slice of her freshly made cake on a china plate She passes the dining room table and spots me standing there with my nose crinkled up in disgustGran  Whats the matter baby Come sit at the table and have a slice of cakeFive year old me I aint eating that cake it smells funnyLet me just interject for a second  Now if your family is old school like mine you know that a child is to NEVER disrespect an elders cooking Especially if that elder is a family member you just dont do it That is unless you want a black eye ribs broken missing teeth you get the pictureGran Girl get your hind parts over here and eat this cake before I slap the hell out of youOh geeztheres that tone You know it you know it well That angry deep tone that resonates from parents when their truly pissed off You know that voice that scares the living shit out of you and gives youre delicate childlike mind nightmares for a month or your whole life Yeah thats what I was hearing right about then But still I was adamant I would not eat that damn cake That smell It was just too potent Now you might be thinking whats the big deal Surely youve smelled worse things than that cake before which is very true At that point in my life Id smelled worse things before WAY WORSE but Id never been subjected to eat those things either Also the stench of that pastryit was just so very not right I was only a child but I was still old enough to know right from wrong and that cake was definitely wrong Even at that very moment I could taste its bitterness in the back of my mouth With every inhale it burned and tingled down my throatGran Come over here and take this plate nowOkay at this point I knew I was in REAL trouble Even if my grandmother didnt kill me I was pretty sure I was in for the ass whooping of my life I slowly started to back away from Gran as she moved closer to me with that dreaded cake Even as she inched towards me that smell seem too magnify With every step she took it grew more and more intense Girl you better take this cake she yelled holding the plate out in front of her I turned to run but she quickly snatched up my arm before I could get away No I shouted feverishly trying to pull away from her grip I dont want the cake granny but my pleas of desperation came to no avail My grandmother started to tug me towards the kitchen table her fingers angrily wrapped around my tiny forearm Suddenly she yanked me forward making my body jump about two feet in her direction tilting my face towards hers She looked down at me with an awful glare Dark hollow eyes glowered down from Grans wrinkled sockets Her once loving face was now rigid and stiff with a sadistic expression that I had by no means seen before You will eat this cake She shouted through gritted teeth Even if I have to shove it down your throat piece by piece I had never seen this side to my Gran before My once sweet devoted granny had turned into this vicious monster plucked straight out of my worst nightmares My small frame quaked in fear and tears began to seep from my eyes I had never known terror like this My insides loosened and squirmed like jelly making the contents of my bladder empty and leak down my legs To say I was afraid would be the understatement of the freakin decade But you know what There was something else I was more fearful of Even as I pissed myself in sheer horror from the presence of my devillike grandmother there was still something more bloodcurdling more utterly terrifying than herthat fucking cake NO echoed from my lips in a banshee scream and with all the strength I possessed I juggernauted into my grandmother My body throttled into her torso head first making a loud solid grunt bellow from the old woman Her arms flew in the air letting me go in the same instance and her vast body collapsed backwards before suddenlyCRACKThe sound of my grandmothers head crashing along the rim of her kitchen table splintered throughout the house Gran thudded to the ground like a sack of potatoes and the plate with the cake she so firmly held onto shattered on the floor I stared at her lifeless body as blood began to seep through her head and flow on the linoleum I was still too little to know the true meaning of life and death but I did know for sure that red liquid was not suppose to be running out of her head like that I bent down and looked into Grans half opened eyes They werent black any more Theyd gone back to their normal brown again Not really knowing what to do I just stared down at the gruesomeness of it all watching the chunks of yellow cake absorb the blood until each piece was just as red To make a long story short the police were eventually called My Grans weekly bridge game was on that day and a couple of her elder counterparts found her body and me sitting in a pool of piss and blood staring at it Needless to say there were lots of screams Oh and youre probably wondering what that smell was right I actually didnt find out until I was well into my teens what exactly it was I was pouring it into my foster parents coffee one morning when it finally hit meCyanide From the smell of it Gran probably couldnt have used too much either Maybe half a teaspoon give or take totally undetectable to the average persons nosebut not to mine So thats what that was go figure  I remember thinking that to myself as I stirred the cyanide into two mugs My foster parents passed away later on that day I wish I could say I feel sadness over it but I really dont  I was more consumed with thoughts on why my grandmother was trying to kill me Was it because of what Id done to Oscar her cute little Maltese I mean if Id known the oven wasnt a suitable place to put a dog I might have done things differently I was only two at the time Or perhaps it had something to do with what happened with Mommythat really was unfortunate I didnt want to hurt her but she was an obstacle that just had to be removed But anyways thats neither here nor there Im an adult now and those days are long behind me Im actually on my way to my boyfriendsexcuse meexboyfriends apartment right now Im visiting him and that slut he cheated on me with And guess what They just had a baby isnt that the sweetest thing  ,1385470521.0,A nose for things,16,nosleep,top_week
FUCK,12,6,1rhjmk,11,So my uncle has always been into the paranormal and he got me into paranormal investigation Or ghost hunting to simplify it a few years back Well I go with him on a lot of them and we do it for free for people who think something paranormal is going on in their houses I always saw it as a nice little hobby to do on the weekends to blow of some time and I always liked being scared I mean thats how I even know about this subreddit because I like reading it And thats one of the only reasons I knew about what had happened on my last investigation We got a call from a family out in the middle of the country saying they had begun hearing weird voices when they were each alone but the  year old son was the one who had it happen the most I went through every scenario I could think on the way there Something was legitimately going on that was paranormal one of the kids was lying and was fucking with the rest of the family and other such things Well when we got there we talked with the family and everyone seemed happy except the two children The son was as I said earlier  and the girl was  they seemed uneasy looking off into corners and such I took a note about it but didnt dwell on it that much We went around the house marking places we would put cameras and getting the lay out of the house Once we finished that we went back to our van and started getting ready After we set up all of our equipment we each got our POV Point of view cameras strapped on and started our investigation My Uncle took the upstairs our colleague took the first floor And I went into the basement to do a little investigating of my own I made my way downstairs and grabbed my Walkytalky and radioed my uncle asking if everyone was ready for me to hit the main light breaker He gave me the go ahead and I flipped the little switch plunging the whole house into darkness I held up the other camera I had with me so I could have a camera move around freely  plus it had a night vision setting so I could see where I was going Well I turned it on and walked slowly to the chair I had placed in the room so I could sit comfortably waiting for something to happen And after an hour or so of me questioning the darkness It answered backMy instincts kicked in and I put a call in on the radio for everyone to tell me where they were And everyone was exactly where they said they were supposed to be My heart froze in my throat from fear but excitement so I stood and asked who I was talking to and I heard a small wispy chuckle before it said softly You know who I am I swallowed hard before continuing to walk around the room and asking questions It stayed silent for a few questions before I asked why it was here It chuckled again before I heard a small sound Like a door knob jiggling and I turned towards it My camera landed on a door knob sticking out from a sheet that I guess had covered it before I walked towards it slowly pulling the sheet off to reveal a shabby door about waist height with peeling paint and scratch marks  I put in a call on the radio telling my uncle and the others I had found something and for them to meet me in the basement I got no answer back but I assumed they had gotten the message My uncle did that a lot he tended to get over excited with these things so I figured he was just trying to get here as fast as possible  But the paranormal curiosity ran in the family so I reached down and grabbed the knob it was warm as if someone had been holding it for a longtime I steadied myself before twisting it and pushing it open I looked through my camera screen as I walked into the door The atmosphere around me seemed to change instantly even though all the lights in the house was off it just seemed to be darker and colder in here the basement itself  I looked around in the room through the screen until I saw a lone chair in the center of the room I walked forward until I was right next to it and then began looking around more I jumped a bit at the bright light on my screen until I noticed it was a mirror It was bolted onto a beam  next to the chair and when I looked to the left I noticed the same thing I thought it was really strange so I walked around the front of the chair and accidentally kicked something over  It was loud and then I heard a sound of rushing water My heart leapt into my throat as I looked down and around looking for the source until my camera came upon a metal bucket slightly rolling with water coming out I also saw a candle and a small match book and thats when it hit me My whole body filled with fear as the realization flooded my head This was a three kings set up I turned towards the door pointing the camera as I looked through it I saw the door slam and I stopped My whole body froze from pure terror and it took me a few seconds before I let out a scream for help After I stopped I heard the soft chuckle come from behind me in the darkness and I just stood there with my eyes closed shaking as I felt a soft breath on the back of my neck I heard a voice My voice whisper right into my ear  Do you know who I am now I stood there for a second before screaming again and then I heard the door bust open and I saw flash lights on me and my uncle asking what was wrong I just ran from the room to the breaker box and flipped on all the lights I then sank to the floor looking at him as he sat next to me and asked all that happened I just held out my camera to him and he took it Before he watched it he asked me why I didnt call for back up and I looked at him before telling him that I did He looked at our colleague before watching the recording After that he asked me if we all went in together would I go back in I nodded as long as we kept the lights on and we went in and it was as I thought It was a set up for  The three kings I shuddered as I turned to my uncle asking if he knew what it was He didnt so I explained it to him and I pointed to the bucket  and it has been used recently The bucket was full of water  My uncle nodded to me and put a wrap on the investigation We went back home and I have decided to type this up Tomorrow we will be going and talking to the family about what happened and who had done the three kings in the house  I think the three kings set up has something to do with what has been happening at the house I will update you all on what happens after we talk to them ,1385460233.0,What have these people done,17,nosleep,top_week

Marksman,4,4,1rftnd,12,Have you ever looked in a mirror and you were a little off put by your expression Or looked at yourself in the mirror and realized that the person looking back at you is youI walked beside my friend and as we walked we talked I cant remember what we talked about but all I remember is this bland superficial conversation about nothing in particular Conversations like these bothered me they didnt seem real to me just like sounds verbal things that hold no real meaning And as I thought about our conversation I wanted to make it more real for me to give our little talk some depth and just before I asked her a meaningful question I tripped I startled awake rubbed my eyes glanced at the clock but the time didnt register in my head I realized that I needed to go the the bathroom I shuffled over dragging my feet to be sure I didnt trip or stub my toe flicked on the lights squinting from the brightness relieved myself and turned on the faucet I ran my hands under the cool water threw some water on my face picked up the towel and wiped my face off As my eyes adjusted to the light I looked at myself in the mirror and my reflection was smiling at meI considered that I may have been dreaming or hallucinating but my cold damp hands and the pain of the bright light was all too real I did what I would usually do when in this sort of disbelief and rubbed my eyes some more hoping I was still just a bit drowsy But nothing changed I looked at myself and was quite curious I felt my face with my hand to see if I was actually smiling It certainly didnt feel like it Normally this would creep the hell out of me I would on any other occasion scream or run away but I just stared at the reflection looking into my eyes as if they werent mine A genuine happiness I havent felt that way in far too long I felt calm But suddenly as though something dropped to the ground the feeling of calm had broken like a shattering vase a feeling welled up inside me A tightness in my chestLike someone had just punched me it was one of a gurgling frustration I would be happy if it werent for this stupid house things are constantly broken and this wretched family it all torments me every day of my life Thats when I heard the voice of my father from couple days earlier Because I said so the words resonated in my mind I could feel my teeth gritting the sound made my skin crawl but the reflection just kept smiling backtaunting me The shrill sound of my mothers voice beckoned in a continuous annoying ringing in my earI shook my head to clear my thoughts but the ringing was still there I peered over at the clock and looked at the time    Its lateI couldnt possibly sleep now I was simply too stressed I had school tomorrow but I had to deal with thisLet me sleep I muttered half to myself half to the voices and that face in the mirror This was when I noticed the mirror had stopped reflecting my actions and just was a still image of myself smiling I became angry at this point What is wrong with you I said to it hoping it would stop Just go the hell away I growled through my teeth Feeling rather violent I stared back into my eyes trying to counteract that incessant grin with my anger No Its mouth didnt form the words but the sound just streamed out of it The ringing got louder and louder I tried to cover my ears but it felt like it was coming from inside my head the voices began circling me and taunting me and that terrible ringing Then it all just stopped Was it over I just wanted to go to sleep so I could continue my broken life It started laughing a laugh that sounded unmistakably like my voice But it was a sound I had never made before a sound like true laughter this was new to me It bothered me I was envious Why cant I experience that kind of happiness He bothered meI had enough The voices all faded away but the mirror kept smiling STOP I yelled as I punched the mirror the blood was quick to run down my arm and the few pieces of mirror were stuck in my hand I could feel them scaping at the bone The remnants of the mirror on the wall reflected nothing but my angry scowl and bloodied arm I stared at my hand It didnt hurt but I could lightly see the reflection of my own face in the bloodied shards It still smiled IT STILL SMILED NO I slammed my hand against the counter the blood spilled all over the room on my shirt and faceAnd so it happened Blake had snappedthough In his own mind he was trappedBroken and confused he wanted to dieBut all he could do was simply cryThe lights flicked off his mother shrieked in the other roomscared as though she could feel her impending doomHis father had been up all night drinkingWhile Blake was pondering and thinkingThe sound of the window outside smashingrang in his mind terrifying echoed the crashingNOW OF ALL TIMES Blake shouted furiouslyWe enter Blakes house to a horrid scenethe smell of blood nothing was cleanThe sanctity of his mind and house violatedwith adrenaline and fear his pupils dilatedSprinting to the kitchen he grabbed a toola knife very sharp for he was no foolNot afraid to risk his life with nothing to live forThis life And the criminal he did abhorCreeping through the house to find the thiefHe heard a loud scream though very briefIn his parents room he finds the two mangled corpses the floor already soaked in blood His parents had been completely mutilated each had been stabbed numerous times now slumped on the floor eyes still open A figure stood overtop the lifeless corpses that were once his parents hunched over with a bloody knife in hand the tall man was half visible in the moonlight that came through the window His skin fair and pale his face was itself a conundrum it was an inexplicable quality His face looked off Like an optical illusion where all you can do is stare and ponder His fingers were skinny the joints looked massive in comparison He looked almost inhuman but he was unmistakably a man Awkward echoed in my mind perhaps for lack of a better word as he edged toward meYou didnt I said to himYoure welcome I stated in a soft warm voiceto Blake who accepted my words without much choiceI followed him back to the kitchen as he put the knife downThe blood dripped from his hair as heavy as a crown Its done its over He quietly muttered to himselfWe can sleep now He put the knife on the shelfI climbed back out the window never there was a messas Blake walked he had no more stressHis house unviolated but his mind still taintedto this new life he will never be acquaintedMy wits came back to me Cold blood streamed down my arms I walked calmly to the bathroom and looked at the cracked and bloody mirror the counter was a mess Between the cracks I see my face depressed Sad to the point of a complete bleak The frown That was more like it That makes more sense to me no longer that disgusting smile I saw a tear on his face It was of blood Feeling around on my face I felt a drop of blood Blood on my face Then I felt something that I did not expect A smile My mind twisted Reality as I knew it broken demented distorted I looked again at my hand The shards of glass still glistened in the light even covered in blood I saw a piece of bone fractured I glanced again at the clock  When did that happen I said as recollections of what had just happened streamed back into my mind Did I wake up my parents when I hit the mirror Then reality hit me in a particularly cruel mannerFor a moment dead silenceMOM DAD I yelled as I sprinted across the house into their room There they lay Bloody and mangled bodies multiple stab wounds on both of them in the torso the chest the legs the knees even the faceI hugged them soaked in their still warm blood Yelling at the top of my lungs IM SO SORRY IM SO SORRY Like a pin dropping the tick of the clock in their room brought me to how real this wasBut only one thought reverberated in my mind This is going to totally ruin my day After about  minutes the blood grew cold and the corpses began feeling rather stale I walked around their room looking for my next days lunch money and as I was walking out I slipped in a pool of blood With a loud crash I continued to lay on the floor for quite some time I silently muttered to myselfDammit now I need to get some new clothesI began pacing toward my room taking off my shirt frustrated by this inconvenience I threw it on the floor and it made a sloshing sound Maybe I can wash it My mother had done my wash up until now I took a shower and put on some new clothes Clean at last I walked back into my parents room I stared a little while Maybe  or  hours It was so Peaceful This shouldve happened a long time agoWhen I remembered that it was time for bed I began laughing Laughing as I never had before in my life Overjoyed More genuine than any laugh I have ever had Time for bed I dont have a bedtime anymore No one to yell at me No one to tear my mind apart I laughed and laughed until I heard my alarm clock go off in my room Oh time for school I said with a grin on my faceBut without my parents here to test me this was no raceMe This house was now my place Im here to stay for I had left quite a trace,1385409532.0,Reflection,16,nosleep,top_week

Dectrek,2,6,1rbx7r,12,All my life I have never believed in luck Its just some stupid phrase coined from the minds of jealous or selfabsorbed people saying Arent I the greatest I just won  off the lottery Im so lucky or Can you believe that he just won  grand off the lottery that son of a gun Now just because I think that luck is a bunch of crap doesnt mean that I gamble Oh I gamble alright I gamble until Im rich and drunk at the same time Ive been to Vegas with my friends Ron Jerry and Max a ton of times and they always say Wow Rob youre so lucky and Ill either ignore them or Ill be too drunk to hear them I was addict when it came to gambling but one night that all changedIt was another Vegas trip with the guys I had lied to my company telling them that I was going on a business trip and they had completely bought it I even was able to use company money to pay for the trip We checked into our hotel room and decided that tonight we were going to live like there was no tomorrow I played craps until I was running low on money so I went to the blackjack table and counted cards until I was well funded for the rest of the night We drank and we drank and we drank until we could barely see anymore I started to black out so we went to the streetsNow the next events were blurry and I dont remember all of it I think what happened was that my friends were telling me that I lucked out at blackjack when one of them said something about me cheating I got all offended and started taking hits at him and I think we got in a fight Next thing I knew I was in an alley and was starting to black out probably not such a good idea to have had that much to drink and thats when every turned blackThis is when it happened First everything was dark and I couldnt feel anything but then I heard voices They were cheering all around me that sounded like something exciting was happening and then I got the sense of feeling back I was lying on my back and there were voices all around me cheering as if it was a football game Then the lights went upI was blinded at first but as my eyes adjusted to the light I saw thousands of people sitting in stand around a stage that I was on I was laying a colorful wheel something you would see on the wheel of fortune and I couldnt get up Beyond the crowed was darkness and the only light came from a huge light bulb that was about  yards from where I was laying A man was standing on the stage and was holding a microphoneLadies and gentlemen please give a warm welcome too our next contestant Rob JohnsonThe crowd went wild and the wheel started to spin slowly at first but it gained speed quickly I was beginning to feel sick when I heard Jerry press the button when youre ready and the wheel began to slow down As it slowed I heard the man on the stage yell Lets see how luck our contestant is too which the crowed started to yell out colors that they thought the wheel would land on The wheel stopped on the color green and the crowd screamed with joy All around the room the color green was shown with the words Bad luck on them I was deeply confused when I heard Well it looks like Rob wasnt too lucky stay tuned for our next contestant too which I blacked outI woke up at the hotel in bed where I instantly began to contemplate what happened during the night I came to the conclusion that it was all just a dream and that my friends found me in the alley that I passed out in They had driven me back to the hotel where I slept the rest of the night away and was now waking up from a drunken dream Ron came into the room where they asked me if I was ok and what I was doing in that alley too which I replied that I just had had one too many drinks They gave me some water and then told me to get ready for breakfast The rest of the day was ok up until we went back to the casino at night I was losing my fortune at craps again so I thought I would count cards at Blackjack again to refund my lossesMy count revealed that the next card too be thrown was going to be a four and I had  points on the table He had thrown  aces kings queens jacks  and so on and so until  to which he had only thrown three I knew that there was no possible way that I could lose so I went all in He picked up the next card and laid it on the table and what I saw I couldnt believe He had laid down the ace of spades which I distinctly remembered getting three games ago I just sat there in disbelief as he ranked in all of my moneyI ran to the atm and took  dollars out of my account and ran back to the blackjack table where I counted cards until that was all I could think about but every time my calculations revealed what the next card was It was always a card that made me go over  I kept running to the atm and running back to the blackjack table but I always lost My bank account was swept clean that night all of the money that I had worked hard for year after year was taken away from me in a few hoursRon Jerry and Max all said that it was just bad luck but I couldnt believe what happened that night It had been a terrible night but not as bad as what happened when I feel asleepI was back on the wheel and everything was exactly the same as the night before except I got a new color This time I landed on purple which lit up the room with the word Truth When I woke up it was the next day and my friends came in and brought me too breakfast That day my company found out I lied to them about the trip when all of my bank account money disappeared and I was fired The bill for the trip was sent to me but I knew I wouldnt be able to pay for it That night I was back on the wheel being spun again for a new colorThis continued for ten days each brought a new horror such as pain or divorce to which I was beaten up by some muggers and then divorced by my wife On the eleventh night I was standing on the stage with the man holding the microphone Lets give it up for Rob Johnson everyone The man yelled and the crowd went wild I was ushered off the stage and was taken into a room with the guy who had the microphoneNice job Mr Johnson He said The crowd loved youWhat was that I asked I demand you tell me at once what is going onOh Im sorry you must be very confused Im Chris Armstrong and I run this show You see whenever someone new comes along we take the number of big sins that that person had committed in the past  hours and we have them face the wheel and its consequences that many times You had  total major sins in that past day so you faced the wheel ten times You sure put a show on for the audienceSins I askedOh yes you committed theft gambling murder you name it You cheated at blackjack you became drunk you beat up a few people and you committed more theft We havent seen a suspect like you for a whileI dont remember anything like that I snapped at himThats probably because you were drunk when most of it happened Dont worry though youll have plenty of opportunities to make up for them laterThis is when a thought occurred to me he said I committed murder but I didnt remember doing or who I did it tooWait who did kill I asked suspiciously You dont know I thought it would have occurred to you by now Lets see if I can make you realize who You got into a fight with him after you left the casino You hurt him pretty bad and in your drunkenness you killed him When he came here we thought that instead of making him face the wheel why not have him push the button that stops the wheel from spinning It was an attraction that brought in a larger crowd than usualThats when I remembered him saying Push the button when youre ready Jerry and how I had gotten into a fight with one of my friends about me cheating at blackjackI killed Jerry I asked in horror but then a new though came into my mind Wait if Jerry is dead and he pressed the button to stop the wheel then does that mean ImYes you are dead Chris said as if he knew exactly what I was about to ask You died of alcohol poisoning when you passed out in the alley The past  days have been a simulation Mr Johnson welcome to HellLucky me,1385266824.0,Lucky Me,18,nosleep,top_week
SpudzOCD,6,7,1rgcw5,10,Hey redditors im new at this so excuse my writing skillsAll through my life ive had things happen that i just couldnt explain ive told a couple of friends but even they dont know what to sayMy story begins when i was a kid about the age of six or seven we lived in a poor neighbourhood in southern Ireland and had a shithole of a house i lived in a room with my two brothers kyle  at the time and Dylan and had been for a couple of years so i was used to sharing a room The first incident occurred after about a year in the house our street was built on a graveyard and happenned in our room it was an ordinary day before it happenned woke up ate breakfast went to school nothing out of the ordinary however when i came home from school that day there was something odd about the house I couldnt quite tell what it was but it just felt wrong But being a kid at the time i thought nothing of it and carried on with my daily routine after dinner and a shower my mom put us to bed After my mom turned out the lights and left the room i began to drift off to sleep after about an hour and a half of hazy dreams i was suddenly awoken by a loud crashing sound kind of like if you dropped a frying pan i quiclky jumped up my pillow and sat upright in bed I looked over to Dylans bed at the other side of the room he ws still asleep I began to question if i had actually heard it at all feeling curious i checked if kyle was awake we had a bunkbed Kyle was on top as i was climbing the four step ladder i felt a burst of cold air rush from kyles bed and immediately dropped to the ground waking up Kylewhat are you doing he saidi heard a noise so i wanted to see ifsshh he stopped me mid sentance and focused his gaze to the back of the room The look on his face will be forever imprinted into my mind I turned around gingerly and what i saw was scary enough to make me cringe even today I saw a scrawny black figure hunched over Dylan who was still asleep But this figure was definately not human It was at least  feet tall its head was overpoweringly large compared to its beyond anorexic body Its fingers were  inches long minimum From what i saw it wore nothing but it very well could have as it was late at night and i was still half asleep Then the image that will haunt me forever It whatever it was turned towards me and Kyle It just stood there staring at us for what felt like forever it then jumped towards us and simply vanished into thin air right before it hit me I was left lying on the floor and Kyle was wondering if what we had just seen was actually real I looked at him and back to Dylans bed whatever it as when it jumped it jumped with enough force to push the blanket off the end of Dylans bed I looked back towards Kyle who was already asleep again and decided to go back to sleep myself not knowing if what wed seen that night was just a figment of our imagination or notWhen i woke up the following morning i hesitantly asked my mom and sister if theyd seen or heard anything last nightthey didnt So i questioned kyle about it and he said that he had no idea what i was on about he had no memory of seeing or hearing anything he didnt even remember me falling off the bunk ladderTo this day i still cant quite figure out what happened that nightMy second experience was only four or five years ago a couple of months after moving to Australia We were living in a pretty old house at the time so it was a bit creaky and what not it was a pretty average day when it happennedI was  and I was once again in bed at the time I was sharing a room with Dylan  at the time Kyle  was in a room across the hallway Jenny  was the next door down and my parents room was at the end of the hallway It was about  at night and we were all just about asleep My mom and stepfather at the time were out exploring the wild clubs of Surfers Paradise so it ws just us kids I was almost asleep when i heard slight footsteps coming from the kithcen area I wondered who it was considering we were all in bed so i opened the door to check I headed towards the kitchen once i reached the living room about halfway to kitchen from my room i could see into the kitchen i slowly emerged from the wall no one thereweird i thought so i headed back to my room but as soon as i turned around Kyle was standing right in front of me with a knife I jumped quicker than id ever jumped before Kyle then laughed his head off and went back to bed I did the same without the laughing I was back in my room now lying in bed realising im too awake to go back to sleep i just lay there for about five minutes staring at the ceiling untill i heard more footsteps in the kitchen I called outKyle go to bed idioti am you fuckwit he said as he emerged from his room half asleepwell then whos upstairs i askedIts probably just a possum in the attic or something dont worryI regretfully closed the door and went back to bed But as soon as i did loud heavy footsteps started making their way down the hallway along with heavy thumping on the walls they were getting closer and a hell of a lot louder It sounded like someone was trying to stomp and bash rats out of the walls and floor It kept coming closer and increasing in volume until it was at the point where it was like gunshots right outside my room It then stomped right outside my door and my door swung open with extreme noise and force and standing at the door was i shit you not the same tall black scrawny fucked up figure that i saw years ago I practically shat myself It stood there for a couple of seconds but if felts like hours then started stomping and sprinted towards my moms room I dont know why but i instantly got up and ran towards the door and looked towards my moms room nothing there it vanished again I dropped to the ground in shock just as Kyle open his door and screamed WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT Its back i saidWhats backthe thing i saw hunched over DylanI stayed up all night that night not wanting to sleep knowing that thing followed us to AustraliaMy most recent encounter with our old friend was last year Wed moved into an old complex of houses that had a bit of a history in the crime side of things Wed been living there for about  months and my friend from primary school Jordan was now living in the complex too It was around PM and it was just Jordan Kyle and I in the house I was playing my ipod at the time Kyle was in the kitchen and Jordan was behind me Kyle decided to pick up a coin and throw it at an unsuspecting Jordan who surprisingly caught it and returned fire but then Jordan moved a little backwards and Kyle threw it further and harder The coin flew through the air right past my head and stopped rigth in front of Jordans face IT LITERALLY STOPPED IN MID AIR it stood still in front of his face for less than a second and then was propelled back towards Kyle with nearly twice the force We all just stood there speechless not knowing if that had really just happened Later that day we were showing a friend what had happened  and were back in the Kitchen messing around with coins to see if it would happen again When suddenly a ball flew through the air at Kyle like it had been thrown with force from the stairs leading upstairs For the second time that day we were utterly speechless and had no idea what to doThat night after Jordan had left and Kyle went to bed i was making a late night snack Dylan was in the living room watching TV and there was nobody else in the house I finished making the snack and was about to head into the living room when in the corner of my eye I saw the figure that i had seen twice before glide upstairs same height same scrawniness same long fingers only this time it was a little misty like a shadow and it looked right into my eyes as it vanished upstairsI am still wondering what the actual fuck that figure is all i know is that my mother has become a clairevoyantI know for a fact that there is definately going to be a lot more of this thing which i have nicknamed the figureFor the time being i will keep an eye out for my little follower and if i see himher again i will not hesitate to report the time date and details of the situation and of course reddit the fuck out of itfor now redditors i bid you farewellEDITUPDATE Ok im rushing this so pardon my writing I was hanging out with Jordan and Kyle during the week and decided to mess with an aboandoned house in the complex Kyle and our friend who will be called W were being the little shits that they are and started knocking on the door of the supposedly haunted house they knocked once nothing they tried again still nothing Then kyle rang the doorbell a couple of timessilence They were about to walk away when something started banging and smashing the door loud enough to make both me and Kyle jump it only lasted for a second or two but it was still freaky as fuck Scared shitless we left the area almost immediately about an hour or two later i was casually riding a bike through the complex Kyle and W were alking behind me there was nothing out of the ordinary when suddenlythe bike screeched to a halt and thrusted to the right about  meters like someone physically pushed with a fuck tonne of force After that i blacked out but according to Kyle W I fell off the bike and somehow ended up standing on my head for about  seconds almost like somebody was holding me upright Kyle and W ran as fast as they could towards me but as soon as they got about  meters from me i dropped to the ground It was at that point when i regained consciousness and the first thing i saw was hand marks on my legs like somebody had just squeezed them as hard as they couldi still havnt seen the figure for a while but im keeping an eye outWill update if anything else happensstay safe and have a nice sleep,1385422010.0,An old friend of mine,17,nosleep,top_week
chrispybigwood,6,9,1rpjmm,10,Im sure many of you are well aware of the famous idea that when a person is at the cusp of death they see memories of their life flash before their eyes According to those who have survived this phenomenon the flashes are slow enough for them to recognize each individual memory and evaluate it It can often lead to epiphanies where one realizes the morality of their life as good or evil and decides to change itIn my youth I was known to dream infrequently and had trouble keeping tabs on my dream journal in my psychology class The few dreams I did have were so mild of temperament and experience that I often forgot they occurred at all I realized at some point this coincided with the fact that I suffered ongoing insomnia and I often stayed up for multiple days at a time My attitude was that life was too short for sleep there were too many things to explore and appreciate to watch them pass idly by in ignorant blissThe only dream I do remember having was one that still terrifies me with every waking moment the one that sends shivers down my spine with every eyelid I see closed I remember waking up in an amorphous environment nothing was memorable except that there was just nothing there Oily shadows which ebbed and flowed in the vast infinity of this abyss before me The experience was in this first person as I looked down and saw my hands feet and body just as how it was in the real world The sheer quality of my vision and perception in this place was like that of a lucid dream mixed with all the governing laws of reality I began to walk aimlessly about hoping to find something or anything in the inky blackness that so completely enveloped me I wandered for what seemed like eternities until finally I came across a single door It was very odd because I had sat down to rest my tired legs and when I looked about again I saw it plain as day like it had always been thereSuddenly a startling clarification encroached my mind Youre not supposed to feel fatigue in a dream not supposed to feel the burden of time I felt the creeping sensation of dread crawl through every fiber of my being as I thought to myself I may never make it out of here or at least not the same What was this place I thought Was it purgatory hell heaven something in between Was I even still dreaming Was this a just punishment for my actions or was this where I must prove myself in some unknown test of character Time would have driven me insane had I not again had the fortune to bring the door into my gaze again Where had it come from What was its purpose Should I enter So many variables to a single constant element in this placeThankfully I had the luxury of time to ponder my decision I decided if I waited long enough I would wake up back in my old familiar house in my old familiar bed and I would wake up safe I felt instead of the previous awe and mystique I saw in the flowing shadows a sense of imminent danger about them I felt there to be an element of malice of hate in there as though it consumed them They were everywhere and there was only one of me Panicked I ran towards the door and thrust it open with all my might leading with my shoulderI was very confused when I arrived on the other side I saw the same overwhelming darkness and looked behind me to find the door so I might escape again It was gone however and I was right back where I started again Alone hungry tired thirsty and altogether desperate I felt myself getting weaker as my will slowly ebbed away as if it was absorbed by this damned oblivion Right then is when I saw itLike a mirage I didnt know if my eyes truly saw it but far in the distance beyond the haze of shadows was a vaguely manshaped figure I called out to it I waved at it each eccentric motion more exacerbated than the last Eventually I ran to it until it got close and then I saw just exactly what this figure was It was meMy view was from behind but I still knew the exact same head of hair the exact same body type the exact same length of the arms and legs the exact same musculature as my own I stopped dead in my tracks and froze every nerve in my body He looked around and stared me dead in the eye and a look of the most honest and real shock I have ever seen swept over his face His jaw gaped wide open his eyes larger than a sinkhole and his eyes locked mine for the briefest of moments And then he ranHe ran away from me with all the speed of a bat out of hell I pursued him but with great difficulty as I felt a pulsating pain in my chest that intensified the closer I got to him When I was just out of arms reach I felt a crushing exhaustion throughout all of my body By some miraculous feat of strength I was able to actually outrun him I wasted no time in leaping on him and tackling him to the ground I felt a shock in me that resounded with more force than if I had been hit with a thunderclap Time seemed to slow as we both fell to the ground and collapsed into it The last thing I saw was his faceI only glimpsed it before I woke up but what I saw haunts my every waking moment His flesh was already cold colder than even dry ice to the touch His skin was pale beyond pale and closer to being an unnatural shade of white unbeknownst to human vision His eyes stared lifelessly dead blank expressionless in no particular direction yet I felt as though they peered into my very soul His lips were crimson red the exact color of the very blood that runs in my veins I saw this and I FELT like a part of me had died when he didI woke up in my bed and threw myself into an upright position upon doing so I looked around the room and made absolutely sure everything was as it should be before letting my resolute guard down It was then that I felt the same overwhelming sense of fatigue and exhaustion I had felt in my dream I was starving and insatiably thirsty Moving any part of my body was met instantly with excruciating pain I looked at my clock to see if it was morning and it read  Satisfied I moved downstairs and cooked a savory meal of bacon and eggs and carried on my day as if nothing had happened until I looked at the messages on my answering machineThere were hundreds of them so many that the answering machine had deleted some of the old ones One was from work informing me that they had fired me from the company after three consecutive no callno shows on the job Another was from my parents wondering if I had got their package requesting that I call them back upon receiving it One was a startled message from my girlfriend wondering if anything was wrong as I missed our date and hadnt communicated with her in three days I listened to all of them and became more and more confused about the situationI looked at the calender to confirm my suspicions and they were proven to be true The current date was indeed three days from when I had fallen asleep before that terrible dream My mind was fucked This meant that not only was it the most realistic and coincidentally the only dream I remembered having but it took place in real time simultaneous to REAL life The fact raised the question though was I suffering from the exhaustion because the dream was real Was the man I killed a version of me in another dimension or universe Was the life I was living now even real Or was I just another version of him in that universe a mystery to be uncovered or a shocking discoveryThoughts raced through my mind as I simply stood there contemplating everything I had ever come to know and understand Should I be alive whats waiting there on the otherside is death really the endThis last question burned and lingered in my mind and I couldnt erase it no matter how hard and fruitlessly I tried It consumed me to the point where I had to kill myself to find out for sure I walked slowly deliberately and with a definite purpose over to the knife rack in the kitchen and picked out the large serrated butcher knife from it I placed it in my hand and envied the feel of the cold steel against my rough calloused palms The feel of the handle and the power to decide life and death at my fingertips I raised it ever so smoothly in the air and placed the blade right against my throat A smile creased my face as I took a deep breath and prepared for the unknownSuddenly in a flash he appeared before me and alarmed me to such a degree where I dropped the knife where it clattered earpiercingly on the floor The silence in that room was absolute and his presence so dominating that the only thing my eyes could focus on were him This was an impossibility though wasnt he dead Hadnt I felt his life force cease to be just as I felt the connection between us cease How is any of this making sense how could any of this happen in real lifeHe stood there solemn and unwavering in his posture His face showed not the slightest trace of emotion as he raised an outstretched arm and pointed a long finger in my direction His voice was calm yet boomed in the deafening silence He said four simple words which chilled my bones more than the dream ever could Four simple words that confirmed my worst fears and suspicions which lurked at the bottom of my subconscious mind He said simply Was I not enoughHe vanished after that He didnt fade from existence or blink into nothingness he simply vanished One moment I was looking right at him and the next he was gone I couldnt believe anything that had happened this had to be a nightmare I pinched myself I cut myself to see if I still bled I screamed I clawed at the walls I begged a merciful God in pity to not let this be real Eventually I conceded defeat and laid on the floor with eyes transfixed on the ceiling and closed my eyes But this time I never woke up,1385733288.0,Evasion of a

buttootz,4,8,1rl0m6,11,Im not entirely sure if this is where this belongs but I dont know where else to put it Last night I had the scariest experience of my life it was extremely surreal It begins with me falling asleep as most of this is a dreamIn my dream I was a little not myself just a little girl Ive never seen I was living in a subdivision with my mother but she constantly hid from the neighbors she would go out in public but no one would ever notice her One afternoon my mom was getting home and the neighbors children were in their back yard which butted up to ours playing kickball Eventually the ball ended up in our yard when one of the little girls came into the backyard to get her ball my mom ran outback to greet her Think I can make the ball into that trash can over there She pointed over to a trash can on the complete opposite side of the yard the little girl just giggled and encouraged her to try She kicked the ball and it appeared to be going nowhere near the trash can All of a sudden the ball bounce off a tree and slowly balance along the telephone wire and went straight into the trash can upon impact the trash can ignited in flames The little girl stood frozen watching the trash can burn and just as slowly as ever a trail of fire began leading towards the little girl who stood frozen in fear The fire caught the little girl and completely turned her body to ash from her feet all the way to her neck leaving just a smokey charred head I ran over to her and as I was running towards her parents realized she was missing and came looking for her upon seeing her they were obviously devastated and they called the cops The cops came over and questioned my mom The whole time I just stood there and watched her lie to the cops telling them she had no idea how it happened I couldnt tell the cops what happened because I was scared of what she might do to me The next thing I know were in the grocery store I remember being in the produce aisle and there was a bigger guy with us All of a sudden this guy had me bent over a sink gagging me with his hand of mushed up fruit The whole time he was chanting some kind of verse I remember feeling so weak sick and helpless He just kept trying to stuff his whole arm down my throat like he was trying to climb inside me I kept fighting him periodically he would stop forcing his arm down my throat only to ask me if I was ready to commit I had no clue what he was talking about After what seemed like hours of this happening I just took his hand and shoved it down my throat I just gave in I couldnt handle it anymore I woke up in his body and he was in mine I was just drained I couldnt focus I didnt know what was going on He was carrying me and asking himself what he should with my corpse because he thought I was dead When he realized that I was still alive he set me down and wiped all the fruit and vomit off my mouth kissed me and walked off leaving me to die When I woke up I could taste the vomit in my mouth I looked to the clock at it was  am I did not feel right something was off I got up and went into my parents room to tell them what happened because I was so freaked out While I was explaining the dream I felt something running down my leg when I looked it was blood I was bleeding and it ran all the down to my ankles,1385573248.0,Demonic Dream,19,nosleep,top_week

SprightlyMonkey,2,8,1r98ph,8,Most people no matter what their age cant really remember many things before the age of  barely anyone can remember most of their life before the age of  I know that my earliest living memory was when I was  when my younger brother was born Its odd that after it all of all the things I couldve remembered its that which is stuck in my mind When after it all I was left with but a notepad with three notes A URL an address and some jottings And thus I take it upon myself to inform you of all that Ive learned in these past few hoursI dont really know who I am any more Im a tall gangly male with long black hair and the only name I have to go on is the pseudonym Im using to convey this message I know that once I was interested in psychology and philosophy These things mixed together to form a fondness for one thing in particular I slowly became obsessed with working out how memories worked why we had them and how they formed Of course you have the scientific answers but thinking back they dont really provide you with much explanation Very very few people if any can remember their birth perhaps the single most important events of your entire life and barely anyone can remember it Dont you think it odd that whilst we remember inconsequential things like our first tooth falling out or how you grazed your knee when falling off your bike you cant remember being born People will put it down to a theory called Childhood Amnesia where adults find it difficult to recall early memories as children havent got fully developed limbic systems But how come there are exceptions to this ruleOf course the answer is I dont know Or more rather as horribly ironic as it is I forgot I know that I did research this I did a load of it In as much detail as I could It was a personal project of mine one I know Id been working on for a long time Again God knows how long I forgot that too It all feels like an eternity ago now considering Ive forgotten it all I suppose that its my own fault considering I brought myself into this I went perusing into areas one shouldve left untouched as far as this transcript can tell me And that has landed me deeper in whatever mire I find myself in than I can assume most others ever have And that scares me Not because I fear for my life definitely not I am literally nothing now with nothing to my name but this notebook and what I am writing here I suppose you want to know what the jottings are Well theyre in two parts The first parts are like stage directions with little annotations in handwriting I can only assume is my own describing the setting presumably so I can find my way back there The second part is a statement A saying or a speech or something So without further ado I shall do my best to relay this scriptI am sat at a bench at my local green Its a cold dark winters evening with heavy air hanging over me Across from me stands a man who is much better equipped for the cold than I Hes wearing a large overcoat with the collar rolled up around his cheeks and a small hat stuck atop his presumably bald head He looks about  the only reason I can tell being the soft amber hue from his cigarette betraying his wrinkles lined with a rushed stubble with awkward tufts slightly bushier than the rest The wisps keep rising up and obscuring my view of his glassy eyes If I didnt know any better I wouldve said he had been crying but thats silly He stands a good inch or so higher than me and makes an effort not to slouch Whenever he speaks to me he addresses me very carefully and politely referring to me as Sir or Mister and making sure to annunciate every syllable as if a single mistake would betray him This makes his speech slow but not staggered he has no difficulty in speaking properly but he is deliberately taking care He isnt particularly stocky but nor is he lanky Hes a perfect medium Hes addressing me gesturing for me to approach him Hes ushering me on now waving his hand as if to say for me to fall in behind him I do so Hes leading me to a flat the address is written here but for your protection I shant be putting it in until I can confirm its safety Its very well kept  rooms All doors are shutHes gone into the room straight ahead of the sofa Im sat on shutting the door behind him Im not sure how but I dont think he noticed thisThis next part is not in the same handwriting as above Its very intricate certainly whoever wrote it took their time There are however mistakes Very obvious mistakes but I cannot figure out what theyre for I think that that may be why I am writing to you now to see if you can assist meDearest Curious Inquirer It is my solEmn duty to regretfully inform you that you have gone far enough in your scour for the true workings of the human mind It is a sincere wasTe of a life lived too litTle for me to have to extingUish but you leave me with no other option You simply have discovered toO much The real worry that I have is that I may have intervened far too late However there is no use in dwelling upon these mistakes They are mine and mine alone I was charged with the protection of your Blood and that is a duty which I can onLy suffer for so long Our exIstence is insufferable at times I can only imagine how yours must be liVing without such core memories so many thIngs that you must hold so dearly important Of courSe you meaning you alone Everyone else is too ignorant to go out and look for that which has been taken from them Theyre Content with the answers theyre provided with acting as if there isnt exemption to the socalled rules One shoe it would appear does not fIt all I truly wish I could reward your innovation I honestly do In as many years I have desired a chase such as this Something I can truly be proud of If you remember one thing which is highly unlikely I want it to be that your childhood is something you have to keep Once its lost its lostThe infinite possibilities of a childs mind is often labelled as immature but tell me can an adult construct a story from but a pen paper and some squiggles Do we consider men like Picasso to be immature and simpleminded How can something so infinite and yet so delicate be incomplete You mislabel it as immaturity when in fact childlike wonder is a blessing A blessing lost to age because it no longer suits you It doesnt fit the world youre entering That is why you are stripped of it We act simply as you askYou brought your lack of memory upon yourself Persist in finding it at your own perilYour SaviourIf you can find any information on

JustAnotherLondoner,1,9,1r8zg3,11,Last year my brother Liam fell ill and took himself to hospital He wasnt insanely ill but due to the fact that he kept fainting and falling into things he felt the hospital was the safest place for himself to be After an examination he was told that an ear infection was causing his balance to be off and him to faint They kept him in for observation until he stopped fainting and would be safe at home alone He told me that the first night he couldnt sleep The man in the bed next to him would groan throughout the night in agony He didnt know what was wrong with him but it was too late for a nice chat so he remained silent The second night wasnt much different but Liam managed to sleep for a few hours from about am until around am He hadnt faint for a while and felt he was getting a lot better hoping that he would be able to go home soonLater that day the man in the bed next to him awoke Hi Im Jim He introduced himself What are you in for My brother explained his ear infection and that he had fainted and fallen into things and asked why Jim was hereWell He began I dont really know I was only in here for a broken leg initially Then I fell ill I think theyre keeping me hereWhat How Liam asked When I was close to recovery I told the nurses that I felt ready to go home Later that night I woke up to see a nurse leaving my bed She didnt see me but I noticed that my leg felt funny I think she did something to it I dont know what but the next day I fell terribly ill with pneumonia This was nearly a week ago and im still here not getting much better Dont tell them when youre ready to go home just go His face was dead serious Liam was a bit worried about Jims story but assumed he was a bit crazy and paranoid about the nurses He ignored Jims advice and told the nurse that he was ready to go home He felt the disappointed gaze of Jim fall upon him as the nurse walked awayWell Good luck Jim sighed I hope they let you out Thanks Liam replied The nurse later returned and confirmed that the doctor would look at his ears the following day That night Liam had another restless night Jim was groaning again but Liam was beginning to grow used to that Suddenly the groaning stopped The silence of the night was instead met with the screams of JimAARGHH STOP GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME DONT YOU DARE PUT THAT NEEDLE NEAR ME FUCK OFF the curtain was closed around him Liam couldnt see what was going on He was too scared to speak The curtain swiped open Liam pretended to be asleep his eyes slightly open He saw a nurse leave Jims bed Jim was laying in his bed holding his legs AAre you okay Liam whispered What the fuck just happened I told you man The nurses are keeping me here They saw that I was getting better again and she just stuck a fucking needle in my leg again Im not getting out of here any time soon Jim replied He revealed his leg to Liam  there was a small hole with blood dripping out of it He had indeed been injected with something Liam laid down in shock Jim decided that now the attack was over it was safe to sleep When Liam awoke the following morning Jim was gone Liam asked a nurse where Jim was and the nurse apologetically replied Mr Morris passed away late last night How could that be He was well enough to hold a conversation with Liam just hours earlier to his apparent death The injection It must have been the injection I visited Liam later that day and he told me of the events He begged me to sign him out and get him home that day He was desperate He was not in safe hands there after all I tried to sign him out but the doctor assured me that it was in the best interest to stay one more night to ensure the infection had completely cleared I reluctantly agreed I visited again the next day and Liam was in a terrible state He was pale his face was sweaty He even had a temperature he was in a much worse state to what I had seen him like the day before The doctor told me it was just a side affect of the medicine they had given him Liam told me otherwise They attacked me Kate Thats the only way i can describe it I was pretending to sleep late last night and a nurse came in She rolled me over and prepared my leg for an injection You know what they do they wipe it with some sort of liquid I startled her when I asked her what she was doing She told me it was just procedure I asked her to stop and said that id rather not have the treatment She got aggressive Called another nurse One held me down while she injected me I screamed but nobody came Now all of a sudden Im ill Im not getting out of here Kate Im going to die in this bed Just like Jim He began rocking back and forth as I tried to comfort him He was soaked with sweat I asked his doctor what was wrong with him and the doctor told me it was pneumonia My heart sunk It was just like Jim Liam was right  he wasnt safe here I needed to get him out Ill be back tomorrow to get you out of here I told Liam They wont let me today and now that they have a clue that I want to get you out theyre all watching me I was almost escorted out when I shouted at the doctor Tomorrow I can do it quietly when im not being watched so closely Liam agreed The following day I returned to the hospital Liam told me the nurse had not returned that night I put him in a wheelchair and took him to the toilets I gave him some clothes that I had collected from his apartment and he changed I asked a nurse to bring me any belongings he had left with the desk stating that he had asked me to take them home for him The nurse agreed and brought me his things without a word We escaped and I took him home Before leaving we slyly stole the sign out clip board and Liam was able to sign it He was legally free Three days later Liam was found dead in his apartment The pneumonia had gotten worse and without treatment took his life He left a note It read I was taken into the hospital with an ear infection I left without said ear infection but with bigger problems I was abused I have made a realization either the secret injections being given are procedures to keep population down or they are ways to make medicine companies

iamphiip,6,4,1rq1mr,15,I met Chris the summer before high school when his parents moved to town and our mothers became good friends Over time we became friends good friends and then best friends We remained close throughout high school but then he moved to Florida to work with his father and I joined the Army We still stayed in touch but a couple years went by before we saw each other again    I was taking leave for a few weeks and decided to swing by Florida for a few days before heading back to Korea for another year Chris picked me up at the airport and we spent the drive back to his apartment catching up The most interesting conversation was when he mentioned his apartment was haunted Shortly after Chris and his dad moved into the apartment Chris felt a strange presence in his bedroom The temperature in his room would drop several degrees even when the air conditioner was off and his computer chair would swivel for no apparent reason when he was on the opposite side of the room He told me he never felt threatened but he was sure his apartment was haunted    He told me he started his own investigation He read about a technique that was supposed to facilitate communication with the ghost He took a writing pad and pencil asked a question several times out loud then cleared his mind and started writing It would be jibberish at first something along the lines of safvhagjnLGFDKsfbvaDGSLKNdjghACKK After some time words would start to form as the ghost used Chris energy to direct the motion of his hand From this technique Chris learned the ghosts name was Jeremy and that he had committed suicide in that same room about a year before Chris moved in Jeremy said he was  when he died and he was lonely    Chris was skeptical at first but when he asked around the apartment complex he discovered that a  year old named Jeremy had in fact hung himself in the same apartment about a year before Chris and his father moved in The fact that this information matched exactly to the answers on the writing pad convinced Chris that Jeremy was a real ghost and really haunted the apartment    When we arrived at Chris apartment he showed me the writing pad and then told me he was going to take me into his bedroom and introduce me to Jeremy He said he needed to introduce me because Jeremy didnt like visitors and would sometimes make them feel uncomfortable until Chris told Jeremy to dial it down because the visitor was a friend Chris and I walked into his bedroom and he said out loud Jeremy this is Dylan He is my best friend and I want you to treat him with respect and be nice to him    The rest of the day passed without incident That night Chris offered to sleep on the couch and let me sleep in his bed if I was alright with that I said it was fine I was still skeptical about the ghost and I thought it might be an interesting adventure to sleep in a haunted room I was pretty reckless back then when I was in the Army I thought I was invincible so I didnt even consider that this might be a bad idea Besides Chris introduced me and Jeremy had never acted out against Chris friends once they had been properly introduced    I decided to do a little of my own investigating after Chris went to sleep I took out the writing pad asked Jeremy if he liked me cleared my mind and started writing After a while I must have fallen asleep because I had a nightmare that I couldnt breathe In the dream it felt like my throat was full of foam and there was a huge weight pushing down on my chest My throat burned and tightened but when I brought my hands up nothing was there I struggled and kicked and clawed at my chest and neck but the burning and the inability to breathe only got worse All my strength and Army training was useless Finally I had that falling sensation and woke up  Chris woke me up He said he had been asleep until he heard me thrashing around in the bedroom He came to check on me and found me sitting up against the wall asleep with my hands around my throat When he woke me up he said I slid down the wall a couple inches as if something had been holding me up off the matress My neck was sore so I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror I had bruises around my neck in a distinct pattern It wasnt bruises from my hands it was obviously a bruise from a rope    I went back into the bedroom and Chris was staring at the writing pad He asked me what I had been doing so I told him He showed me the writing pad and he was pale Among the scribbles and random letters was something I do not remember writing It said Jeremy is ONLY best friend,1385750356.0,A ghost tried to steal my best friend,19,nosleep,top_week

kenandmforever,1,2,1rc5s5,8,Hey guys Longtime lurker first time posterI guess I finally have something to post about Everythings just been wrong the past few weeks I miss her so much I know this isnt a therapy subreddit or anything but I was just thinkingmaybe if I can get these thoughts out theyll stop bothering me Its just I should have been paying attention you know I should have seen something was wrong But I didnt and now shes gone and its all my faultI guess I should start at the beginning She was my first serious girlfriend  Ill call her M to protect her privacy Last thing I would want is her family finding out Im talking about this on some site for thousands to see Anyway M and I worked together at a tutoring place on campus It was my first job and I was nervous but she helped me figure everything out M was really shy  she could almost never meet my eye and her voice was superquiet  but really sweet once I coaxed her into talking I got the impression she didnt think too highly of herself whenever I tried talking to her about her major or anything shed change the subject All I really got was that she was a Bio major and she was working on some research project about some new cestoda whatever that meant But she liked hearing about me and my major  English Ive never been scienceinclined  and laughed at my jokes and everything so we had a good timeAfter our shifts were over wed go to the Subways down the street sometimes I would always offer to get her something but she always turned me down She would just watch me eat while we sat together It always made me feel kinda bad especially since she was so small it was like eating in front of an African kid or something But she never seemed to mind so I got over it We became good friendsEventually I asked her out for dinner and a movie I cant even remember what we saw  some remake horror flick about mindcontrolling carnivorous worms or something  but we had a good time We were laughing through the whole thing and she kept pointing out the impossibilities and throwing all her science knowledge around I dont want to sound weird but I found it pretty hotBut by the time we got back to the car she had stopped smiling She said she didnt feel too good like she was sick or something She said she wanted to walk back to her apartment  she lived just off campus and was really big into fitness and everything  but it was like twenty minutes away and in the middle of the night so I drove her home She got out said goodnight and that was it No kiss nothingI went home thinking I had blown it but when we had the same shift again she was really happy Kept saying shed had a great time and everything So we went out on a few more dates I let her pick what we did  she never wanted to go out to eat but she did teach me how to ice skate and we went on a few hikes even some k runs Those were the worst but it was worth it to see the way she lit up At the end of each one I kept wanting to kiss her but she was really sheepish about it Every time I went in for one shed turn her head or peck me on the cheek before I could She was always embarrassed about it and apologized but I figured she just wasnt ready she didnt seem the type to have done a lot of dating herself That was fine I wasnt going to rush her into anythingThe first time we kissed was like three weeks after we started dating  and I wont say anything but wow At this point I realized I was completely head over heels for this girl She was smart she was funny and she liked me which was different from most girls We started going steady after that  and thats when everything started changing The signs that something was wrong had been present before but they really should have become apparent afterwards God Im so stupidShe started wearing big baggy clothes to work  huge stifling sweaters that sort of thing I wondered if one of the guys at work was hitting on her or something and making her uncomfortable but they were all either huge or really friendly and I didnt want to ask She would shake sometimes too like she was cold even when she was being swallowed up by these enormous shirts Id hug her and shed lean into me but it was like I couldnt even feel her underneath the clothes She started eating a lot Like I mean a ton When we went to Subway now shed put away two footlongs like it was nothing I took her out to a few ritzy places but the portions were always too small so we would end up getting burgers or something afterwards I didnt really mind  it was nice to see that she felt comfortable enough to stuff herself around me I guess We were kissing a lot more too which was of course awesome Because of her I was into hiking and stuff now so I felt great Everything seemed perfect Maybe thats why I wasnt noticing the signsI stayed over at her place a few times as things got more serious but we never went too far She was still embarrassed about that sort of thing I think  but that was fine I could wait Her couch was still infinitely better than my dorm bed anyway and her fridge was always heaped with food  mostly meat granted but Im no vegetarian Despite all her eating though she seemed to be getting thinner Her face was paler and she was more withdrawn Sometimes she would just stare into space for half an hour at a time not saying anything only to shake herself as I touched her or called her name a few times She started calling into work sick and when I visited her she would just be curled up on her couch heaped in blankets the remnants of some sandwich or a pizza box scattered around her I started to get worried but I wasnt worried enoughOnce when we were making out for a moment I felt something more than just her tongue in my mouth The feeling didnt really leap out at me  it was just a sort of niggling sensation swallowed up by everything else that was going on  but I kinda stopped and she drew back and looked at me with curiosity I swallowed ran my tongue around my mouth a few times but decided I had just imagined it Then she asked what was wrong and something flickered in her eyesI dont mean that in a poetic Englishmajory way I mean I literally thought I saw something tiny dart through her eyeI freaked out needless to say but she was just confused She said she didnt feel anything and even when I shined a light on her eye to see for sure there was nothing there I thought I was just going a little bit crazy so she went to bed and I stayed on the couch I shouldnt have dismissed it I should have taken her to the doctor Damn it why didnt IThings got worse She stopped coming into work entirely and I began taking time off to go make sure she was okay Her staring into space was more pronounced than before as was her shaking When she got up and walked around it was disjointed like she had forgotten how to use her body And she kept asking for food all the time At first it was just sandwiches then it was hamburgers then it was just the burger itself Then once she asked if I could just give one to her rawI was taken aback disgusted but she just looked so pitiful shrinking into her bed with all her pillows and everything fluffed up around her So I did Well I cooked it a little but it was still plenty pink in the middle when I brought it to her She ate the whole thing gave me a sleepy smile and fell asleepI went back to my couch silently freaking out It was all too weird for me Id never heard of anything like this Id heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever or whatever but this was ridiculous I decided I was going to take her to the doctor the next morning whether she wanted to go or notBut when the morning came she wasnt in bed I could hear the shower running in her bathroom Frankly I was a bit surprised she could even manage to walk that far as weak as she seemed But I decided Id give her some space if she was showering maybe she was feeling betterI decided Id go and make myself a sandwich When I came back the shower was still running which was weird It had been more than thirty minutes  I had ended up making myself a second sandwich and had eaten a hot dog too I was just weirdly hungry Anyway by now I was a little concerned I had no idea how long she had been in there before I had woken up and she wasnt the kind to take really long showers anywayM I called opening the door a crack You okayNo responseMStill nothing God the sound of the water hitting her is still in my headI stepped inside The steam was almost blinding there was a window she usually opened to let most of it out but it was closed MI pulled back the curtain and there she was sprawled on the tile blood pooling around her fractured skull her eyes gazing sightlessly upwards as the rain pelted her naked body But that was not the worst part The worst part was that she looked like a skeleton I still remember those pictures of the Holocaust victims we all see in high school where they look more dead than alive that was exactly what she looked like She was so painfully thin it was a wonder she had managed to walk on her matchstick legs at all Her ribs looked like they were about to poke through her skin But her bellythat was round and full like the distended ones you see in those images of African children on the charity commercials I knelt by her but of course there was nothing I could do She was long gone She must have collapsed and hit herself on the temperature knob on the way down It didnt look as though she had struggled at all she would have died almost instantlyI stayed there for a long time just staring A few times I thought I saw her stomach move  but of course that was crazy It was just the way the water hit her Then in a daze I left I called   even though it was far past that now obviously  and explained what had happened The lady on the phone promised to send a cops and an ambulance my way immediately even though there was no needThen I sat down and made some baconI cant even really remember what happened when they arrived There were just people swarming all over my house suddenly Two big cops started asking me questions I dont really remember what I said They kept asking me why I was eating and I just kept repeating that I was hungry over and over One said I needed to go to the station with them so I didWhile I was there they wouldnt give me any food not even a bag of chips no matter how much I asked They kept asking me how I couldnt have known she was starving how I couldnt have known something was wrong over and over and over All I could say was that I didnt know Shed hidden it all from me with her huge clothes and thick blankets I kept saying if I had known I would have helped her I would have saved her Now I know she was too far gone for that of course I hadnt seen the signs in time and it was too lateEventually they let me go Later in the day someone called her apartment but I didnt pick up A doctor I think or maybe a coroner They left a message Something about her stomach It sounded important but I couldnt bring myself to listen again I wandered around her apartment for hours touching everything that had belonged to her as if it would bring her back As if I could take back her mistakes and mineShe must have had some sort of eating disorder I guess Looking back the way she acted when we first met sounds like classic anorexiabut then it must have changed into something else I dont know Maybe she was eating a lot and then throwing it up  Ive heard about that on TVSometimes I cant help but think back to her stomach how swollen it had been how deformed I have no idea what could have caused that But it doesnt really matter now does it Shes dead and its my faultIm sorry guys Theres not a whole lot else I can say The past few weeks have just been awful They kept it out of the news but somehow people keep asking me about it anyway wondering why I didnt do something why I didnt see I dont know Ive just been living in a daze since it happened like I cant feel anything at all Nothing seems right Sometimes my hands kinda jerk on their own when Im just zoning out I keep waking up in the middle of the night feeling like Im starving but I think Ive been losing weight Grief probably Ive heard it can do that to you I really dont know I just kinda wish it would endAgain Im sorry This is a lot to dump on you all but I just have to get it out Im going to post this and then lie down for awhile I think I havent gone to work in four days now Just havent felt up to it Maybe make myself a burger  that sounds good Dont think Ill cook it though My stomach seems to handle it better when its fresh,1385276326.0,Cestoda,10,nosleep,top_week

he arced the car across the road onto the shoulder and back into the opposing lane headed to the center of town I was smushed against the door and then the back of my seat as he gunned the accelerator giving the engine a run for its money and losing traction briefly in the process My heart hammered in my chest and shocks of adrenaline coursed through my body This was it I was dying My mom my sister both dead Now it was my turn Two minds swam around inside my skull like binary stars poised to collapse together They took turns rocking back and forth faster and faster each feeling the pull of the other as they battled for control of my body Faster and faster approaching singularity vibrating my perspective like an engine in a car numbing my face and fingertips Black encroached upon my vision as I drowned in fresh air and then all was darkness appendix looks alright Given her recent loss and the trauma she must have experienced witnessing the crash its likely she had a panic attack Has this happened beforeNo never I opened my eyes I inhaled Sickness and death coated the inside of my nostrils I pictured my sinuses and lungs darkening as though I was inhaling smoke from an electrical fire Yellowed fluorescence glared down at me from the ceiling Misery seeped into my pores and tugged my heart in several directions at once Someone nearby was about to die and so many were sufferingI heard beeping and someone yelled for a crash cart Right on timeI was alive and I was myself But the definition of myself had changed I felt distinctly like one person yet knew that I consisted of two beings We had fused together the silver lady and I and I was equal parts both I examined my skin its ghostly sheen A greenish corkscrewshaped worm drifted over my bed briefly silhouetted against the glow of the fluorescent lights and sighed dreamilyWell that was differentOh thank Christ youre awake my dad halfsobbed lurching toward my side and away from the doctorIm fine Dad I think I had a panic attack A small purple leechlike thing with white spots had attached itself to his face while I was talking and slurped at a tear that had just trickled past It shivered ecstatically and began purringI thought you were dying I just  it would have been too much he said brushing another tear off and inadvertently dislodging the leechkitten thing It screeched and flitted away with a farting noiseI consulted my expanded library of memories  from when I was the silver lady Strange and very hungry creatures loved to gather at hospitals They fed off the dying the vulnerable the grieving It seemed to be a drug for many of the darker things in the world I mused to myself that fire was used to keep those pests away before it was used to cook meat People were so much more in tune with reality before language let the mind shape perceptionThe doctor checked me over and kept me awhile for observation Dad and I left with a small prescription of Xanax and a referral to a local therapist I knew I wouldnt be needing either now but also that it would reassure my dad to go I couldnt think of anything I wouldnt do to make him feel better and mentally shruggedI wanted to go pick up my car but Dad would have none of it His tone told me that hed rather walk through Hell than let me out of his sight right now and I couldnt blame him We went straight home and I stared out the window in fascination A herd of giant spotted fuzzy caterpillars were crawling across the road on the way out of town wiggling phallic appendages on their backs quivering with the motion We rolled the car straight through the middle of them and several popped with a glurping sound like balloons full of soft pulpy pudding A tall lanky semitransparent humanoid was licking the red paint on a stop sign several miles later with a blue fuzzy tongue the size of my dads knobby hands It paused when we pulled up and stepped over to the car in two long strides I was slightly embarrased to notice before it stooped over that its wrinkly penis was the size of my forearm I stared into one set of its chameleonlike eyes and smiled its other eyes were flitting around and examining the car It licked the window leaving a slimy trail that lingered until we were nearly homeThe vast majority of the spiritual wildlife that hides in plain sight is harmless or mostly so I knew Extremely weird and illogical yes but for the most part its interactions with the world we know are trivial Hardly surprising that we dont see much of it considering the human desire for an orderly world was a tiny sixarmed ape just fucking my ear canal or did that song get stuck in my head on its own No no earfuckers here no sirMy dad and I were both exhausted when we reached the house I broke off to the kitchen while dad meandered to the living room I popped open the freezer looking for my jumbosized tub of neapolitan ice cream and was greeted by a tiny pixielike critter with the head of a fly It burst out of the freezer and shook its tiny segmented fist shivering hard enough to affect its flightSorry I thought at it as though I had been telepathic my whole life Which technically I suppose I had beenDamn right it thought back It shot me the middle finger and buzzed off phasing through the solid glass window and toward the treelineYeah spirits are like that sometimesI grabbed my tub of ice cream and a spoon because this was not a day for diets I marched into the living room and plopped down beside my dad who was just settling down himself He turned the television on and it was set much louder than it needed to be I jumped and so did the shadowy figure in the corner It began screaming bloody murder Shocked I mentally yelled at it to quiet down but I apparently didnt get through Dad almost immediately turned the television down but the figure only screamed louder and my ears began to hurt I silently tried to reason with it for fifteen minutes to no avail In exasperation I asked if it wanted some ice cream and to my great delight it quieted down I took the tub back into the kitchen shadow man in tow and scooped out a spoonful of icecream into a little saucer which I sat in the sink I wasnt really sure what it was going to do with frozen dessert but I didnt really care as long as it was quiet about it I grabbed my bottle of Xanax off the counter and tipped a couple into my palm because it was most definitely a day for anxiolytics I tossed them back and swallowed dry and then went back into the living room taking my tub The living silhouette stayed behindDad left the station on the news until it mentioned the crash and then he channel surfed for awhile Between the sedatives and the ice cream I wasnt paying much attention I whittled the strawberry down to almost nothing and then half of the chocolate before I realized I was really full and put the tub back up The shadow man was gone and the ice cream in the saucer had warmed and melted I mentally shrugged for the second time that day which reminded me I needed to set up the therapy appointment I grabbed the sheet of paper with the name and number on it called and scheduled an appointment The earliest they had was about two and a half weeks from then and would probably last an hour and a half and could I please come early to get the paperwork filled out I said I would and thank you very much then hung up I wrote the appointment down on the fridge calendar so I wouldnt forgetI chuckled softly to myself I was Alice falling down the rabbit hole I needed a shaman not a shrink but I doubted either one could help me and I thought back to the memories of my mothers death of the wound in the world that had taken her away from me I saw it over and over again each time the person was different and so was the setting The memories stretched back to antiquity to the times before the written word before hatred took the form of words at all I knew that specter so well To call it the devil would be misleading To call it evil an oversimplification I felt righteous fury well up inside me a gift of the silver lady a pure singleminded longing for cleansing fireAnd then I felt the distinct impression that somewhere dark and far away an eye had opened and turned its gaze on meI heard the voice as an echo carried on the wind from across a great chasmMy Sarah How youve grownThe

octowhiskers,20,9,1rb8eu,5,WebmorePrimaryno subjectNicole Skewesto me minutes agoDetailsSince the no sleep community knows about some of this stuff I was wondering if you guys can help me out and maybe tell me what this thing is   Throughout my life Ive had a couple experiences that a normal human being might perceive asodd Though slightly nerve wracking at times Ive been able to brush them off They were all dismissed on account of lack of sleep or my stressful lifestyle That was until four years ago Four years ago began the string of events that now has my questioning my sanity Because of what happened and what has continued happening for the past four years I have to sleep with a nightlight when I am alone Even though Im almost twenty years old   I remember the day clearly I was fifteen years old Fifteen and brave Fifteen and oblivious What did I know about anything anyway   I came home from school as usual It was such a normal and uneventful day Painfully boring really It was a Friday and at  I didnt have much to do after school Especially because the weekends were my fathers days and he had a strict curfew of before  in place No sleepovers either I didnt mind this because I didnt have any chores to do I was free to stuff my face with pizza and play video games all weekend It was a pretty good setup   After playing with my GameCube for what seemed like ten hours I was ready for bed I sauntered off to the washroom went through the motions of bedtime and was soon in what I considered pajamas Just an old tank top and old gym shorts really I climbed into bed without a worry or care After getting situated I quickly drifted off into dreamland   A couple hours later I woke up I had to pee And bad I sat up in bed and waited for my eyes to adjust My light switch was on the other end of the room and Im not the neatest person I wanted to be sure I could make shapes out so I wouldnt step on anything on my way to the door   A couple seconds went by and my eyes adjusted The room grew a few shades lighter and things were coming into view That is except for a spot in front of my bed   At the foot of my bed was a large shadow It appeared to be the silhouette of a very tall person I sat there almost in a trance Dazed and confused And as I continues staring I noticed something There were absolutely no features to it It was just a black mass Thats when I understood This thing wasnt human    I frantically blinked hoping my eyes were just playing tricks on me After every blink it was still there Fucking staring at me And whatever it was it hated me I could feel the malice coming off in waves I knew it wanted to hurt me To do something awful The worst part was I was powerless to stop it   Fear washed over me I could feel ice in my spine lead in my stomach I was completely paralyzed I was at its mercy My heart felt as if it would burst out of my chest If that thing didnt rip it out first I sat there and we stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity Then it moved    Slowly but surely it came closer and closer to my bed My terror was reaching its peak I was drenched in sweat But I couldnt muster up a sound That is until it moved again Slowly it bent over me It was getting closer as if it meant to come face to face with me I gathered every ounce of courage I had I shut my eyes and began screaming at the top of my lungs   A few seconds later my dad came rushing in Tears began streaming down my face and all I could say was Theres something in my room My dad mistook something as someone so he checked my window which was still locked Then he checked my closet which was still empty He dismissed it as a nightmare But I know what I saw I slept with the light on that night And every night since then when Im alone I sleep with a small lamp on A couple of times I felt brave and I have tried to sleep without a light But I swear I can feel something there And that is not the last time my own personal tormentor came to visit either Does anyone know what it might be,1385245041.0,Can anyone tell me what the hell this thing might be,14,nosleep,top_week
Insomnniia,4,11,1rmq6o,6,Ive always been a cynic impossible to convince As long as I can remember Ive needed  proof before Id belie anything The events of the past  hours theyve changed my perception of real or true Ill start from the beginning You decide what to take from it because Ive still yet to find an understandingDetermining if one is in a dream or not can be the hardest task the mind can tackle When youre awake surreality tends to stand out like a sore thumb but its quite the opposite when asleep The comfort of a dream will cause you to overlook anything out of the ordinary  but what if theres no feeling of comfort What if you have full reign of your senses What happens when you can no longer trust the information your senses are relaying to youIt started as normal as any day Ive lived in my past  years of life I awoke in my bed checking the time on my phone A red flag rose when my eyes were able to focus on the screen The time read FE As any person would I passed it off as a software malfunction was I ever naïve I continued my morning wakeup checking my facebook on my phone getting dressed etc It wasnt until I left my room that my head started to buzzI opened the door of my bedroom Do you believe in the supernatural I dont  or at least I didnt Ive since reconsidered my standpoint I entered the room on a cautious foot  The couch the side table and the chairs were all afloat suspended in midair I slowly approached the hovering furniture My fingertips grazed the fabric of the chair the chair spun as I grazed it as if they were weightlessA heart dropped The furniture flipped upside down and abruptly slammed against the roof I stepped back feeling for the wall to guide me In the pitch black I fumbled my hands around looking for the doorknob to the bathroom  The small nightlights glow was dimmer than usual I stepped into the room slowly quietly closing the door behind me An eruption of grinding steel burst from the walls My eyes fixed on the mirror before me as it began to bleed its colour down the wall leaving behind a clear sheet of glassThe silver pigment of the mirror ran onto the floor bursting into a million tiny shards The shards moved and pulsed inching toward me Stepping back my foot met the razorsharp shards I stumbledA burning searing pain began creeping through my foot Losing balance knocked the door open I tumbled to the floor Scrambling out of the door frame I turned kicking the door to the bathroom shut Scrambling to my feet I headed for the stairs Still attempting to cradle my foot I reached the first stair of the set Something seemed off I couldnt shake the unerring feeling that something just didnt feel right I tested my first steps as if on thin ice I pressed my toes eversoslightly against the first step almost as if to test itThe step felt normal it felt sturdy I continued opening the door to the outdoorsIt was dark and damp Something about the atmosphere was off it caused the hair of my arms to stand outright I took a few steps from the house distancing myself from whatever was happening within A low resonating sound began to ring through the desolate streetNot a single car person or house light filled the nightly void No more than a few dim streetlights The noise grew louder as the ground began to vibrate My eyes scanned the darkness with haste begging for something to hide behind an immediate sense of urgency overwhelmed meMy eyes locked on a waisthigh workbench draped in a tarp Hobbling as fast I could I threw myself to the ground behind it taking pressure off my footThe sound grew louderI covered my head as if there was a threat of an explosion The sound was no longer blocked by the unlit houses on the street the sound was no longer reverberating It was directly on the other side of my shelter I cocked my neck I attempting to peer over the bench My pupils snapped to pinheads There he loomed in the dim orange streetlightMy eyes strained in the lowlight attempting to see over the cover The figure stood rigid and dark a standing shadow My scalp tensed and the hairs of my arms jut so far outright Id have sworn they were ready to escape my skin The figure moved slowly trailing a black shadow in his wakeI ducked my head once again As the rumbling of this figure began to die down I receded from my shelter Slowly making my way toward the street my eyes strained in an attempt to make our figures in the dark Carefully stepping I made my way down the driveway Something shifted to my right I frozeThe movement now became a loud rustling My head was pounding hands trembling My gaze darted back and forth as my brain racked itself in an attempt to appease my fight or flight responseA dark figure sprang from the bushes perched on all fours Its head bent towards the ground as if to sniff something My eyes scanned the figure up and down It had a human body but its head It was about this time I realized the pressure Id been putting on my injured footMy legs gaveThe figures head shot up like lightning For the first time I saw the figures face The ears were long and rugged the face reminiscent of a rabbit This thing was simply put a human with a battered rabbit head I scrambled to my feet and began sprinting down my driveway away from the creature With no set direction I ran across the street into a residential surveySkittering on all fours the figure was right behind meThe adrenaline was causing my head to buzz my legs were moving ahead of body I continued running refusing to look behind me My breathing tightened The pain in my foot had become overbearing I toppled over instantly looking behind me The figure skittered along the ground like a spider Slowing the closer it got The ripped and torn ears were menacing I scrambled backwards into the singular streetlightEverything outside the light grew dim too dark to see Moving slowly into view the rabbitlike figure tilted its head I was suddenly winded unable to catch my breath He crawled slowly towards me staring straight at me I opened my mouth but nothing came out I struggled to move but was unable Slowly more of these figures emerged from the darkness They filed in slowly around meThen the noise That low resonating soundMy Heart dropped as the sound grew closer much more intense than before It was near deafening The figures all scurried off in different directionsThe dark shadowlike figure The light around him began to bend and swirl Then completely dissipate  The street lights had completely disappeared I could no longer see the survey I was surrounded by a faint blue ambient glowThe shadow began to flux what was once a solid black now moved like flowing smoke He closed in his face seeming to take form I was forced to my feet I was now face to face with the figure He lifted me off my feet I grew limp a feeling of intense exhaustion overwhelmed my body The ground beneath my feet began to crack and spill an intense light I raised my gaze to meet with the figure one last time before he released his grip As my feet met the ground I crashed through it The light so intense it caused my eyes to slam shut A ringing began in my ears Everything was so serene so peacefulThats when I heard the voices start faintly at first Too faint to distinguish The light beaming on my eyelids began to dim enough for me to open my eyes The voices began to come in louder they were frantic yells not voices The light began to dim voices becoming clearer I made out the word Clear followed by staticThe darkness persisted I felt a pressure on my chest followed by a large jolt My eyes shot open Gasping air rushed into my lungs I panted like a dog my eyes struggling to adjust to the lights and scrambling shadows The ringing continued louder My vision cleared slightly and I could make out a few faces unfamiliar ones The buzzing people held my head still while scrambling around my body I felt a searing jolt of panic I knew not what they were doing to me but my body refused to struggleThe faces receded as I was lifted I struggled to look around to get any sense of direction My face was smothered by some sort of maskIts two weeks later I think Ive made some conclusions Is it possible for your body to remember things without you being consciously aware I wouldnt have thought so but everything that had happened there it convinced me otherwise I was in a car accident The events that occurred did so after the initial impact knocked me unconscious A driver had been drinking swerved to dodge a raccoon and lost control I was launched through my windshield Notice anything yet NoThe impact and the flipping of my car the moving furniture The surgeons removed a  inch shard of glass from my heel which was lodged on impact with the road itself Authorities say the glass was a part of my my windshieldThe glass in my foot and the searing pain from the mirror fragments Still not convinced Ive concluded the black figure to be the paramedic Being lifted by the figure was them getting me on a stretcher and into a brace As for the shock Well that was the defibrillatorThe is all logical right Id like to believe so The only part still beyond my comprehension is why nobody is aroundIts day fifteen and Im afraid to leave my bed but I havent seen or heard a person in days The truly terrifying part is the mirror has been dripping for the past  minutes,1385620266.0,Far From
