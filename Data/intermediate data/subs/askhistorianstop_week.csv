Bezant,14,16,1rk42q,46,Some of the accepted history about Spartan society strikes me as so strange that it comes off as exaggeration or outright invention and none of the authors were actually SpartansI also find it hard to reconcile their supposed military training with their actual record The idea is that they trained from early childhood to be the biggest badasses possible and thanks to the helot system they were free to focus entirely on warfare Essentially  military focused with incredibly extreme training and honor culture Yet if you look at their military history its a pretty mixed bagSpartans lost to the Argives at HysieaConquering Messenia was successful but took a very long timeStruggled against Tegea with many reverses couldnt conquer them and had to make them alliesIn a  vs  fight against Argive warriors the Spartans sort of lost supposedly  Argives and  Spartan remained standing hardly what youd expect from  elite professionals vs  nationalguardNow during the period of the League they were strong no doubt they did well against the Persians although really no better than the amateur Athenians did for ex MarathonThey lost the battle Battle of CnidusThey won the Peloponnesian Wars but they took a long time and the Athenian amateurs gave them a run for their moneyThen of course Leuctra which is explainable by a genius strategoi on the other side but I only use it as part of my argumentBasically their military record is good but not what you would expect from supposedly the biggest badasses on the planet with the harshest most extreme military training in history facing amateur armies It just doesnt seem reconcilable with the extreme claims made about their society,1385536729.0,If the Spartans were such consummate warriors why is their actual military record such a mixed bag,62,askhistorians,top_week
