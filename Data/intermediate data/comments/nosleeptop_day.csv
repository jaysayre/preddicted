AssassinCorgi,With the exception to the voices at the same time I have experienced as a kid the whole room expanding like you have It always felt very surreal ,4,cdpkkw8,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,68,64
koutavi,I experienced something very similar as a child where late at night the room would shrink and close in around me or seem to dramatically expand Sometimes my body parts most often my hands would shrink or grow and feel too light or heavy as well Id hear music or whispers frequently on the rare occasion it would turn into the roar of a crowd The walls of my room were woodpaneled and the knots and whorls would sometimes turn into faces I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood I heard them after all But if my grandmother came in for any reason it would all stopSometimes it still happens and my doctor believes that both the shrinkingexpanding and the musicwhispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines He calls it AliceinWonderlandSyndrome Aura or lilliputian hallucinations that cause the feeling of the room warping and that sometimes children experience this but grow out of itI still hate that room though,5,cdpn6m5,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,29,24
Bulldog,I had a similar thing happen  The room would feel really big and I would hear voices  The voices werent really screaming but a few people talking at once in an angry tone  I could never hear words but the voices would get louder and louder and I would feel physically stressed  The weird thing is when I would have these episodes I would always think of thesehttpusrfcomwmarualestebanarualestebanarualestebanhayballsinwhiteplasticcoverwrapbalesstackedoutdoorforfeedinganimalsinfarmsjpg for some reason,1,cdpnjb6,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,7,6
pilferedpotatoes,It sounds to me like you may have been experiencing a rare condition known as Alice in Wonderland Syndrome or Todds Syndrome  See if this sounds familiarhttpwwwaliceinwonderlandsyndromenet,5,cdpn8zq,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,10,5
Quatr,I would have something similar to what your describing happen to me often when I had a fever It is hard to describe It happened more in my head like a dream Everything in my mind would clear like I was standing alone in a matrixlike white empty room I remember at the center if the vast empty space there was what I perceived as a bombI could feel the bomb was about to go off but never would Like the constant stress would build and build until I was overwhelmed with it pulsing and compressing the bomb and its space But the bomb would fight back growing rapidly The two forces would fight in the large white room expanding and contrasting violently inside my head until I awoke ears ringing head throbbing and quietly crying It was always the same Then never happened again,0,cdpntfa,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,4,4
zackisazombie,Ive had this exact thing happen to me when I was a little kid I only recently figured out that they were probably panic attacks I still get the room growing bigger thing and I believe it is a form of dissociation The voices are actually the blood roaring in your ears ,0,cdppbwi,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,4,4
witchofchaos,Sounds similar to something Ive experienced  When I was a kid usually when falling asleep but occasionally when playing everything around me would seem to distort stretching out or squishing kind of like it was made of rubber and being pulled on  Sometimes thered be a spinning or wobbling sensation too and and it would make me feel a little sickI found it more fascinating than scary though and would often watch my hands or my toys and feel them holding still and staying the same as I see them change and move in front of me  Usually it would go away awhile after I focused on it intently  I grew out of it around the time I started kindergartenI also heard voices whenever it was dark and quiet  I still do as an adult  They always seem just out of reach to focus on  I still need to have some light and sound in my room to be able to sleep,0,cdppfd6,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,3,3
manudouble,Even at  I still get this sometimes  It normally happens when Im sick or something else is going on that keeps me from sleeping well  The room starts expanding and I feel so small but I at this point I can typically snap myself out of it ,1,cdppobw,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,5,4
Pooner,When I was young I would experience a similar thing where I felt very small and the room was expanding but no voices Apparently my mother told me when I had these experiences I would be saying Its so big Its so big I assume I was referring to the room,0,cdpn936,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
Sedentary,Ive only heard heavy breathing but heard my name called from the closet It started very faintly and i sort of awoke then my name was called again slightly louder I was thinking I may be imagining it and it came again and again each time louder until it was loud enough that i jumped out of bed turned on the light and proceeded to run to my parents room,0,cdpos72,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,3,3
ATyp,Holy shit Ive experienced exactly this Usually when I get the flu yearly Ill be laying there feeling like death and then sit up to get some water or something and then this will happen Also I have out of body experiences like this too Pretty cool never has been scary really ,0,cdpp7ug,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
Leenlopez,Ive experienced something like that even the room expanding it always happened when I was alone and not only during my childhood maybe the last time it happened to me was  years ago Its very weird and hard to explain but yeah the loud whispers that I couldnt make out what was being said made me feel like I was going insane,0,cdpqecg,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
HairStylistAndrea,Ive had this my whole life Sometimes it feels like I cant move but I can if I try The voices I hear too and theyre so loud I always thought that if I could just hear the words theyre saying Ide be able to understand what was happening It scared the shit out of me as a kid and now Im so curious about it I remember the room expanding and contracting almost like your looking through a magnifying glass and it would go up and down my body as well My limbs would feel really huge and then really small The room would get extremely dark and then return to normal when the voices would finally quiet down My mom would just brush it off and say my eyes are playing tricks on me but I always thought there was more to it  than that ,0,cdptp0e,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
LillaNissen,I once woke up and couldnt move I could see the roof in my room and the wall next to me but I couldnt move any part of the body I didnt really know what to do so I just waited to see ig I would really wake up then I think I got tired of waiting and fell asleep again and woke up as normal later Dont know the name of this english not my native language blablabla,0,cdpwon1,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,3,3
DobbelKnife,A quick question Did you ever see anything,0,cdpou0h,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Captainwhackschlong,I had almost the same experience All I could see was black though I was asleep when it happened I would always be inside a D cube The  voice would whisper but it was so loud like a screaming whisper it was terrifying It still happens occasionally still The whispers are the worst part,0,cdpp1e3,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
cnfvsed,This has happened to me Im  now and I still get the screaming voices However theyre not just when Im in bed about to fall asleep they happen during the daytime as well ,0,cdpp3uc,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
grrn,I had the voicessame thing Numerous persons sometimes whispering and sometimes yelling The room stayed the same size But I remember something else I remember being semi awake and I would float face down up to the ceiling I would float around my house and if my parents were up I could see them they couldnt see me and if I tried to talk or scream nothing came out I couldnt get their attention couldnt float lower It was something similar to reverse gravity like swimming will keep you at the top of the water This was a similar feeling ,1,cdpp675,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,1
oakles,I had something similar but Im not entirely sure if I remember there being voices When I was little Id occasionally wake up in the middle of the night and see someone standing in the doorway usually my mom or dad and they would just be staring at me When Id call out to them I wouldnt get a response and they would just keep staring After like  minutes they would just fade away and be gone it was really weird now that I look back on it,0,cdpp9kg,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
HarleiQuinn,I used to hear voices screaming in my head However it only happened when I was sick or when I was in that part of the brain between sleep and awake I had it happen so many times it was terrifying,0,cdpq2zd,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Troghen,Yeah Im not sure if this is at all similar but I remember on a few occasions having something like that happen with the shrinkingwithout the voices but I also remember something I can best describe as pins not needle pins but like the inside of a lock pins and this is a vague descriptionits really hard to describe all lined up possibly floating slightly above the ground and all of the sudden they would just drop sometimes they also expanded and shrunk before or while falling and make a really loud crashing noise and it scared the hell out of me I remember it happened a lot when I was sick or if I woke up in the middle of the night,0,cdpqo4v,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
qaudforce,I actually do have the weird feeling thing often for like feeling small and disoriented I found that its a hit and miss sort of sideeffect that I get for decongestants,0,cdpqv90,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
dirtylongen,Holy shit this actually did happen to me when I was a kid I can just remember the room seeming to get bigger as I was in bed I dont think I heard voices but I remember hearing my heartbeat much louder than normal,0,cdptrht,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
leialoup,I had it when I was a child but static and not voices Now I sometimes get the static still and my hearing will go and literally focus just on the static It disappears after about  seconds to a minuteOne thing I do also have is a weird sense of hearing When there are lots of people in a room I can hear everything and everyone to a point where its unbearable I cant be in a crowded restaurant and I hate shopping centres I hear everyones conversations Its so strange,0,cdpuo0z,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
Claireski,I have experienced voices I first noticed it in my late teensearly twenties amp still get it now Just as Im trying to fall asleep I can hear taking but cant make out words like you describe I find they get louder amp louder amp suddenly I jolt awake As soon as my eyes open they stop Sometimes it sounds like theyre talking in a different language Occasionally Ill just ride it out amp keep my eyes closed eventually Ill see faces but its nobody I recognise Someone once told me it could be caused by some kind of epilepsy how true that is I dont know Ive never paid enough mind to it to bring it up at the doctors,0,cdpux02,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
SimplySubliminal,You contradicted yourself in the storyYou said first that when your mother would come in the whispers would stop but then you say you screamed for her to come turn the light on for them to stopwouldnt the whispers stop when she came in anyways Not trying to be dicky just pointing it out,0,cdpux1y,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1

jillischillok,While reading this I sort of started to remember some distant memory of me being haunted by something amp turning on the light would be the only way to stop it I dont remember what it was exactly I do remember sleeping in my parents bed tho amp there was a bust of Jesus that would be in my sight as I was sleeping amp I recall that as I was wasting time before falling asleep that that bust of Jesuss eyes would look as if it was moving I guess it didnt really freak me out too much because it was Jesus amp I interpreted it as a good thing,0,cdpvs8t,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1

iamjto,Whoa reading all these comments I thought I was the only one that experienced this I had it when I was a kid sometimes I still have periods of these Now I can control when it starts and when it ends Everything becomes very large or expanded The voices are quiet but they speak once in a while angrily ,0,cdpw6t0,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
hartosexual,This happened to me too except there were no voices I felt so small and everything was huge but sometimes stuff like my pillow or blanket were too small or shredded into pieces and I basically had a panic attack because of that I started crying and screaming I was a weird child,0,cdpwxl6,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1

Ppopcorn,Lucid dreaming in a way but I know what u mean happened to me once I was on my way to Hamilton and I woke up from a car nap but I couldnt talk and I could only open my eyes like a MM I could only mumble and I could hear my family laughing about me mumbling but really Im freaking the fuck out because Im like frozen and the second I stopped fighting to keep my eyes open I instantly fell asleep instant lol felt so weird ,0,cdpz9vs,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Nicolestormborn,I used to experience something very similar to this when I was about  However I would hear music like s jazz music instead of voices The first few times it happened I would run out into my living to ask my mom to turn down whatever it was she was listening to but as soon as I left my room the music would stop Needless to say I still cant listen to jazz music without feeling creeped out,0,cdpzfvb,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
pizzamann,Sounds like an OEB experienceWhere all your surroundings seem surreal in a sense and everything looks different yet the same Its kinda like lucid dreaming only youre not really dreaming but its kinda hard to explain lol after a while though if you practice you can actually willing have oeb experiencesive done a few but the last time I did oneugh never again for a while anyways haha,0,cdpzq6l,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Alison,This happened to me too Only a small difference I couldnt hear voices but I saw people I never recognized the people and they were talking but I couldnt hear what they were saying Or I would hear it in extreme slow motion My parents always said they were night terrors But I never actually fell asleep before it started,0,cdq0bhw,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
GhostOfDawn,I used to have many nightmares and I always heard strange noises when I was younger I would always keep a light on because I felt a lot safer that way A few nights I heard strange sounds coming from my living room it sounded like high pitched gibberish sounded like two beings were communicating Those nights terrified me This went on for a week or two,0,cdq0st9,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
epulella,Minus the voices Ive been experiencing this occasionally all my lifeThe room seems to become larger objects in it appear smaller and everything seems to go faster than normal movements speech etcIm glad someone brought up the Alice in Wonderland Syndrome as Ive always wondered heh what this was and if I was the only one experiencing itYour experience sounds quite terrifying though I couldnt deal with the voices,0,cdq100j,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Eatsleepfag,Wow The same thing actually happened to me as a kid Every time I fell slightly asleep I would hear the voices They started as whispers and grew louder I could never understand what they were saying either As soon as I opened my eyes they would stop and I would like jump up and turn on the lights And the room stretching would always occur before I closed my eyes Later I concluded that it wouldnt happen when I left something on like the radio or the lights And Still to this day I sleep with something on ,0,cdq1ap5,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,2,2
Whiteblonde,I didnt hear any voices but ya the whole room expanding for a brief moment yes for that matter even outside in open amp it still happens sometimes May be its our eyes adjusting to conditions thats what i thought of it until now,0,cdq1ufa,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
kHvie,I dont know if this is true or nosleeptrue but something really similar used to happen to me all the time I would be just about to fall asleep when I would hear whispering never recognizable words though just sounds I only ever experienced one voice but it would get louder and louder over  minutes  and eternity as a  year old until the voice reached a deafening volume It was like a human roar that echoed in my hear for a solid  minutes and then suddenly Id be waking up in the morning or after a nap and everything would be fine,0,cdq1xgt,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
cimplosive,I do sometimes get that wired disorienting feeling from laying down perhaps too quickly  Like when you close your eyes you lose your balance and you think your about to fall No voices for me though,0,cdq2if3,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
stillborn,Im almost  and I still get this usually just before I get sick No voices but things seem disproportionate Thats not even the right term but its the best one I can think of Things seem small and far away but theyre proportionate with everything else Just far away My hands seems far away the walls seem far away everything seems like its far away but not disproportionate to each other Kind of like how things in the mirror seem to change size when you get closerfarther from the mirror but they really dont Ive had people suggest its AIWS but none of the symptoms match My body parts are proportionate Im not hearing things Im not having migraines etc It just feels like everything is SUPER far away ,0,cdq2k1i,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
haleywho,This happened to me a few different times when I was younger actually I  used to get really sick when I was little and wake up in the hospital so my child mind connected sleeping with that and I always got really nervous to fall asleep And thats when this started to happen I would experience the change in area size It felt like I was being pushed and pulled in my room while not moving at all Things becoming large and then me feeling small Then I heard the voices A very cluttered collection of voices and it would get so loud and my mom would have to come and help me fall asleep I hated it so much Reading this I felt like I knew what you were talking about ,0,cdq2oco,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
glbracer,Yeah this happened to me all the time from when I was around four to six maybe up until seven Sometimes it would be growing smaller sometimes larger I didnt hear voices or whispers but this loud music it would grow louder as time went on I reacted pretty much the same way Ive always wondered if this has ever happened to anyone else It stopped when I moved out of the house,0,cdq2qkl,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
WorldsWorstCanadian,When I was young I constantly had the room stretch out on me I would often reach for my night stand just to kind of gauge how far it was for me I never heard voices but Id see things during Rhodes times ,0,cdq2zgx,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
kahakiman,Oh god reading this has really freaked me out Aside from the voices this exact thing happened to me as I was a kid I think the doctors Ive been to called it Alice In Wonderland Syndrome I remember the room an my body and everything warping and changing and causing migraines and nausea I remember that I would end up so nauseous that I would often vomit and afterwards I would have to watch tv because every time I closed my eyes it would get worse  ,0,cdq3zu0,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
theaviatroy,This is what happens to me which I learned as they became frequent from ages   Whenever I fall asleep where I will accidentally put weight on an arm like sleeping with an arm behind you back  the larger space of my environment happens I would cry because sleep paralysis is also involved but like I said it only happens whenever an arm of mine is being weighed down by my asleep body Thank you for sharing,0,cdq4eyn,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
cactusflower,This is exactly my worst dream I get it right before I get sick like a feverish delusion kind of dream ,0,cdq4h7l,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
squingy,No voices but I remember having the sensation of something around me getting bigger and bigger while I either stayed the same size or got smaller and smaller ,0,cdq4lmi,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Sheltonio,I used to have dreams where gradually peoples voices and tone would become more violent until they were finally shouting at me I almost always woke up sobbing in my bed nervous the people I loved in my dreams would be upset with me know real life ,0,cdq53u7,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
bleeblahblow,My experiences  yrs oldwere both awake and asleep Voices would crescendo into a roar and Id feel like taffy getting worked over My flesh would seem to expand with the space around me while my bones would condense A majority of the time I would wake and be so nauseous that dinner would leave me It was an oppressive feeling but hollowing It may have been a way for my mind to cope with things or it couldve been something else entirely swear Ive seen ghosts or something similar Either way Id wait and ride it out If I got sick the run into a lit bathroom and sounds of it would get drowned out and not come back It happened sporadically,0,cdq5ux8,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
Tinuva,Yeah this is nothing new to me Its been happening since i was five or so as well Eighteen years later and it still happens at least two or three times a week It starts with a complete lack of control of my body Im assuming some version of sleep paralysis then the expansion of space in my room it can often feel like Im lying in the middle of a football field Then its a weightlessness or the feeling of my limbs weighing a thousand times heavier Then the incessant whispering growing louder and louder with every passing minute until it becomes a roar I can never full hear what the voices say Probably should go see a psychiatrist about it one of these days ,0,cdq6gmp,1rplro,nosleep,top_day,1,1
