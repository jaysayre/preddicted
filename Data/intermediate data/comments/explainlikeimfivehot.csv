lifecereals,The transplanted kidney would have taken damage from being transplanted in another persons body The person who gave the kidney would have had their other kidney get bigger to compensate for the loss of one of their kidneys There would be little to no benefit probably a lot more harm in trying to give back the kidney even if it was okay because the person who gave it has already had enough changes to make up for it You would not want to give it back due to things like fibrosisscar tissue etc Also when you transplant a kidney you put it in a different place than where you take itin the pelvis area So its not like you can just put it backOn a side note kidneys are VERY easy to damage so depending on what they die from it would probably not be able to be used anyway even if it were possible,256,cdmh1c8,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1216,960
bagdan,No you cannot get your kidney back  When you give your kidney to someone they will get it attached to their bladder and their nonworking kidneys will remain hooked up to them where they originally whereSourceI just went through this very recently and asked the doctors the same question  Interesting fact  The kidney transplant center will lie for you if you want its something they offer you  For example your close relative is in need of a kidney and asks you for one  You agree but before the surgery you have second thoughts  So instead of having to tell your close family member No I will not give you my organ the kidney transplant people will lie to them and say Sorry your relative cannot give you your kidney because he is not a viable candidate due to geneticssome rare condition he hascompatibilityetc  They will make up some bullshit so that way it doesnt look like you are refusing to save your family members life it will look like you simply were not accepted due to whatever medical guidelines  This option really surprised me,42,cdmh6jk,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,221,179
iniasknayvid,It is really rare to reuse organs During the psych eval of a potential living donor you are asked whether or not you will be still OK to donate even if your kidney is rejected implying that the rejected kidney will not be used again and will not be given back to youBut to answer you question here is a relevant casestudy I foundhttponlinelibrarywileycomdoijxabstract It is somewhat similar to OPs question According to the casestudy it is possible to reuse the donated kidney but I have not come across any cases where the kidney was given back to the original donor If any of you have please let me know This is an interesting questionAlso if you do donate your kidney as a live donor you will be placed on a priority recipient list should you need a kidney later on in your life At least thats how our organ center works I am not sure if this incentive is available nationally Source I work at an organ transplant lab,20,cdmh6yp,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,75,55
rearviewclouds,The short answer is noThe longer answer is way longer than this post but it starts something like this You hit the nail on the head with one of the reasons  transplant surgery is major  there are risks involved with all elements of the surgery   anaesthetic the laparotomy  ie it is open surgery and the surgery is technically difficult and fiddly To be allowed to donate your kidney in the first place you must be in sufficiently good renal and otherwise health to operate on just the one  essentially you are pretty much perfectly healthy just with one kidney Thus there is no need to subject a healthy person to the risks of a major operationanaesthetic and the challenges of post op recovery infections blood clots pneumonia etc etc  Another big reason is that organs need a blood supply to survive and decay starts as soon as the blood supply is lost  In transplant surgery there are strict time limits for taking organs out of a donor and being put into a recipient Sooner is better After a certain time the organs undergo irreversible changes that mean they wont be able to usefully operate even if they were put back in another person   Organs are put on ice until they are ready to be plugged into the donor which limits the rate of decay of the organs but damage from a lack of blood supply is always inevitable Google things like cold ischemic time and warm ischemic time for further detailsEssentially most of the donors are patients in ICU environments who are brain dead  They are on life support which means that machines have taken over the job of keeping the airway open and providing oxygennutrition to the body Blood is still pumping around their body getting to the organs kidneys liver heart lungs etc  but not the brain  So the kidneys are still alive and working and are suitable to be put into someone else During the transplant retrieval operation this blood supply is cut and the organs are removed Ultimately the donor dies during the donation surgery Clearly this is a huge thing to consider for the donors loved ones  one of the many reasons organ donation is such a complex area The other main scenario is a live donor situation such as you are talking about  where the donor has an operation to retrieve the organ  thus normal blood supply is maintained right until the operation to donateSo in our scenario  it would be technically possible to get your kidney back if the person you gave it to became brain dead in an ICU type environment But you would be doing fine without itOrgan transplantation is a huge and complex topic  this is only the beginning of the explanation The ethicalspiritual side is also fascinatingsource  work in a transplant centre ,12,cdmi3a5,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,29,17
anubisofq,Unfortunately no  When your kidney goes into the recipient their body immediately starts attacking it  Doctors do some testing to help reduce the amount of damage host does to the donor kidney HLA typing but it doesnt check for everything which is why transplant patients are placed on immunosuppressive medications medications that reduces the immune system of the host Those drugs are also toxic to the kidneys as well  So its a balance between drug toxicity and immunosuppression  Thus the kidneys will undergo damage and over a period of years will become dysfunctional people with transplants do not return to normal lifeexpectancy it is just temporarily elongated  Longterm causes of mortality of people who undergo transplantation will be that they either die of the infections secondary to immunosuppression diseases secondary to the cause of the original disease requiring the transplant or kidney failure from drug or host damage  so in the end the risk of the surgery does not outweigh getting the kidney back  You would be hardpressed to find a surgeon who would be willing to do the surgery  Now i do remember an article published awhile back that stated that a transplanted kidney was retransplanted into another patient who needed it not back to the donor because the cause of death was irrelevant to the kidney itself  The first host also had the kidney for a short period of time But this would be the exception rather than the ruleEdit clarification of details and sentence fragments,10,cdmn3fj,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,26,16
rwired,In years to come the idea of transplanting organs from one individual to another is going to seem like one of those barbaric procedures they did in the middle ages Its pretty much a miracle that it works at all and even when it does its not that great Just look forward to a future when all transplanted organs will be D prints of genetically matching cells cultured from stemcells derived from your own body on an inert substrate with no chance or rejection and functionally equivalent to a younghealthyadult If you want that kind of stuff then vote for Science Bitch,4,cdmgzjp,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,16,12

WendellSchadenfreude,Besides the other reasons given in this thread already theres one more very few people are suitable organ donors after their deathKidney transplants are fairly common because the donor is alive After your death your organs including kidneys donated to you by someone else become damaged within minutes  unless you die from brain death gt The major obstacle to organ transplantation today is the limited organ supply It is estimated that only  of the total number of people dying in hospitals and about  of those dying in Intensive Care Units ICUs die in the situation known as brain deathhttplinkspringercomchapterF Since you couldnt take the kidney back with the original recipient still alive this alone would make it impossible in most cases,8,cdmlalu,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,16,8

ProSaint,I have absolutely no expertise on health issues but the kidney functions as a Mason jar of sorts that is a place your urine passes through before it goes to the bladder The kidney takes any left over nutrients and gives them to any homeless bloodcells that pass through it Every  years the nutrients expire and the gallbladder which acts as a lid to the Mason jar is unscrewed and all contents are poured out All the homeless cells have to find a new homeusually your pancreas for males If youre a female they go to your pancreas too If you get that kidney back and the gallbladder hasnt let all the homeless cells out you will have an over abundance of vagrants in your body begging all your other organs for a dollar Needless to say this raises the unemployment in your body instantly which is bad for the presidential elections So I dont think this is a good idea unless youre planning on causing a commotion inside your body as a distraction while you overthrow the government Brain damage penis areola esophagus and other large medical terms could happen Not a good idea ,0,cdmjrrs,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

lmckl,Hey reddit I work for organ transplant Although it is not outside the realm of possibility for this to happen if you were in need of a kidney you would likely receive one from another donor There are a few points to take into considerationThe kidney you donated will likely be in rough shape from years of antirejection medications and other meds the recipient is likely onHow functional is your own remaining kidney If youre fine and dont need a transplant they are not going to do it It is no small surgerySpeaking of surgery Do you want another one Many living kidney donors end up having complications after their donation such as large hernias under their incision site When receiving a kidney it is attached to your abdominal aorta so you would have an incision site at your belt lineWhat did the recipient die from If they died from renal failure you probably dont want that kidney backI can only think of one organ donor that Ive seen that has also been a recipient but their heart was going for transplant so thats probably why Typically post transplant patients screen out medically for organ donation However it is totally possible to be an organ recipient and a tissue or eye donor,0,cdmjgm2,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

aeo,As with almost all foreign policy pronouncements you should consider what audience is being targeted and what the speakers incentives are  In this case there are good strategic incentives for IsraelNetanyahu to appear hardline on this dealFirst Netanyahus domestic political situation is dependent on him being seen as hardline on Iran  He has staked his reputation on this position and so whatever deal was agreed to he has to appear more hardline than that  So even if he actually thinks that this is a good deal or a step along the way to a good deal good in terms of what Iran would eventually accept he has to publicly appear pissed off using OPs language  Second there is the international audience  The P negotiators from the United States Britain China Russia France and Germany will be able to get a better deal from Iran if they can point to a hardline Israel stance and say to Iran Look look at the pressure we are under here  If you dont want Israel to reject the deal and maybe unilaterally bomb your nuclear facilities you are going to have to give a better deal  The P negotiators also seem more reasonable and moderate next to a hardline Israel  In addition to strategic incentives there is a thing called fundamental attribution error  Briefly this is a psychological phenomenon that all humans are subject to to some extent where you think that you are a good person and forced to do bad things by your environment but other people do bad things because they are bad people  So even though Israelis trust themselves to only use their nuclear weapons defensively they think that Iran would use nuclear weapons offensively even if that means effectively committing suicide through nuclear retaliation  This means that they are far more concerned about ensuring Iran doesnt have nuclear weapon capabilities than is reasonablerational  These are the most basic and plausible explanations for why Israel is pissed off with the Iran Nuke deal  There are other possibilities but they are more complicated,37,cdmr9r4,1rfnff,explainlikeimfive,hot,178,141

Yankeessfan,While the actual act of executing someone may be a lot cheaper than life in prison it usually takes years to get a person to this point because the court allows the defendant to appeal the decision to give the death penalty So essentially giving the death penalty is adding the fees of a prison sentence to house the person with years of legal fees to prove that the person does deserve the death penalty  years sticks out in my mind from my criminal justice class I took in high school but Im not sure if thats the average time before the final approval of the death penalty or the maximum time they allow the trial to go on for Perhaps someone can elaborate on this ,0,cdna1yw,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,hot,10,10
DeweyCheatemHowe,The expense comes from legal fees and expert fees Once the state declares its intention to seek the death penalty a defendant will automatically be appointed not only an attorney assuming hes indigent but probably a couple attorneys as well as a mitigation investigator That person will go back to the defendants roots and dug up everything they can from the persons life that would help sway a jury to recommend life There will likely be a sanity commission to determine whether he is competent to stand trial consisting of several doctors The state is also hiring experts and will be spending extra man hours to ensure everything goes exactly right so a later court has no reason to reverse Same thing goes for the trial court So all that happens before trial Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection Before the normal process starts each juror may need to be media qualified have they been biased by prior coverage of the case and will need to be death qualified whether they could vote for death under some set if facts or are they too against the death penalty to consider Only then can the attorneys start regular jury selection Trial will probably run  weeks If guilty then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors this is where that investigators work becomes relevant Then they will vote on lifedeath If death at least in my state the defendant gets an auto appeal to the state Supreme Court He will be appointed a different attorney for this who will have to learn the case go through the whole deal Defendant argues anything and everything that he says went wrong from the moment the crime happened If affirmed he can petition the US Supreme Court to hear his case Unlikely here Then he starts state post conviction New attorney goes back to arguing constitutional challenges in the same court he was convicted If affirmed back to state Supreme Court and the petitioning the US Supremes If he hasnt managed a new trial yet he will file a petition for habeas corpus in fed district court again arguing constitutional issues If affirmed he can go to the appellate court and then petition the US Supreme Ct again Only when the supremes deny his petition or affirm does his conviction become final Meanwhile this whole time hes been housed in an ultra secure area of the prison by himself rather than in the GP Every appeal except US Supreme Ct and maybe US Appeals are of right He gets them regardless and taxpayers are paying his attorneys and fees think of all the copies for instance If any court finds a a significant error process restarts Also its in the defendants best interest to fight to delay all of these waiting for new rulings new facts or just more days on earth Most defendants will then file some sort of  claim alleging that the method of execution is unconstitutional Usually some interest group pays his fees here but the people still pay the state and the federal judge thatll hear it Overall its not hard to see how the costs pile up Source friends in the DAs office and I took a capital punishment class in law school Forgive type os on mobile and I might be a bit rusty on some of the facts above ,3,cdnd25l,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,6

Brelya,The death penalty in most states results in a bifurcated trial where the same jury most of the time sit through two trials The first is the guilt phase where they decided whether to convict a person  The second is the penalty phase where the State and defense counsel each present relevant evidence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances so that finally the jury may decide whether that particular defendant should get the death penaltyDefense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place the State may waive seeking the death penaltyIn some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the States supreme court for a proportionality review They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received itDuring this time appeals and postconviction motions run wild The defendant can assert many claims such as  ineffective assistance of counsel unfair trial etc There are many avenues to have not only state courts but federal courts to review the case and claims the defendant might have In every instance the State most likely will defend their positionThe prosecution State is financed by the state government and where the defendant is being represented by public defenders that is also financed by the state governmentIt is a long and arduous process but it costs money because death is different It is a lot more sensitive and dangerous to put someones life on the line without making sure the process is fair That includes hiring of many experts on both sides to help provedisprove the case,0,cdneepo,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Coltfourty,The death sentence costs more for the basic fact that once you are sentenced to the death penalty your case is required to be reviewed by the supreme court  They receive thousands of cases every year and only hear around  of them  The whole process requires an insane amount of man hours put in by the federal prosecutors where as if someone is sentenced to life in prison without parol their isnt as much work from the start on the prosecutors side       Another factor in the cost being higher is that death sentence inmates cost more to house  Most states require death row inmates to be housed alone instead of in a group cell  This means more space taken up and more intensive supervision which accounts for more money  In california for instance it costs up to  times as much to house a death row inmate compared to a regular inmate because of the treatment differences,1,cdnf8m4,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

MistaSchlong,Ok so you know about digital devices  Think about a binary switch something that just turns on and off  Thats what a neuron does it just turns on and off  At the end of a neuron there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too  These signals are made of molecules and we call these molecules neurotransmitters  We wont need to talk about these neurotransmitters but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them theyre really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn onOK your brain is made of neurons  Its also made of other types of cells but the most simple straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail  Knowledge is stored in these neurons  Now because a neuron can only essentially turn on and off the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easierMaking the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms  You can make the neuron more sensitive to neurotransmitters  This can for instance happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor  Likewise you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing sensitivity to neurotransmittersNote you may have heard of the term Action Potential  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns onNow knowing that a neuron can turn on and off and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar  Chords are made up of notes and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings  Basically turning them on or keeping them offHowever and this is the key with just a few chords you can play millions of different songs  Its just about how the chords are played the timing the tempo the coordination  Similarly the firing of neurons on and off in combination generates recall of stored knowledge  And knowledge is stored in how easily or difficult these neurons are fired on and off,0,cdnep8v,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3
Volsunga,Simple sensory data is placed in feedback loops with sensations that occur at the same time being connected This creates a complex Web of relations that we perceive as memory ,0,cdnchaa,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
airor,The memories are stored in the pattern of sequences your neurons fire throughout your brain  A single neuron will tend to fire at a rate determined by the neurons attached to it so groups cortical columns of neurons tend to fire at the same time and at a steady rate  This rate can be influenced by other groups of neurons firing at nearly the same rate such that the two groups start to synchronize  Patterns form as the different rates compete for synchronization throughout your brain  Some of your neurons are directly connected and influenced by sensory input and tend to sync to that input  Due to the feedback of all the other neuron groups the input can be predicted the pattern is recognized and other groups start performing the pattern that is the expected future sequence of input  The brain is built to allow for many layers of this pattern recognition dance each layer predicting the future output by simply repeating the patterns that occurred the previous times it received that inputWhen the pattern is confirmed and the input really does follow the expectation the two groups stay in synchronization and new connections are made to strengthen that pattern  When dissonance occurs and the input does not match with a group the connections to that group weaken  So in effect your brain evolves the connections between neuron groups that correctly predict the futureHow is that a stored memory  There are areas of your brain that can fake sensory input into the system and let it perform its dance  This ability gives us the power to imagine situations and remember previous input  The feedback and the flurry of patterns that emerge as we think is horrendously complex and not well understood because we cant reproduce how it actually works  But in principle it is the fact that certain areas of our brain react to internal input simulated inside our minds that give us our self awareness and memory,0,cdnismc,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
ElectroSpore,The brain does not really record facts so much as gathers key fragments of experiences and when you recall a memory it is rebuilt on the fly from key fragments and it fills in the detail as best it can on the fly It constantly refreshes useful items and unused items fade and may even get lostPhysically it uses neutrons that creat connections individually they are similar to bits in a computer just flashing pulses of electricity but due to the way the connections form and the information is stored are uniqueThis is why eye witnesses are often not reliable When they go to remember a face the brain fills in the blanks if there are to few details it makes stuff up based one what it knows,1,cdnacm0,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

GraniteMaggie,The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohns symptoms are much more common than most people realise Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals particularly in food many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives For example one study on people who had recurring migraines n so not hugely definitive found that  of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include nonmigraine headaches sinus congestion digestive issues that dont have the same characteristics as Crohns or Coeliac disease unexplained weight loss or gain according to some people lethargy  and even Gluten AtaxiaAnother school of thought is loosely based on the PaleoPrimal diet and lifestyle and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now and the presence of gluten allergies sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumesOf course its becoming more widely known and understood so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some peoples exclusion of gluten from their diets,21,cdnb1pa,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,hot,69,48

bisteccafiorentina,httpwwwplosoneorgarticleinfodoiFFjournalponeAmong the many potential environmental triggers for TD diet has been considered a significant contributing factor   Of the various dietary factors gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of TD  Rodent studies have supported this claim  Mechanistically it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of TD In the current study we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the prodiabetogenic properties of dietary glutenCeliac is a life threatening response to gluten  However there isnt much science investigating the responses that arent as pressing  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance which is characterized by a host of symptoms including bloating abdominal discomfort or pain diarrhea muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo among many others from the wiki for gluten sensitivity  Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food from the celiac wiki The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the sameTo address your question Why do people go on a gluten free diet  Well there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes  To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally  But nonetheless often times the best way to determine if a dietary intervention will benefit you is to implement it on a personal level and see what happens  ,4,cdncwl4,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,hot,13,9

doovidooves,It really boils down to the fact that life is incredibly different now that it was say a hundred years agoDuring the classical era most music was commissioned by people of influence Nobility the church etc would hire the famous Then the distribution of this music is not like it is today There were no recordings so the only way to actually HEAR the music of the time was to hear it performed Major cities throughout Europe had their own orchestras its not as if one famous orchestra of composer would travel in some grand tour it was the music itself that traveled and the name that was attached to that musicToday the face of the music is of the performer because thats what we all can see Its distributed via TV radio and mps We hear the one artists performance not one song performed by the local musicians in each townEDIT Tidied up the grammar a bit,49,cdne4cu,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,256,207
maestro,Okay so nobody here is right  Not even doovidooves with his  upvotes  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording and classical versus modern isnt the right way to break things downFirst some terminology  Im going to refer to it as Classical versus Popular  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music eg Gregorian chant certain types of Renaissance music motets madrigals etc the Baroque period the Classical period the Romantic period and modern periods that we dont quite have the historical context to classify yet  It continues to be written todayPopular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created which today involves the rock combo with guitars basses drum sets keyboards etc but includes folk music all the way back  It actually predates ClassicalPopular music has always been meant to be easily imitable  In the days before recording it was meant to be playedsung by amateur musicians in the home or around the campfire or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be  Its simpler music not that impressive in its composition so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer  And usually there arent that many performers which makes it simpler stillClassical music is not meant to be easily imitated  The forms are longer and more complicated and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor  We marvel at the composers ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece  We still marvel at the performers but we marvel more at the composer  Many people can both write and play Popular music  Few can play Classical music and even fewer can write itRecording and distribution has changed things a bit  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular we do still use that but not exclusively we can record the worlds best Popular musicians and distribute that recording  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction see MetalAnd Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular see Mozart operas  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently  But thats the basic distinction,4,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,38,34
ersFaithfulForLife,Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself Its easier to take a goodlooking singer stylize them and build a brand around their face and name than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image In some cases especially in hip hop the producers name may be wellknown and liked enough that theyll make a point to associate it with the album but this is an exception to the ruleFor the most part the music industry doesnt want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isnt written by the performers but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula finetuned to maximize the likelihood theyll get your fifteen dollars for the album That doesnt look as good Yeah most consumers know or have been told this is the case but its not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a songClassical music on the other hand wasnt about image or identity it was just about the music,6,cdnegam,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,27,21
darknessvisible,Classical music exists in its primary form as notated manuscripts intended for performance by many different performersensemblesorchestras each bringing their own sensibility to their interpretations  therefore it is more logical to identify the piece by the composer rather than the first performer  The primary form of popular music is an actual recording of a particular interpretationperformance which amounts to the definitive version identified by the performer  while cover versions and reinterpretations are common they are rarely based on a manuscript of the original track  ,0,cdnedkp,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,9

gich,I think many here are missing a major point that I think is key With music performed by an orchestra such as classical each individual artist has less influence over the final piece There are a sea of artists While the composer is alone and has the most direct influenceIn modern music each group only has a few artists and they have much more control over the song They can improvise or add on their own feel They have the most influence there,0,cdnixla,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4
vedantdotcom,Most modern music has its roots in folk music blues to jazz to rock which was informal and was generally never written down or taught that way  Even when you look up the tabs for popular rock bands the actual notes for what to sing are never written down and also why the song structures are seemingly more simple versechorusversechorus  That isnt to say that all folk music is simple as much of it especially from other countries is extremely complex  I also dont intend to imply that all classical music is complex as a lot of it is compositionally lackluster as an average pop song today  However in contrast to folk music western classical music was written down and still is written down today its just not as popular as it used to be partly due to classical music going bonkers in the early th century,0,cdni8k9,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

zerozed,Lots of modern music as you phrase it is fairly disposable pop with no gravitas  It often is one dimensional lyrically and the producer normally dictates both the sound and structure  In a nutshell such music is more akin to a commodity not art since it is produced for a mass audience by a whole slew of people on the corporate payroll whose single goal is to sell records not convey a composerartists original vision  Although your question specifically asks about the different standard with classical composers and modern music Id like to correct you a bit  You might be too young to remember the explosion of the singersongwriter movement of the ss  Prior to then almost all pop artists just sangperformed other peoples songs  As artists like Buddy Holly to the Beatles came aroundaudiences discovered the unique profundity when an artist performed their own work  Bob Dylan was the first major artist to really cross this bridgea number of artists popularized his work eg Peter Paul amp MaryBlowin in the Wind The ByrdsMr Tambourine Man Jimi HendrixAll Along the Watchtower but there was no mistaking how powerful an artist Dylan was once you heard him with all this noncommercial idiosyncrasies perform his own compositionsFinallyto more directly respond to your question regarding classical composersthe answer is simply that their compositions were uniquely their visionstranscribed precisely for artists to render without improvisation  ,3,cdnfat3,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,0

Typobro,There are a couple of ways to transmit radio signals but the principle is the same for all of them  We create a carrier signal with a certain frequency  Then we add a signal to the carrier signal We start transmitting that signal A receiver picks up that signal  He subtracts the carrier signal All that remains is the original signal The difference between the various transmitting methods is the way we add the signal to the carrier signal ExamplehttpwwwnicomcmsimagesdevzonetutdhallanalogmodulationJPG The reason why the signal gets transmitted is power A whole lot of power Its very dangerous to stand close to powerful transmitters because it would be like standing in a microwave Hope this answers your questions a bit ,0,cdnd9l9,1rhkok,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

vomitshovel,When someone takes a blow to the head like that their brain hits the wall of the skull which in turn causes your brain to go into self preservation mode  The best way your brain can do this is to turn off as much of the brain as it can as to avoid damage to active parts  sort of like how you can drop a hard drive when its off and it can be fine but when you turn it on the slightest drop can really mess it up  Its a bad analogy but you get the point I assume  This is how brain transplants are possible without damaging someones brain  This isnt the only reason however as the brain also perceives you getting hit as a threat that you could possibly make worse by acting out of fear or kneejerk reaction  So your brain hits the wall of your skull decides If Im working too hard while this keeps happening it can cause serious damage so Im going on standby until I feel safe  This is why some people can pass out from being frightened as they perceive a threat and the brain wants you to just relax and stay still that is what it feels is the safest  Hope this helps Im no doctor I just trained MMA and thought Id do some research,164,cdne8no,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,hot,174,10

noptotsch,Basically a person knocked out is saving energy for primary body function by blocking functions strictly unnecessary to survival Its physically processing a huge blow to that person This can be mentally coming from a shock or otherwise difficult context of input to your brain this can be physically as a reaction to a huge slam bloodloss or otherwise The result of knockout is in any case a physical reaction where the body physically switches back to survival mode by disabling secondary physical body functions such as seeing smelling moving Sometimes the body already does this to prevent further damage by say assessing and processing any mental or physical most often sudden blow to its perception of reality you can get knock out as shock no physical blow recieved here so this can happen as a precaution where physically your body doesnt necessarily needs to shutdown these secondary functions BTW going more directly into your question assuming trend game is something like people kneeling down and suddenly stand up to faint this is like physically draining the oxygen from your head people sometimes do it by kicking each other in the lungs or stomach too by suddenly standing up your brain notices decrease of oxygen in bloodflow and shuts down to save the energy for primary function sort of survival reflex ,1,cdnfoy4,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,3
PRATFO,I dont know about any of the explanations that the brain shuts down for protective reasons I just dont see the adaptive benefit to this unless youre arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult This simply is not the case if anything the blood flow is increased following impact This is the basis of secondimpact syndrome When there is concussion brain function is altered resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate As a result of this dilation there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edemaAs to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal The details probably arent worth going into But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants such as the Moro reflex which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change This reflex originates in the pons ELI Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem where the arousal network is This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem this is called the fencing responseFencing Response httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvZlXjwAlOflA,0,cdng7nr,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

SoWhatIfImChristian,Just like a lot of the posts here have explained it has to do with either you brain receiving trauma or damage an overload of sensors or insufficient oxygen levels reaching the brain Whether it be getting hit on the jaw being in a car crash etc all of this causes a fast acceleration to your head Your brain is suspended in fluid and there is nothing else that keeps it apart from the skull When sudden acceleration or deceleration happens it will cause the brain to smash against the skull This will cause trauma or damage and result in being knocked outAnother way can be when your brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters Whether it be pain flashing lights epilepsy and so on if the brain is overloaded with neurotransmitters it will overload and shut down for its own safety In the case of an oxygen deficiency do people remember the game where people used to play by choking each other until they pass out In order for the brain to function it needs a continuous stream of oxygen being  When oxygen is cut off it results in cerebral hypoxia When you get choked either by someone else a belt a rope or anything it cuts off the blood supply to your head The oxygen is carried through your blood thus it results in cerebral hypoxia If this lack of oxygenblood is cut off long enough you will die Even if you dont die it will possibly result in permanent brain damage ,0,cdo18uy,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

Nyghtshade,Theres a trend to what works Smaller animals tend to have faster breeding cycles and larger litters This would allow any effects of natural selection to surface quicker Thus one could probably argue that smaller species are simply more equipped to adapt to long and short run changes in ecosystems whereas larger creatures are simply filling temporary niches that can only support species until the next reset if you will,0,cdnjpla,1rhq7c,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

GooberCity,This is an active area of research in the medical community right now however there are some fundamental differences between male and female cardiovascular pathophysiology that is known about today  First of all it is somewhat of a misconception that only men are susceptible to heart attacks  It is true that more men fall victim to fatal heart attacks than women but the disparity is not a big as most people think  Some factors that influence this difference include eating and lifestyle habits between men and women the size of the individual often times bigger people require more effort from the heart to push blood and thus more fatigue and ware size and composition of arteries where larger arteries found in men are more susceptible to atherosclerosis inflammation and blockage When it comes to symptoms women posses a much larger tolerance to pain  This tolerance can elicit a different and unresponsive appropriation to a heart attack whereas a man might be more susceptible to the feeling of hypoxia blockage and lack of oxygen to the area of the heart Edit Spelling clarity science  ,0,cdnk3or,1rhqh9,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Fairleee,The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history  it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing  this universally agreed thing is called a standard There are a number of different standards and sometimes we dont have a single one Consider something like transferring data between devices The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer but it isnt the only one  however because it is so popular most devices will have a USB portIn terms of distance these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do  basically if we didnt have a standard system of measurement for length then mass production of components couldnt exist which would mean that we wouldnt be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform wayThe meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length This is similar to the celsius system of temperature which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system However the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough or constant enough to be fully acceptable So part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant To measure time a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom  I cant remember details off the top of my head For distance the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain incredibly tiny period of timeAs for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere yes there is There is a prototype meter kept in France I believe and a number of almost identical with the tiniest tiniest variations and the variations of which are recorded meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards So basically precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these and so on and so on So a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing However if you are doing a job that requires a very very very high degree of accuracy such as precision engineering then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the worldIf you are interested in reading the history of the meter the Wikipedia article can be found herehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofthemetre,4,cdnd8a9,1rhqwm,explainlikeimfive,hot,16,12

OrbOfConfusion,If theres a wire or a particular bracket thats poking her you can buy dental wax Its just what it sounds like the wax comes in little strips in a packet and you should be able to get it pretty cheap at a pharmacy You just pick off a bit of the wax and mold it on the sharp point and you can keep it on while eating You just change it out when you brush your teeth and thats about it Now if your daughter is experiencing more of a general pain sometimes it just takes a while for the insides of your mouth to toughen up enough to not be irritated by the brackets I know that doesnt really help much but know it wont last for long ,2,cdnjw8q,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,7
Sunfried,That pain will go away within a week the cheeks and the inside of the lip with toughen ever so slightly shes not going to get callouses in there and this pain will be completely forgotten  She should use dental wax to moderate this rubbing in the meantime and keep it around in case she gets a wire break rare or poking out the end of her braces Her orthodontist has little containers of wax which heshe buys by the ton use it by day take it out at nightThe real pain of braces is far less acute and far more annoying when they replace the wire with something really stiff shes going to get that awful ache as the new wire starts to bully her teeth in the right direction Its not pain just eternal uncomfortable pressure on your teeth  Actually it lasts a few days after each wirechangeGood luck  And tell her its worth it  And when its over tell her to wear her damn retainer Teeth move of their own accord if you let them thats how they got this way in the first place I know its annoying but having nice teeth go crooked is far more annoying,4,cdnhbx8,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,5
Throned,Speaking from past experience braces which are not removable do not really seem to have sharp points on the individual brackets the metal pieces glued to the teeth except for on those brackets where elastic bands could be required in my case it was the third tooth from the middle on both sides on both the top and bottom of the mouthThe wire however which is attached to  threaded through these brackets is made of some sort of memory alloy which when bent away from its set position will try to bend back to what it was set to the correct shape of the mouth  layout of the teethSometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets and is usually able to cut the inside of the mouth If the gum scrapes along it while chewing or speaking for example it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek Alternatively as the teeth move into position the wire may end moving around in the braces as it is not fixed into position from what I can tell but instead is kept close to the brackets by being enclosed This could cause it to be fine when the orthodontist first puts the wire in but then get worse as you go along until the next time the braces are tightened  rewiredOh and as uSunfried has mentioned  there are two main types of pain with braces in my experience A sort of ache which is usually worse just after them being rewired and for a day or two afterwards and the cutting pain which the ends of the wire cause Just after I had my braces put on however the ache lasted for approximately a week but was not as bad afterwardsWax can be used on the edge of the wire and on the ends of the hooks used for elastic bands on the brackets if it hurts too much,0,cdni7ev,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

debman,There are several parts to braces that can be sharp The braces themselves which may cause some irritation at first but her lips will get used to The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth like others have noted However they also have to be cut to fit her mouth sometimes if the wire is too long they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire bending the tips of the wire or using dental wax as others have suggested I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself its a few cents to them free to you and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter As to why its metal there are several other statements that essentially address the issue The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheapthere simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility cost etc Unfortunately cutting metal leads to sharp edges unless its treated with something to smooth out the edge As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out they dont do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut Hope that helps,0,cdnw5hg,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

restricteddata,The same question came up on here a day or two agohttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentsrfmeliwhycansomecountriesdecidewhocanand heres what I wrote thereIn the early s the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb Maoist China had just set one off and was considered a pretty looney rogue state at the time Cultural Revolution and all that and was a mutual enemy to both Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future as opposed to the five that then existed US USSR UK France China They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence eg once China has nukes you cant threaten China with nukes without being threatened back and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to allout nuclear war which neither the US or the USSR wantedBut the problem is that they didnt want to give up their own nukes They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation Once a country has nukes a whole new potentially stabilizing political order emerges They didnt want to give that up they just wanted to stop new political orders which they saw as destabilizing from cropping up elsewhere The countries without nukes of course were like wait you guys get nukes but we dont Lame So they made the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty NPT include sections that said that the socalled Nuclear States the ones that already had them would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well This is Article VI which statesgt Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete disarmamentWell that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding All of them are willing to say sure well get rid of our nukes if everyone else does but they all know that isnt going to happen anytime soonSo why would a nonnuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is Not so much because of the disarmament clause but more because the NPT also says that nonnuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy as well So they get help with reactors and things like that as long as they agree to safeguards that wont let them weaponize any of it Its also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region  if everyone in say South America agrees to not get the bomb and this is enforced by means of the NPT then that means you dont have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get oneIn practice things have always been messier than that For one reason not everybody signed the treaty There were many nonsignatoriesnonratifiers until the end of the Cold War Among them were two of the named nuclear states France and China both of whom did help other states proliferate and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear Israel India Pakistan South Africa as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear ie Egypt Taiwan South Korea Cuba Argentina Brazil ,1,cdnl5zy,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,hot,13,12

rsdancey,After WWII ended the United States thought that there were only two options  Either nuclear weapons needed to be turned over to an international agency for use only in the enforcement of collective security or there would be unlimited proliferation leading in short order to a nuclear Third World WarThe civilian benefits of nuclear technology were overstated  People thought that nuclear power generation would replace conventional power generation very quickly  The potential of nuclear medicine was just being investigated but hopes were high  So most countries wanted access to nuclear technologyThe problem is that nuclear reactors using uranium the easiest and first technology available produce plutonium as they operate  That plutonium can be removed from spent fuel and reprocessed to make nuclear weapons  There is no good way to allow unlimited nuclear power generation without creating a nuclear weapon proliferation riskOnce the Soviet Union developed its own nuclear weapon it was no longer possible for the US to imagine giving up its own weapons to an international body  In the end an international treaty was developed that traded the right of a country to operate nuclear reactors for the enforcement of rules that prohibited the development of nuclear weapons  This treaty called on the powers that had nuclear weapons as of the date it came into force to eliminate those weapons as fast as possible so that eventually no nation would have nuclear arms  Those countries were the US the USSR the UK France and China  Coincidentally those countries are also the vetowielding permananent members of the UN Security Council which via the language of the nuclear weapon  nuclear power treaty serves as the arbiter and enforcer of that treatyA small number of countries have never signed the treaty or have withdrawn from it which is how India Pakistan North Korea and Isreal have built their weapons programs  Technically they should face crippling economic sanctions and potentially military action to force them to comply with the treaty even though they are not signatories but practically the decision has been made to enforce those penalties ad hoc or not at allThe problem with the treaty is the danger of dualuse  A country can remain within the limits of the treaty while preparing itself to make nuclear weapons  It can create enriched uranium or extract plutonium up to a limit  It can conduct research on the triggers and controlled explosions used in nuclear weapons  And then it can break the treaty and dash for a weapon trying to get the work done before it faces international consequences  North Korea shows that once you have nukes you probably cant be forced to give them up  This is why Iran is so worrisome  They are following the classic path to use the legal limits of the treaty to position themselves for a quick sprint to a bomb  In fact they have repeatedly violated the treatyand been caught which reinforces the world opinion that they are planning to make bombs,2,cdnkqx7,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,2

evilknee,A regulation  lets say to tie max wages to wages of lowest paid employee  has various effects  Some companies might pay lower wage workers more others pay higher wage workers less others try to have their lower paid employees not technically be employees etc  If this regulation is enforced then changes will happen  However if the regulation is poorly written it might be easy to get around so that its intended effect fails to happen or there are unintended negative effects  This can happen often with hastily written or politically motivated legislation  While there may always be some incentive to get around the rules sometimes compliance is easier  Maximum work hours child labor laws minimum wage laws etc are generally complied with  In fact large powerful corporations are generally better at complying with those laws than small businesses because they are a bigger target for enforcement class action lawsuits etc  Often the regulations themselves are not the only thing that results in compliance but a shift in cultural standards and norms can also help eg nondiscrimination laws  Overall though its false that in all cases very little actually happens or comes about  ,0,cdnjxpl,1ri5pk,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

H,In addition the EPA regs now usually mandate that any infrastructure changes that are over a certain percentage of square footage or dollar market value or any of several criteria require full environmental review and permitting and are treated as entirely new facilities So essentially this means that to raze a smelter and combine it with a coke production facility would require them to get a full environmental review permits and mitigation plan for razing the smelter  which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars to ELIMINATE a facility Then to add on to the production facility the EPA and other agencies would treat it as new construction of BOTH plants and require the full process for each Again running into multiple millions of dollars for EACH facilityThis is why there havent been hardly any new refineries built in decades and why there are so many shuttered and abandoned industrial facilities rather than selling off the land The permitting process simply to tear down a facility is cost prohibitive It is cheaper and easier to just mothball it and walk away,0,cdnl8bb,1rif4q,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Schnutzel,Stack overflowWhenever you call a function memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack When the function completes its run that memory is released A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called and theres not enough room in the stack which has a hard size limit to allocate more memoryHow can this happen Look at the following code for example    int foo         return foo    When you execute foo for the first time memory for it is allocated on the stack But then the function calls itself  so memory is allocated again The nd invocation of the function calls itself a rd time  and so on to infinity and beyond Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,18,15
Schnutzel,Buffer overflowA buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer an array and the data exceeds the size of the array For example    char buffer    scanfs bufferThe function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer which is  bytes long However scanf doesnt limit how many characters will be read  it will read until its done until a whitespace character is reached So what happens if the user enters helloworld The first  bytes are written into the buffer but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the arrayNow one of three things can happen The overwritten memory can be unimportant and nothing bad will happen for example the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore The program is not allowed to write to this memory so it will report an error and probably crash The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important but the program continues running This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldnt normally have access to which is a security flaw thanks uBrQQQ for expanding on this,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,14,11

MEaster,Buffer Overflow Any random piece of data has a certain size For example an ASCII character is  byte So if you have a string of  characters you would need  bytes to store it A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other dataStack overflows are a bit more complicated Firstly a stack is a way of storing a list of data Its whats known as a lastinfirstout list Basically think of it as a stack of plates You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack and then remove data by taking it off the topAnother thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every timeWhen a program enters a subroutine it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets biggerIn an operating system such as Windows I believe each program has its own stack of limited size If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it then it will halt the program with a stack overflow error to prevent the program from causing problems,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,1
RandomRobot,The two can be combined or independent depending on the context A buffer overflow is very common in the CC languages It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds In those languages you can access memory directly so a string can be shown as     char myStringIf you try to copy more than  chars into it then it will overflow A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed like in the previous example However if you dynamically allocate memory that memory will be on the heap a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to     char myString  new charThis string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow which is handled slightly differently by the programOverflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack such as return addresses If you carefully craft your x chars then you can potentially control the execution of the program If your buffer was large enough say char then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes because what an attacker wanted back in the days was to get a shell or a command line to the infected computer There are whole books dedicated to this how to write them and how to detect themAnother way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions The stack is a limited place with around M depending on tons of factors such as your OS your language your compiler Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this    void func      func    Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones first because they are easy to detect even by just reading the code The first execution will also crash fast Secondly the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program while leading an attacker to complete control of your machineThere is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called Smashing the stack for fun and profit by Aleph OnehttpwwwphrackcomissueshtmlissueampidModern OS such as Windows  and Ubuntu  have built in protections against those attacks since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid A common protection is a canary on the stack It means that the OS puts a special magic value at strategic places on the stack After some instructions the OS checks if the magic value has changed If it has then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the userThere are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows but they are more difficult to execute properly,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
kyz,The implicationsThe stack is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program Every time you call another function it saves your current state on the stack and where to come back toThe called function runs and when it finishes it restores the state to before you made the call stored on the stack and jumps back to just after the call instruction also saved on the stackIf you run out of stack the program simply has to stop running Where can you store the details of the next function call Nowhere youre outta space The OS has to abort the programHowever theres something worse Imagine you take input from the user and put it into space located on the stack What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for it means that the end user gets to control whats on your stack They get to overwrite it with whatever they like They now control the state of your program They get to control where your program will go to once the next function returnsIf its easy enough to guess where the stack is if its at a predictable location like it used to be before address space layout randomizationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiAddressspacelayoutrandomization was promulgated you can tell the program to jump to the stack data itself which is something you the attacker have control of thanks to the buffer overflow This is called smashing the stackhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSmashingthestack for fun and profit The stack data which is actually code is called shellcodehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiShellcodeSo now you have complete control of the program Just from supplying input to a program you have made it start running your own code and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it hasOne fix against this as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code is to mark the stack memory as No eXecutehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNXbit which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack it will immediately end your program,1,cdnpmng,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

neanderthalman,Simplest terms with some inaccuracy  atomic nuclei are made of little particles called protons and neutrons The protons themselves are made up of quarks The quarks are held together by the strong force to make the protons and neutrons and the protons and neutrons are also held together by the strong force to make the nucleusThe weak force is tougher to explain but one thing that it does is keep a quark stable Quarks can change color which can in turn change a proton into a neutron or a neutron into a proton In doing so it will release energy in the form of an electron or positron which is ejected from the nucleus as radiation,1,cdnmpfi,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2
InfiniteAmbiguity,The strong and weak nuclear forces are two of the four fundamental universal forces  As you mentioned the other two fundamentaluniversal forces are electromagnetism and gravitation  There are many interesting theories about why we have four and how they started including that they allstarted as one combined fundamental force and separated over time after the Big Bang  In any event the strong nuclear force allows for the otherwise counterintuitive formation and integrity of an atomic nucleus  An atomic nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons but gravitation doesnt operate a subatomic scales and is a very weak force in any event while electromagnetism says that protons should repel each other in such close proximity and prevent any atomic nuclei from forming  Obviously without atomic nuclei forming we would not have anything we see including life forms So the strong nuclear force is what overcomes electromagnetic repulsion among protons and allows atomic nuclei to maintain structural integrity and thereby for atoms molecules and things we see  The strong nuclear force is very strong but only within very short distances such as atomic scales  So in summary the strong nuclear force is what holds atomic nuclei together allowing the formation of atoms and obviously molecules by extension  The weak nuclear force allows for radioactive decay It is different from and weaker than the strong nuclear force  The crucial practical effect of the weak nuclear force is that it allows for nuclear fusion within stars Nuclear fusion within stars is essential for fueling the stars and for ultimately allowing for the formation of the higher elements  ,1,cdnn7on,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2

Pandashriek,This pretty much depends on the spaceshipUsually those rocket engines contain not only fuel but oxygen also as this allows a detonation to take place and power the rocket in the respective direction Technically if you take a shuttle with its rocket engines still attached to its hull teleport it into deep space tore open the rocket engines and light the match you will witness some great fireworks Those tanks will provide enough oxygen for the fuel to ignite and explodeAs for implosions  those are impossible to occur on a space ship The fact that the Cosmos is a vacuum means that there is no pressure which means that there is no force being exerted on the ship making it implode Actually the main force being exerted on the ship is coming not from the outside but the inside The ship is actually a pressurized container and all that pressured air tries to escape in space This is the reason why when a rupture occurs everything is sucked out into space  you shouldve seen it in the movies and that is actually trueThings that do implode very oftenly are stars However they collapse because on themselves due to the huge ammount of weight that is being exerted However  this is another story,0,cdnndj6,1rinpb,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

MooiWeer,The most used anesthetic in surgery is propofol Propofol works by making it harder for your nerves to transfer signals If your nerves dont transfer signals you wont feel pain cant move are not conscious and you dont make memories Propofol can make your nerves stop transferring signals through at least two pathways Neurons the cells that are mostlyyour nerves communicate with each other through neurotransmitters There are neurotransmitters that make a nerve cell send a signal but there are also neurotransmitters which prevent a neuron from activating Propofol makes your nerves more susceptible to an inactivating neurotransmitter called GABA By doing this it makes sure signals dont go from neuron to neuron  To transfer a signal through a single neuron an electrical charge must pass through it A resting neuron has a portential voltage between the inside and outside of the cell of mV when activated this is raised to about mV thereby sending an electrical signal through the cell The potential goes form  to  by opening sodium Na channels which makes Na flow into the cell increasing its potential Propofol blocks these channels making it impossible for neurons to transfer a signal So basically neurons are less able to send send to other neurons and are less able to send information through the neuron itself  ,0,cdnoa67,1ripzx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

meldyr,Usually people start using the water analogy I have a couple of problems with it You have positive and negative charges That would be the equivalent of water particles with positive and negative mass Current goes in circles at least in circuit theory Water doesnt do that necessarily Usually they say voltage is height or pressure The problem is that voltage is just energy It is thus a little bit of both that can complicate the thinking sometimesChargeParticles can have a charge You have positive and negative charged particles Two particles with the same charge repel each other Two particles with an opposite charge attract each other  Charge is expressed in Coulomb Eg An electron has a charge Qx CQ is the symbol of charge and C is the symbol for CoulombCurrentCharged particles can move If charged particles move through a wire you have current Current tells how much charge goes through a wire in an instant of timeIf  Coulomb of charge travels to a wire in  second you have a current of I  Cs AWhere I is the symbol of current and A the symbol of AmpèreAmpsWhat is voltageAn electrical particle causes an electrical field Suppose you have a nonmoving electrical charged object Lets call it object A If you bring another electrical charged object close to it This is object B Object B starts to move Object B starts to gain speed You could say that just because B is put on a given start position it has some kind of energy When it starts moving that energy is converted in kinetic energy energy because it gains speedThe voltage represents the electrical energy that particle has because it is on in that position in proportion to its charge To every position in space we can assign a voltage VV  EQWhere V is the voltage E is the energy an electrical particle would have on that position and Q is the charge of that particle EgSuppose the object B has a  charge QC Because of being at that place it has an energy of EJ We say that on that place the voltage VJCVNote that the first V represent the voltage And the second V stands for VoltsResistorsIn this figurehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsddeOhmsLawsvg you see that on the top is a high voltage called V  and on the bottom we have a low voltage V We know from the previous section that a charged particle that is in the highvoltage area will flow down to the low voltage area and gain speed The problem is that it doesnt go that simpleWhen the particle goes down it has to travel trough a resistor and the particle will bump against a lot of other things How more things that it will hit when going through the resistor the slower the current will flowWe can characterize a resistor by using Ohms LawVIRIf the Voltage difference over the resistance is V and the current IA the resistor has a resistance of  OhmWattsPrevious I explained that a charged particle has trouble to go trough a resistor The particle will lose speed as it goes trough the resistor This means that the particle lose energy Because the current runs in a circle we can assume that at any place the speed of the particle should be the same The kinetic energy doesnt changeSo the amount of energy that is lost in the resistor equal to EVQWhere V is the voltage and Q the amount of charge that went trough the resistorIf we want to know how much energy we use for a given time instance we can do the following dividing trough a time tPEt  VQt VTP is the power that is lost in the resistance The power is expressed in Watts Buying a light bulb Voltage The light bulb is designed for a given voltage and the wires in your house provide that given voltage So nothing to worry about Power This is the amount of watts The more power it uses the higher your power bill will be On most light fixtures you can find something like W In that case you should put a light bulb in it that consumes less than  Watt  If your light bulb consumes more power than your light fixture can provide you could damageburn your fixture  Light Intensity The more Lumens L the more light it gives Dont assume that because a light bulb uses more power it will produce more light  Color Temperature It is expressed in Kelvin K But its tricky what scientists call a low color temperature describes colors which normal people would describe as warm So if you buy a lightbulb choose one that has a low co lour temperature to keep your house cozy If your light color is too high you will have an unpleasant hospitallike light A right choice depends on the atmosphere you want in the room I wouldnt go above KBuying a microwaveHere you have to be careful You have two times a number in watts which describes different things Power consumption the microwave consumes  Watt This is the number that ends up on your bill Microwave Power this is how much of the power is actually used to heat your foodAn average microwave oven uses about  Watt to provide  Watt microwave food If you buy a microwave oven you should check that it provides enough microwave power and the efficiencyBuying a generatorFor a simple generator you shouldnt mind the voltage It produces the same voltage as a power plugPower The more power it can produce In Watts The more electrical appliances it can support at the same timeEfficiency How much fuel it needs to create one Watt Sometimes given in literWatt sometimes just given as a number Note dont compare these two different

InfiniteAmbiguity,Not necessarily but possibly  Assume that each nation is actually one person for simplicity  If I representing my nation walk into your house representing your country put a gun in your face and take all of your stuff then Im necessarily richer and you are necessarily poorer  There are also external effects on people who become aware of this event but we can ignore them for purposes of your question  This is a case where my wealth increase correlates precisely with your wealth decrease However assume that I walk into your house and offer you to sell you a car for  and you agree  Assuming thats the cars actual fair market value then neither of us are better off at all but were both in the same positions at that transactions moment  But then I take that  invest it and get  back from the investment  Ive now increased my wealth by  while you havent lost anything  And presumably my investment has also benefitted thirdparties who are also better off also without you losing anything  Now further assume that you use the car to get a lucrative job that would have been too far away for you to take in the absence of having an affordable and reliable car which I sold to you  This new job pays you much more than anything you had before and so your wealth increases without diminishing my wealth Presumably your employer has also benefitted from your labor too in amount that exceeds your cost to the employer  And lets say you then leverage this job into even better jobs while also accumulating investment capital which further enriches you  In this second scenario Im richer the recipients of my investment are richer youre richer your employer is richer and the recipients of your investments are richer  and nobody is poorer  These same scenarios with an infinite number of permutations happen every day at national and international levels  These free voluntary and consensual transactions  overall  lead to better aggregate wealth results for all assuming full information zero coercion and zero fraud Obviously there are individual exceptions but the system overall  with inherent disadvantages that we work to minimize  seems to be the best devised and implemented as a practical matter So if theres force coercion trickery or violence then one nations wealth will probably come at the expense of the other nations wealth  With free consensual voluntary and informed trade then its likely that all participants will benefit although its unlikely that they would benefit in exactly the same amounts  ,0,cdnqg51,1riyx7,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

LeSquish,Oooo memeI grew up in a movie theater and I think more detail about the process requiredEveryone makes a lot of money but who gets it all depends on how well the movie does There are a lot of people paid up front for their services Many of these people are technicalsupport and are often paid at a flat rate but depending on their talents might be able to negotiate royalties Actors producers and directors often receive their pay in a combination of flat pay and royalties overtime Even if the movie flops they already get some cash This is why this group has to negotiate because if the movie does really well you dont want to have worked for too cheap and screwed yourself out of ass tons of cash Next we move to the theaters and producers For theaters deciding what movies to show are a gamble Producers dont take a flat cut of sales They take different percentages over time and these percentages vary from company to company A producer will present a movie they want to distribute to the theater operators The producer may ask for something like  cut of the profits for the first  weeks of box office receipts and then maybe bring it down to  later random imaginary numbers The theater owner then looks at the movies being offered and tries to ascertain how long the movie will stay popular or if it will be popular at all If theaters think the movie is too risky and turn out will be poor they haggle down the price or refuse to show the movie in their theater Now that the terms have been decided theaters have to pay up front to purchase rights to show the movie Then they hope to god that they movie will be popular for more than  weeks because they wont really be making any money before that time period So now the movie premiers and the producers starts to make bank The first weekend is the most important because that is when studios mop up the biggest cut of ticket sales  weeks pass movie is still popular and now the theater can mop up without the huge cut going to the producers if it turns out to be a movie popular as long as the Avengers theaters will make ass tons of money on top of their concessions that is their primary source of income But what if the movie flops immediatelyThe reputation of the all the people that madestarredworked in the movie is diminished and you lose your bargaining power with the theaters and hence can loss access to key markets The producer absorbs the loss If the movie flops later the theater takes most of the loss Sometimes people lose interest in a movie after a week of it being out The theater next time will be wary of this producer and probably negotiate a shorter run and less seating for that producer as well as a larger piece of the profits tl dr Too badEditTyposgotta fix em all,0,cdo4mui,1rj2k2,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

AyCarrumba,Stereoscopic vision is only one component of how we perceive depth and not even aparticularly good one Because our eyes are closely spaced its only really good for close depth perception Combined with convergence How much our eyes have to look towards one another to focus on a close object these binocular methods of depth perception are really only effective out to about  metresMonocular methods of depth perception that dont depend on having two eyes include Parallax  things move relative to one another as out point of view changes Relative size  smaller things are further away example in a field of cows Familiar size  Ships are big dogs are middle sized insects are small We know this Perspective Line converge to a point which indicates the size of an object Occlusion If one object passes in front of another blocking our vision of it we have perception of their relative size and so distance Defocus Blur As our point of focus shifts different depths are resolved in and out of focus by the eye This gives important depth information Distance to horizon In a natural landscape the closer something is to the horizontal horizon the further it is away This is a function of our elevation above ground levelThere are moreSo as you can see our depth perception is NOT limited to stereoscopic vision We use many subtle effects to judge depth One of the reasons D cinema can be nauseating or confusing is because it uses simple binocular effects to brute force our perception of D which is uncomfortable when other queues are  misplaced in the footage were viewing,5,cdnvtoc,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,hot,29,24
nosessequasinanos,You cant really but your mind is interpreting distance based on its experience of the surroundings and the objects you see For example when you see a car you have a pretty good idea of how big a car is so your mind can estimate how far away it must be If you see something new or something without a standard size like a ball however your mind will have a harder time,6,cdnsbg5,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,hot,12,6
robbak,We have many ways of judging depth The main one for relatively close things is the difference between both eyes But we also get cues from how much our eyes have to focus from perspective  that is the way distant things are smaller than near things and the way dust and smoke change the color of distant objects,0,cdnsebp,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3
Rakaicius,Ill take a crack at this one  The brain uses several different cues for judging distance some of which only require one eye   if object A is partially covered by object B our brain assumes B is closer than A   the more detailed we see something the closer we think it is  This is why studies have shown people tend to underestimate distances in foggy conditions our brains already have an idea of the size of familiar objects due to past experiences   objects closer to the horizon appear bigger because we assume it is closer to the ground   Next time you see a lowhanging moon that looks big curl your hand into a very loose fist and look through it you should notice the moon now looks smaller  The brain will use these cues to give you an idea of the relative distance of an object but its not a perfect system  If you ever try to play a sport with one eye closed youll notice a huge difference  Nothing beats having two perspectives to compare differences  For an interesting example of using two perspectives check out how Napoleon was so accurate with his cannons  ,0,cdnvwax,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

Cogythea,Condenser microphones work by having a metal diaphragm right next to an electrical circuit httpwwwmediacollegecomaudiomicrophonescondenserhtml Put simply when the sound waves hit this diaphragm they push it back onto the circuit as sound is a vibration thereby completing the circuit This then sends an electrical signal down the wire the microphone is connected to or the sound card in the case of the camera and this signal is then interpreted and converted into its original form When a microphone is exposed to wind it is constantly pushing that diaphragm back onto the circuit so the signal is being sent when it ordinarily would not be This creates an anomalous sound The volume of this sound depends on the windspeed  a higher speed means that the signal is being sent more times per second I would assume that we dont hear wind as loud because we have evolved to filter some of it out Not  sure though but thats my explanation as to why microphones pick up wind very loudly If anybody has any corrections Id be more than happy to hear them ,1,cdnuv3t,1rj90z,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

panzerkampfwagen,Torrents are where files are split into smaller pieces  You run a program that finds these pieces from other users and downloads it from them  Those who have the complete file are called Seeders  Those who are downloading are called Leechers  Together theyre known as Peers  You get your copy from both Seeders and Leechers  Obviously the only way to guarantee that a complete file is available is through Seeders  This is why its recommended that once you obtain the whole file you remain as a Seeder instead of hitting and running which is where once you get the whole file you stop torrenting it to save your own bandwidth  This is a common problem on open public torrent sites which is why a lot of people go to private torrent sites where you have to obtain a ratio of at least  meaning youve uploaded as much as youve downloaded to be able to use the site  If you drop under a ratio of  for too long they ban youThe torrent programs arent illegal so you can just look for their names such as uTorrent and download them  Wikipedia would probably give you a long list of different torrent programs  Quite a lot of MMOs for instance use Torrents for downloadingOne of the advantages of this is that someone a person or company doesnt have to host the complete file on their own server and spend a fortune on uploading it  Instead once enough people have the file and are uploading it the faster new people can obtain the fileThe downside is that by splitting the file into smaller pieces more popular files can literally slow down the internet for everyone  When popular TV shows and movies are released on torrent sites the overall speed of the internet slows down  The internet can handle larger files more easily than lots of smaller pieces  ,0,cdnx4r3,1rjoc9,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

colinbroderick,Like most physics problems you solve it with a cleverly placed triangle  Theres a reason you spend so much time learning trig in school you knowBasically at some point in the year you measure the angle between where the sun is on the sky and where the star is in the sky  Exactly half a year later you measure the angle again  What you now have is a triangle where you know the length of the base twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun and you know both of the base angles  From this information it is very easy to calculate absolutely everything else about the triangle including the height which will be the distance from the Sun to the star  If you want you can also calculate the distance from the Earth to the star  Which distance you really want probably depends on what youre it using for and actually the timeaveraged distance between the Earth and the star will be the same as the distance between the Sun and the starIt looks something like this        X                      The dot at the centre of the base is the Sun the X is the star in question  As mentioned above we know the length of the base and the two base angles so we can calculate everything else about the triangle        Its called parallaxhttpenwikipediaorgwikiParallaxParallaxinastronomyThis is just one method and only works well for relatively nearby stars  For things that are further away we use the brightness  For certain types of star we know exactly how bright they really are at the source so by observing how bright they appear to be from here we can calculate how far away they are  Brightness decreases with distance in a wellunderstood wayEdit  By the way this is almost exactly the same principle that allows us to judge how far away things are  Because we have two eyes our brain gets two slightly different images from two slightly different angles and the two images together allow the brain to calculate how far away objects are  Again this only works for quite nearby objects up to about  feet for more distant things we have to rely on things like our knowledge of scale ie if it looks smaller its probably further away,1,cdnxvy6,1rjqro,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,3

darkautumnhour,There was an interesting TEDtalk about this that sort of opened my eyes GMO refers to a method of using DNA sciencemagic to make plants better at some things output namely but ultimately everything that reaches the table of the modern man is in some way genetically modified Crop cultivation which began thousands of years ago when humans decided they were getting tired of the nomadic lifestyle started to realize that if they only gathered and replant seeds from the tastiest most bountiful plants year after year the resultant crop becomes increasingly tastier There were no bell peppers thousands of years ago at least not the beautiful shit you pick up in a grocery store likewise for pretty much anything else you eat From cilantro to chicken to avocados to almonds humans have artificially selected traits that they deemed most beneficial and it is unlikely that natural evolution would ever produce something similar Unless you actually are hunting and gathering your own food from a deep forest everything you eat has been genetically modified in some sense Now we just have the technology to do it with laser accuracy rather than centuries of trial and error,0,cdo1z8d,1rjrxd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Koooooj,You just need a Bitcoin wallet  Note that in Bitcoin the word wallet means several different things including The application or website that manages your balance The file that stores your private keys the data that indicates that you own the Bitcoins The collection of addresses that you ownFor this post I will be using wallet to refer to the first definition  There are several options to choose from when selecting a Bitcoin wallet  You can change your mind at any point though so dont stress out about it too much  I would recommend Electrum for a new userits a wallet that will store all of the sensitive data  on your computer meaning that you have zero reliance on any website while it allows rd party servers to store the  GB of data from the Bitcoin blockchain  If you want to use a completely standalone wallet then either Bitcoin QT or Armory would be a good choice the latter is built on the former but has more features for advanced security  You could also consider using something like Blockchaininfos online wallet which can be done carefully to minimize risk of losing your coins due to the actions of a rd party  If you have a smartphone then the Android or iOS wallets would be a good choice since they easily allow you to see that youve received a payment without needing to carry around a laptopWhen you select your wallet application there should be some button that says something to the effect of generate new address  When you hit that button youll be given a string of numbers and letters that represents the new address something that looks about like ABsAjenaBjyPxyTjvkBhpreJT this is an address I own  When you go to sell you just have to give the buyer that information and tell them how many bitcoins to send  When they send the bitcoins you should get a notification that there is a transaction incoming and some time later the transaction will be confirmed by the network  Once confirmed the odds of the buyer scamming you are virtually zero although many buyers will not want to wait for the confirmationit can take a while  For most transactions it is reasonable to consider a transaction as being complete when it is first received unless you stand to lose quite a lot of money in the event of a scamAs always make sure you use good common sense  Dont meet people in locations where they can easily rob you and what not  If all you give the buyer is an address and an amount to pay then theres not much they can do to scam you though  Honestly theyll probably be more worried that youre scamming them since theres no way for them to unsend the bitcoins once theyve paidthey have to trust that youll hand over the goods  Keep that in mind to keep the buyer at easeYou should also look into securing your wallet nd definition  Most wallets st definition have the ability to encrypt the wallet nd definition with a password  Be sure to use a strong passworda good choice would be a phrase that doesnt appear in any literature or anywhere online nonsense makes a good choice here provided you will remember it,1,cdo1xky,1rjs58,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

bahanna,Well Judges set bail and defendants post bail Not sure why those are the words but anywayBail is set before trial and people are innocent until proven guilty We cant very well throw people in jail because some cop though the guy probably broke a law only for a jury to come along three months later and say Oops were really not sure you committed any crimes By that point its too late theyve served  months in jail for a crime they didnt commit Bail is a compromise The idea is that the court holds on to such a large amount of money that we can be reasonably sure the defendant will show up to get it back IDK about Kyron Templeton but when it comes to  Million bail the idea is that if anyone is willing to lend this guy  million dollars then we know theyre not going to let the him out of their sight Theyll have bounty hunters following him  to make sure he shows up at the trialOf course bounty hunters cost a lot of money So between that at the risk they could fuck up and lose the bondsmans  million Kyron would have to come up with a fewseveral hundred thousand dollars to make it worth their whileSo the judge figures The state could allocate officers to keep an eye on him  for the next  months but that cost the equivalent of k in manhours we cant spare So Ill let him see if he can hire someone else to do the job and take the risk Since bailbondsmen charge  that     Million If he cant find someone to do this great if he can then all the better In either case no one can say we didnt try to let him out with reasonable precautions  the precautions were just too expensive,0,cdo0zpp,1rjz8z,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
pythonpoole,The point of the bail system in most jurisdictions is to ensure that the accused shows up to their scheduled court date Its not supposed to be used as a form of punishment or detention since you have not yet been convicted of any crime but rather is intended to make sure that you will attend court and go to trial to assess your guiltiness for the crimes which you have been accused ofTechnically you should be awarded bail at a low amount whenever the risk of you being absent for your court date is considered low even if you are suspected of potentially violent crimesYou are only supposed to be denied bail or be set a large bail amount if you are considered a flight risk eg the risk of skipping court dates andor leaving the jurisdictioncountry to avoid punishment is highThere are many factors which may be considered when assessing flight risk the risk of skipping court including such factors as whether the person has a passport and the financial means to afford travelling out of the country whether the individual is settled and socially connected with others eg has a family to provide for etc and whether the individual has an established place of longterm residence as opposed to someone just living on the street or in a hotelEdit Of course I forgot to mention the key point which is that you get the money back after you attend the court dates you are scheduled to show up for So bail is really just a way of saying we dont know if youre guilty yet so well let you go for now but you have to pay us a security deposit so we know youre serious about returning to court and well eventually refund you the bail amount IF you fulfill all your court duties,0,cdo0rdc,1rjz8z,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

pythonpoole,Github is basically a powerful collaboration and project management tool for computer programmingIts designed to let people share coding projects with others and help manage those projects while allowing others to also contribute to the source code Its primarily useful when you have multiple people working on the same codebase and you want to keep track of and review everyones individual contributions to the projectBy default Github creates public repositories for your projects which means everyone else has access to your projects source code If required you can pay a subscription fee to get private repositories eg to use internally at your organization or for proprietarycommercial purposes,0,cdo2muq,1rk6vr,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

aadhar,So a skeletal muscle cramp is a painful overshortening or contraction of a skeletal muscle  It can happen due to a variety of reasons  Some of the most common ones are fatigue and electrolyte imbalances  Many people who play sports or run experience a cramp from a fatigued muscle Ill explain this one  Basically your individual muscle cells run out of their energy source ATP as they become fatigued  This energy source is needed to actually detach the linked contracting fibers in your muscle cells  This would normally allow relaxation of the muscle  If the energy runs low they cant detach  So your muscle temporarily gets locked in a contracted state which causes the pain  So obviously it follows that resting the muscle is a good solution for this cause of crampsI can explain the electrolyte imbalance particularly calcium and potassium imbalances cause as well if youd like but it involves a much more indepth explanation of skeletal muscle physiology so Ill skip it for now  Suffice it to say that staying well hydrated can help prevent this cause of cramps  As for what most likely happened to cause you to wake up with a cramp in your calf heres my guessYour calf muscle was probably contracted in the position you were sleeping  That particular muscle helps you move your foot so that you point your toes down like youre standing on tiptoes  And basically because your foot was in that position for a long time while you were sleeping the muscle cramped due to the fatigue reason I explained above,1,cdo30cj,1rk6zy,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2

Faustroll,Basically notions of creativity skill and quality underwent drastic shifts beginning in the th centuryIt is imperative to understand the word master in historical context which at the time connoted skill but also crucially described an artist who had a studio in which he rarely she trained other artists Students had a fairly rigorous training in academic drawing for a few years before they learned painting This method created a kind of consistency and helped encourage the notion that artists with large studios were true masters The exceptions here are Michelangelo who was notorious for not having a studio and for berating assistants until they abandoned him and for Leonardo who worked in relative isolationSo master in the Renaissance more often implied individual skill but also skill as a teacher A notion of individuality plays a role in forming a notion of the master during the Renaissance and at this moment it meant the extent to which you could teach others to make art that looked so much like yours that it was indistinguishable Its interesting that you picked Michelangelo and Leonardo since neither of them had studiosAnother piece of this has to do with the Renaissance belief of where in the process creativity actually happened Drawing was the central node of intellect at this time it was why artists studied it for so long and it was why assistants generally carried out the majority of painting in the studios after which the master generally did touch up That was your entry into the grand style in which drawing was seen as the place where the real thinking happened So if you were good at drawing then theoretically you could be good at anything Drawing in Italy disegno implied that design the putting together of something occurred before the execution of it All of these ideas of creativity and individuality underwent a massive change in th century Europe with the decline of academies Artists gradually began pursuing the idea that real creativity did not hinge on excelling in an accepted style or having a studio in which you taught others So the word master changed drastically at the time and became a question of unique personalities The focus on personality and emotion was best seen in unique styles that shied away from the polish of the academic style Impressionism and turned quality into something that was way more granular So to ask whether an artist is a master the reply could be a master of what In determining a master there needs to be a comparative body of less talented artists With collective style dissolving art was no longer something that had a collective comparative premise Artists were judged by their sincerity to the motif which was a personal question Most importantly total emulation like the kind you would find in a studio system gradually vanished So while a young artist was inspired by Picasso actual copying was anathemaArtists today create in different media but judging mastery is based more on the taste of the viewer for different specific artists and everyone has an opinionSorry if this is kind of meandering but it is a complex issue with lots of aspects that feed into each otherA good source for how these ideas came about in the th century is Cezanne and the End of Impressionism by Richard Shiff and The Academy and French Painting in the th Century by Albert Boime,0,cdo8832,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,9

FoolOfFools,I dont know if someone said this already so sorry if Im being repetitive From what I remember the three big names of the High Renaissance Da Vinci Michelangelo and Raphael only became famous after their names were propagated by Georgio Vasari who was from the same location as them but I dont remember where that was Florence perhaps The reason he was so successful at this propaganda was because he wrote one of the only surviving literature on art and great artists of that time periodbooks were just coming into popularity and books on art were rare Vasari didnt acknowledge other artists who were of the same calibre because they either werent from the same location or didnt suit his artistic preferenceThat being said there could have been other great artists and there can still be great artists now but nowadays its all about being different and selling the artist instead of the art This concept was first initiated by Marcel Duchamp I believe with his controversial urinal fountain his idea was that anything can be made into art if you believe in the artist The term art has become so subjective now that great artists are often passed over in favour of those who can produce something different and unique Even before the Renaissance when all you usually find are unrealistic illustrations by tribal people or eastern cultures the capacity for realistic art was still present but nobody believed in it due to religious beliefs They believed that portraits should emphasize specific traits Realistic art was considered offensiveI took two consecutive courses of ancient and modern art a couple of years ago so my memory is rusty and the details might be a bit off so I apologize for that,0,cdobr2h,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Eventhorizon,Today though there are quite a few individuals who are as multifaceted few artists in art programs are taught to fully cultivate each medium simply put there are more human beings on the planet in contrast with  years ago In comparison to art apprentices in the time of Da Vinci and Michelangelo there is a saturation of the art school market with students who simply cannot draw well or sculpt etc Instead art schools today exist as businesses and about less than  of students are multifaceted Most art students choose to pick a particular route ie graphic design or animation and ignoresimply get through other reqs like ceramics sculpting or drawing As a result theres also been a huge shift in the medium through which artists choose to express themselves relying less on pure technical talent and more on conceptual art This also means that mean people who think they are artists saturate the market and cant find work easily Lastly artists dont benefit from being masters of different art forms in the way that they used to through patronage royal court reputations instead art students are incouraged to use multimedia collage technology etc to diversify their art creating new possibilities but simultaneously helping some artists better hide the fact that they cant draw or paint technically well there have been many painters throughout history accused of not knowing how to paint classically many Impressionist painters considered among them ,0,cdohdbk,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
laioren,So everyone here is pretty much just posting things about their favorite artists I think the OP was asking more for contemporary artists that would qualify as a Renaissance Person Or a polymath if you willhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPolymathIll try to contribute this Certainly there are still some really amazing artists and scientists out there Now more than ever However we dont generally have true Renaissance people anymore for the following reasons Lack of Forced Focused Education  Leonard and Michelangelo both endured very focused apprenticeships starting in their teen years Both received specialized education before that Most of the First World eschews such focused educational practices The Less a Culture Knows the Easier it is to Be a Master of Several Basics  To attain a PhD in the United States from a respected University now requires an immense amount of specialization The idea that you could get a PhD in both quantum physics and architecture is very rare and exceedingly difficult The idea that you could get both of those and like five others is unheard ofDuring the Renaissance you could point glass at a star and become a master of astronomy Thats an exaggeration of course but today even if youre really good at science no one really cares unless youre the freaking best at it Financers Rightfully Think There is Only Enough Room in Peoples Heads to Think of Someone in One Way  The people that finance projects have done enough research to know that a large number of people can really only think of someone else in one particular regard So whereas some artists might want to be both musicians AND sculptors the people that publish and distribute their art will generally only choose one medium to sponsorLook at someone like Natalie Portman Sure some people probably know of her work in the sciences but most people dont And even more people dont give a shithttpwwwnytimescomscienceangierhtmlpagewantedallYou can find this again and again Creative people that are good at things tend to continue trying to work However financers rarely back these side projects for fear that the less profitable venture may actually detract from the profitability of what they see as the more promising one Lots of Things Can Now Be Produced with the Same Skill  Someone below mentioned how awesome Kanye is Which is true However everything Kanye does boils down to digital workIm not trying to denigrate anyone here I myself am a digital artist of sorts but being able to produce music digitally movies digitally and graphic design digitally has more in common with the digitally than it does with art portionWorking with real physical stone and sculpting it is WAY fucking harder than creating a D image of it on a computer Again I am NOT saying that creating a D image isnt difficult or that it isnt art or any such polarized interpretation bullshit that some people will make up because they feel threatened when their work is called into questionBut simply put the copy and paste functionality and the fact that undo allows you to make an infinite number of attempts while simultaneously removing the scarcity factor makes all digital work vastly easier to produce Better too but just so much easierIts because of this ease of using digital mediums that generally no matter how many types of things you can do with them most people will simply recognize you as a digital artist of some kind rather than a Renaissance PersonAnd thats fair because sculpting and painting the Sistine Chapel while lying upside down are two very different skills Yes theres still some overlap in the skills especially with the concepts such as the understanding of perspective foreshortening etc but they require much more practice talent and skill to actually accomplish Void of Competition  The Renaissance produced a large number of grand artists but nothing compared with today Now everyone with a computer is an artist with something to offer the world And everyones attention yours mine art critics everyones has universal access to their artSo now people compare and argue about which was a better movie Citizen Kane or Dolemite because our experiences are inundated with the work of artistsWhen there are only  artists of acclaim working in a generation its easy to see all of their talents When there are  billion all you do is compare that kids YouTube clip to the one you made of your cat yesterday and call bullshit,1,cdoj4lq,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,3

oechsph,Forgive my interpretation of this question but I think that its difficult to answer provided that your two examples had significantly different roles during the Renaissance Michelangelo would have been considered an artist during the Renaissance while Da Vincis role as an artist is only secondary to what made him so successful His name would have resonated more as a scientist and engineer than an artist In other words its like asking if there are any modern artists like Nikola Tesla and John Cage The problem is that one was an innovator while the other was an artist Im guessing you are looking for an artistAlso I would like to point out that Da Vinci DID NOT do many different art forms He did painting and drawing He never did ceramics sculptures glasswork etc So again and I know Im being a stickler it seems like your question doesnt even know what its askingThat being said I might take the liberty of revising your question then answering itAre there any contemporary artists like Michelangelo who are masters of several artistic mediumsSimple Answer Yes YES DEAR GOD YES Not only are there a few THERE ARE HUNDREDS The Renaissance popularize the sentiment that the artist does not need to stick to one medium Since the Renaissance you can find artists from pretty much every movement who were masters of their movements in painting and sculpture but not exclusive to those two mediums Looking to what we deem as modern art you could claim that Salvador Dali film photography sculpture painting Picasso sculpture painting costumes theater Boccioni literature painting sculpture Braque sculpture painting  Kollwitz woodblocks sketching sculpture THE ENTIRE BAUHAUS MOVEMENT textiles painting design architecture theater music the list goes on From the perspective of art history they were all masters of many different mediumsWe now live in the age of postmodernism and arguably postpost modernism where the idea or concept behind art is more important than the work itself you may know this as conceptual art In a sense this is now the norm An artist who does one thing and one thing only is easily swept under the carpet Why is this This is subjective but we have a tendency to want something new constantly eg iPhones Art is no different We want to experience new things making a demand for multiple mediumsAlso it should be noted that the living artists or masterswhom we consider celebrities today may very well be forgotten in a hundred years This is pretty common practice in art historyOh I also have a No answer to your question but that is definitely going to leave the ELI zone Is there a ELIBut the short short answer to your question is Yes and they are all over the place,0,cdomd4y,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

dazfive,A collar is a method of attempting to make money on a purely options play It is used separate from any position on the stock There are many strategies like this and are often named other types of buzz words calender spread Iron Butterfly etc They are fancy names for taking a position on both puts and calls long andor short in an attempt to profit while mitigating risk  As for when to use options unless you are a sophisticated investor never The options game can be dangerous but as well lucrative I am an options trader  I use options to make money usually as a seller or writer  The best use of options for an average investor is to protect against downside or lock in a profit If you are long ABC and its has gone up sharply I would say just sell but if you want to participate in more upside while ensuring some profit you can buy and out of the money put This put give your the right but not the obligation to sell at that strike price regardless of where the stock is trading options can also be used as a cheap method to play in a stock  IF you think AAPL is going to rise you can buy an out of the money call which gives you the right to purchase the stock at that price regardless of where it trades Effectively if the stock goes up you can sell the call as opposed to exercising the option to purchase the stock  An out of the money call may only cost  per share rather than the  to buy the actual stock  WARNING  options have an expiry date and are subject to what is known as time decay  The closer the expiry without the equity moving towards your strike the faster the price of the option will drop This can be a tricky game to play I hope this helps   ,1,cdo6gha,1rkcbx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,1

Fairleee,The first thing to understand is the geography of the United Kingdom Ireland is an island lying off the coast of Great Britain which comprised England Scotland and Wales Historically Ireland was under British rule from  and subject to numerous invasions by the English prior to them establishing rule In the early s a successful Home Rule ie independence movement arose and Ireland became independent shortly after the end of WW with the exception of the top part of the country  Northern Ireland which opted to remain part of the United KingdomTo put it simply the main reason why Northern Ireland wanted to remain part of the UK was because much of the population were colonists from the UK and were predominantly protestant This group is known as the Unionists because they want to remain part of the Union of the United Kingdom There was a smaller native population that was predominantly Catholic that wanted to split from the UK so the whole country was part of the Republic of Ireland  this is known as nationalism as they are Irish nationalists or republicanism as they want to join the Irish republicSo the Unionists see themselves as British and the Nationalists see themselves as Irish However as the majority of Northern Irelands population are Unionists it is unlikely that Ireland will unify with Northern Ireland Because the two groups are also split along religious lines protestants and catholics this adds an extra element to the situationThe Troubles were at their worst from the late s onwards and numerous people were killed and injured The UK deployed part of its army to permanent duty in Northern Ireland and radical nationalist groups carried out a number of terrorist attacks in both Northern Ireland and the UK  in  the IRA a nationalist paramilitary group managed to kill the Queens cousin Lord Mountbatten with a bomb Both Unionists and Nationalists were responsible for a lot of awful violence in Northern Ireland itself and the British Army didnt always help matters  Bloody Sunday is a particularly notorious example where the army killed a number of unarmed protestors In recent years the Troubles have become less severe and the IRA has officially announced a ceasefire and no longer engages in bombings or terrorist attacks This is actually one of the lasting legacies of the last Labour government and Mo Mowlam a Labour politician is credited as being a major force behind the peace process she was the Secretary for Northern Ireland at the time The Republic of Ireland has largely acknowledged Northern Irelands existence and it has been established that if unification is to occur it has to be ratified by both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland However sectarian violence still does continue as there is a long long history of violence in Northern Ireland and feuds are still ongoingSo why is Catholicism and Protestantism relevant Well the fact that the two political positions unionism and nationalism were also largely split down religious lines was significant because it is an obvious marker of difference This is similar to how tribal affiliations in various other nations can be used to justify conflict Religion is often a very important part of a persons life as it can play a large role in how they define themselves so anyone who is not part of your religion is automatically an outsider In Northern Ireland the protestant and catholic communities have largely selfsegregated  in Belfast for example people know whether an area is Protestant or Catholic So it was not the primary cause of the Troubles but it was another complicating factorI hope this answer has been helpful please note that bearing in mind this is an ELI I have simplified a lot of the issues The fact is that the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland is very very complex so if you are interested in finding out more the Wikipedia articlehttpenwikipediaorgwikiNorthernIreland on Northern Ireland would be a good place to startEdit added a bit more info,1,cdo6422,1rkebc,explainlikeimfive,hot,7,6

redliness,Actually theres an inherent advantage to black and white film that made it a much more practical option its faster Fast in film terms means that the picture actually forms in the camera without needing as much light You could take a black and white photo from a distance at nighttime and it would come out clear where a colour photo would be an illdefined wash of browns and purples It also let you use much shorter exposure times which meant black and white film was more practical to use when moving or when shooting with a very long zoom lens Even today black and white film is still used in some cases for these reasons,0,cdo6t24,1rkg5f,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

obscuresamplegroup,One reason is as mentioned by ukultakala that you have take the risk of permanently damaging your voice if you start again too early The other reason is that concerts are a whole different level of exhaustion than your normal job A lot of artists run around jump dance and rock off all in bright light that significantly heats up the stage They sweat rivers and pretty much work out for something about  hours at least Even if you are back on the track after a week or two you just need more time to withstand that again So cancelling it is probably the only reasonable option,5,cdo5uwq,1rkhbr,explainlikeimfive,hot,23,18

BassoonHero,SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS for The Avengers and ThorOn a surface level your summary is mostly correct Although Captain America not Thor is considered to be the leader of the Avengers The Avengers is at its heart a bigbudget action movie pitting a band of superheroes against an evil villain and his army Thats not to say that there isnt any more to it of courseLokis apparent motivation in the movie was simple to rule Earth A simple enough motivation and a very common one and the characters in the movie accepted it However many fans believe that Loki never really wanted to rule the Earth He wanted to rule Asgard and never really cared about the Earth When he sent the Destroyer to Earth in Thor it was to kill his brother heir to the throne of Asgard He didnt care one way or the other what happened to the Earths people But in The Avengers he suddenly wanted to rule the Earth Perhaps it was a consolation prize of sorts since he couldnt have Asgard but this didnt seem to be in character for himSo the fans speculated that Lokis scheme was some kind of ruse or diversion Like pretty much everything else hed ever done or said The postcredits scene implies that he was working with Thanos red face guy leader of the Chitauri the alien invaders When Loki is openly working with someone chances are he has already betrayed them and is already plotting to betray the next guy So what did Loki want from Thanos if not to rule the Earth Theres a lot of speculation We dont know what Loki had been doing between the end of Thor and The Avengers What we do know is that at the end of The Avengers Loki returned to the world he desired to rule If his plan was to rule the Earth then it failed but if it was to rule Asgard then the events he set into motion put him exactly where he wanted to be  just like his capture in front of the opera house put him in the helicarrier,0,cdod6wt,1rkhxo,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

ampellang,Ok I will explain how copy protection works on PS and PS since thats what I am well versed on but I cant say definitively how it works on other consolesSo to start you have to understand that the tracks on CDDVDs are not a perfect spiral  There is a wobble which is that the track itself moves back and forth in a sine wave perpendicular to the direction of the track  This wobble is  kilohertz and some change IIRC  The tracks exist independently of the data which is to say when you buy a blank disc the track with its wobble is already there  A Playstation game changes the wobble slightly on the leadin the part of the track closest to the center where that the drive uses to orient itself prior to reading any data  So when the head is orienting itself on the leadin it follows the wobble of the track  By measuring voltage and impedance of the motor that runs the head the system is able to determine exactly how fast the head is moving back and forth and determine that it is different from a normal khz  If the wobble is exactly correct a analogtodigital converter circuit then sends the okay this depends on the region for America the chip sends hex the representation of SCEA to the CPU and allows the game to be playedThis is why it is still impossible to play burned games on a PS without modifying the console in some fashion,0,cdod1s9,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3
IntHatBar,Many methods of copy protection have been invented and cracked over the years  An example PlayStation  remember the black discs have a special CD Drive that can read data from a track on the disc that is not accessible using standard CD drives  The drive seeks to this special spot near the center of the disc and reads a special code from this track to verify game is legit  Hackers quickly found ways to get around this  The most prolific solution was to modify the PS to intercept the signal and respond with the appropriate code  This logic was built into a small integrated circuit and sold online as device allowing users to verify backup discs  If one has the mod chip installed in the PS heshe can simply copy an original black disc using a typical CD burner then play it on the modified PS  You know so you didnt damage your original game disc by playing it  And stuff,0,cdo771w,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
EatDiveFly,one way is thisThis is how they did it back in the diskette days but is probably still interestingrelevantWhen you ask your operating system to make a copy of a disk you are essentially saying please take data from here and put it there in whatever way you pleaseWhen copying operating systems dont generally write to a specific track or sector on the disk Often the native copy command cant for instance write to track  sector  specifically So when the creator makes the disk he puts a code right in that spot  If that code is not there when the software starts up the sw checks with a low level command is there an X on track  sector  it knows its a copy  ,1,cdo78tx,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2

HolyGigi,To answer your question DRMNow about DRM think of it as similar to the way we detect fake money You look for safety elements put the bill in the light so you can see a shape a hologram stuff like that If your disk is genuine it has DRM If its a copy its like a fake bill It looks the same displays the same values but its missing all the protections,2,cdoaaom,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,-1

dochobbes,Insurance companies make plan changes every year  Changes include coverage increases or decrease premiums copays deductibles and limits as well as changes to the provider network who accepts your planChanges are based on market profitability competition in said market and changes required by the government Ultimately the decision to keep change or remove a plan type or plan in general are completely up to the insurance company  So People who lost their current plan may have done so regardless of the ACA however the ACA did make it less profitable for insurance companies to continuing to offer certain plans in certain areas or at all,2,cdo6i75,1rkiyu,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,1

machinehead,The behavior you are seeing on Reddit is not typical and not how a webserver would normally behave  Reddit is very specifically designed to handle shittons of traffic and they have certain traps in place to make sure if the site is getting slammed to make sure it doesnt get slammed harder  So as uSchnutzel points out instead of making you sit there watching your browser spin for  seconds they just throw back that error page with the reddit alien getting buried by upvotes and you refresh to try againOn a single threaded webserver or a smaller website where special considerations are not taken into account this would not happen  If you are running a website where these special traps are not in place and that website gets completely slammed to where a page would take too long to display  your browser is going to spin and you will sit there and wait until either your request times out or the server is able to respond  In that scenario you couldnt just hit refresh to get the page to come up  the server would still be unresponsive,0,cdo63rm,1rkjki,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

BassoonHero,As has been noted E and B do have sharps  F and C This really isnt any different than C sharp being the same note as D flatBut why are B and C closer together than C and D The answer is that there are twelve distinct pitch classes in western music but seven in a diatonic scale such as the C Major scale When notation was being standardized the C Major scale became the default and the seven pitch classes in that scale got simple names whereas the other five pitch classes have to be referred to via flatsharp namesBut why does the diatonic scale have seven notes You can arrange the pitch classes in the C Major scale or any diatonic scale so that each is separated from its neighbor by the interval of a fifth F C G D A E B This is in fact more or less how the scale was defined Why seven notes Because this is the smallest scale that will contain every interval Chop off a pitch class at either end and you cannot form the tritone six semitones Chop off one more and you cannot form a single semitoneFor a more complete explanation read thishttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentsehsuaelithedifferencebetweenwesternandeasterncapko,0,cdocls0,1rkjsr,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

InfiniteAmbiguity,So everyone who receives income pays taxes on that income whether or not they work or make any which are actually very difficult things to define when you look at them closely and impossible to administer orpolice in a large scale But basically the tax code says that all money you receive is taxable unless something in the millions of pages of tax code regulations revenue letters court rulings and other sources  Essentially every rich person pays a lot in taxes on income that they actually receive with one glaring exception  municipalbond investment income is totally tax free regardless of amount received total income or wealth  So for example if I out  billion into municipal bonds that pay me an average of  per year then I keep my billion plus I received  million in income every single year  totally tax free   By contrast if instead of lending the billion to some localgovernment I lend that money to a local private company for  then I will still keep my billion assuming the company doesnt fail I will make my  million per year in interest income and I will pay about  of that  almost  million every single year  in federal taxes plus state taxes as high as an additional  or  million in some states  So municipal bond interest income is the only real total tax code scam that wealthy people can use to actually receivemuse and consume income while spying zero taxes If Americans were actually educated about this it would go away immediately  But both political parties tolerate this game while pointing out totally irrelevant stuff and meaningless but heated sloganeering  In addition to giving people a free ride this municipal bond income exemption also forces residents of fiscally sound states to subsidize the fiscally reckless states which just encourages the fiscally reckless states and their voters to tolerate fiscally reckless behavior  All forms of investment income rental income nonmunicipal interest income and corporate income are heavily taxed or where deductions exist they were consciously chosen for public policy reasons to encourage specific behavior such as research and development charitable giving expanding capital plant and equipment exploration construction and similar behavior  Id say that the mortgage interest deduction is alsoa scam but it primarily benefits existing home owners at the expense of renters and effectively subsidizes the realtors mortgage bankers and home builders  Edit  literally thousands of pages can be written about how horrible the tax system is and why a corrupt federal government  with both parties conspiring  refuses to make it simpler and only keeps making it more complicated But people should start thinking about the most glaring weaknesses  municipal bond interest income being totally exempt from all taxes and the overall complexity of the tax code as a whole  ,0,cdo77xm,1rkkst,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

FellowConspirator,I presume that this question specifically relates to the GAO report on the purchase of  billion rounds of ammunition by the Department of Homeland Security in  That number of rounds is about  times what the US military used over the  years in Iraq DHS was also cited for purchasing a large number of hollowpoint rounds which cost almost twice as much as full metal jacket rounds That ammo was purchased specifically by and for the DHS without intent to share with other government agencies like the militaryThe official explanation for the purchase from the DHS was we need ammo and its cheaper to purchase in bulk No explanation for the purchase of hollowpoint ammunitions was given A spokesman said With more than  armed law enforcement personnel in DHS significant quantities of ammunition are used to support law enforcement operations quarterly qualifications and training to include advanced firearms training exercisesThe GAO is investigating Conspiracy theorists suggest that it may be a scheme to reduce gun violence by tying up the ammo manufacturers causing shortages and increasing prices there were shortages and increased prices that part was true However the most likely scenarios are someone did it just because they could or someone had a financial or political interest tied to the manufacturersHowever the answer so far is nobody knows why DHS is buying more ammo than the Department of Defense,2,cdocz8p,1rkm1p,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,2
zenontherocks,Short answer theres no way to know and theyre not saying They claim its for training but in some cases thats implausible For example the DHS which is supposed to be an exclusively domestic agency just bought  billion rounds of hollow points claiming they need it for training but historically they use about  million rounds per year for training So thats enough to last them hundreds of years at current levelsMaybe theyre drastically changing their training program but they havent said that and probably wouldnt tell us if thats the case Maybe they anticipated an ammo shortage and overdid it stocking up Maybe they meant to cause an ammo shortage in anticipation of citizens trying to stock up following gun ban announcements Maybe they thought civil conflict was likely given political tensionsAlso worth noting that they just bought  MRAV tanks so about enough for one in every county in every state in the US,2,cdo7vt6,1rkm1p,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,2

CoolStoryJohn,WWII ended with two primary power brokers the US and USSR  Both countries were inherently distrustful of each other for two reasons a their systems of government capitalistdemocratic and socialistcommunist were significantly different and b after having fought a bloody prolonged war together both countries knew what the other nation was capable of militarily  It really broke down to fear  The US wanted to cement its place in the world as the sole hyperpower but the USSR threatened that designation by being so powerful itself  While initially the USSR opposed the US on more ideological grounds the belief that capitalism was a true evil and the US was the greatest exporter of this evil that opposition grew less ideological by the end of WWII less about the evils of capitalism and more about also wanting to be the worlds sole hyperpower  As the postWWII th century rolled on a lot of the world took sides  Most of eastern Europe and some South American countries allied themselves with the USSR and generally all of the western Democracies allied themselves with the US all other countries taking a wait and see stanceneutrality  Both sides fought each other through what are now known as proxy conflicts  In other words the US and USSR would find a conflict often Democracy vs Communism themed in the world and each would support whichever side more favored their interests  The side that won added credibility and power to whichever country supported them  On top of these proxy conflicts espionage was incredibly common with USSRallied spies in the west and USallied spies in the east Eventually the west realized that the USSR had achieved a status that would result in mutually assured destruction MAD if they ever launched a nuclear strike at the east  The USSR long had nuclear weapons but MAD requires more than for both sides to just have atom bombsthere need to be nukes AND a delivery mechanism that cannot be disabled in the event of an attack for example the US has planes flying and submarines operating  armed with nuclear missiles in the event of a nuclear attack on US soilso if the US is attacked it will be able to offer a nuclear response regardless of how much damage it sustains  Once the west realized that the USSR had mastered this delivery mechanism and MAD took effect the chance of a direct armed conflict between the two sides which one could argue would have been very likely if MAD was never achieved diminished to about   The result was more proxy and more espionage until eventually the USSR moreorless collapsed itself in the s a very complicated issue itself and the USallies won the cold war    ,0,cdodwm2,1rknqj,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

sacundim,Well first of all somebody has to sue them and I dont think there are many such lawsuits  I suspect there just arent many people who are actually turned down because of ethnicitybecause most white people simply dont apply for these jobsSecond I dont know about where you live but here in the SF Bay Area the workforce at ethnic restaurants is more diverse than what your question would imply Most small restaurants hire Latino immigrants as bussers or line cooksbut rarely as waiters  This includes plenty of Asian restaurantsmy neighborhood ramen restaurant for example has a Japanese chef directing a team of mostly Central American line cooks  The owner is Japanese as is the wait staff except for one halfJapanese who speaks perfectly fluent Japanese  Most of the clientele is recent Chinese immigrants and AsianAmericans A lot of Japanese restaurants here are actually owned and operated by other ethnicitiesmost commonly by Koreans  The reason as I understand it is that Japanese food has better profit margins  And these restaurants again usually have Latino line cooks and bussers There are exceptions to this stillfor example theres a Vietnamese restaurant in my town where one of the wait staff is Latino he started as a busser but I think the restaurant owners realized the value of having a Spanishspeaking waiter  The restaurant is next door to an Asian chain supermarket that actually has a very good Latino products section and attracts a Latino as well as an Asian clientele  The employees there are roughly evenly split between Chinese and Latino though only about  of the cashiers are LatinoSo actually the discrimination question out here is rather about whether Latinos are excluded from wait staff jobs  But certainly a lot of them are undocumented so theyre not suingEDIT Another example in my town Peruvian restaurant owned by Peruvians Peruvian chef with some Mexican line cooks  Dishes in the  range at first most of the clientele was middle class Spanish speakers and all of the wait staff spoke Spanish as well  But word got out and it became more popular among English speakers nowadays most of the customers are Englishonly speakers and theyve hired several wait staff that dont speak SpanishThen theres the shabushabu restaurant that used to have mostly Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian wait staff and Latino cooks  The Japanese takeout corner shop with the Mexican guy who makes great oyakodon etc,7,cdo9frf,1rkphs,explainlikeimfive,hot,47,40

drphrp,As others have mentioned a business can claim an exception to the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act if they employ fewer than  people or if ethnicity is a bona fide occupational qualification BFOQ Although race as in skin color can never be part of a BFOQ ethnicity can be Eg French chef in a french restaurant The BFOQ exception is narrowly tailored however So an ethnic restaurant discriminating on the basis of ethnicity by only hiring chefs of the ethnicity in order to retain authenticity is probably acceptable but only hiring servers or dishwashers of that ethnicity is probably closer to violating Title VII Strictly within the letter of the law many businesses engage in what could be considered illegal discrimination every day Why does this still occur so frequently you may ask Well first you have to prove that you were discriminated against on the basis of your protected status There are multitudes of obvious evidentiary problems in proving discrimination especially that the discrimination was committed intentionally not inadvertently Second the damages suffered by the aggrieved person are usually nominal You didnt get the job as a dishwasher at that restaurant because you werent the same ethnicity as them Yeah sounds discriminatory and maybe it was But what are you going to sue them for and expect to get from them A few months pay maybe Damages in these types of cases are usually so nominal that lawyers who practice this kind of law will not take your case Lawyers who do take these cases do so on a volume basis Ie take as many of these cases as you can and send out letters to businesses threatening to sue unless they settle for a lesser value Very rarely do these cases actually go to trial because of what it costs the lawyer in his or her time spent Third if you do go to trial and the employer claims BFOQ or business necessity defense theres even more chance that the employer may actually win and the Plaintiffs lawyer gets nothing for all the time they just spentSure theres the Equal employment opportunity commission EEOC whose job it is supposed to be to enforce these laws aside from private lawsuits but the system basically works the same as a private lawsuit The only difference is that the government pays the EEOC lawyer to investigate complaints and file lawsuits against employers whereas the private lawyer only does so because of the potential to profit if they win And when you think about how many Americans are clamoring about how the government is too big and spends to much money you shouldnt be surprised to know that less than  of EEOC complaints result in some legal action and the ones that do may take up to  years between initial complaint and filing of a claimFinally as mentioned initially most restaurants like this are small businesses so if they employ fewer than  people they can discriminate more or less all they want and its not illegal TLDR Its usually not big enough of a deal for people who are discriminated against when they are not hired by an ethnic restaurant to sue over it Legal fees will cost more than the potential reward if you win The restaurant may also claim some exemptions under the law so their discrimination is not per se illegal discrimination,0,cdohpwl,1rkphs,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

Salacious,Lets do this chronologicallyThere was a guy named Booker Dewitt He fought at the Battle of Wounded Knee killed a lot of indians and felt really bad about it After the battle he found people being baptized in the river At first he volunteered for the baptismHere the universe splits It becomes World A in which Booker does not go through with the Baptism and goes back to his life and becomes a strike buster In World B he becomes Zachary Comstock remains in the military and goes to Columbia Booker in World A eventually has a baby Anna Comstock in world B is unable to have a baby because of experiments done by Leteuce Comstock in world B wants to have a baby and Leteuce thinks that she can get him one from the world of her brother who is really her in the alternate universe similar to how ComstockBooker are the same person Booker has a ton of gambling debts but no way to pay off the debts so Male Leteuce says he can pay off the debts by giving them his baby He agrees to do that and they take the baby but Booker changes his mind and chases them Leteuece gets Anna through the rift but part of her pinky gets cut off and stays in Bookers world meaning she exists in both World A and World B at the same time This gives her the ability to open portals between worlds These rifts can also span across various times for example in one early scene Elizabeth opens a rift to NYC and the theater marquis shows Star Wars being played even though its only  in the gameBooker sinks into alcoholism and depression after losing his baby carves her initials AD into his hand and gets into more debt Leteuce again offers to wipe away the debts if he goes to this city and brings a certain girl to New York He agrees and they bring him out to Maine and pass through a rift at some point without him knowing He goes into the light house and goes up to Columbia rescues Elizabeth from her tower they flee the city etc Elizabeth is captured by Songbird and brought back to Comstocks house Future version of Elizabeth brings Booker to the future and shows him what happened as a result of not having stopped Songbird from taking her then sends him back to stop Songbird Elizabeth opens a tear to Rapture from Bioshock  and Songbird is killed by the water pressure Then they go up to the lighthouse Each lighthouse represents a World created by a choice like Bookers choice to get baptized or not Each world branches off from many different important choices Anna realizes that as long as there is a world in which Comstock exists there will be a world in which she ends up destroying everyone using Columbia So she opens a tear and they go back to the moment where Comstock began the baptism There the many versions of Elizabeth that had all reached the same conclusion meet up and drown Booker before he can become Comstock thus preventing that horrible future from ever happening and thats why they all disappear,16,cdo79rg,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,hot,105,89

RexMundane,Since the whole story rather confuses itself a few times most of this is interpretation as much as anything so grain of saltThere was a man named Booker and during the battle at Wounded Knee he did some very bad things On his way home he stumbles on a baptism and participates But at the last minute he resists reasoning the bad things hes done cant be washed away in a moment and a prayer He grows older becomes bitter taking a series of jobs working for ever harder and crueler men He marries but his wife dies in childbirth and in time he sells his daughter Anna to a crime boss to pay for his gambling debts Despondent with grief cynicism and drink he loses himself in his misery and ultimately forgets any happy moment he ever knew and there he remains for some  years or soDesperate again with gambling debts he takes another job to rescue a young woman from a city called Columbia which is made of buildings that float among the clouds led by the prophet Zachary Hale Comstock The young woman in question is Elizabeth Comstocks daughter locked in a tower and is herself is a bit of a mystery missing part of her little finger uncommonly intelligent and posessiong supernatural powers Rescuing her avoiding the monstrous Songbird and getting through the political struggles of a class structure at war with itself Booker and Elizabeth in order to affect their escape Booker and Elizabeth ultimately destroy the tower where Elizabeth was kept releasing all the energy that had previously kept Elizabeths diminished and she becomes in effect a kind of goddess capable of exploring alternate universes past and present And it is here Booker learns the truth Comstock is in fact Booker and Elizabeth is actually Bookers Daughter AnnaAll those years ago at the Baptism in an alternate universe there was a version of Booker who decided that yes all his cruel misdeeds could be wiped away easily That by extension perhaps any cruelty can be mitigated by circumstance and ambition that any ends can justify all means And of that mindset he pursued the construction of Columbia using the bizarre science of a physicist named Rosalind Lutece which would allow not just for levitation but crossing planes of reality To accomplish his dream he needs a daughter of his own bloodline but the scientific experiments would render him sterile and so he along with Rosalind would conspire with Robert the version of Lutece from Bookers universe to take Bookers daughter Anna Knowing this and how much trouble is caused by it all Booker realizes the only way to stop the madness and evil Comstock would eventually become responsible for is to back yet again to the baptism to go under the water and never come up again sacrificing his life which he does with the help of various iterations of ElizabethAnnaAfter all of this Booker awakens on the day he would trade his daughter Anna to the mob boss Was all of it a dream A vision of a parallel universe and bad times to come Or all a memory of a reality undone by Elizabeth ,1,cdo8bud,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,4

ameoba,Normal TV comes in at  or  frames per second  Movies are traditionally shot at If youre trying to put a fps movie onto a screen that refreshes  times per second theres no simple way to do this that lets you show each frame of the movie for the same length of time  youd need a TV that showed  frames for a movie frame to show for  screen frames or hz to show a movie frame for  screen frames  In practice they use a  pulldown  alternating between showing a movie frame for  frames on the TV and  on the TV  Some people dont like how this looksIf you have a TV that natively shows  frames per second this isnt a problem  hz video can show each frame for  frames on the TV hz signals can show it for  and movies that were originally recorded in fps can show each frame for  refreshes of the screenAs far as I know theres no widely used standards for video that are actually using all Hz  Some TVs will try to smooth out video amp guess what the inbetween frames are  some people like this and some think its horribleThe best thing to do is to experience it yourself  Go to a store that sells TVs and ask them to demo one for you,0,cdolqr5,1rkr4r,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

Amaterasuomikami,Because flaviviruses are tricky First the dengue virus has four different serotypes and postinfection immunity will not only occur just against the one specific serotype but also worsen the reinfection with any of the three other types So it really is a case of immunizing against all four so called tetravalent vaccine or none at all And then even worse the virus is so specific to us humans that although they can get it not even primates are a viable model  So the virus has effectively prevented effective studies on animal models for a long time new human medication licensing without several effect studies on animals before moving on to human studies is practically impossible and made the risks outweigh the gains by a long shot So it was deemed easier to try and control its spread through the mosquito population insteadHowever since that didnt work at all we have developed ways to make appropriate animal infection models in the recent years There are now several dengue fever vaccines in development and clinical trials including one in phase  which is the last big human trial stage before licensing and postlicensing longterm evaluation So several thousand patients have already been treated with dengue virus vaccines at this point and that is just fantastic,0,cdo8ggz,1rksyx,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

NotMrPotatoDick,Assuming you are American as this issue gets tossed around every now and again the simplistic answer is Separation of Church and State in the st Amendment At the birth of our nation founding fathers like James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were influenced by Roger Williams who wrote there needs to be a hedge between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the world These men made sure that the US government respects all religions and wouldnt tax them to destruction  a phrase from the  Supreme Court Case  Walz v Tax Commission of the City of New York The ruling of this case said that grants of tax exemptions for religious institutionsJustice Burger stated in the ruling   the exemptions for religious organizations created only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state and far less of an involvement than would be created by taxation of churches and the effect of the exemptions was thus not an excessive government entanglement with religion The grant of a tax exemption was not sponsorship of the organizations because the government did not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstained from demanding that the churches support the state The exemption created a more minimal and remote involvement between church and state than did taxation because it restricted the fiscal relationship between church and state and reinforced the desired separation insulating one from the otherHowever because they are exempt from paying taxes they cannot openly endorse any political partycandidate Johnson Amendment of  Sorry I wish I can wirte more,5,cdo984a,1rkvgc,explainlikeimfive,hot,15,10
BassoonHero,Most churches are nonprofit organizations and nonprofit organizations do not have to pay several kinds of taxes Churches do receive preferential treatment in claiming nonprofit status not needing to go through the same procedures as most organizations In general churches must abide by the same restrictions eg on political campaigning as other nonprofits but enforcement is rareIn addition church ministers receive additional tax breaks on housing This is called the parsonage exemption This benefit is not available to nonreligious organizations,1,cdobxke,1rkvgc,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,4
AshRandom,Well if its a question of nontaxation of churches in the US its because of the issue of representation Perhaps youve heard the line no taxation without representation The original intention of the founding fathers was to keep religion out of politics currently failing rather spectacularly in the last century And as churches were supposed to keep out of politics they were given tax exempt benefits Many are currently pushing hard to tax religious institutions in the US precisely because theyve taken center stage politically Recently there has been some major headway Clergy TaxFree Housing Allowance Ruled Unconstitutional Freedom From Religion Foundation Wins Federal Suithttpwwwhuffingtonpostcomclergytaxfreehousingunconstitutionalnhtml,0,cdoko95,1rkvgc,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4
jazzun,I can agree with this concept to a point but I feel that it falls apart once churches become involved in activities that do NOT benefit society such as promote one political party or candidate from the pulpit  I also hate the idea of churches getting breaks from taxation when they are in fact large companies  Many of those radio preachers own businesses planes fleets of cars all by pleading for donations to help the poor or minister to forgotten souls  Very little of those donations actually turn out to benefit society  they benefit the preacher and his cohorts,4,cdog9yo,1rkvgc,explainlikeimfive,hot,6,2
reksy,The other explanations are partially correct But they are missing part of the explanation The idea is that there should be a separation between church and state and that the power to tax is the power to destroy Thus the government should not tax churches because of the power that this exerts over the church including the power to run it out of businessOn this perhaps antiquated view separation of church and state runs both ways the church should not interview with the state and the state should not interview with the churchOf course this is merely a descriptive answer to your question There are also various normative answers on whether any of this is correct or not,4,cdocgc1,1rkvgc,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,1

SqueakyGate,gt We live in a world with advanced medicine and doctorsActually you doand well probably most of reddit For many the access to basic needs clean water food shelter medicine dentists etc is a daily struggle So for them I would say traditional mechanisms of natural selection are still very much at playEvolution works by two main mechanisms natural selection and sexual selection Traits which are naturally selected for improve the chances of the individual surviving to sexual maturity Traits which are sexually selected for improve the chances of an individual reproducing Evolution occurs when the frequency of alleles gene variants changes over time A person does not evolve a population does Also remember that traits and behaviours are not just driven by genes An expressed trait or behaviour is the sum of the genes  environment Moreover what is beneficial in one environment can be detrimental in another Consider this for much of human history being able to store fat was a good thing because by and large resources were scarce Now for certain populations resources are in abundance thus being able to store fat is a bad thing This is because our bodies naturally want to store fat because of this ancient scarcity now its working against us  we have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases etcThe hardyWeinberg principlehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHardyWeinbergprinciple explores the hypothetical situation where evolution ceases It states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences These influences include nonrandom mating mutation selection genetic drift gene flow and meiotic drive Because one or more of these influences are typically present in real populations the HardyWeinberg principle describes an ideal condition against which the effects of these influences can be analyzed Thus there is no real world situation where all of these assumptions are met even in places with advanced medicineHumans are always interacting with their environment even if that is living in a big modern city Our population gene frequencies are always changing Thus we are always evolving Yes some people are indeed surviving into adulthood who would otherwise probably die but that does not equal to a halt in evolution Moreover many diseases or illnesses that we treat like huntingtons arise or are expressed only after an individual has reproduced thus their bad genes have already made it into the next generation In certain cases we can genotype people and determine the level of their genetic risk in which case they may or may not decide to reproduce However the ability to do this is limitedthere are many diseases which we cannot predict from a persons genes thus they unknowingly pass these on anywayFinally humans are always being influenced by sexual selection What is considered attractive is also influenced by culture and thus can vary from place to place and through time Not to long ago being fat was considered attractive because an individual had the means and resources to accumulate wealth Now in western cultures being thin is considered attractive Be careful  some traits can be influenced by genes eye colour hair colour height weight but others are not hairstyles clothing etc Both can change over time and both are influenced by culture but only some will result in physicalbehavioural changes to the human population For example there was a first human born about  years ago with a blue eyed gene This person was obviously considered attractive because their blue eyed gene was past on into subsequent populations ie they managed to have children and their children had children If that first blue eyed person was considered unattractive then  blue eyes might not have been as widespread as they are today Blue eyes do not provide any survival advantage  eg they dont help you see better or farther  they provide a sexual advantage in certain populationsEdit I simplified the blue eyed example from the true story of blue eyes arising but the core of it is the same ,5,cdo92k1,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,hot,8,3

entropydecreaser,Short answer yesEvolution occurs whenever the frequency of alleles in a population changes over time Alleles are essentially types of genes that code for specific traits For example theres an allele for black hair an allele for blonde hair and an allele for red hair The hair colour you get depends on which allele you have This is a huge oversimplification but it gives us a goodenough groundwork when talking about the theory behind evolutionThere are several things to keep in mind The first is that evolution is not only governed by natural selection There are four factors that result in evolution mutations gene flow genetic drift and natural selection Ill go through each one and discuss why humans are continuing to evolveMutations are the random introduction of new alleles in a population They arise as a result of errors in DNA replication or other factors So regardless of medicine mutations will always arise Mutations are not as significant of a factor as the other three so I wont go into detail hereGene flow is the introduction of alleles to a population because of immigration This is very significant when applied to humans Lets look at London for example A thousand years ago almost all Londoners had Caucasian alleles that coded for white skin light hair etc Now however there are people immigrating to London from around the world Im going to use India in this example So Indians move to London and are essentially adding new alleles to the population that code for brown skin black hair etc Assuming that there are whiteIndian couples their kids now have different set of alleles than Londoners would have had a thousand years ago If we go back to the initial definition of evolution regarding the change in allele frequencies in a population this clearly satisfies thatNext is genetic drift This is the random change in allele frequencies over time Though this does happen the population of humans is big enough that we can dismiss it as being not particularly influentialLastly natural selection I assume that you understand natural selection due to your question but Ill explain for any readers that might not Natural selection occurs when certain alleles are favoured over other ones in a particular environment For example in a cold environment dogs with thick fur will presumably live longer and have more offspring than those with thin fur Over time since those with thin fur die out and dont have as many kids the allele coding for thin fur disappears from the population The one coding for thick fur increases in frequency This is where medication comes in Historically diseases frequently killed many people and those that were resistant survived If we take the example of smallpox being introduced to the New World many Native Americans died but those that were resistant lived and continued to have kids and spread their alleles Thus alleles that caused a resistance to smallpox or overall better health increased in frequency Now medication erases many of these selective pressures Those with diabetes in the first world dont die as much anymore Previously alleles that caused people to be prone to diabetes would have been decreasing over time because those with that allele died young and didnt have kids Now they continue to live just like healthy people and they presumably have as kids that inherit these alleles So in a sense you have a valid point However there are plenty of diseases that we dont have easy cures for Cancer and AIDS are two examples Individuals who are resistant to HIVAIDS are presumably going to live longer and have more kids generally than those who are not resistant so we can expect certain alleles to increase in frequency over time and others to decreaseThere is one other point I want to make about natural selection There is a particular kind of natural selection called sexual selection This is when females pick their mates based on certain characteristics and those that are chosen have more kids than those who are not chosen By having more kids the alleles that coded for these characteristics are passed on Sexual selection is certainly existent in modern populations For example women often prefer men that are muscular over men that are fat Of course musculature and fat are hugely affected by lifestyle but genetics also plays a role Assuming that these muscular men have sex more and have more kids than fat men do on average then over a long period of time alleles coding for big muscles will increase and those coding for a predisposition to fat will decreaseThese are just a few of many ways in which humanity continues to evolve Thanks for the question,0,cdoa5cu,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
rupert,Youre thinking of evolution as if its a static phenomenon where the definition of fit never changes Thats how you get the idea of evolution stopping because everyone is now fitMedical advances simply means that the definition of fit has changed and that evolution in humans no longer involve selecting against those who wouldve perished if not for medical advances Rather human evolution is taking a new directionIts also important to note that survival of the fittest isnt all there is to the story  many traits we see arent selected for because its fit but it arises due to random chance,0,cdoa5qu,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
airor,Evolution is the change of allele frequencyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiAllelefrequency in a population  So even if your premise was true that more and more bad genes were remaining in the population and not getting selected out that would still be evolutionThe issue is whether or not having those now survivable alleles in the population is a bad thing and the answer is a definite no  With more combinations of genes there are more paths for evolution to take which means a larger search space for evolution to find beneficial combinations  Consider having that bad gene might be barely survivable in one person but maybe when combined in someone with a specific other gene the two cancel out the bad and produce a new feature  Without the new survivability of that bad gene the chances of the two being found together was very small but now that its survivable it gets a chance to find that other gene  Now the two genes together can be passed on and the new feature can change the population,0,cdoaauv,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

TimeTravellerSmith,TLDR  Its better to turn it down if no one is in the house  If youre not running the AC youre not using electricity and if youre not running heat youre not using gas  Not using those things means you spend less month to monthIt costs money to heat the house in the winter and AC the house in the summer and either case they sit around  degF  So if no one is in the house during work hours  hours a day then its not worth paying for  hours of heatingcooling which is what just about every modern thermostat does these days  They let the house heat up in the summer and not run the AC or it lets the temp drop in the winter by not running the heat  Then they usually are set to reactivate an hour or so before you get home so the house is at  when you pull in  ,1,cdo99am,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2
brokengoose,Im going to assume that by better you mean cheaper Think about it this way is it better to turn the thermostat down if youre going out of town for a month Yes Obviously How about a week A day A few hoursIn other words whats the magic point at which it becomes better to leave the heat on The correct answer is usually Never Youll always use the least energy by turning down the heat when its not needed That usually means that its cheapest to turn down the heat whenever you leave the houseThe one exception would be if your heat comes from a source that charges different rates depending on the time of day Say an apartment with electric heat In that case if theres a huge difference in price it might make sense to keep the heat on during a cheap part of the day so that you can run the heat less during a more expensive part of the day Thats a really complicated problem to solve but fortunately it doesnt apply to most peopleA lot of people assume that when a multistage furnace kicks into high that its operating less efficiently Thats usually not true Usually a furnce churning away at full power is more efficient than one thats kicking on for a few minutes every hourEdit to add My experience is that people who argue that leaving the heat on is better are really more worried about how long it takes to heat the floors and cold corners They feel stupid arguing that turning the heat down when were gone makes it less comfortable to walk across the floor with my shoes off for a few hours so they concoct strange arguments that defy the laws of thermodynamics ,0,cdomzz0,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
DickEB,Depends on the house and the system yourre using to heat and the outside temperatureThe basic equation is thisHow long would your heater be running in order to bring the house back up to temp ltvsgt How long would your heater be running during the time you are gone  In my experience it is worth turning down the temp a bit  AC generally takes longer to cool a house a few degrees than a heater does to heat a house up a few degrees  So turning the temp up in the summer when the house is empty isnt as effective as turning down the heat in the winter  Although I think turning the temp up a few degrees is usually still economical,1,cdoa4qe,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2
SoLongFall,TLDR It is better to keep the temperature closer to outside temperatures to decrease power consumption however the benefit decreases with better insulation Edit Dont drop the temperature below  or  F to keep the pipes from freezingAlright there are several ways that your house transfers temperature but basically we have discovered that the energy in heat must go somewhere  In this case we have four ways that the heat can transferRadiation this sort of heat transfer will happen through energy carrying electromagnetic waves This is solely based upon the temperature of the object and not the surroundings The higher the temperature of the object and the more surface area the more heatenergy it will radiateConvection This is the transfer of heat through flowing winds and water This one depends upon the temperature difference of the two objectshouseoutside and the bigger the difference the faster you try to heat up the windConduction The other types of heat transfer deal with the walls and roof of your house this one deals with the flooror earth if you like living one with nature and have dirt floors  In this case the earth stays ish degrees so some of your energy is going to heating up the the surface of the floorAdvection Some of the air inside of your house goes outside taking all of that precious heat with it and some air comes inside  You will need to reheat this air and the more you have to heat it the more energy it will useNow all of this depends on heat getting to the outside walls of your house See your house is essentially two cubes with one inside of the other  The inner cube is the floor you walk on and the drywall inside of your house with that sweet wallpaper while the outside is what you show to the world as well as the foundation of your houseThe heat will move from the inside to the outside through your walls based upon the first three ways of heat transfer listed above This is where insulation comes into play The better insulation you have the slower it will move through the walls and the less the inside of your house will heat up the outside of your houseHopefully I didnt get too specific for ELI on this one but I wanted to get a bit of info on what makes up the heat loss of your house  Hope this helps,0,cdouvne,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
Juanfro,If you turn it down while you are out the house will get cold so it will need some time to get it warm again The best option when you go out is to keep the thermostat on but maintainining a comfortable low temperature This way the house wont be freezing when you arrive and you wont spend too much energy and money,2,cdo9bjp,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,0
Xelopheris,For one you should never drop your house below a certain temperature All those pipes running in the walls of your house need to stay above freezing which means the area of your house that is actively heated needs to stay even further above thatGenerally speaking outside of a few weeks of the year your heater never turns off once it starts running If you let it drop a few degrees while youre away it saves slightly more energy during that drop as it costs to heat back up ,5,cdo9bu0,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,-3

Nickel,Expanding on criedleys comment as to give a bit more to the reason why  Atoms arent arranged so theyre right next to each other which makes sense since atoms arent REALLY round spheres  They form a crystal they have a pattern  This pattern repeats across the structure  When light waves enter a material certain wavelengths get lost within the structure others bounce back we see the wavelengths that bounce back  The crystal repeats across the entire material so the color is consistentCompare this to snow  Each snowflake is random  The snowflakes fall in a random pile  There is no order in a snowbank  Therefore all wavelengths get reflected eventually  Resulting in whiteCompare this to ice  When water freezes the water molecules have time to align themselves as to reach a the lowest energy possible  This alignment will be the same for each water molecule  It happens that at this arrangement light waves are able to be reflected in such a way to let us see throughtldr Ice has a pattern snow does not,0,cdot5mb,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

Hirodo,Well take a seat this post may take awhile  As states elsewhere each organization was originally created for a specific purposes  Sometimes these purposes could not be combined for legal reasons an issue Ill explain a little later onFirst the FBI was created as a solution to the pesky problem of gangsters and jurisdiction  During the s and s many bank robbers bootleggers and other mafioso types could keep away from the law by crossing state lines  Crossing into another state would effectively halt any chase and apprehension by the authorities in the state the crime was committed in  The FBI was created as a Federal Police like force that could continue the investigation and chase despite criminals crossing state lines  Needless to say the FBI has grown to be the go to investigative law enforcement agency dealing with high profile crimes and other federal level crimesCIA The CIA grew out of the WWII intelligence agency the OSSthink early Medal of Honor games  The CIA main goal was operational  intelligence and foreign intelligence aka spy stuff  This is still what they do  The CIA main goal is to find out what we dont know usually from the source such as agents inside the host countries and any contacts they have fostered  During the last fifty years or so the CIA has grown to not just include covert monitoring but covert action as well  The CIA Special Activities Division is very active in war zones and other countries forcing changes such as overthrows  In fact the first US forces into Afghanistan where CIA operatives from SAD  Of course any and all of this is subject to speculation  NSA This is actually a very simple agency from an overall perspective  The NSA provides intelligence both domestic and foreign by electronic means aka SIGINT  The NSA is a component of the DoDSecret Service  The Secret Service started as the law enforcement and criminal investigation arm of the Treasury Department  The Secret Service is one of the oldest forms of federal law dating back to the Civil War  Back then theyre role was slightly larger but for the purpose of being brief Ill skip that part  The Secret Service fell into the protection of the President and other VIPs after the assassination of William Henry  ATF Will talk about during Homeland SecurityHomeland Security  Now here is where everything ties together kinda  The Department of Homeland Security is just that a cabinet level Department that over sees many agencies including the Secret Service and FEMA  The main mission of Homeland Security is the internal protection of the United States by threats both domestic and foreign  Although not completely compromised of Law Enforcement Agencies Homeland Security does maintain a certain level of LE capabilities when these agencies have missions that correlate to actual security  For example the Coast Guard is now an agency of Homeland Security there main mission is domestic maritime policing or Customs and Border patrol whose main mission is security of the borders and entry points  Homeland Security agencies do not focus of the prosecution of criminals other then the ones stated above  The falls to the Department of Justice where the FBI and ATF reside  In essence the ATF is like the FBI but with a strong focus on you guessed it Alcohol Firearms and Tobacco  They do more then policing work as they also regulate the sales and transfer of such items         ,0,cdohcn1,1rl61p,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

okse,its probably easier to see why when you use a  hour clock midnight is  clearly the start of the new day  marks  hour passing of the new day not the start of the st hour the same way we count birthdays starting at  not   year old means  year has passed is the middle of the day and marks the begining of the nd half of the day going until  when it goes from  to  it makes a lot of sense since its the end of one day and the start of the next so therefore when you convert it to the  hour clock going from pm of the previous day to am of the next is the logical flow,1,cdod34x,1rl8id,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,8

Koooooj, PM is one hour past noon  Similarly  AM is one hour past midnight  This is a justification for why we dont call noon  oclock which would make it go  am  am  am  pm noon  That would solve one problem but introduce a new oneThat sets us up with a system that should go  am  am  m noon  pm and so on   am is clearly before noon and  pm is clearly after noon so what do we do with noon itselfIf you just look at the even hour times then it would seem that noon ought to still be AM is more similar to  and  than it is to  and  so it should get the same suffix right  However ask yourself  is  before or after noon talking about the  that occurs near mid day   is clearly after noon and thus ought to be labeled as pm  The same is true of  or   Thus if  is to be AM then we would have  AM  PM  PM and so on  Now that seems out of placeIn fact if you continue that argument then we can look at seconds as well AM  PM  PM and so on  Since noon is only a single instant in time we find that for essentially the whole th hour the time is already pm  Therefore making noon be  AM is inconsistent more so than making it be  PM is inconsistentNow there is a completely consistent solution  We can still make  hour past noon be  oclock and we can make it so we dont have that weird discontinuity from  AM to  PM  We simply call noon and midnight  oclock pm and am respectively  This is actually the most consistent is more like  and  than it is like  and  so labeling noon as  oclock PM is consistent there and  PM conveys the idea that it is  minutes past noon while  PM would suggest that its  hours after noon  This is the most internally consistent  hour clock but the existing  hour clock going from  to  instead of  to  already has too much hold for this idea to gain much tractionusing the existing clock works just fineThe other consistent solution is to do away with a  hour clock in the first place and just call midnight  oclock and count up from there  We have  am  am  pm  pm  pm and so onthe break from am to pm happens at noon if its reported at allwe never have to specify which  oclock were talking about but we dont reset the numbering an hour later so theres no problem  This clock system is arguably better than my proposed  hour clock since it removes the ambiguity of a  hour clock being used for a  hour day and it sees widespread use around the world ,0,cdoh7pc,1rl8id,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

mrkarlis,The government is connected to it in the way that they closed state construction oversight department in  transferring those duties to municipalities but without giving them sufficient power  basically they can only check documentation and issuedeny building permits but what happens afterwards is barely controlled  However it is probably a combination of many reasons such as      people are always complaining that cabinet ministers dont feel responsible for what happens in the country that they dont accept political accountability By resigning the Prime Minister has a chance of gaining huge popular support It might sound weird but the minds of people are easily influenced especially  in the wake of such tragedies I mean the President has always been seen as an exbanker with zero representative skills and questionable morality but when he called the roof collapse basically mass murder hes suddenly seen as some sort of hero who tells it like it is The Prime Minister on the other hand has always had both lovers and haters but more from the first group as hes won the last  elections he wouldnt win the th though as his party is increasingly unpopular His party is beyond salvation but he personally will now have enough support to pretty much go whatever path he chooses Has already confirmed not to lead the new government though   He is rumored to have good chances of becoming the new Chairman of European Commission Its no secret that he is liked in Brussels and that he likes working there as well Maybe this is in preparation of his return to European politics   The last half a year has been very hard for the government  constant conflicts between the coalition parties resignations of ministers etc A very serious problem has become the nationalistic party NA acting up and generally being a nuisance but without them the government doesnt have majority support and cant make any important decisions It would only make sense to create a new coalition but apparently the Prime Minister doesnt want to   Emotions The PM is known for being very introvert and emotionless I mean once he made a joke at a debate and it became local Youtube sensation due to its sheer unexpectedness However today when announcing stepping down the man was close to tears no one has ever seen him like that It is possible the supermarket tragedy did affect him emotionally i mean he did get to the location that night and probably saw dead bodies being excavated and the people waiting news about their loved ones behind the police tape In a way the tragedy did have an effect on nearly everyone in the country even those who were not harmed in it  Guilt tripping the Mayor of the capital city into resignation or at least seriously damaging his reputation as strictly speaking the Mayor has more political responsibility in this event as construction oversight is now up to municipalities The mayor is from the currently most popular political party However what would the PM gain by this now is not entirely clear The Mayor is pretty pissed though and was quite uncooperative today with the journalists    Although the actual reasons will probably be revealed in time theres no denying the roof collapse has had at least some impact on this decision and he states it as the main one as a new leader is necessary who could lead the government in these hard time Its a shame really This PM has set a record by having lead the government for nearly  years straight He took control during the economical crisis and managed to get the country back on its feet while no one else even dared to accept the challenge The fact that the country is joining Eurozone this January is also mainly thanks to the PM and his Minister of Finance On the other hand maybe its time for a new PM to come if not for other reason then just for the sake of change to see what it brings,0,cdom6qo,1rlji9,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

deepsea,Although the director is a key man in making the movie its the studio and the producers that are the top dogs  In the end they make the decisions of what they want and do not want in the movie  Where directors may be more focused on the artistic value of the film the studio and the producers may be more interested in the commercial value  Unfortunately artistic value and commercial value dont always mixIn many cases the directors cut contains a lot more footage  It includes stuff like more sideplots and extended scenes  However producers tend to like shorter movies  Producers are afraid that longer movies will bore the audiences especially the movie watchers that are not film buffs but are more interested in getting their bang for their buck  So producers tend to cut out a lot of scenes they dont think are necessary to keep the film nice and short and keep the audience entertained  Also some producers dont like the darker elements of a film  Most people like happy stories with happy endings  Dark and depressing movies can be very good artistically but it turns off a lot of people  So the producer might cut scenes where the films hero is shown to be an alcoholic that abuses his wifeAnother reason is censorship  Things like sex and violence might compliment the film artistically but it reduces the films target audience  A film that a has lower rating has more potential viewers than a film rated R because now younger children and teenagers can watch the movie as opposed to just adults,0,cdogol1,1rlkwj,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

InfiniteAmbiguity,So you mention the minus sign next to the spread  First understand the purpose of a spread which one mechanism for equalizing teams that are mismatched from a talent perspective  So assume that the very worst NFL team is playing against the very best NFL team at the best teams stadium  Obviously everybody expects the best team to win and to win by a lot  And the best team will win this matchup  out of every  times this kind of game is played  If everyone could just best straightup on who will win risking only  juice then everyone will always bet on the best team everyone will win  out of  times lose only  out of  times while the sports book will lose big  out of  times and win only  out of  times  Obviously this will quickly bankrupt the sports book and will be too easy and no fun for the bettors  So one thing the sports book does to fix this problem is to set a point spread  The point spread says lookat the final score deduct the pointspread points from the favored teams final score and calculate who wins after that deduction  In our example above lets say the pint spread is  for the best team and the final score turns out  for the best team and  for the worst team So the best team won the game but did they win against the point spread  Subtract the  from the best teams  total points and you get  points for the best team which is till more than the worst teams  points and so the best teams bettors win while the worst teams bettors lose  Butassume that the finalscore turns out instead to be  for the best team and  for the worst team In this case we subtract the  from the best teams score and get  again but now were comparing that  points against the spread with the worst teams  points In this case the best team and its bettors lost against the spread and the worst team and its bettors won against the spread  Obviously if the team giving the points the one favored to win and so has the minus sign actually losesthe game outrightthen you dont even need to do the math because they already lost even before you subtract the point spread from their final score MYou can get the same result by leaving the favored teams final score alone and instead ADDING the pointspread number to the worst teams final score so that in the latter case you would leave the best teams score at  and add the  to the worst teams  points and get the worst team winning with  points over the best teams   This is just an alternative way of counting so dont be confused  The winnerloser result is the same under either calculation method The juice will apply here too and the samepossibilities and consequences of a push are also applicable here  But unlike the overunder here you dont care at all about total points scored You only care here about who wins and by how much  There are many variations on this but this is the general framework There re other ways to equalize the mismatched teams such as not using a pointspread but instead using a money line but maybe we can discuss that another time  ,1,cdoh5mv,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0
InfiniteAmbiguity,In general the overunder refers to a threshold of something and youre betting that this something will actually end up being over or under the established threshold  most commonly the threshold is the total points by both teams scored in the entire game but it could also be total points by one team in the game or total points by one or both teams in a half or quarter or total fumblesinterceptionsturnovers by one or both teams in the game or half or season or one teams total wins in a season or one teams total points in a season or anything at all For simplicity lets say that were dealing with the most common  the overunder for total points in lets say a late December game between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs Its going to be cold the offenses have been performing poorly and the defenses have been playing well  So for these reasons and others the odds makers set the overunder at a relatively low number  lets say  So with a  overunder the odds makers are inviting you to guess whether the total number of points scored by both teams combined in the game will be over  or under  You dont care who wins who loses or by how much You only care how many total points are scored  So lets say you think it will be a very high scoring game with total points above  and so you bet  on the over  total points This means that if the total points go above the  overunder threshold then you get your  back plus  more from the sports book  But if youre mistaken and the total points stay under  then you lost by betting on the over so you just lose your  and get nothing back The converse is true if you bet the other way obviously  Notice that you risked  to win  This is because these straight wagers typically require you to risk  more than you stand to win You risk  to win   to win   to win  and so on This  extra you pay on losses is usually called the juice  Final point here  What happens if the total points scored in the game are exactly equal to   In that case its a tie  known as a push  and so you get only your risked money back minus the juice In this case you put  at risk to win  but the game pushed so you will get  back of your risked  and you will lose the  juice  So this is a quick summary There are many possible variations Feel free to ask any questions Illanswer your pointspread question separately  ,1,cdoglu4,1rlky3,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

DiscIn,Ghz is a measure of cycles per second  A CPU executes instructions  Imagine that your CPU is an assembly line and an instruction is a product that is being manufactured in the assembly line  The Ghz or cycles per second is the speed it takes for the product to move from one stage in the assembly line to the next stage  Its up to the design of the processor to determine how much work is actually done in each stage  For example the Pentium  had something stages in its pipeline some of which I believe did no actual workAnyways there is more that goes into the quality of a CPU than just the speed  For example number of cores how many physical processors presence of hyper threading multiple hardware threads per core size of cache how much does the CPU hold in its fast memory before having to go to RAM etc,0,cdoj6r5,1rlspc,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
TedTschopp,A processor that is a Ghz processor can perform  single step operations a second  However a processor doesnt complete most calculations in one operation  Many operations take more than one step  So the way you get speed increases is to decrease the number of steps it takes to do some unit of workTake long division for example  Most people learn math by starting with addition then subtraction then multiplication and finally division  The reason for this is that each of those skills build on each other  So in order to do a simple division problem you need to know how to do addition subtraction multiplication  So if you were building a computer to do math you would start with addition and it would take one step to add two numbers  Then when you did multiplication you would need to take more than one step to do that work because multiplication requires more than one unit of addition  Finally when you write your code to do division you would need to do both multiplication addition and subtraction  So you would get one request to divide two numbers done in say  steps where the addition of those two numbers would only take one step  Now lets say you learn some shortcuts in doing long division and you realize that you dont need to do so many steps  Thats what happens when you go from say an i processor to an i processor  That i has a lot more tricks up its sleeve in doing long divisionDoes that make sense,0,cdokk5q,1rlspc,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

Koooooj,Sig figs is a measure of uncertainty  In science a number without any indication of uncertainty is essentially meaningless  For example say I tell you to prepare for a party and that therell be  people there  If you take that number as exact then you could have exactly  servings of beer goldfish crackers  However youll want to be prepared if that number wasnt exactmaybe I know that number is accurate to there could be between  and  people so you should really have  servings to be on the safe side  Perhaps though Im really bad at estimating and I only know the number of people to a factor of there could be between  and  people  These are three very different views that all would be reported as  people N just with different values of N  This is the importance of stating uncertainty in scienceNow for dealing with uncertainty properly you have to do whats called uncertainty propagation analysisyou know the uncertainty of each number you use and you use some math which is ultimately derived from some basic calculus to figure out what the limits are on your answer  This is a lot to deal with especially in early science classes so sig figs are usedThus sig figs are all about representing how certain you are with a number you state and it all comes down to how you write a number  For example if you write  then its clear that you didnt mean to write you had enough certainty to carry the decimal out to   However its also clear that you werent confident enough to give the answer as  or perhaps   Thus this is two significant figuresthe  and the   For some other numbers  is  sig figsyou included the   is only  sig figsyou didnt have any choice in including the zero here  is  sig figsthe explicit decimal after the zero indicates that the  is accurate There is no way to state  to  sig figs without scientific notation    is  sig figsthe   and   This is the only way to state the number  with  sig figs  is only  sig figs  The first zero is meaningless and should be omitted  is  sig figsthe zero is surrounded by nonzero digitsOnce you figure out how many sig figs your inputs have you have to figure out how many your output has  For example         Here each number has  sig figs  When you carry out the math treating each number as exact you get   How should this number be reported  Just as  random parenthetical comment to indicate the period is not a decimal point  For addition operations each number is only precise to a given place value ie ones tens hundreds etc  Whichever number is the least precise determines what the significance of the answer is  This makes senseif your first number is  then you cant suddenly know the sum of    to any precision more accurate than Another example         Here  has two sig figs while  has   If we carry out the math with exact values then you get   How should this be reported  It should be rounded to  sig figs regardless of place value  The most significant number is  so that number gets to stay  The nd is  so it gets to stay  The final  and  arent significant enough to stay so they get set to zero  However since were rounding the  causes the  to be increased ie weve rounded  to be just   The math here is       This becomes more clear in scientific notation          Here we can see that you can pull all of the  n out and deal with them separately then look at the remaining numbers on an even scale  The rule for multiplying numbers is that you count the sig figs of each number then round your result to that many sig figsA final thing to consider is the idea of exact values  For example in the formula for the area of a circle you have A  pi  r   How many sig figs does pi have  Infinity  Not because its irrational or anything like that  It has infinite sig figs because you dont measure pi at any pointits just a value you introduce  Similarly the number  in the exponent of that equation is an exact value and has infinite sig figs even though a  would normally be only  sig fig  When you add subtract multiply or divide an exact value you get no loss of precisionNote that when doing a combined operation you keep track of sig figs according to order of operations but never round until the end  For example        Here your first move is to multiply  by  which yields  with  sig figs both  and  have  sig figs and you were multiplying  You then add    and get   Where do you round this   was actually the number that determines the sig figs of the result since only the  and the  are significant in this intermediate result so you have to round to the nearest hundred  Your result is   Note that It would have been improper to round  to  before carrying out the additionthis would have caused the result of addition to be  which would then be rounded up to   The rule to remember here is that you never round intermediate values even if you are keeping track of how many sig figs they haveObviously sig figs are a cumbersome system that isnt perfect  For formal scientific papers it is expected that proper uncertainty analysis is performed  However for less formal approaches it is good to use the sig fig rules to remember that numbers are inherently uncertain  The rules to remember are Rules for determining number of sig figs All nonzero digits all zeroes to the right of the decimal no zeroes to the left of the first nonzero digit all zeroes in between nonzero digits all zeroes between the lowest nonzero digit and an explicitly stated decimal When adding or subtracting the result is only as precise as the number that has the largest place value of uncertainty When multiplying or dividing the result has as many significant figures as the number that has the fewest significant figures Intermediate values of a multistep piece of arithmetic should never be rounded,0,cdok03z,1rlu8t,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4
TimeTravellerSmith,Sig Figs are how many numbers that you actually want to look at when you write something downSo pi is something like and on and on  But we dont want to write all those down so we say were gonna use  sig figs which means that well call it   Then when you want to start using sig figs in math operations you have to keep track of what has what and how many you can carry over  So unless you have to track how many are used for operations for exams its best to try to keep as much as you can during operations in your calculator and then round at the end for the most accurate number  You would end up rounding to be as accurate as the numbers youre givenFor example if youre told to calculate how much time it takes a mass to fall to earth and youre told to use a mass of kg then youd round your answer to  sig figs in the end even though you might know that acceleration is mss and the distance is  cm,1,cdoiwhp,1rlu8t,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,1

GryphonNumber, Countries define unemployment differently Every country fudges the numbers in one way or another In America the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes  different measures of unemployment each with an increasingly expansive definition of unemployment U is the most often repeated measure currently standing at  U the most expansive definition encompasses part time underemployed workers those whove been discouraged from looking and all other marginally attached persons Its at about  When talking about unemployment across different countries you need to be sure youre looking at statistics that are actually measuring the same thing Many European countries especially the ones that are having economic troubles today have a recent history of bad government that exacerbated economic problems leading to chronic high unemployment and socioeconomic dislocation For example Spain had a fascist government until the s and around the same time Greece was ruled by a military junta Italy has had like  different Prime Ministers since it adopted its modern constitution in  By comparison America has had only  presidents over that same time frame Over time the populations in these countries got used to having high unemployment and started to consider that the norm America has grown accustomed to a certain level of affluence since World War II ended and we became the dominant military and economic power on Earth So what might be acceptable levels of unemployment in other countries isnt good enough for us And because we are used to almost total employment we never developed the expansive welfare programs that Europeans did in their effort to rebuild after WW so when someone loses their job in America it can hurt them more than in other rich countries,0,cdoy07q,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,5
Kropotsmoke,Unemployment has deleterious effects on peoples psychologies and their material conditions  Entire families suffer  People struggle with feelings of uselessness anxiety depression  Also they start to go without and to slide backwards  less access to education less access to health care less access to material comforts less access to leisure and rest less access to quality nutrition and less access to the sorts of status symbols welloff people take for granted like having clean clothes that appear relatively new  Its a catastrophe because it implies tons of people are suffering greatly both materially and mentally  Think about the effects unemployment cause to children  to their nutrition their education and so on  They can sense theyre in an unstable home and can understand  read the mood of their parents  This has terrible debilitating effects on familiesIn fact the huge rate in Europe is a catastrophe as well a larger catastrophe as someone else points out but it probably symbolizes less total social damage than the rate in the US  This is because at the very least there are publicsocial standards in Europe like a developed wellfunctioning health care system that provides even for those priced out of an insanely expensive corporate system  Going unemployed in Europe is much less likely to spell the doom of you and your family than it does in the US  a single medical disaster and in the US you are completely wiped out ,0,cdoj1ki,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,5

Starmedia,Long story short Its not the unemployment that hurts the economy its the lack of spending in the economy caused by people who dont have incomesIn the US if youre unemployed youre basically SOL In most European countries the state will provide money for basic necessities to the unemployed This means that even if a town has  of its citizens become unemployed they will still be able to shoppay rentetc While its not an ideal situation businesses can still sell goodsIf we hit Eurozone level unemploymment rates in the US without their saftey net wed be in real serious trouble as businesses would start closing in a type of domino effect unemployment leads to business closures which leads to more unemploymentAs a final note remember that many Americans that are considered employed are working extremely low paying jobs that actually provide less then  a European social welfare model So while the American unemployment rate may be lower our economy is much more fragile,1,cdoqhww,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,4
MarginCalls,There is something called the natural rate of unemployment NRU which accounts for this in part Basically think of it this way if the economy is operating at maximum capacity everyone is working as hard as possible all businesses are operating at maximum efficiency there will still be some people unemployed due to various factors Lets look at those factors Frictional Unemployment Basically this is where people have just been layer off or quit and are unemployed but manage to get a new job fairly quickly For instance if you work for Dole selling bananas for Reddit to use as a scale in photos but suddenly a giant plantain comes along and destroys Reddits ability to use bananas as a scale thus reddit no longer uses bananas and you get layed off as a result However luckily in a  month you get hired quickly to sell bananas to truck drivers in Africa who use it to temporarily fix truck Truck differentials This is a real thing actually Thus you were unemployed for a small amount of time thus it would temporarily cause an increase in unemploymentTLDR Unemployment can vary based on how often people change jobs Structural UnemploymentPeople who cant a job but want a job They often lack the credentials to get a job or there is simply not enough jobs total for the population This is where government policy tends to come into effect a country with a very strong unemployment benefits program and other welfare might have higher rates of structural unemployment since they can rely on the programs more rather than taking a very low paying job There is also another area doesnt really fit in to these categories at all and that is people involved in illegal business or who have undeclared income A hypothetical scenario is a crack dealer who claims unemployment benefits because he has no income to report other than his illegal money Thus a country that has a large amount of people who falsely claim that they are unemployed when they are actually Meth dealing ex chemistry teachersSo I wouldnt generalize too much about the whole continent of Europe but generally European countries as a whole have stronger welfare programs and thus a higher structural unemployment that is probably one of the biggest reasons not sure about the other two Also some countries in Europe have shittier economies Though this really only makes sense if youre framing this in the context of unemployment that is most commonly used for government policy The unemployment rate used is really only helpful from a monetary and perhaps fiscal macroeconomic policy viewpoint Its not really a good measure of quality of life or an individualistic perspective of an economy ,1,cdorwr2,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2

opensketchbook,ITT A horde of libertarians and a very narrow view Lemme balance that by giving a more leftist POVThe smallscale examples given in the other examples whereby rise in wages and rise in living expenses are directly correlated is true inside of a smallscale closed system However it fails to account for changes that occur at larger scalesFirst off you are absolutely right Just raising the minimum wage will do very little on its own However it is an important part of creating a demand side economy Youll also want to ensure business regulation will prevent monopolies from emerging in the new markets created by the new demand and you want to make sure your tax scheme is progressive enough to prevent the rich from getting so rich they flip it around again creating the situation you described So yes preventing an executive from making too much more than the workers can help but you have to be careful not to overdo it you still need investment capitalSo why have a demandside economySimply put the health of an economy is tied to the flow of money If money is changing hands it generally means things are getting done goods and services are trading hands and have good value associated with it and you have an example of the old saying A rising tide lifts all boats While the actual value of individual units of currency might change in an economy that is both growing and health purchasing power increases As growth is primarily fueled by technological innovation and doesnt really look to slow down increasing the value of labour to match is healthyThe next thing to understand is that poor people and rich people handle their money very differently Poor people they spend their money as soon as they get it on things like rent food clothes medical care etc They dont and cant hold on to very much By contrast rich people traditionally either save their money or shunt their money off into the financial sector where it is invested Ideally that money is invested in ways that enhance the economy by keeping the money flowing into businesses especially small businesses on a competitive stock market and into limited markets That dynamic of investiture is what forms the basis of the financial sector of the marketNow something interesting happens when the system gets top heavy when the richer portion of society has a disproportionately large chunk of the money compared to the poorer half like for example in a society which believes in supply side trickle down economics Essentially this causes the financial sector especially small portions of it to become bloated with capital Money is invested at a faster rate than growth can keep up with because money is not the only limiting factor on growthInvestment is rarely straightforward Oftentimes an investment is actually an investment into an investment ad nausium which is finally being invested in the actual market What happens is that large portions of the economy are segregated off circulating only in an incestuous subset of the financial industry chasing real value to be invested in for growth Other people usually middle class people who want to be rich take out loans in order to invest in these seeminglyvaluable markets Pretty soon there is more money being invested than the things are actually worth When people realize this has happened and they wont see a return on their investments the bubble popThis is known as a Bust and it involves the sudden loss of value in a market as everyone tries to get out as once This not only releases a bunch of money back into the wild leading to inflation but saddles a bunch of people with worthless investments they cant get rid of Booms and busts are commonplace in an economy without regulation they are extremely vicious creating periods of extreme growth followed by even worse depressionsSo why does this matter for minimum wageBecause the people making minimum wage dont invest in the financial market Money comes to them through their jobs and is immediately spent on stuff which pays other people their salaries so they can spend it on stuff and so on and so forth When you pay minimum wage workers more they still do that but they have more options They might be able to afford to eat out and eat better so new markets open up for restaurants and quality food They can buy electronics and entertainment so those markets expand Competition in these markets is no longer strictly a race to the bottom in terms of prices which creates a more diversified economy as luxury options move in You still have people who own those companies and make lots of money and are rich but they are not making quite as much as they were their profit margins are narrower further encouraging competition and reducing monopolization and less money is shunted off into the financial sector so booms are not so frantic and busts are not so drasticA demandside economy sees more regular stable growth in markets that are more in line with the longterm value of a market because most of the money is coming from consistent spenders the poor instead of investment chasers the rich The growth of the economy is seen directly by everyone instead of just to investors Rich people still exist and still invest providing the raw capital needed to break new ground into fresh markets and reaping the benefits but because the system is more bottomheavy investments are more metered and safer Less runaway booms and bustsEither way you get growth usually fairly comparable numbers when you look at it over long periods of time But in a supply side economy where minimum wage is low thus devaluing labour and massively increasing profits for the rich the economy spikes and drops harshly wasting capital and hurting the people at the bottom who cant afford to have their labour devalued any further In a demandside economy the growth is a steady line with little dips and rises Less money is squandered and prices are more stable so your money goes furtherSo everyone else here is absolutely right in a closed system raising the minimum wage would be meaningless But its not a closed system the economy of labour exists alongside things like financial sector like government and public spending and like the global marketTLDRHigher minimum wage and redistribution of the economy so poor people have a higher proportion of the money leads to steadier more stable economic growth with better competition by growing new markets in proportion to the consumer rather than the investor However this sort of economy also requires greater regulation and progressive taxation,3,cdott95,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,hot,12,9

bjornartl,Minimum wage is a little bit like game theory Look at the climate debate The cold war This is why we have treaties Everyone wants to be the one that has cheaper production Or has more military force More whatever the conflict is about The solution to such conflicts are treaties where all parties decide they are better off if ALL parties involved reduce equally The reason why this is not always possible is because they cant always decide what is equal or who should be more equal than the others When it comes to minimum wage its a little easier Theres a higher power a government who can decide who what and when these treaties should count for A government could for instance enforce a minimum wage for the food industry only This would help avoid the outsourcing a lot of labor but its not like the fast food industry would stop selling food in the US Unlike a phonetech assistant these jobs require working hands on US soil Thing is that probably most work that can be done without being located in the US for less than  probably already is outsourced so you might as well not make it limited to say the food industry So wouldnt the prices go up on their products Not necessarily They dont pay people more if they make more revenue The price of labor is mostly decided by supply and demand This means that every time a nation is losing jobs and markets then there is a high demand for jobs that they can take advantage of These swings will always happen Nations change and then it takes time to adapt to new markets more suitable for their nation In the US this would probably mean a higher focus on better education towards tech and greater investment in tech development along with other particularly and less about manual labor but thats a way different discussion Point is that swings will happen and they always take time to adjust So basically it does two things  it helps reduces between classes in the US These classes are more or less made up by  stands of sociaty a people who have ownership in US companies who either succeeds in markets suitable for the US nation andor outsources b The people who work for these companies in the US because they make up a profession that is desirable to said companiesmarkets and c which is the last and lowest stand which are the people who are not desired by any of these marketscompanies but does jobs they cannot outsource Minimum wage helps the second classb but more importantly it prevents massive abuse against the third stand of society  It helps spreadread keep more money within the US Money spent towards thirdc class professions are money spent on services they more or less mustve spent money on anyways This again leads to less buyer force directed towards imported goods and pleasures Both these points are economically profitable for the US Being a first world country they are expected to have a certain amount of welfare although it is shit compared to the rest of the first worldwestern world Having more people be able to afford their daily lives through their own work is good And who pays for this The middle and upper class through the services they purchase Then less money goes overseas Now who want you to think this is a waste of money Well the upper classa first and foremost but also to a great extent class b Togather they make up a big enough voters pool so that they have a great chance and Id argue they have already to a great deal too steer politics in their own advantage through political campaigns and advertisement ,0,cdp3btr,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

TURUS,The Time remaining indicator bases the time off the current download speed and basically finds how much time the download will take if your current download speed remains consistentThe reason download timers are so often incorrect is that download speed can and sometimes does easily change every second making the time estimate inaccurate Many modern downloads will change the estimate very quickly after the download speed changes but if you just take a look at a download and it says  hours remaining and you leave to do something else the speed may drop and change the estimate to  hours remaining when you arent there to see it,0,cdojqs0,1rlxct,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4

Comicbookguy,A mixture of a few things  Massive supply lines took months for ships to cross over the pond back then  The French Spanish and Dutch all declared war on the British  they used the opportunity to stretch the British military the Royal Navy in particular in order to dilute the British influence over Europe etc  Remember the British Empire was rather big at the time  George Washington bolstered the US ranks by both using positive incentives for enlistment and by ensuring the troops took precautions against disease  Sickness claimed more lives than those taken in battle and although Washington lost a lot to the British he kept his troop numbers upBasically the Americans had to only prolong the conflict as the British couldnt affordmanage a lengthy war so far from home with more closer concerns bloody FrenchIm English btw and not in anyway bitter but I dont quite understand why you treasure the Statue of Liberty so much  Yes its a remindertribute to a well fought and hard earned independance but its also a reminder of the fact that the French aristocracy spend so much on aiding the Americans that its own people were literally starving to death which precipitated the French revolution  No offence but the French didnt give a flying fuck about the Americans at the time since for them it was all about the power struggle with the British,1,cdokdjf,1rlxz1,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,1

DeletedByMods, Reddit handles far more data than Healthcaregov and its far more customized to the user than the data on Healthcaregov which makes the server load even more of a challenge for redditHeathcaregov does however need to integrate with many different systems whereas reddit has the benefit of not needing to integrate with anything  its all their own stuff from top to bottom  This creates some initial design issues but it shouldnt really create a load issue if the initial architecture of the software is saneThe real answer is that Healthcaregov was a trainwreck of extremely poor project management due to the cronyism exercised by the Obama administration in hiring CGI Its just a really shoddy terribly built piece of software because of poor business analysis poor design and poor project managementFor example healthcaregov is powered by a remarkably shitty and remarkably obscure xmlbased data tier  Not only does their chosen data tier not scale because of its bad tech it also drastically limited to talent pool they could hire from because it wasnt an industry standard technology Heathcaregov is a textbook example of cronyism in government contracting and why its a bad thing,4,cdoojar,1rly93,explainlikeimfive,hot,7,3

thegreatgazoo,A big thing that reddit does is use the Amazon server cloud which is hosted in a couple data centers using similar technology used to host the amazon web site It has some magic in it that as server loads get greater it automatically turns on additional servers and when server loads slow down it starts to turn off excess servers you get charged by the hour based on how many are running Reddit involves posting cat and banana pictures vs health care information so it doesnt have the same security requirements that healthcaregov has so the amazon cloud might not be appropriate to host healthcaregov Another big difference is the chatter between the website and the browser Generally speaking the fewer back and forth messages between a website the faster it runs  A normal website might have say  or  messages going back and forth to display a page Iirc version  of healthcaregov had something like  messages which generally indicates sloppy programming and or gluing a bunch of rd party libraries together instead of writing your own code They also scaled it to handle the same traffic as Medicaregov not understanding that there are more people under age  than over  ,0,cdoov3i,1rly93,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

ArtP,The following is from a recent post on my weblog   httpeconomicswordpresscombitcoinsgoldandpyrite Bitcoins and gold may have some speculative value but as a solution to economic problems or as a form of money they are on a par with pyriteAs I understand bitcoins their main feature is that the supply of them is intended to be finite  This will make them great for speculators but as a form of money they come with the same problem as gold and that is that the amount of money in an economy needs to be flexible  Through history there have been a number of situations where authorities have tried to limit the money sometimes by trying to force a gold standard and the result has been serious depression  I wonder if bitcoins were invented in part because gold is in limited supplycircleBitcoinProbably the increasing interest in  bitcoins is a psychological reaction to economic uncertainty and fears of hyperinflation which would wipe out the savings and pensions of a lot of people  Given that the economic crisis is based on problems in the resource base gold and bitcoins may not be useful  A better hedge would be a market gardenAnother feature of bitcoins is that they can be used online anonymously   This makes them great for illegal transactions   No wonder some regulators are saying bitcoins should come under their jurisdictionSo far as I can see the main use of bitcoins is for speculationThe author of this comment has a web log on economics at httpseconomicswordpresscom,0,cdolcmf,1rm39g,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
Koooooj,The nominal exchange rate ie  per Bitcoin is pretty much immaterial  It could be that  per Bitcoin is fair or that  is overvalued  This is because Bitcoins are effectively infinitely divisibleyou can divide a single Bitcoin into  pieces each worth  as much right now and divisibility could increase with a simple software patchThere are two things that drive the value of Bitcoin  utility and speculation  The second is pretty obvious  people notice that the value goes up so they buy  This makes the value go up even more so they buy more  This cycle repeats until people get tired of buying at which point the bubble pops and the price quickly falls to zero  We saw that happen perhaps most famously in the Netherlands with tulip mania in the sUtility on the other hand ought to be much more stable  It brings price increases as more people realize the utility and join the movement  This is what gave Bitcoin its original value  Thus the question is what is their utility  The answer varies from person to person but the common answers include It allows nearinstant transactions around the world seconds until its received typically Transactions are irreversiblegreat for merchants dealing with credit card fraud Transactions are low feecredit cards can take several percent of a merchants gross income There is no danger of sudden hyperinflation from a government deciding to print  trillion dollar bills see Zimbabwe Transactions can take place nearly anonymously technically pseudonymously Individuals have the power to protect their wealth from theft more securely than a bank can note many Bitcoin supporters are strongly Libertarian and view taxes as theft Bitcoin is especially popular in that group  Also note many people do not take the proper precautions Its money that is already digitalno need to mess with paper money Its easily protected against flood fire etcits just information,0,cdolp7d,1rm39g,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

QuickSpore,Needless to say the facts in the matter are disputed Prior to WWI the area known as Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire Around this time there was a group of Jews living in Palestine all across the Middle East really And the European Jews were tired of being treated like second class citizens Hitler was far from the first European leader to put blame on the Jews or to round them up and kill them He was pretty much the best at it though So these European Jews chose their old ancestral land as the one which would become a Jewish homeland Bit by bit Jews moved to Palestine buying land and setting up communities The Turks werent too happy about that The last thing they wanted was another strong ethnicity in the empire But they never cut off immigration completely And small numbers of Jews continued to move into the areaWhen WWI broke out the British made a lot of promises They promised the area to the Arabs They promised the area to the Jews And they promised to split it up and rule it with the French Of course the promise they kept was to rule it themselves as a protectorate Both the Jews and the Arabs there were no Palestinians yet took offense at this And both Jewish and Arab terrorist coups formed And a three way low level microwar broke out The British clamped down on Jewish migration incidentally dooming a lot of Jews but a small amount of illegal immigration continued to take placeBy the end of WWIi it was clear the British werent going to hold on to the area And frankly they didnt want it anymore more trouble than it was worth Step one was the area east of the Jordan river was spun off as TransJordan There were very few Jews and so it was clear that would be Arab regardless But dividing the area west of the Jordan was a mess And there was even a question of whether it should even be divided at all After a few years the British tossed the problem to the UN And in  the UN came up with a plan the area would be split About  would go to the Arabs in Palestine  would go to the Jews and Jerusalem would become an international city It wasnt clear exactly how that last part would work out Largely the Jews said absolutely we accept And largely the Arabs said we dont accept And the British said screw it were leavingThe day the British left the Jews declared the formation of the state of Israel And the Arab nations all declared war on Israel I the end when the fighting was over Israel had most of Palestine Egypt had Gaza And Jordan had the West Bank Hundreds of thousands of Jews were forced from their homes all across the Middle East And a lot of Palestinians fled from their homes in what became IsraelIsrael was established as a Jewish democratic nation But it should be mentioned at this time that there were a lot of Arabs living in the new Israeli state And they are citizens to this day with voting rights and everything It should also be mentioned that Jews and Arabs are not treated exactly the sameAfter this Israel and the Arab states fought other additional wars And Israel conquered Gaza the West Bank Sinai and the Golan Heights Originally Israel held these territories with a promise of land for peace They gave the Sinai back to Egypt for a peace treaty But neither Egypt or Jordan wanted Palestine back And the Palestinians didnt have anyone willing and capable of negotiating with IsraelSomewhere about this time the Israelis got the bright idea that settling Israelis in the occupied territories would both make them more secure and induce the Palestinians to the table That didnt exactly work And some Israeli extremists view them as a chance to grab more or even all of Palestine and create a Greater IsraelSo right now the two parties are disagreeing on most everything The extremists on both sides would love to see the others driven into the sea And even the moderates cant agree on where borders should be if Arabs should be allowed to return to their old lands in Israel who gets Jerusalem and which parts And both sides regularly kill innocents on the other side making it harder to compromise ,0,cdopvj3,1rm94a,explainlikeimfive,hot,6,6

SnafuCoaxer,Theres a huge number of reasons for this and Ill try touch on a few but its very important to first recognize a few assumptions Firstly youre coming at this from the perspective of someone who exists postrise of the West so youre going to look at the world as being on a sort of linear progression of technology That isnt how anyone viewed technology prior to the point that it changed radically in the span of a single lifetime so around the late thearly th century Also note that to someone in the periods were talking about these sort of differences in technology might not appear to exist and technology the concept only really exists in the popular mind by the early modern ageAnyway the main reasons I can think of that Europe ended up with superior technology to much of the rest of the world Geographically Europe isnt particularly well suited to farming especially Northern Europe While there are some very productive regions theres nothing like the Mekong Delta and the continent is often too cold or the terrain too undulating to grow large quantities of crop This means that agriculture is often very difficult This has three effects firstly it means that the population is less content with an agrarianbased society secondly it facilitates trade within the region Lastly its a huge limit on the growth of urban areas So Europe is typified by very dense very small urban settlements Those geographical factors set up the perfect environment for huge economic growth If I need to buy Egyptian grain I need something Egyptians cant produce themselves like wine Using far more modern economic theory we know that the most productive trade is done between highly specialized economies with very different advantages and this leads to increased wealth for all economies involved This develops rapidly in Europe however its not going to develop as well in South East Asia or North America where food is abundant and so trade in these places becomes a largely diplomatic exercise rather than a vital force Trade is a source of imported luxury goods not a vital lifeline for the majority of the population So we know that Europe is going to be more interconnected and wealthier in the long run than many other places with abundant food and smaller trade flows  Greater trade flows means that ideas travel faster through Europe than through other locations For example if im in Peru and everything I consume is locally produced there is little need for new ideas and more importantly if i did have an innovative idea it would likely never reach say Mexico without generations of people physically migrating However an innovative farming idea in Baghdad is likely going to reach Vienna in less than a year So the research base the knowledge that youve building off is much greater in Europe especially if you view Europe as a monolithic entity Socially the Black Death creates a need to radically restructure society This leads to the Renaissance period which triggers renewed interest in the Classical world and things like philosophy This causes the Reformation which for a bunch of highly contentious reasons leads to Northern Europe developing at a very fast pace this is in a large part due to Protestantism removing much of the outerworldliness of Catholicism and much of the comfort it provided its practitioners in terms of the promise of heaven Coupled with a lack of agricultural land and an abundance of fuel sources the Industrial Revolution occurs first in the region,0,cdosar9,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4
whatIsThisBullCrap,This is my own theory and as far as I know not commonly supported But Ill share it anyways because I think its at least a contributing factor Basically trade Specifically information trade Europe was very connected to much of the world and they were in constant contact with Arabia India China North Africa etc This meant that information most importantly technology could be shared The result of this is that technology advances faster Consider this basic example ammunition arches and plows just three random things that popped into my head are complicated technology They might each take  years to invent and perfect For a single culture to invent all three would take  years Or three different cultures could invent one each That way the whole old world has them in  years plus a couple for the information to spread Obviously technology doesnt work like this First of all it can take s of years before someone realizes the need or potential for something and then in a year it could be complete Theres also no reason you cant work on more than one piece of technology at the same time However this does demonstrate that having more peoples to invent technology that can be shared does speed of up the process On the other hand the Americans and southern Africans were more isolated In America the natives had ni contact with other peoples and even amongst themselves wasnt that common except for with a few select tribes In southern Africa it was a similar story Isolated tribes and even when Europeans began exploring the rest of the continent there was little trade as it was mostly colonozation and resourcehunting This means Americans and southern Africans didnt get the benefit of other societies inventions ,0,cdos9ks,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

pythonpoole,I think it may have to do with the fact that the Imperial Gallon used in the United Kingdom is not the same as the US Customary Gallon used throughout the United StatesThe Imperial Gallon is roughly  Liters in volume whereas the US Customary Gallon is roughly  Liters in volume Thus you will get more miles per Imperial Gallon than you do per a US Customary GallonThis is merely an educated guess as to the reason for the discrepancy I dont know whether or not there is a worldwide standard gallon measure used for calculating MPG rates for automobiles,0,cdotow3,1rmviv,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
sirsri,One thing to add Theyre measuring different things because europe and the US have different driving habitsSo the US is trying to measure average american driver stats whereas europe is trying to measure the average european  Well europe is a great deal smaller than the US with a great many more people very different urban planning and some places very different concepts of how to deal with trafficEuropean cars have different turn signals than amercian ones for visibility to different types of other people and european cars at one point were designed much more about a low speed collision with pedestrians than about high speed collisions with other cars and brick walls I dont think thats the case so much anymore and the auto makers really want the same standards everywhere  But you get the idea   Theyre thinking about fuel economy in the way a european drives which is shorter distances on slower roads with more pedestrians  ,0,cdp0bcy,1rmviv,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

LondonPilot,gt Is smoked salmon cooked or rawAccording to WikipediahttpenwikipediaorgwikiSmokedfishgt  Cold smoking does not cook the flesh coagulate the proteins inactivate food spoilage enzymes or eliminate the food pathogens and hence refrigerated storage is necessary until consumptionHowever it then goes on to saygt traditionally in the US coldsmoked fish other than salmon is considered raw and thus unsafe to consume without cookingPersonally I would consider smoked salmon to be uncooked I think the distinction Wikipedia is making between salmon and other smoked fish is that salmon is the only one which is generally considered safe to eat in the US without cookingId guess that the reason for this is because salmon is so often prepared this way that the fishing and storage methods involve keeping the fish fresh enough to eat safely without cooking  Im sure that other fish would be just as safe if it was stored in the same way as salmongt And does putting fish in an acid ie tuna in lime cook the fish or is it still raw despite the change in appearanceAgain using WikipediahttpenwikipediaorgwikiCevichePreparationandvariants as a sourcegt Ceviche is marinated in a citrusbased mixture with lemons and limes being the most commonly used In addition to adding flavor the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become denatured appearing to be cooked However acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms unlike the heat of cookingSo this method of preparing fish is not considered to be cooking However the confusion perhaps stems from the fact that the word ceviche which describes preparing fish in this way might derive from the SpanishArabic word assukkabáǧ which itself derives from the Arabic word sakbāj سكباج meaning meat cooked in vinegar The fact that this is the origin of the word is not definite though,0,cdov9ii,1rn1ke,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2
Fairleee,It depends on the context of the filming and the laws in various nations So in the UK for example if you are filming in public for the purpose of news or reporting or current events then you do not need to obtain consent This is because it is assumed that by being in public you have waived your right to privacy  after all anyone in the street can see you However it is usually considered good practice for companies filming to put up signs or notices that filming will be going on in the area so people are aware This is partly because it would be impractical to obtain verbal or written consent from everyone in the area However if you notice that you are filmed you do have the right to ask them not to identify youIn a private residence you do have to get permission to film someone so that they can be identified because it is not assumed that they have waived their right to privacy they are in a private place That tends to cover people who are being filmed in the background  when it comes to people being interviewed you typically would try and get a consent form in place so they are aware that they are being interviewed and the interview might be used However it is also generally expected that the person should be told what they are being interviewed about For example it would be completely unethical to tell someone that you are filming them about Christmas and then use them saying I think its wonderful in a piece about child pornography Obviously thats an extreme example but something that is intentionally misleading like that will make you liable to a lawsuit and if you intentionally misrepresent someone then that is illegalWhen it comes to filming for commercial purposes ie the purpose is to make money then you would typically need a consent form because entertainment is different to newscurrent affairs Again in a large crowd scene you can just use a general announcement that filming will be going on but if you are going to film someone intentionally and directly as opposed to just a shot of them in the background you should get consent simply to cover your own assSource I did some research on this for a friend who was looking up laws on consent for a film he was making Im not a lawyer so cannot guarantee this is  accurate also it is worth noting that laws very from country to country,0,cdovrcd,1rn288,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Mephysteaux,Gifts are not typically exchanged on Thanksgiving Strangers do typically wish each other a happy Thanksgivingholiday While Thanksgiving is traditionally a family holiday some people do seecall friends In particular if a friend isnt spending Thanksgiving with someone often due to being separated from their family its fairly customary to invite them to spend Thanksgiving with your family Native Americans rarely get thanked Religious people often thank God but the feeling of gratitude generally isnt directed at anything or anyone in particular unless theyre directly involved Its considered a generally American holiday so its celebrated by people regardless of their race religion or political affiliations I wouldnt say there are people who express AntiThanksgiving views but there are some who say the story is watered down and that the Thanksgiving story everyone knows takes away from the fact that Native Americans were abused by white settlers Also the big controversy recently is that a lot of employers especially in retail make their employees work on Thanksgiving This is partly because Black Friday which is considered one of the busiest shopping days of the year is tomorrow Thanksgiving is only one public holiday but many employers also give employees the following day off so they can have a day weekend and schools might be closed as early as Tuesday or Wednesday,0,cdowsk9,1rn8ci,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4
GreenTea,The history as I understand it simplified a day of Thanksgiving including a feast to thank God for a fortunate event or blessing is a tradition that goes way back In America there was a famous Thanksgiving in the th century when English settlers in Massachusetts joined with Native Americans to celebrate a successful harvest It really happened although it has been mythologized over the yearsFlash forward to the th century days of Thanksgiving have continued but with no set date The Civil War has torn the country apart and president Abraham Lincoln inspired by a citizens letter decides to declare a national day of Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November Thats how it became the national holiday that it is today For much more detail see WikipediaModern ThanksgivingPeople of all faiths and nonbelievers celebrate the holiday to give thanks to their deity to just be gratefulappreciativeor just to have a big meal Many families try to get together hence the driving large distances for people who have moved awayGifts are not a traditional part of the holiday Its all about food family and for many Americans football Also watching parades mostly on TVYes it is normal to say Happy Thanksgiving or Happy Holiday especially this year with Hanukkah overlapping itFriends certainly could be involved although the focus is on family for most people However the night before Thanksgiving many old high school friends reunite because they have all come back to their parents homes after being away at college or moving awayUnfortunately actual Native Americans are not a big part of most public Thanksgiving eventsalthough Im sure it happens somewhereAmazingly Thanksgiving seems to be equally enjoyed by liberal and conservative Americans Food is universal  Theres not much antiThanksgiving sentiment although you do see some from Native American activists Also vegans I guess since turkey is the traditional main dish although many vegetariansvegans celebrate happily with nonmeat dishesThe official public holiday is only Thanksgiving Day itself Some workplaces also close for the following day making a wonderful day weekend but others dont especially retailthe dreaded Black FridayHope that helped,1,cdox0d1,1rn8ci,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,1

psychologythrill,theres another explanation also theres this thing called object permanence which is an infants ability to represent an object in its mind To get an idea of this think of playing with a baby and his toy and then hiding the toy under a blanket until a certain age the baby wouldnt look under the blanket for the toy because it doesnt yet have object permanence or  a symbol of the toy in its mind So the theory goes that until a child acquires object permanence it wont be able to represent objectsscenarios in its mind and so wont have that kind of memoryLanguage also uses symbols the idea that a word represents a concrete thing and so another idea is that using language throughout the day will aid memory formation and so before children begin speaking their memories will be weaker evidence of this was shown in the different social environments that north american vs asian children have Its more common for NA parents to discuss the events of the day with their children what happened today what did you learn etc and this is not so common in asian cultures Theyve found that NA children have stronger and earlier childhood memories Interesting stuff,0,cdp18x4,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,hot,8,8

SunAvatar,We dont really know exactly why but there are several proposed explanations Neurological immaturity The brain structures that form lasting personal memories are just not fully formed yet This is probably the most popular theory yet it has the problem of explaining why twoyearolds can frequently remember things that happened when they were one Emotional immaturity Emotion is heavily involved in recollection and during the first few years the brain structures that regulate emotion are still developing Supporting this theory is that the occurrence of deeply meaningful and emotional events in a young childs life such as the birth of a sibling can lead to earlier memories Repression The first few years of life are so traumatic that they are simply repressed Supporting this theory is the fact that adults who were abused or traumatized in childhood frequently have their first memories even later around  Lack of selfawareness Until a certain age toddlers dont really understand that they are a person with unique characteristics and separate from all others Until this happens toddlers can learn but they cannot construct memories that are autobiographical in the way you or I would understandThere are probably others but these are the ones I can recall from those old undergrad psych classes,0,cdpcohp,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4

Kutulainen,Human brain has its own rewardpunishment systems Your brain rewards you for doing things that your instincts tell it are good things Example Eating fatty food rich in carbohydrates is very rare in natural condition think stone age people so your brain tells you damn this is good stuff eat as much as you can Same thing with grooming and playing with friends they are likely to enhance your social status and make you more likely to survive as part of a group Your brain also punishes you for doing things that it considers are bad for you This is why some things taste horrible or feel badPeople wit addiction to gambling or some other activity usually have their rewardpunishment systems slightly skewed the rewardpunishment doesnt work properly Such as giving rewards for activities that dont really benefit you or forgetting to give punishment for something that is harmful So in that way a gambler might remember only the winnings they make him feel good but forgets all the losses as these dont bring the correct punishmentreaction ,0,cdp1bjm,1rnjc0,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

flamingmanny,This is copied from another thread i saved only this excerpt so unfortunately i dont know who the original writer of this is Very informative whoever posted thisTheres actually an international classification of headache disordershttpcepsagepubcomcontentlong that classifies the different types of headaches The brain itself has no pain receptors because all pain receptors send their signals to the brain Its the thing thats doing the feeling of the pain This is why awake brain surgery works as well as it does the neurosurgeon can go in an electrically stimulate the awake brain and remove brain tissue without the patient feeling anythingAs can be seen in the ICHD there are many kinds of headaches Some are caused by muscle tension in the head and neck Others by inflammation pressing against nerves Some even caused whats called referred pain which is when it feels like the pain is in one place but thats actually a phantom pain being caused somewhere elseThe classic examples are heart attacks and icecream headaches In icecream headaches the rapid cooling of blood vessels in the throat and mouth stimulate the trigeminal nerve which brings in pain information from the head making it feel like your head is in pain when the stimulation is actually happening in the mouthFor other headaches its good to know about the three protective layers called meninges that cover the brain thepia mater soft mother which adheres to the brain and is very fine the arachnoid layer which sort of provides a barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and the rest of the circulatory system and the dura mater hard mother which feels very leathery like bat wings and holds in the cerebrospinal fluidThese meninges also help form the blood brain barrier and cover a lot of the fine blood vessels that supply the brain with bloodBoth the blood vessels and meninges have pain receptors The pain receptors in these regions can be stimulated by a lot of things For example meningitis is when these become enflamed due to infection This inflammation is painful due to the stretching and pressure Similarly pressure changes brought about by dehydration or changes in blood salinity or what have you like in a hangover can also cause pain that we feel as headachesSo in short theres not one kind of headache and sometimes even though a headache feels like its located in one place its not really because of the phantom stimulation from referred pain,13,cdp2rr0,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,hot,65,52

doctoranonymous,Headaches are basically pain referred outside from any damage or irritation to structures inside your head other than brain mostlyBecause brain itself is insensitive to pain and even if touched directly it can only cause funny sensations in the areas of the body represented by that portion that is touchedWhereas the layer covering the brain which holds the blood vessels are very sensitive As someone mentioned earlier hangover headaches are from hereToo much alcohol too much byproducts and even constipationcauses toxic products in the vesselsirritation of vesselsHeadacheIn Migraine too much emotion and tension will make the blood vessels go crazy which get tired and become flaccid and blood keeps gushing in causes it to stretch more including the layer covering brainHeadacheEmotional headaches are when muscles of scalp and neck spasmie when muscles get too stressed out lactic acid is produced which causes pain but still it feels like your head hurts from inside because all types of headaches are referred outside and feels the sameIcecream headache is just referred pain from your palateI dont know if I ve  put it right but thats all I know,0,cdp5y8t,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

docdaneeka,The underlying structure and vocabulary is still largely Germanic in origin All the most common words for example are of Old English derivation  English traces back to AngloSaxon which was beyond doubt a West Germanic language every bit as much as German or Dutch and their ancestral languages are Yes it has since received a massive infusion of terms borrowed from French and Latin but that doesnt change the fundamental nature of the language ,1,cdp0lwu,1rnmvx,explainlikeimfive,hot,5,4
ubabar,Not a linguist but Ill try my bestIts Germanic because it is descended from parent languages that are Germanic Modern English is directly descended from Middle English which is directly descended from Old English Old English was made up of a few very similar dialects that all directly descend from ProtoGermanic This right here is the very simple reason linguists classify it as GermanicNow why isnt English considered a Romance language or Romancehybrid if Old French changed the language so much Thats because Old French didnt change it as much as most laymen think that it did The very simple answer here is that Old French contributed vocabulary and borrowed vocabulary by itself does not change languagesIf all that had happened was that Old English speakers started borrowing words from Old French then it would still have been Old English just with more French wordsThe actual transition from Old English to Middle English was in the grammar and these changes had already started before the Normans had even arrived And would still have happened regardless of the Norman invasion because all the pieces were still in placeThe most important change was the reduction of inflectional endings This might not seem like much but to understand it better you have to understand that with inflectional endings a language can have a pretty free word order That is it doesnt really matter where all the words are arranged in a sentence the words themselves are marked for their grammatical meaning so you could literally rearrange the words almost any way you want But modern English doesnt do this if words are out of order we cant understand whats going on We also have very few inflectional endings as well so You should probably guess when the inflectional endings went our word order had to change to pick up the slack No more I will the you store and to go but now it could only be You and I will go to the storeBut this reduction of endings didnt happen overnight nor did it happen over a few decades after the Norman invasion This change was actually about a thousand years in the making You see the ancestor of English ProtoGermanic had done something strange to the way words were spoken they fixed the stress of a word on the initial or root syllable Other IndoEuropean languages could and did switch the way they stressed their words Latin and Ancient Greek would usually put the stress towards the end of the word usually among the inflectional endings themselvesWhat this meant for all Germanic languages that inherited this feature was the very gradual degradation of all inflectional endings which now all occurred after the stressed syllable So for instance ProtoGermanic wulfaz the wolf would have become preOld English wulfa which became Old English wulf which became modern English wolf Now again this might not seem like much but it happened to almost all words and even by Old English these endings had already taken a beating After what few endings remained had become so similar to each other it wasnt really long before they lost their purpose and would have been dropped altogether A note here Old English didnt end in  it was actually spoken for another  years after the Norman invasion It just wasnt written down anymore as all the people who were in a position to write at this time were now speaking Norman French or were writing in LatinIf French had caused these changes say in a creole situation you would expect this all to have happened very fast with a near complete collapse of inflectional endings right off the bat which is what happens with creoles But you dont see this with English you see a very gradual reduction of endings Middle English still had them more reduced in nouns and adjectives and only slightly reduced with verbs before they were eventually dropped altogether in Modern English Well most of them anyway we kept a few Another final note While we borrowed an awful lot of words from OldNorman French into Middle English this number was dwarfed by the later borrowings of French and Latin words into Early Modern and Modern English during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods,0,cdpab2f,1rnmvx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

OrangeCrack,ExJW here Its a Christian religion technically however they do not follow the nicene creed meaning they do not believe in the trinity whereas most other major Christian religions do They also have a lot of doctrines that make them stand out from other churches for example They do not celebrate birthdays Their reasoning being that all birthdays recorded in the bible ended badly There is nothing in the bible condemning them directly so this is simply doctrine  They do not celebrate christmas They do not believe correctly that Jesus was born on Dec  see also above about birthdays They do not celebrate easter in the same way most christians do I wont get into the details if you want to know more PM me They dont celebrate mothers day  fathers day  new years eve While these are not as strictly enforced as the above the reasoning being that they derive from some pagan holidaysAlso apart from those oddities that have some rather concerning practices that make many people view them as cult like A member of their religion who breaks their rules can be expelled with the result being no one who is still a JW can talk to them family included They do not accept blood transfusions based on a couple bible verses stating do not eat blood But they dont simply tell their members to refuse as a matter of doctrine they severely misrepresented and misquote medical literature to make it seem that using blood is more risky than not Any specific questions let me know,9,cdp1i9n,1rnotg,explainlikeimfive,hot,20,11

RjoTTUbio,Vaccines do have side effects For live vaccines ones with living but damaged versions of a virus or bacteria the side effects tend to show a mild form of the disease for which you are being immunized against For dead vaccines you can get side effects simply due to an immune response against the antigens present in the vaccine Some people claim the flu shot gives them the flu which is half true You can get a mild version of the flu from the vaccine or just a mild immune response to the antigens in the dead flu vaccine Therefore some people associate a vaccine with feeling sick Like umrrandomman stated there was a study published that linked the MMR measles mumps rubella vaccine to autism This study was poorly designed and thoroughly debunked However the damage was done since there was a rise in measles and preventable diseases following this study httpnewsbbccoukhihealthstmThere is also an argument that vaccines drive huge revenue for the medical industry but most of the vaccines covered under Medicare part B amp D and Medicaid really dont drive much revenue for medical offices or big drug companies compared to medical treatment for these diseases that we are trying to protect againstEdit Basically people think vaccines are either or scam or outright dangerous This is due to a poor understanding of what a vaccine actually does I will edit again and explain that better as wellSo what does a vaccine actually doA vaccine introduces a live virusbacteria or dead components of these organisms Once these organisms enter the body via injection oral or nasal route fluMist vaccine your body collects these particles to present to your immune system There are cells that roam the body looking for bad things macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells These cells primarily dendritic cells gather up dead things and bring them to the lymph nodes Once in the lymph nodes B and T cells are exposed to these particles and begin to change B and T cells that recognize the antigen start to clone themselves and eventually form differentiated B amp T cells that hunt down more pathogens B cells produce antibodies T cells kill in other ways They also differentiate into memory cells which give you long lasting immunity to that antigen Once you have been given a shot it generally takes  days for this process to work You are now immune to some strains of that virus or bacteria that you could be exposed to in the future   ,0,cdp1qev,1rnpbq,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4

Inksplotter,Mainly theres a douche canoe named Andrew Wakefield who put a lot of effort into convincing people that there was a link between vaccines and autism His data was bogus and his particular brand of fear mongering did not do well in the UK where he is from but it caught the American imagination I think Americans were particularly vulnerable because his theory resolved ambiguity about a mysterious disease Americans hate ambiguity while squarely setting the blame on opaque organizations that were out to make money and damn the consequences Americans also love conspiracies particularly with clear moral badguys at the bottom Also through previously very successful immunization programs hardly anyone has seen scarlet fever or whooping cough while autism is an epidemic This makes Americans particularly bad at estimating the risk of not vaccinating Americans also have a broad misunderstanding and mistrust of science and tend to mistake people using scientific sounding words and repetition for people who actually sense Also our preventative care system sucks so many people will take any reason to not go to the doctorMost people vaccinate their kids and themselves For one thing a lot of schools require it But hardly anyone does it because they understand know what they are doing and make a choice its mainly habit and doing what your doctor tells you The ones who dont vaccinate make the news and look like they understand what theyre doing which does occasionally convince people who dont know what theyre doing to follow them,0,cdp325n,1rnpbq,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

NightMaestro,Friction is made everywhere The results however can be neglible or very pronouncedWhat you have here on a molecular level is a bunch of liquid contacting liquid And Ill explain thisThe water molecules inside the bottle are already at a liquid state but when in contact with that ice cube the surface atoms at the state of energy to keep the ice cube a solid begin to break into a liquid The molecules of the ice cube are melting offThere still is some friction made between a liquid vs a liquid state but its pretty neglible Imagine the friction of air moving against air The molecules hardly ever get close enough to create a lot of friction And in water you just have the molecules actually move not resisting much change The friction is negated almost entirely when the molecules actually move about instead of resisting the force you are applyingNow imagine I filled that whole bottle with marbles covered in sand paper What you got now is two solids running up against eachother The state of these solids keep them a solid and when force is applied on a molecular level they will resist change along the whole structure This is called sliding friction and is the most resistantIn this picture you will see on a atomic level little ridges of the sand paper hit against eachother and the molecules staying in their solid to compensate this They dont all break off instead each solid object will move a little bit to compensate but the electromagnetic repulsion actual mathmatical friction creates energy in the form of heat what we expirience as friction You have huge sheaths full of millions of atoms the surface of the objects enacting this force so the net gain of friction is a lot bigger than the liquid or gaseous frictional return,0,cdp49p1,1rnpgx,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

Itwasntmehonest,The parts that go into a PC all conform to agreed upon standards  What the parts do where they go what the connector looks like how the power is attached  All standardized  You can almost think of the various components like lego bricks  You buy a selection of the right color and shape and plug them togetherThe software environment is also standardized  The main board or motherboard for example has software on board the BIOS that can recognize keyboards and video cards can access the hard drive and read a DVD ROM  This means you can take your Operating System eg Windows DVD ROM pop it in the drive poweron and your system will install itselfWhen Windows is done installing it will often be able to use all your devices either immediately or once you pop in the driver disk for your new video card  If the video card or printer manufacturer have done a good job then this should be trivial  Device manufacturers write software for Windows based on Microsoft published specifications and then have to pass a set of tests called certification in order to publish their device software  Things can still go wrong  if the manufacture hasnt done good quality assurance then bugs can get through that can crash the operating system omg Windows suxorz uh no  Usually though things just work almost like magicConsoles arent like that  Consoles are not like lego sets put together with welldefined pieces that can be plugged in and out Typically the insides of a console are rigid  they cant be changed  Theyre put together in one configuration and cant be changed  This does two things First it keeps the costs down Making a mainboard with all the components fixed is cheaper than building individual components and connecting them  Second it presents a fixed configuration to the games companies  They can write their game knowing that it will always work at these graphics levels and at this resolution  They dont have to build the flexibility to work with  years worth of different graphics card performance  They can tweak and tune their game graphics so it looks as good as possible without risk of some unexpected variable old busted graphics card coming in and ruining the experienceOn the software side the operating system will be hardcoded in the platform and cryptographically signed which means it contains a magic number that mathematically proves the software came from the vendor  This doesnt mean its not upgradable just not upgradable by you  You cant but the OS install on a DVDConsole vendors often make either miniscule profit or an actual loss on the console itself in order to get it out in the world in mass quantities ie they cant price it too high otherwise people wont buy it  They actually make their money on games  Every game you buy a slice will go to the console vendor and thats what makes the whole enterprise a viable business  The console vendors then cant have people installing unlicensed software on the machine as that would defeat the business model  So signed binaries are everywhereSome people might argue that Its my machine and I should be able to do what I want  Uh no  Not when youre buying  of hardware for   If you want to tinker get a PC,0,cdp3wuh,1rnq48,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

sirsri,Those questions are hard to answer  Partly because we dont know exactly what independence would mean  Scotland is a relatively poor part of the UK that has benefited quite a lot from payments from the central government over the centuries for things like health care and roads etc   But it has oil reserves well some anyway which have inflated GDP lately  So first thing  scotland only has about  million people of the UKs  ish  So if they leave in the grand scheme of things it wont make much differenceBut how oil revenues are carved up would be non trivial as would how the territory is split  There no answer here because it hasnt been decided  Presumably scotland would get most of the oil as most of it is close to scotlandgtstandard of living etcIn the long run its bad for scotland  It wont matter much to the UK  Unlike Ireland which was a rd world country caused by deliberate UK policy attached to europe when it got independence Scotland is overall well off  That would start to gradually erode as the practical realities of trying to do business in scotland sink in  Without oil they dont have anything and while they could try and set themselves up as an Ireland like english speaking tax haven how many more tax havens does europe need or want and if they cant be a tax haven what are they  There isnt a critical mass of people for any meaningful industry anymore and trying to use the Euro or the pound would turn them into a greece or spain   For a little while it would all seem rosy as the ship building and the IT sector seemed great and then the problems of goods and people across borders the currency imbalances etc would all sink ingtetcThe etc is really the main question  Unlike just about everyone else who has asked for and gotten independence scotland is not particularly culturally distinct from the UK on a day to day basis  At least not anymore  They all speak the same language albeit with an accent they go to similar jobs they live in similar houses they already have representation in government they go home and watch TV and play games and go to bars and pubs etc in much the same way as their english counter parts  The scottish are not particularly committed to one religion that is being oppressed by another or any of that  So what do they get  Somewhat like Canada and australia and new zealand they get to waste a pile of money having independent foreign policies which almost no one in the world cares about because theyre too small to matter and most of the serious important issues it will get to spend a pile of money to feel good about itself for agreeing to do what everyone else sane is doing anyway  Made worse is that scotland is never going to get much bigger  While Canada and Australia could conceivably pass England in population by the end of the century or so scotland is going to be well small  The UK has military bases in Scotland and Scotts serve in the  British military that would change and less money in one pot will make it a bit harder to have major military assets like aircraft carriers and airplane RampD and that sort of thing   That weakens the UK a little bit but makes scotland basically irrelevant in the world  If the EU got its act together into a single megastate it basically wouldnt matter at all  It would be like splitting New York state in half  You can or you cannot in the end it doesnt make much difference to anyone  Arbitrary lines on a map are arbitrary  NB Im in Canada we have our own separatists in Quebec who do seem to be culturally different from the rest of us in Canada  But on the whole Canadian independence hasnt actually gotten us much  It makes us feel good about ourselves but thats about it ,1,cdp3qp0,1rnq5q,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,0

Drofmum,Well young moflugger as I am here avoiding real work I will try to explain Most smart people tend to agree that dinosaurs died because of a big disaster called the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event Probably because a big rock from space hit the earth and sent a lot of dust into the sky This dust blocked out the sun and made the world very cold Like the north poll where Santa lives As we all know only Santa and his helpers and reindeer live in the north poll That is because when it is cold and dark plants cant grow so the big animals that eat the plants die because they are hungry and cold Smaller animals can live with a lot less food and mammals have fur and warm blood to keep them alive in the cold This is why they survived the cold winter that lasted many years Eventually all the dinosaurs died except for some birds did you know birds used to be dinosaurs because they are small and some could dive under the water or make warm little burrows Mammals then took the place of dinosaurs when the world warmed up again They got bigger and bigger like elephants and whales The largest animal to ever live still exists it is the blue whale We call such animals megafauna For a long time these giant animals lived happily grazing on lush green pastures and making friends Then there came man Unlike other animals man is very sneaky He can work together to catch and eat really big animals even an animal as big as the blue whale I just told you about He can use weapons like spears and knives and even make traps That is why many of the big slow and delicious animals we used to have were all eaten upAnd that is why we dont have as many animals as big as dinosaurs anymore,8,cdp5oho,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,hot,34,26
SirEbonwolf,Im not  sure but as Ive always understood it has to do with the concertration of oxygen in the atmosphere That in the prehistoric period there was more oxygen that let animals grow to extreme sizes and still be able to easily get enough oxygen out of breathing as the larger an animal is the more oxygen it needs to fuel its cells As far as I know whales can get around this by not having the same type of extremities like arms and legs They do not need these as they are suspended in the water getting air to these extremities is harder than getting it to central parts of the body so as the oxygen concertration has decreasedanimals with extremeties like arms and legs have become smaller over the generations,2,cdp8kyp,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,hot,16,14
whyroby,As animals get proportionately larger ie picture a sixty foot tall human with the same relative dimensions as a normal six foot tall person their bodily functions become less efficient and need more oxygen and other things Ill get to why in a second There used to be more oxygen in the air than there currently is so thats one major factor for why extremely large animals have a hard time sustaining themselvesThe reason proportionately larger animals are less efficient is because mass is a function of the cube of height but the strength of bones and muscle are a function of the square of height because their strength is related to the size of the D cross sectionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiPhysicalstrengthOverview not due to the mass of the bone or muscle  picture trying to make a house out of paperA  foot man has x the height of a  foot man So he has x the bone and muscle strength But he has x the mass So he wouldnt be able to support himself unless his body had much stronger and less energy efficient bones and muscle,0,cdpbfg9,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

Mistuhbull,Long long ago the Greeks came and conquered the land of Judea  The king of the Greeks Antiochus didnt like that the Jews had their own customs and gods  King Antiochus decreed that the Jews needed to act like Greeks and worship the Greek Gods not doing so would be a crime  One day the King was riding through town and saw an old man who refused to worship the Greek Gods the King came down and demanded to know who the man was  The man answered that he  was Mattathais and he would not worship the Greek Gods  This angered the King and sparked the people into revolution The Jews revolted against the Greeks led by Judah Maccabee Judah the Hammer and eventually won a long and arduous war against the Greeks pushing them out of Jerusalem and reclaiming The Temple  But when they got to the temple they saw that the Greeks had defiled it they had smashed all the furniture and candles they had let pigs run amok in The Temple and they had let the Eternal Light go outThe Maccabees got to cleaning up the temple and restoring it and when they went to relight the Eternal Light they found that they had only enough oil to last  night and it would take eight nights to make new oil  The Maccabees lit the light and sat through the night to watch it burn to their surprise the light burned strong throughout the night and continued to burn for the eight nights needed to make new oil for the lamp  The holiday is eight days long because Gd intervened and made a miracle happen when the light kept burningNow thats what is told  If you look at the books where the Maccabee story comes from you wont find any mention of the oil  That part seems to have been added in by later rabbis possibly as a way to add a bit of Gd into the storyTLDR Greeks tried to outlaw being a Jew Jews revolted Jews win  Big PartyAs for spelling there is an official spelling its חנכה  However thats not english  The first letter there ח goes from right to left makes a sound somewhere between the H in hat and the CH in chair as the other poster said kinda like the Ch in loch  Anyways when the word gets transliterated thats when you spell something from another language phonetically in yours it sometimes Chanukkah and sometimes Hanukkah sometimes Chanukah or Hanukah too,0,cdp7gwy,1ro696,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

MayContainNugat,Common Law is the law developed over generations by judges over a long period of time Its the law built up from long traditions and precedents that exists prior to legislative bodies passing specific statutes The English common law developed in the Middle Ages and forms the basis of law in England and its former colonies including the US Except for Louisiana whose common law derives from FranceFor instance under English common law a couple is married when they live together for a certain period of time and hold themselves out to the community as man and wife Legislatures in most jurisdictions however have overridden common law by passing statutes requiring a marriage license issued by the state to be considered married  ,0,cdpa7r1,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4
carlfish,As far back as the middle ages legal disputes between individuals in Britain were decided by taking them to courts adjudicated by judges appointed by the crown Judges appointed by the King or Queen would literally travel from town to town hearing cases and passing down judgements In the absence of a comprehensive statutory code judges would base their decisions on their understanding of how the law should work and how judges before them had decided similar casesOn their return to London courts would record their judgements and the reasoning behind them and share them with their fellow judges That way when a judge encountered a similar case on their circuit they would be able to decide it consistently with the last judge who had decided that case Alternatively a senior judge might overrule their junior and create a new precedentThe Common Law is the result of these thousand years of legal decisions Judges in Common Law jurisdictions are expected to decide cases consistently with their predecessors and in turn pass on how they interpret the law in newly arising circumstances to their successorsHow legitimate the Common Law is depends on your jurisdiction The degree to which the Common Law is adopted in your local legal system is determined by your local laws Especially different countries tend to clearly mark where their local system of precedent diverges from the British system they inherited it from  decisions before that date being binding legal precedent and decisions after that date only being suggestions on how the law might be interpreted The only consistent rule is that statutory law always overrules Common Law so once a government passes a law then all other precedent is overruled,0,cdpge46,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

HashTagWaterFelon,Short answer is that it depends and serious deformities may or may not ever actually ariseThe thing is that if the initial two had perfect genomes with no mutations corresponding to serious defects there is no reason that their breeding or that of their descendants would necessarily give rise to a population with those defects If they arent there to begin with they wouldnt be created by inbreeding The founder effect is the formal name for how low diversity groups starting a population can lead to high incidences of genetic defects But that is only because the genes for those traits were brought by a founding member of the population Inbreeding NEVER creates a genetic mutation It only increases the chance that one already present will be expressedAnd anyways if the two people happened to carry in some serious problem traits as in serious to the point that they would kill off the affected person then natural selection would act to start pushing the genes prevalence downwards anyway Simulations with programs mathematically assigning fitness levels to mice show how when a given gene gives a higher probability of successfully breeding that the inferior gene is purged to a minimal level very quickly described in Reece and Campbell Biology th editionSo in short assuming that these two individuals were healthy to start with that pretty much guarantees that there are enough healthy genes in play to rebuild the population Situations like the Kentucky families that took on a blue skin tone was because that trait didnt really reduce fitness levels by much if it did the blue ones would die and that gene would fade out You would have a low level of genetic diversity yes which would leave humanity vulnerable to being ravaged by a disease or other pressure of that kind So you could very easily get some strange traits popping up but if they were serious deformities to the point that they mess with a persons ability to propagate themselves then no that trait wouldnt show up and stay around,6,cdpg3e8,1rootd,explainlikeimfive,hot,25,19

BassoonHero,There is a lot of mythology about this so Ill try to post a complete answer This brushes on some old holy wars so please read the whole thing before leaving angry commentsThe first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive or from another system on your network If you install it yourself then its not a virus even if you were tricked into installing it A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse or just a trojan for shortThere is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS for Windows and even for Linux However there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and none that affect the modern Mac OS For Windows this has not long been the case A decade ago Windows viruses abounded and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs At the same time there were still no Mac OS X viruses in the wildCommon internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time so no one tried to write a virus for it While intuitively appealing this explanation is faulty for several reasonsFirst it strains ones credulity to suppose that this could explain a total lack of viruses for Mac OS X Surely someone somewhere would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller it was also ripe for subversion Mac users of the time were justifiably if irritatingly smug about not needing to run antivirus programs If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus then it should have been easier to infect Macs because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions Moreover surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bringSecond the prevalence of other types of malware such as trojan horse software has increased as the Macs market share waxes Its commonplace to hear that yet another Macbased trojan has been spotted in the wild yet still not a single virus If the Macs market share is sufficient to attract trojans then why not virusesThird the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years True Windowss market share has declined somewhat but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share and crucially the prevalence of viruses for other platforms such as Mac OS X has not increased to make up for itSo if we can eliminate market share as the cause then what Well the answer is simple if sadly contentious During the dark ages of Windows viruses the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS The malware explosion that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes retire old APIs and generally modernize their OSIn a way its only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this The classic Mac OS versions  predated Windows and by the late s it was showing its age It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single trusted user Where this assumption was violated there were security holes And there were definitely viruses although in those days you were more likely to catch one from a friends floppy disk than from the internet There were also myriad technical limitations that are welldocumented elsewhere So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale This was a long and painful process and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting but in the end they had OS X a modern multiuser UNIXbased OS And no virusesWindowss evolution took a more gradual path Windows NT New technologies was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast lest compatibility problems alienate their users Apple on the other hand maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apples engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old daysSo during the dark ages Mac users had a brand new modern OS whereas Windows users had an aging singleuser OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug Today Windows is a different animal  Microsofts strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus But people remember a time not too long ago when this was not the case and the impressions left by that era linger on in the popular consciousness,1,cdpfkns,1roy3o,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,2

TheDoctorApollo,While it is true that there is more awareness for Celiacs Disease and that will lead to increased diagnosis I am not aware of any evidence that suggests it is more common now compared to   year agoMost people who are selfdiagnosed Celiacs have absolutely nothing wrong with them but instead just want to jump on board the band wagon Perhaps they have an intolerance to gluten but an intolerance is very different than an allergy which is what defines Celiacs Disease For someone to truly be allergic to gluten they must have an adaptive immune response to it As I said most people are either doing it because they want the health benefits of a glutenfree diet or because its the cool thing to do I had a friend that decided she was allergic to gluten this summer I couldnt help but call her out on it when she decided that pizza and beer didnt count in her new lifestyleIf your sister was actually diagnosed with Celiacs by an allergist MD who specializes in allergies than it is possible that you have it as well There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link in Celiacs disease It is worth getting check out by a health professional prolonged exposure to gluten can cause tissue remodeling in someone with Celiacs which may lead to cancer or chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndromeSource Immunology major,3,cdpfd9i,1roydh,explainlikeimfive,hot,13,10

liquefaction,Awareness does help but there are many other factors I believe theres been a steep increase over the last  years that is only now becoming public knowledge Children have more sensitive immune systems than adults and those who have spent their whole lives only eating lots of unfermented gluten from a few strains have a more severe immune system reaction than adults who ate less gluten grew up on fermented gluten and ate more diverse gluten For starters we are overexposed to gluten  we eat more processed foods than we did in the past Gluten is also added to more foods than ever because its cheap Its cheap because it stores well and its subsidized While in the past we ate many different strains of wheat currently we eat only a few strains Modern wheat is bred to be extremely high in gluten because gluten is great for texture The way we process wheat has also changed Commercial yeast wasnt developed until the s Before that wheat had to be fermented to help it rise A starter was created for this purpose Starters are usually made from flour and water The flour and water would be naturally colonized by local bacteria which would be fed with more flour and water on a regular basis or less often for sourdough and these bacteria are what caused dough to rise That starter was used to make each loaf of bread The bacteria served another helpful function as well  to break down the harmful substances in grains by digesting them and leaving behind harmless substances humans can digest easily Theres a good reason grain is a common allergy Like animals plants can have defenses Not all though  some plants like fruits want to be eaten Their seeds are spread through feces so it makes sense for them to be delicious and not cause issues in things that eat them Unsprouted grains however die when eaten so they developed a hull as a defense That hull contains phytic acid which blocks absorption of calcium iron and other nutrients we need Its called an antinutrient for that reason Another mildly toxic substance in seeds is lectin In small amounts these substances wont cause permanent issues just some mild stomach upset in those not accustomed However when eaten multiple times a day our bodies sometimes start to react Another thing makes lectins and antinutrients in grains more harmful today than in the past Grains were left in the fields to sprout long ago Just like fruit now is picked before its ripe followers of modern agricultural methods dont allow the grain to sprout as sprouted grain goes bad more quickly Sprouted grain also contained fewer of these antinutrients as it doesnt need the defenses that a seed does Even in people who arent intolerantallergic gluten causes inflammation due to this toxic substance as well as lectins This inflammation causes the intestines to swell The swelling causes tiny holes to be opened When this happens tiny particles of food leak outside of the intestines where theyre supposed to be into the body At this point our body sees the particles as foreign invaders and begins to attack them This is called Leaky Gut Syndrome and is in debate within the medical community but many people myself included have seen relief by avoiding substances that cause inflammation Had I waited around for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me Id still be too sick to leave the house If you think about how your immune system is designed to react to a tiny germ its easy to understand how a tiny particle of gluten could cause a reaction as well Our bodies are reacting to what they see as a constant poisoning by doing what they are supposed to do  trying to make us stop eating something thats bad for us ,7,cdph6p4,1roydh,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,-6

defguysezhuh,When calling  in the United States DeafHardofHearing DHH people have several options links to additional information are included as I go along Video Relay Service VRS amp Video Phones VP  They can use VPs to call  immediately via VRS  Basically the DeafHardofHearing person will dial  over the video phone a certified sign language interpreter will respond first and then dial  is dialed immediately via telephone line in a way conference call deaf person to interpreter to dispatch  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located at home or at a business registered on that account so that when dialing  the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the  dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a timesaver when dealing with emergencies but is also provides clear and direct communication when a DeafHardofHearing person like anyone in an emergency situation may be panicking and would likely stutter with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address  For more information on how VPs amp VRS work you can check out Purple Communicationshttppurpleus or Sorenson Communicationhttpwwwsorensoncom which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA I believe TTYTDD amp Text Relay Services  Just to avoid confusion TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context but have two different names for the same device  Some people know it better by one name over the other so I included both though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out  Moving on its been pointed out that TTYsTDDshttpenwikipediaorgwikiTelecommunicationsdevicesforthedeaf are an outdated technology  For the most part this is true  A DHH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other DHH friendsfamily members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place  However not all DHH people know sign language  As such these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the DHH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that DHH person  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the DHH person as if they were speaking to that person directly  So its the same idea as calling  on a VRS call but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign Captioned Telephones If you still use a landline telephone you can use a CapTelhttpcaptelcom phone which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss usually a HardofHearing person and not a Deaf person  Basically youll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed  Using speech recognition software everything being spoken by the person youre calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone similar to subtitles on a TV with the silent operators ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software  Recently Sprint created a CapTel mobile apphttpwwwsprintcaptelcomwirelesscaptelsprint so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline  Same principle as using the TextVideo Relay Services but you wont have an operator talking for you  Youll be talking for yourself so less delay in  calls Text Messages  This is still in the works  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to  because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if youre a victim of attack and trying to hide eg school shootings muggings home robberies rape etc so this is extremely beneficial not only to DHH but also to hearing people as well  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how Texttohttpwwwfccgovtextto is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up amp running  However as uMastersInDisasters points out SMS as it is defined now is NOT a reliable protocol If possible use voice I hope this information helpsTLDR  We have several options Videophones TTYTDDs Captioned Telephones and Text Messages limited locations only for texts but slowly expandingSource Im a Deaf Social Worker who currently works in the DHH community and Ive been DHH all my life born HardofHearing then it gradually declined as I got older now I consider myself Deaf,14,cdpllpg,1royox,explainlikeimfive,hot,76,62

doctorrobotica,Because corporate profit is more important than civilization   This is an unfortunate game theory problem that motivates these companies  Their primary goal is to generate the most revenue  And this is not new revenue in the sense of companies that produce new products or services but revenue from the same fixed pie WalMart etc are all fighting for the same consumer for the same product   If everyone opened at the same time on Friday the total amount sold would be equivalent However by opening one hour before your competitor you get some of his slice of the pie  And so on until suddenly we dont enjoy Thanksgiving at all and minimum wage staff is made to suffer so the WalMart heirs can by another yachtAnother area this same problem arises is the minimum wage  Almost all serious economists agree that if companies suddenly increased wages disproportionally at the bottom  say raising the minimum to hr  it would greatly benefit the economy  But if your competitor doesnt do it and you do it hurts you in the short term and possibly you go under because your employees make more but dont necessarily spend it at your storeUlitimately of course this attitude will destroy the civilization and infrastructure which is needed to pull profit out but most people arent worried about the long game,3,cdplcfj,1rp0lb,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,-2

tmbstone,Basically due to its shape its easier for a boat to move forwards in the water than for it to move sidewaysThis means that if you point the boat into the wind but at an angle the wind ends up blowing the boat sideways The boat doesnt want to move sideways though so it ends up sliding both sideways and towards the angle its pointed atThis enables you to move forwards and sideways across the wind By changing your angle to the opposite direction every so often you can essentially zigzag your way towards a destination even if its upwindFor more infohttpwwwmaztravelcomarticlessailinghtml,9,cdphtbb,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,54,45

beerMonger,No sailboat can sail directly into the wind But most modern boats can sail at about a  degree angle into the wind Essentially sailboats have  wings on them One in the air and one in the water the centerboard or keel Both of them are very important to making the boat move upwind The sail itself uses lift from the wind going around the sail to pull itself up Think about blowing over a piece of paper The paper will move upwards towards the moving air This is basically how the sail worksThe other wing the keel or centerboard does the same thing only at a  degree angle to the force of the sail You get an apparent motion in line with the length of the boat You mentioned the boats in AC Those are mostly the square sailed kind which basically only went downwind and used different trade winds to get where they wanted to go Here is  video that should get some give some good graphical representations of the physics of ithttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyqwbHIrORMampnoredirect,2,cdpgq16,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,13,11

amartz,I sailed for years when I was younger You cannot sail directly into the wind but depending on the boat you can get pretty damn close Its an application of Bernoullis Principle The way it was usually explained to me is that the sail is like a vertical planes wing The curvature if the sail means that the air on one side has more distance to cover than the air on the other side in the same time This creates sideways lift that pulls the boat into the wind ,0,cdpjwme,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3
SuperStallion,The sails act as an airplane wing does creating a low pressure area on the back side of the sail the relative high pressure area then applies pressure on the sale and tries to push the boat kind of sideways and forward Underneath the water the keel acts as an airplane wing and does not allow the boat to move sideways to the water so it has to move forward The boatis then directed by the rudder  Most boats can travel about  degrees to the actual wind direction high performance boats about  degrees  none can travel straight into itSource avid competitive sailor for around  years in the Great Lakes ,0,cdpkwk3,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

plasticluthier,Ill explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about Three sets of forces are happening while youre sailing a boat   You have the wind pushing on the sail  You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind  The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shapeNow when youre sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry If you squeeze directly from the sides the cherry stone wont go anywhere but if you squeeze from the back the stone will come out of the front Its the same with sailing the wind pushes on the sails the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards Now you cant sail straight into the wind the forces wouldnt balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too So to balance all the forces you zigzag into the wind turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn This is called tacking Now sails are tight in when youre going into the wind completely out when youre going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points generally the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails If you need to know any more Id suggest going sailing I have no idea what AC is ,3,cdpj6al,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,1

koprita,All of the answers so far are ignoring one thing The keel or daggerboard on smaller boats is a board that sticks down into the water underneath the boat right around the middle of the craft that helps prevent the boat from drifting sidewaysThe keel is shaped in such a way that when the wind is blowing you sideways and the keel is resisting this the effect is like squeezing a watermelon seed between your fingers,1,cdplgbq,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,1
OmegaFile,The sail is simply acting like a planes wing,0,cdpn7s5,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
Dirtybirdy,The sail essentially acts like a wing and generates lift based on air traveling  in turbulent flow on one side and laminar flow on the other Just like on a plane wing if air moves faster over one side the pressure will be different on either side and the boat is essentially sucked forward many boats can actually sail faster and more smoothly up wind than downwind This is why boats can sail into the wind even with only one sail The truth of the matter though is that modern computational methods arent advanced enough to theoretically model and calculate turbulent flow too many millions of molecules acting independently in seemingly random directions and the majority of sailing design like Sail shape and curvature is almost entirely empirical Ie Based on peoples personal experience and then fine tuning to obtain slightly better results ,0,cdpnr00,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
SchrodingersDeadKat,You use the power of the wind by zigzaging sideways A part of the force that you feel sideways is transferred against the wind by using the keel that is why you would be going way slower against the wind than with it ,0,cdpoemq,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
notepad,Like ukillavader mentioned the sail acts as a big airfoil lift similair to an aircraft wing is going to be generated and this will act generally about perpendicular to the chord of the airfoil the sail formswith the boat at  degrees to the incomming wind and the sail at about  degrees the lift vector will be approximatley in the direction the hull is facing Like thishttpimgurcomhOJVZOThwZGWOf course there are a lot of other little nuances that will effect the outcome but by and large this is how it works,0,cdpvnws,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

MINTBERRYcrunch,For me I noticed this lung burning happened when I did not properly warm up my lungs to the air intake required during running which is more than when standing still sitting or walking A slow jog before running will raise your heart rate and breathing rate steadily rather than jumping right up to a running pace This will allow for a more controlled and comfortable run letting your body reach its maximum potential the legs tiring in this instance This is why warming up and cooling down is so crucial to a good work out or run,1,cdpjus9,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,hot,9,8
fouzzz,EDIT Totally misread your question but I already typed this all up so Ill leave it for whoever is interestedI thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire OopsIm not an expert but I think youre referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acidAs I understand it when your body cant deliver enough oxygen to your muscles it temporarily forms lactate which helps break down glucose and give you energy However one of the downfalls of this process is that youll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells hence lactic acid Now the whole process doesnt work very well in acidic environments so the whole process is hindered and this is where youll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by overexertion Once your body slows down oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normalTLDR When oxygen is limited your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage ,10,cdphypn,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,hot,15,5

ElectroSpore,There are thousands of error codes in the systems and the OS is translated in many languages Its cheaper to use codes because you can keep adding them all over and not have to send them for translation although some error codes have a common cause others can because caused for various reasons and thus the explanations would be really long numbers are also easier to pass up through the system if something low level failed,4,cdph7ga,1rp63i,explainlikeimfive,hot,43,39

dzzt,As a software developer I would like to get reports from users in the form of specific error codes rather than long sentences of what went wrong It would indeed be less helpful for the enduser to figure out the problem but on my end but with specific error codes I can more easily pinpoint where in the code this error is being produced without asking for a bunch of other details from the user This should lead to easier tracking of bugs so I can release updates that might benefit a good number of other users who are experiencing the bug  error as well,0,cdpiegj,1rp63i,explainlikeimfive,hot,11,11
sirsri,gt Why cant they just SAY Check system timeBecause the line of code that failed doesnt know that the problem is that your system time is wrong  When you do a search for error codes or when you go look at the MS knowledge base youre looking at common causes for an errorBut when you write code you have something like thisIf some condition is true do whatever is supposed to happenIf not throw off an error code that indicated this condition failed  The solution to the problem is to figure out what caused the condition to be wrong in the first place but then maybe its supposed to be wrong some of the time  Software is a series of complex interlocking systems particularly operating systems where you have thousands of programmers who have worked for years  The guy doing a software update is checking to see if time time is valid the guy who wrote the clock software  years ago did so with whatever his assumptions were that time servers would be accessible for example  Enter you trying to update  The programmer who wrote the update only knows how to check that the time is valid or not he has no way to peak into the time keeping code to know that the problem was some time sync failed and that caused his time to be wrong  He just knows the time is wrong and there are a lot of potential reasons for that  ,0,cdpnh34,1rp63i,explainlikeimfive,hot,6,6

computervirologist,Computer viruses fall under the category of malware or malicious software Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs A computer virus is usually an executable file that when executed will usually perform the following tasks  search for other files on the computer if the file is a program copy the viruss code to that program execute a payload which may or may not be destructiveOnce a program gets a viruss code injected into it it becomes an infected program An infected program when executed will run the virus code first before running the original code of the programSince viruses only infect files when theyre executed they rely on user interaction in order to spread Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now Keep in mind though that unless the virus has elevated privileges it can only infect programs that the current user has writeaccess to An antivirus virus is a program that spreads like a virus but when its code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it Think of it like a chain virus antivirus virus original program First the virus code will run then the antivirus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it then the original program will run Antivirus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used Besides viruses there are also computer trojans spyware ransomware backdoors worms and fork bombsTrojans are rogue programs they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else For example many trojan programs ironically claim to be antivirus software but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malwareSpyware is any program that collects users personal data without their knowledge and consent Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user In fact many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom Cryptolocker for example will encrypt the users files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files The password for decryption is stored on the hackers computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down A worm is an autonomous computer virus Unlike computer viruses worms do not require human interaction in order to spread Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading When a worm is running on a computer it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as its host It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers Once it finds a host with vulnerable software the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship Multiple viruses may infect a worm allowing the viruses to be transported across networks Once the worm reaches a destination the viruses copy themselves to that machine too You can think of the viruses as piggyback riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated wormFinally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive requiring a hard reboot If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads the computer will crash every time it is turned on The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system ,1,cdpiayi,1rp7ms,explainlikeimfive,hot,6,5

diMario,Quantum mechanics or more broadly quantum physics studies matter on the level of elementary particles It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of thingsFor instance electric things In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating  Watt  Watt  Watt and so on If Philips were so inclined they could easily make a light bulb rating  watt or  Watt In every day life things happen on a sliding scale A certain property can have a value of  or a value of  or any other value in between  and Not so in quantum physics When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale the properties that you measure take on distinct values For electric current for instance you can measure a flow of  unit of charge per second or you can measure a flow of  units of charge per second but you cannot measure a unit of  charge per secondThis is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either  or  but not one and a halfIn order to describe this phenomenon physicists say that electric charge is quantized from which comes the quantum part of the nameNow as it turns out not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviourOne of the theoretical consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment Ill find that roughly  times the outcome is  and  times the outcome is  But when I perform a single measurement I cannot predict whether the outcome is  or  Weird isnt itQuantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement the property I am about to measure is  and  both at the same time Only after I have measured it the quantum system has decided whether it was  or This means that only after I observe a system the system decides what value it will show me Thus it is said that reality the value of the property is influenced by observation the fact that I measure it,1,cdpij2p,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,hot,11,10
QuigleyQ,I suppose it would be best to start with a brief historyWhat is light Some people such as Newton believed that light was made of tiny particles corpuscles that were fired off by the light source This explains why light goes in a straight line and how it is reflected off surfaces at the same angle But this does not explain how light is refracted through a prism for example Why would some particles bend more than others This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass Still there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe such as diffractionEventually physicists came to support a different theory of light Instead of discrete particles light was a wave Not like a water wave though this wave only moved tranversely like sohttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonscElectromagneticwaveDgif This explained light much better than the particle theory The most striking example is in diffraction Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it a sensor screen some ways behind it and you shine a light onto this contraptionhttpwwwempiricalzealcomwpcontentuploadsdoubleslitboxjpg If light were a particle you should see two bars on the sensor like thishttpstephenwhittfileswordpresscomdoubleslitbulletsjpgw because the particles go through and continue going straight However if light were a wave the sensor would have a more complicated patternhttpgradphysicssunysbeduamarchintgif because the waves interfere with each otherhttpwwwatomunifrankfurtderesearchsynchrotronphotonmoleculeHdoubledoubleslitdoubleslitplanewavegif It turns out when you do this experiment that you get the interference pattern Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light this theory is pretty convincing So its settled light is a wave rightThe challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction When you heat up an object it emits light And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency While these worked well for low frequencies they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones Clearly this is wrong Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities Other properties such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps So are we back to the particle theory again If we are how do we explain the doubleslit experimentLets go back to it again If it is really a particle then why does the interference pattern form Say we place detectors at the slits If light is a wave then itll trigger both If its a particle itll just trigger one When we do this we see that only one is triggered So light is a particle But when you check the screen the interference pattern has disappeared and two stripes show up instead So we take away the detectors and try again Now it reappears If words dont cut it for you watch thishttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonseeWaveparticledualityogvWhen we watch the slits light behaves like particles When we dont it behaves like waves How can we reconcile these two behaviors The answer is light behaves like some very unintuitive thingQuantum physics is the study of how on earth this works This waveparticle duality only seems to show up for small objects think on the scale of atoms Some of the consequences of this include Objects exist in a superpositionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumsuperposition of all possible states weighted towards the more likely ones Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state The more preciselyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenberguncertaintyprinciple you measure the position of an object the less you know about its momentum Occasionally objects can tunnelhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumtunneling across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross You can entanglehttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumentanglement two particles so that measuring one disturbs the other regardless of how far apart they are,0,cdpuf79,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

jguazu,gtBut couldnt you just pretend to be Christian or AtheistThe religious beliefs of the Jews werent what the Nazis despised  it was their ethnic identity A nonpracticing Jew was still a Jew a convert to Christianity was still a Jew It was your ethnicity that youd have to hide and that would be altogether more difficult People in Nazicontrolled areas were rigorously documented and several of the states that Germany invaded already had very thorough civil records which were used by the Germans to quickly identify the Jewish population There was a history of Jewish segregation in Europe anyway so your Jewish identity would be very likely to appear on your paperworkAdd to that the fact that antiSemitism was not a uniquely German thing there were plenty of gentiles across occupied Europe who would have little problem pointing out which families were Jewish in their community Even for those who had no problem with the Jews if a group of SS soldiers turned up in your village and demanded to know who was Jewish you could either lie and risk you and your familys safety or identify them and make things easier for yourselfgt did they just decide to kill everyone in France or PolandFrance no Poland sort of Poland was going to be part of the Third Reichs Lebensraum living space so it was planned to reduce and relocate the native population to make way for German settlementtldr It would be very hard to pretend to be nonJewish because good beaurocracy meant that everyone was documented and Jews generally lived in sectioned off communities Even if you could forge papers and fake it thered be people willingforced to turn you in,0,cdpjgsl,1rpdzf,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

yakusokuN,First of all before answering any of the questions let me emphasize that the things that nonAmericans see are highly atypical and not representative of what happens everywhere  Theres  million or so of us and if you see  people acting crazed thats one person in a million  You arent seeing the vast majority of the other calmer bored tired shoppers who wait patiently in long lines in stores where nothing happens  These things dont make the news  gtIn such videos people always seem to be grabbing items at random Is this true Or do they have specific items in mindIn the videos you see they probably arent grabbing things randomly but theres so many people that its hard to calmly make your way through the crowd and tapping someone on the shoulder and saying pardon me can you pass me one of those  They most likely have items in mind but the craziest people seeking out the best deals are usually after expensive large items like television sets and its difficult to just grab one of the shelf tuck it under your arm and get out of the waygtIf theyre grabbing items at random just because theyre cheap what is the rationale behind that Do people grab and buy lots of things they dont even actually wantThis sometimes happens but its far from the normgtIf people arent grabbing items at random do they decide beforehand Do places like Walmart advertise lets say iPads as  off and then the riots happen because everyone had a premeditated goal to grab that one particular itemOh God does Walmart advertise  I was over at my parents place on Thanksgiving night and within one hour of watching a football game I must have seen  Walmart ads no exaggeration  We get ads in the mail ads in the newspaper and ads on radio and television nonstop for days  Its really impossible not to know that there are stores having deals on Friday  As youve noted yes often stores like Walmart will feature one big item thats normally  marked down to  and a few people every year get zealous about being the person to get it because quantities are usually limited  just enough to get people excited and in the store but not always enough for everyone to buy it who wants itgt Why are sales such a big deal to begin with Sure I like to save money as much as the next guy But mostly I cant be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale I dont mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience  even though I only work parttime and have a low incomeIm not justifying the kind of crazy behavior that makes the news in other parts of the world about us but its not just a little more at least percentage  Some items are marked down  so if you dont get it now you will be paying literally double if you go a week later  In the case of the really expensive things this can mean a few hundred dollars and for many who dont earn much this may mean a lot of hours  If you earn hr  off a tv is half a weeks paygtwhat makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries What inspires all the excitementHonestly companies advertise for weeks the media hypes it up to create a story then reports a story where it happens and makes it seem like its a huge thing and so whats normally less hectic than shopping on Christmas Eve has now become a major deal with huge crowds and chaosDont think the US is unique though  When HampM stores were opening in Europe and other parts of the world there were crowds lined up to the stores  When big name movie stars show up at premieres in London and the like fans line up for hours  Fanaticism isnt localized to the US,38,cdpj66t,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,hot,274,236

Mdcastle,Part of it is Friday is a holiday for most people that dont work in the service industries All the people in suits that normally make news are at home so its a slow news day anyway and since its a holiday people start to go shopping for Christmas The media and the retailers have hyped it up in recent years with say  flat screen TVs marked down to  as doorbusters They lose money but not a lot as they only have  of them per store so people line up the night before and camp out and maybe  people mob the store when it opens hoping to get one and when they dont they still buy other things Theres also a trend among stores to oneup each other by opening earlier than the competition you can probably only get to the doorbuster at the first store of the day so stores are opening earlier and ealier first early morning Friday then midnight Friday and now even Thanksgiving evening which is creating more news stories about how service workers are getting shortchanged as far as spending time with their families Thanksgiving in the US is when everyone comes home to grandmas house to eat dinner ,0,cdpkjs4,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3

twobo,Alcohol is a GABA agonist positive allosteric modulatorThis means it affects certain receptors in your brain that modulate inhibition You brain needs to get excited in order to do things  but it also needs a way to calm down to avoid freaking out in a state of hyperactivity In general GABA accomplishes this We find that certain mental states like anxiety are correlated to different levels of GABA activity More GABA more inhibition less anxiety and also less physical coordination etc Other compounds that act on GABA receptors include the benzodiazepines like Xanax which are used to treat anxiety The effects of alcohol on anxiety tend to come into perceivable effect at lower doses than those that affect physical coordinationBasically alcohol acts on certain receptors in your brain that calm the brain which results in a generalized reduction in anxiety This for many people tends to result in an increase in confidence,27,cdpkxar,1rpis9,explainlikeimfive,hot,197,170

GreenTea,Basically to make you perceive the sound as wider and more realisticStereo sound attempts to recreate the experience of hearing a real band or whatever playing in the room with youyou hear with two ears of course and each of your ears picks up slightly different sounds because they are different distances from the source So your left ear might hear a little more guitar while your right ear hears more keyboardSound mixers try to reproduce that effect by making certain tracks louder in one stereo channel than the other tricking your earsbrain into thinking youre hearing sounds coming from different directions which makes the sound widerEventually people also began using stereo as an effect in itself for example having certain sounds pan quickly from one side to another which isnt particularly realistic but sounds coolTrue it would be easier to mix everything in mono but when your equipment is working properly stereo sounds better to most people ,1,cdpk3nz,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,hot,7,6

systoll,Essentially Stereo sound different sound for each ear exists because we can distinguish which ear a sound is being played in  and we use this information to determine where sounds are coming from Putting everything through both earphones at the same level makes it sound like everythings in the same place right in front of us Its not terrible but not ideal By making different elements louder for one ear and softer in the other producers can create the illusion of different instruments existing in different places around you This sounds more realistic and also makes it easier for you to distinguish and follow particular instruments But others have explained this stuff Im here to demonstrate it Most iPods have an accessibility setting to make both earphones play the same thing On iOS you can find it in Settings gtGeneral gt Accessibility gt Mono Audio Enable it with functional headphones and youll notice a substantial difference It also serves as a fix when one of your earphones breaks Or if you want to use it as intended when you go deaf in one earEDIT Buuut quick question When you say you can only hear select layers of a song does that include having the main vocals getting mostly stripped out of most songs Because thats usually what signals the end of my earbuds and its a different issue entirely ,0,cdplrrp,1rpjnq,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

danpaquette,gt What happens after a company forgets to renew their domain name Once the domain expires it enters a renewal grace period of about  days where the original owner can reclaim it Once that  days is up it enters a redemption period where the domain is frozen for  more days and drops from the zone file The original owner can reclaim or make changes to the domain but the registrar fees at this point are often well into the hundreds of dollars which is easily still worth it if the alternative is losing your businessFor about  to  days it goes through deletion processing where it is dropped from the registry and is available to be registered by the general publicSome registrars will retain their deleted domains to auction them off whether they do it themselves or have an agreement with a third party auction house depends on the registrarMore often than not a domain that had an established website never makes it through deletion processing and is sold off for auction Old domains that had measurable bodies of content users or search volume can be extremely valuable and can sell for many thousands of dollarsWhen its bought at auction the new owner can use the domain as they see fit The vast majority of auctioned domains end up in a portfolio of domains owned by a reseller we call them a squatter They often prompt the original domain owners their competitors and other interested parties to buy the domain well above cost gt Can the person who bought it afterwards negotiate a huge price for the company to get it backThis is legal as long as the domain isnt a registered trademark and they arent trying to actively impersonate the original owners of the domain If there are trademark or legal issues there are avenues people can take to reclaim their domains otherwise theyre out of luck and either have to pay the squatters exorbitant fees or find another domain Ive had companies that drop their domains because no one was monitoring their registrar billing information that were squatted and reoffered to them for tens of thousands of dollars The moral of the story is to always make sure your billing information is uptodate and set your domains to autorenew,15,cdpl9aq,1rpk3n,explainlikeimfive,hot,107,92

Rodorador,When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered third world meaning really that they are underdeveloped by Europeanfirst world standards I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards Now while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so I will not get into this since OPs question was not a moral question The question was about why the north is more developed than the southThe main reason is the fact of colonialism European powers like Holland Spain and Portugal upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the Americas for thousands of years decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations I am not sure how European powers decided to do this but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations If you recall during the renaissance era when colonization was in its beginning stages Columbus had accidentally landed in America in  gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods You can read Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations for more info  Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology enslaved Indigenous miners of gold silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations we move to a period of time called imperialism This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empires benefit In modern day although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call third world countries from developing Structures like the world banks structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing The agriculture subsidy has put out so many countrys agriculture sector out of business even though they would have a comparative advantage ie make crops for cheaper than the usStructural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to third world countries but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector This is bad because these nations dont have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other nonraw resources or technological processes or their human capital  What ends up happening and is happening is that southern countries are still in debt and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt but keeping them in the cycle of debt Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societiesFor more details a good place to start is a documentary called the end of poverty Free on YouTube  ,5,cdprbpd,1rpre0,explainlikeimfive,hot,14,9

SecureThruObscure,Depends Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation The reason is pretty straightforward Your blood and veins act like a radiator system Theyre brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area and then sent off to a different part of the body Is its cold out your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities  It then radiates transmits that heat to the fingers toes etc Typically they lose heat especially in cold weather  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without Its worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia less blood gets to the skinfingers less heat gets lost and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals ,40,cdpmmm6,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,hot,161,121

Shmalpin,Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head abdomen chest etc  In the cold the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities  this manifests as shivering  If cold in the extremities persists the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm functional core temperature    If someone genuinely has bad circulation or a pathological reason that their extremities are very coldsensitive and not an offhand selfmade diagnosis then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities  Individuals with autoimmune disorders like Lupus Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage  This damage leads to less corewarmed blood reaching the extremities  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare    Bad circulation is something that a lot of folks are eager to diagnose themselves with whether or not a true medical cause exists  Similar to people that claim to get migraines when really they suffer from the occasional worse than usual headache More likely than not folks generally  dont have medicalgrade bad circulation,2,cdppuxh,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,hot,11,9

jigokusabre,Reagan is a venerated figure among Republicans because he represents a return to relevance for conservatives in America They had largely been out of the White House ever since the fall and failure of Herbert Hoovers presidency The only two elected Republican presidents were Eisenhower who had the whole War Hero thing going for him and Nixon who benefited from a split Democratic vote in  and a terrible democratic campaign in  Reagan is also credited as the president who brought down Communism The fall of the USSR and the related collapses of Soviet supported states is the largest US victory that weve had since WWII Whether or not Reagans policies actually brought about this change more quickly than anyone elses is a debatable matter but serving presidents get more credit than they deserve when things go well and more blame than they deserve when things go wrongHis successful presidency also redeemed the disgrace of the Nixon administration in the minds of many conservatives ,185,cdpnzsh,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,hot,776,591

mookie,Ok let me try to give you the perspective that me and my friends have as  year old college students who talk about politics regularly and Reagan frequently comes up All of us even the Democrats agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they cant really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president but heres what we think The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market massive outsourcing looser economic restrictions and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power for the time at least but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on Americas social mobility He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like welfare queens and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes Also his Trickledown economics which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work due to failures in modern day Canada Bush  and Bush  its clear Trickledown doesnt work as well as thought Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didnt attribute to him but instead blamed on new technology because of his cult of personality So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems which are even today causing us problems ie outsourcing and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology which had little if anything to do with Reagan and military spendingtldr I dont like Reagan,7,cdpvyi5,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,hot,11,4

Drew,You say that Reagan is held to be one of the best US presidents but who believes this  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagans accomplishments  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans  In any case even if he were held to be an amazing president the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the s while being himself young and vigorous having an attractive wife and young children the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelts and that had been nearly  years before JFK and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights the Peace Corps nuclear disarmament and so forth  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful attractive witty and energetic  But Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president No civil rights laws and so forth  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in peoples memories  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process in a way Reagans reputation developed somewhat similarly though not quite in the same way as Kennedys  After all Reagan did not die in office but he was very good on TV witty pleasant easygoing like JFK and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits and Reagans children from his two marriages he had been divorced and remarried were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets  But he was a nice guy had a good sense of humor and his appeal on TV always benefitted him  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal no matter what their abilities really are And Reagan was not a bright man  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with and that America could do no harm  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do  As for his actual policies as president he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union He had come late in his presidency to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing But this was very much different from the rest of Reagans foreign policy   Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive as Kennedys had been as well with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in   Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly  He is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents efforts as from Reagans and it resulted at least as much from the USSRs own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures arguably more from internal problems than from what the US did  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble  But the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually fell during the presidency of Reagans successor GHW Bush  Maybe he should get all the credit  Of course that would be silly too but crediting Reagan is just as illogical  What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy like JFK who made them feel good that he stood up to the Soviets but so had Truman Eisenhower JFK and other presidents often much more dramatically and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the s  So Americans felt better in the s  Was this Reagans doing  Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy and other factors  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today  he began the year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others  This legacy was one of Reagans worst and we are still suffering because of it  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the s and most Americans dont understand very well the economic changes of the last  years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the s This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top  Reagan was also very antiunion his firing of air traffic controllers accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor whatever you might think of unions in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time  Reagan was also a strongly antienvironmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws  On popular issues like these Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS those who got the disease were most often leftie homosexuals which Republicans did not care about or to improve the medical system in any way  In fact Reagans social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president  In short  our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre  But neither is ranked among the top presidents The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and instead they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people was reviving the economy was a patriot on foreign policy  These claims are inaccurate but the average American does not read much Im afraid or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they feel about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan he was reelected in  of course or buy most of the claims made in his favor and in the last years of his presidency Reagans popularity was dropping  This was partly due to his involvement in the IranContra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagans impeachment but didnt He somehow survived to the end of his term and he got Alzheimers fairly soon after leaving the White House he was already very old and people generally liked him so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him  The public simply choose not to care  But the facts are there nevertheless  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past had been divorced and lied a little about his accomplishments but was very charming and told good stories so people liked him anyway Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them  Abraham Lincoln often ranked as the best president today was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good  Popular views are shaped by emotion sentiment misunderstandings a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues and faulty memories  Truman was widely disparaged as president then there was a Truman Revival in the s after wed had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher I think due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were  In any case I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president  Its the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy  Heck I liked him but I hated his policies and still do ,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4

DrMerkwurdigliebe,Thanks for asking a great ELI question We need more of these around hereThe difference lies in where power is at least in theory concentrated In a unitary system all power and legislative authority rest with the national government This means that the national government is the only one allowed to make new laws and that it makes laws for the entire country The UK operates under a unitary system A unitary system allows for broad application of national policies and standardizes government services across regionsA federal system splits up power between the national government and regional governments The US is an example of a federal system the national government has the power to do certain things like raise an army and regulate interstate trade and the states have the power to do other things like run schools and build roads This allows different states to pass different laws based on what works best for them It also limits the power of the national governmentThere is actually a third government type that goes along with federal and unitary systems confederations Confederations are on the opposite end of the spectrum from unitary governments In a confederation the nation is divided into regions or states like in a federation however rather than the regional and national governments being in a balance the regional governments hold the vast majority of the power the opposite of a unitary system This means that most laws are tailored to local interests which is good however problems can arise when a confederacy needs to act together as a single nation like in wartime since the national government is too weak to act effectively,0,cdpq1px,1rpza1,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

Momotsuki,Assuming youre talking about being stabbedshot in an area that is not your brainYou will start losing blood The decrease in blood volume will translate to a decrease in blood pressure Your baroreceptors will detect this change in blood pressure and activate your sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate and contractility of the heart to increase cardiac output and thus get more blood outThe most important organ in your body is your brain and your body will do anything in its power to protect it It will cause vasoconstriction of the vessels that supply the periphery fingers toes arms legsYour kidneys will have less blood going to them due to you having less blood over all so it will start to fail less urine output Your gut and your liver will also have less blood flowing to themYou will eventually get to the point where there is insufficient blood pressure to perfuse the brain and you will start to get drowsy Your brain will try to minimise brain activity to reduce O and energy demands to prevent damage to neurons You will lose consciousness Insufficient blood flow to the brainstem may cause you to have an irregular breathing pattern as it modulates your respiratory rate Insufficient blood flow to the coronary arteries may cause areas of hypoxia in your cardiac tissue This may lead to rhythm disturbances which then further decreases the amount of blood that is pumped out of your heart This may then lead to asystole flat line,0,cdpz4sb,1rq8wt,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1

wreckeditralph,I will give this my best shot  I am by no means an expert but I did a little research when I was looking into water filters    When you pass a substance through a charcoal filter a decent number of impurities will chemically attach to the charcoal and become trapped This is another thing that makes charcoal attractive as a filter medium it attracts a lot of the undesirable impurities while leaving everything else aloneCharcoal is also very porous which helps give it a LOT of surface area  This means that charcoal also has lots of areas for the chemical impurities to attach,0,cdpr1dd,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3
jackrex,Actually in most cases we use activated charcoal  which is charcoal treated with oxygen Due to this the molecular distance between the carbon atoms is increased thus effectively increasing the molecular surface area  ie it becomes more porousThis increases adsorption of various liquid and gaseous impurities httpenwikipediaorgwikiAdsorptionIn simpler terms due to adsorption  impurities are trapped in between the carbon atomsAfter a certain period of time all the intermolecular spaces are occupied by impurities and the filter will not adsorp any more This is when you need to change the filter,0,cdpratw,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

spockatron,charcoal has an absolutely huge number of small pores a few grams of charcoal has hundreds of square meters of surface area for the filtrate to flow over and then bind with the carboneventually the carbon runs out of binding sites and is exhausted meaning you need a new filter,0,cdprmll,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
soIsaystomabel,Ok what people are missing about why activated charcoal actually absorbs things yes the pores are important but not the only reason is that charcoal is made up of many carbon atoms bonded together The surface of this carbon material has many sites of positive charge When it is activated by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral positive and negative charge In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to removing it from the liquidIt can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid depending on the density of the carbon used as it will have a different density than the waterThe reason it is used is because it is cheap and doesnt require much energy to actually process the water You basically mix them let it settle,0,cdptzuz,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,hot,1,1
AtomicSans,The main difference is processing powerAn animated movie a Pixar movie for example is prerendered on massive arrays of computers called render farms The calculations needed take large amounts of time to finish and if I remember correctly a tensecond scene of an animated movie takes somewhere close to half an hour to fully render This explains why special effects look so good However after the movie is rendered it is turned into a video file which is simply a series of still pictures played rapidly so that it appears to move Oversimplified If you want to know how video compression works theres lots of explanations out there for you to look at Playing this video isnt hard to do which is why a DVD or BluRay player which isnt very computationally powerful is able to play such goodlooking moviesGames are quite different Instead of being rendered already for you your consolePC has to perform all the texture lighting polygon shader etc calculations and rendering on its own Also unlike movie render farms these calculations have to be done nearinstantaneously to keep up with your controllermouse and keyboard inputs To account for this game developers are forced to make game elements easy and fast to calculateTLDR Graphics in games and movies are visual effects that are created rendered Movies are prerendered using tons of processing power games are rendered onthefly with your desktop machine Thanks uMichelloDSlothIf anyone wants to simplify this feel free I may have accidentally used too much technical terminology for ELIEDITED formatting n redundancies,1,cdprq7q,1rq9i1,explainlikeimfive,hot,10,9

TimeTravellerSmith,Because they know that they can charge a premium for storage options since you cant add your own  Less so because the actual type of storage that they use doesnt scale in price the same way that SDs do  So just because a GB SD is  and GB is  doesnt mean that the flash storage they use is  for GB and  for GBYou also see this in build to order options when you can add your own RAM and HDD  Most companies charge a lot more than what it would cost to do it yourself  They do it because they know people who dont know any better or how to do it themselves will pay a lot for it rather than figure out how to do it themselves,0,cdpu3c4,1rqj78,explainlikeimfive,hot,4,4

soIsaystomabel,Ok so I did a lot of H NMR work during my undergrad but it has been a while The nuclei of all atoms have specific properties given their specific make up this includes isotopes of individual atoms When you put atomic nuclei in a magnetic field they can absorb and reemit radiation of specific wavelengths frequency The wavelength of the radiation they can absorb is determined by the strength of the magnetic field they are in and the magnetic properties of the nuclei themselvesSo NMR spectroscopy works by putting nuclei in a magnetic field of known strength and hit it with radiation of a known wavelength You then measure the emission of any radiation from the nuclei When it is detected you have the magnetic field strength and the wavelength of radiation absorbed and emitted so you are able to determine the magnetic properties of the nuclei Which tells us which nuclei or nuclei group for the case of complex molecules is presentEdit Sometimes I find formula helpful this isnt actually a mathematical formula just a relationship between the information basically N Nuclei specific magnetic properties W wavelength of the radiation absorbedemitted and M strength of the magnetic fieldN  M  W  so if you can measureknow any two terms you can determine the rd,0,cdpuaxb,1rqjpn,explainlikeimfive,hot,2,2

tibbytime,This is debatably not an ELI topic but Ill humor itRap has pretty hard to figure origins Black culture has never been as well preserved or documented as white culture so a lot of old stuff is lost There are some roots going all the way back to Africa with rhythmic and rhyming storytelling over drum beats Its hard to say if this REALLY filtered into the modern genre or not but it probably influenced slaves who influenced the first free blacks who influenced ragtime and then jazz When you get to the jazz generation you get a lot of Harlem Renaissance poets who started performing poetry over jazz This didnt directly turn into hiphop either but it created a kind of precedent that may have directly or indirectly influenced people who would later make hiphop The same can be said of funk in the s a lot of people would even argue that a few select funk albums might be the earliest rap albums particularly Here Comes the JudgeMost of what we now call rap was born in the s DJs spinning dance albums particularly funk and some dub would rap over these records usually improvisationally to toast someone in celebration or for comedy Particularly in New York DJs became sort of competitive about this making more complex and stylized rhymes and trying to elevate the game Eventually you started getting people writing original lyrics to match with older beats and even further down the road you got people who started recording their stuffAfter that the rest is pretty easy to figure out,0,cdpv1ia,1rqjy6,explainlikeimfive,hot,3,3
