ca,I just attended a book discussion at my local UU church that touched on some of your questions The book under discussion was Mans Search for Meaning by FrankelI think what I took away from that discussion  was the meaning not the purpose of life thats a different question One group member said the purpose was strictly biological as in reproduction of life is making meaning of lifeOr the meaning of your life is to make something meaningful of your lifeFrankel a psychiatrist and neurologist who survived the German concentration camps thought that the meaning of his life was in helping others find meaning in theirs and he developed a psychoteraputic tool he called Logotherapy He noted that those who lost hope or a vision of the future were more likely to succumb to the rigors of concentration camp lifeMy feeling is that I wont live happilyeverafter in some gilded heaven or unhappilyeverafter in a torturous hell so I only have this brief time to enjoy this amazing live I have and to help others enjoy theirs True my impacts wont last generations actually my kids and my work may last a while be recorded in history books or change the world in major ways but that doesnt bother me at all or make my tasks feel less important It just makes me want to make more efforts so my impacts can be felt here and nowI get my primary fulfillment from my very small family Many are not so fortunate to have that I try to focus on relationship and community I also found fulfilling work that makes a real difference in other peoples lives nursing and a fulfilling hobby that does this as well running a community garden teaching others to do so and then and donating to the food bank I think if you cant heal or feed one hundred just try to heal or feed one Even when healing wont happen I can help ease the loss in a kind and professional way I use the garden to allow others to contribute too So best wishes to you I recommend finding something that fills you up and that you can share with others Relationship and community,0,cdkw7sc,1r92wd,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

SekretOne, How did you deal with the realization that quite nearly all youve believed was if you were not born to atheist parents falseYou feel betrayed and I do not think that is an inappropriate feeling But there two ways you can approach learning in fear an embarrassment believing that each lesson just highlights your ignorance or as a celebration a thrill that there is something that you never even conceived ofThe old world is shattered True It was familiar with clear edges simple rules  that didnt work and hatreds that didnt make sense The world turns out to be a lot bigger with a lot more properties than the little one And the rules all seem to be a bit more nerdy  less gays are all evil and more matter cannot be created or destroyed Seems a bit fairer though dont it  How did you deal with this sense of insignificanceI am a small man I will never eat all the food in the world Does that make eating inconsequential Do I not taste if I dont taste everythingIt is less scary when you get over the shock of not being in the center of the universe and instead be part of the universePersonally I cant see anything making me feel more insignificant than being created solely to acknowledge something else Particularly when that something is insists on testing me when it already knows the answer and baulks if I test it when I dont know the idea that everything needs a beginning and an end I wonder how baffled earlier mankind still applied beginning and end to the surface of the Earth and found out it was a sphere That Earth didnt really have edges The answer may be in the scope of a question we havent even asked But we can find answers and thats exciting But you can only find answers if you ask questions and dont assume youre rightThe most harmful thing Christianity does is it instills this notion that everything you need to know is between the pages It pretends that all that is unknown is unknowable Yet we keep figuring stuff outIts startling to have the familiar fall away and see what appears to be an huge unbound expanse But trust me that confusing but cozy place is nothing nothing compared to whats actually out there Its not a void Its filled with people strange plants weird food music reverberating on strings vocal cords drums and GUI displays an internet that can freaking connect you to people on the other side of the world in a fraction of a second moons in a perpetual state of falling bacteria living without oxygen butted up against volcanic vents blue whales a genetic marker named after Sonic the HedgeHog cartoons robotic limbs and corgis,0,cdkvt7o,1r92wd,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

astrodog,Everyone hang on lets not get too excited here This doesnt appear to be as big a deal as it seemsgt socalled parish exemption which allows religious ministers to avoid paying taxes on the value of their housing granted to them by their religious employers violates the establishment clause of the US Constitution and must be discontinuedSo this ruling really only applies to employees of the church who receive housing That must now be claimed on taxes As far as I can tell this doesnt mean anything for collections donations or actual houses of worship It might set a precedent but even as it standsgt the ruling right now is on hold until the appeals process is completeWho knows how long itll actually be before we see any tangible progress,66,cdkzuax,1r99hi,atheism,top_week,361.0,295

bigdamhero,Just to clear things up for those commenting who have obviously read no more than the title and perhaps the first few lines of the article the court enjoined the IRS from enforcing  USC  and does nothing to  What this means is that if the decision is not reversed on appeal the IRS is barred from granting a tax exemption on extra income provided to a minister specifically apportioned for the paying of a ministers rent or mortgage  which was untouched still allows a church to purchase a home and allow the minister to live rent free without reporting the market value of such  rental as part of his taxable income This wont greatly effect most smaller older or more rural churches as historically these churches save money on minister salary by paying less and providing a living arrangement by way of a parsonage often gifted to the church or bought by the church long ago rendering it a free addition for he church to make Instead what the removal of  does is to prevent a minister from being able to hide any amount of income that they are able to show was spent on living arrangement which is far more common among the larger churches which get proportionately more wasteful with increased size and grant ministers unreasonably high sums for their homes essentially allowing the Revruns and TD Jakes of the world to live lavish lifestyles while reported relatively little On first reading the headline I was concerned for my father who is a minister however upon further reading I realize that neither he nor any lower income minister I have ever met would be greatly effected by this decision ,0,cdkzh5p,1r99hi,atheism,top_week,12.0,12

postoergopostum,The last line of the review on Amazon readsReaders will find that over the past twenty years the case for the historical trustworthiness of the Gospels has grown vastly strongerIt is generally considered among scholars poor form to write your own blurbThis quote from the blurb of The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man by Robert M PricehttpwwwamazoncomIncredibleShrinkingSonManTraditiondpreflaBJPBXSsbooksampieUTFampqidampsr provides an interesting contrastFor more than a century scholars have been examining the Gospels and other traditions about the life of Jesus to determine their historical accuracy Although the results of these scholarly efforts are sometimes controversial the consensus among researchers today is that the four Evangelists accounts cannot be taken at face value In fact a team of more than  scholars called the Jesus Seminar has come to the conclusion that on average only about  percent of the four Gospels is historically accurateThere are two points worthy of note   Firstly if you check the link to Amazon youll note that Price being a serious scholar uses quotes from published reviews of his books to provide the text for his blurbs This one is from Freethinker magazine  And secondly that there is another very scholarly and respected perspective on these issues that is somewhat at odds with the views expressed by apologists such as William Laine Craig Dinesh De Souza and of course the very calm and balanced Craig L BlombergNow its not my place to tell you what you should think or what conclusions you should draw on this issue Likewise I dont think you can be fully informed on a given subject until youve got an accurate and sound understanding of both sides of the issueBlomberg is as good an author as any to give you a grounding in the subject as it is presented by the modern school of evangelical apologists Note though that many scholars who are also Christian disagreeThe above link is as good a place as any to get all you need to know of the other perspectiveAnyone who read both of those books would be in a sufficiently informed position to consider the matter and draw their own conclusionsIve included a link below to a Robert M Price youtube video because he should always be read as he speaks Ive also linked to a few Amazon pages for authors who have written well on the subjectRobert M Price at Skepticon part  on youtubehttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvgouJmYtDoRobert M Price at AmazonhttpwwwamazoncomRobertMPriceeBJPBXSrefsrtcqidampsrentRichard Carrier at AmazonhttpwwwamazoncomRichardCarriereBKLYEMrefnttautsimBart D Ehrman at AmazonhttpwwwamazoncomBartDEhrmaneBIRRGrefnttautsim,1,cdkztk5,1r9m68,atheism,top_week,4.0,3

NuclearShadow,Many people believe that morality comes from religion   Its a common trap theists try to use  however is not only easily countered by  our understand of morality  through science on how and why it came to be but  since many theists do not believe in evolution I like to counter it another wayWhat people perceive as good and evil changes person to person   Which shows it is largely a culture  and somewhat of a personal opinionThink of a few religions and then look at how drastically they can view certain issues differently    A modern Christian for example would likely see Mesoamerican  mass human sacrifices to be  immoral  yet obviously the other side of the fence would see it as a good and moral act     But it gets worse for theists as even people of the same faith will often disagree on atleast minor issues  and at times even major issues    The topic of homosexual rights for example  you can find that Christians can have a polar opposite opinion on this subject   Some still think homosexuals should be killed  and they believe this to be the moral thing  Others will can be completely for homosexual rights and be supportive of the LGBT community and have nothing but love for such people Now if religion was the basis of morality this would not happen  especially in the case of those that practice the same religion,1,cdl1ugg,1r9ugf,atheism,top_week,2.0,1

MartinTheRound,Im not sure what you mean by looking for signs and answers Are you trying to have faith and find justification or are you looking for the truth out there If you are looking for faith your quest is completely different you will need to find something to reassure you to feel the spiritual connection In this case I personally suggest something along the lines of being spiritual that is to say just believe that there is a higher power and dont buy into any specific religion search for the good parts of religions If youre looking for the truth on the other hand you need to ask yourself are you ready to find that there is in fact no higher power and the gods people believe in are just manifestations of psychologyAs for damning people to hell for not believing its one of the glaring problems with christianity Think of if this way if there were a loving god hesheittheythem would not condemn people for silly stuff surely But from a critical perspective consider that the jewish faith and the old testament has no concept of heaven or hell And if you read the bible carefully youll find that nothing jesus said mentions heaven specifically Jesus spoke of the kingdom of god on earth and the resurrection of corporeal bodies when the time comes And people are still waiting Also consider that there is no single interpretation of pretty much anything in the bible Or it can be seen that way consider the christians that kill in the name of god despite thou shalt not kill is a commandment from god Also consider that there are countless churches and denominations so being right is out of the question or at least practically out of the question Since if a truth could be found and presented it would not make sense to fracture churchesYou dont need a church or a doctrine to be spiritual And you dont need to have faith in a higher power or spirituality to be good or happy And if youre looking for the truth you might get surprised be ready What do you seek precisely WhyBut I wish you happy seeking And feel free to ask Im on reddit for a short time but there are plenty of people here to give you plenty of points of view vast majority in a welcoming manner,0,cdlhb0q,1ralx0,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

DinoDude,Apparently he needed to feel like everything was designed perfectly in mind for him in order for him to appreciate it Ultimately its an argument as Richard Dawkins put it from Personal Incredulity  I cannot accept that you can love without thinking things are designed therefore there is a designer He interweaves this rather skillfully befitting to his profession with some some glaring nonsequiturs and errors of fact for example personalities and appearance arent random  theyre caused by an easily understood sequence of events occurring in childhood and gene expression respectively Lewis then blindly asserts that it is irrational for music to be pleasurable without having any knowledge himself on what scientific reasons there might be for music existing within cultures in the first place so once again we see argumentum ad ignorantium Furthermore he commits a nonsequitur by implying that because it is irrational you therefore cannot explain it by chance alone  what a load of nonsense Even if my love for ska music and kittens is inexplicable to me that doesnt mean I cant appreciate them or that my feelings for them arent real He makes an assertion there that really amounts to little more than ignorant opinion Theres also a broad implied false dichotomy here along the lines of science without God  total chaos God  order when all the scientific principles we know of operate interact and originate all the same whether or not Gods mentioned in the mix As Laplace famously said I had no need of that hypothesis Essentially what Lewis says here is an artfully crafted carefully written beautifully expressed pile of ignorant horseshit ,0,cdlljhc,1raqhm,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

Xylemicarious,Moral objectivism The idea that morality is not subjective or a matter of opinion It is true or false and not subject to human feelings or customs Usually the source of said morality is god but philosophies like Utilitarianism could fit in here as well It stands in contrast with moral relativismMoral absolutism The idea that some actions are immoral no matter the consequences or motive This is often religiously based as well but you could be for example a strict practitioner of nonviolence and think that violence was wrong even in selfdefense Absolutism stands in contrast with consequentialism which says that an actions morality depends largely on its context and its consequencesAnyway theyre often overlapping but different Most atheists wouldnt consider themselves to be either though especially the former,0,cdlcuey,1rava8,atheism,top_week,2.0,2
postoergopostum,Ive been thinking about a new approach to arguments about morality Any thoughts and comments would be greatly appreciatedOne of the foundations of just about all religious doctrine is a moral code Further most of these doctrines are structured such that these rules are generally raised to a higher status than mere human rules and are regarded by the flock as being far more important and carrying more weight than civil lawsThis is then used as leverage to try and force all of society to conform with their individual ideology Think of Sharia in the UK or gay marriage in The USApologists also use our own internal sense of right and wrong as an evidence for God By claiming that the ideas we hold on the subject of how we should behave are not things that we have been taught or even conclusions weve reached on our own the assertion is made that this moral law is a feature of The Universe and it was put there by GodTo make matters worse there is the popular troll that those of us without faith are in some way morally compromisedTo date we heathen have tried to construct scientific or philosophical justifications for a moral code or sense that is independent as it must be of a non existent deityBut what exactly is meant by the term moralityLike spiritual and so many other popular terms of faith including faith the wordmorality is a slave to equivocation Part of the way religious belief is kept unfalsifiable is by using a wide variety key terms ambiguously If the things you say about your beliefs are confusing and difficult to pin down let alone understand then its much more difficult for that belief to be shown as falseWords like morality are too loaded We dont need them and by using them we are giving too much groundAs Hitch used to point out those who are psychopathic or sociopathic seem to exist without any genuine idea of morality and right or wrong So morality as such is not available to everyoneInstead lets talk about behaviourHow human beings behave towards each other is something we can test and measure There is already a wealth of data and it feeds in directly to ideas like Harris thoughts on well being and human flourishingWe already call the subject Ethics It is the scientific study of human social behaviour We even know where it comes from Surprisingly most social conditioning formerly moral instruction is carried out by our siblings and peers right from the very beginning of childhood Fairness is understood the day after we first manage to crawl to the toy box under our own steamTLDRSo my position is to put it succinctlyThere is no such thing as morality Its a term of ecquivocation and only serves to cloud the real issue How should we humans behave towards each other so that we maximise human well being and flourishing,0,cdlepxw,1rava8,atheism,top_week,1.0,1
Logomac,Objective morality would be moral truths that exist outside of an individual frame of reference and can be objectively measured Absolute morality would be moral truths that remain true regardless of individual situationsTo say that it is inherently wrong to harm someone against their will and this quality of moral wrongness is independent of any participating agents is to make a claim for objective morality To say is is wrong to harm someone period whether it be against their will or not regardless of the situation is to make a claim for absolute morality,0,cdlf1gg,1rava8,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

CesarV,I am always polite to them when I see them but ask them a few questions that no Mormon has ever been able to adequately answer  For instance How do you explain the fact that DNA evidence contradicts the historical narrative in the Book of Mormon  Why is steel mentioned in the BOM but not only has no steel been found that was made by natives in NorthCentralSouth America but no evidence that they had the technology to produce steel  Why are horses and barley mentioned but both were not present or used by natives  Why is it that modern linguistics has demonstrated no connection at all with native languages and the middle east  If you believe in the small population theory why is it that in the BOM there are battles with hundreds of thousands of people killed yet no evidence of these battles   Nine times out of ten they smile nod listen and then ask me to check their website or come to the temple for a chat with an elder  I then tell them that I have already done this and no solid answers  Then comes the canned faith answersGod can do anything evidence is irrelevant when you have faith God communicates with us and proves himself this way without the need of evidence etc   Its to the point now that its getting boring,2,cdltm6x,1rc7k9,atheism,top_week,9.0,7

youllforgetme,I was a late convert to Mormonism at  I took to it for a few years after my parents converted I left eventually because I could not stop questioning the doctrine I have to say though during my time with them a nicer bunch of people you would be hard pressed to meet No one in the church gets paid for any work they do and  of money given as charity is used for charityLike all places there are a few people that were what I call Sunday Christians but I would say in my area they where in the minorityAs for the missionaries it is crazy what those kids go through mentally I became friends with missioners as we where around the same age and when one went home she was institutionalized She could not leave her room for weeks without another person They live  with another person of the same sex for  to  months so it must be hard being a missionary  So nowadays when I come across them I offer them a lift if they need it I speak to them nicely although I may at times really push them with theological questions they never react with anger or scorn and they have never said I would go to hell for not believing like my own brother who is a Evangelical church member said  to me one dayYes these kids know nothing about the real world but they do try and live there beliefs everyday which can rarely be said about a lot of religious peopleI might also add never has a Mormon called for the death of another for not believing ,3,cdlunjg,1rc7k9,atheism,top_week,5.0,2

monedula,A careful look at the list of prophesies you refer to quickly shows how nonsensical they are Messiah would be born of a woman Big deal How many men are not Messiah would be born in Bethlehem This is not what the prophecy says it says that he would be born to the clan of Bethlehem  Messiah would be born of a virgin If you read the prophecy in context it is clear that this prophecy has nothing at all to do with Jesus but is referring to the Assyrian invasion centuries earlier And in any case the original Hebrew says young woman  not virgin Messiah would come from the line of Abraham In other words he would be a Jew Big deal and  Matthew and Luke give wildly different lines of descent inspiring no confidence at all in their reliability Furthermore they are male lines of descent And Jesus father was supposed to be God  on which basis he was not a maleline descendant of Isaac etc The whole thing is a complete muddle Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah This contradicts the Micah prophecy that he would come from the tribe of Bethlehem Messiah would be heir to King Davids throne Jesus was never the king of anything All we get is a repeated prophecy that he will be one day Messiahs throne will be anointed and eternal Were still waiting Messiah would be called Immanuel He was called Jesus See also point  Messiah would spend a season in Egypt If you read this in context it isnt even a prophecy And according to Luke he didnt go to EgyptAnd so and so on and so on Its walltowall nonsense,1,cdls5uh,1rc9vr,atheism,top_week,10.0,9

imanoob,gt The only reason we even consider the possibility of a god is because some guys wrote stories about nonsense because they did not know scienceNo There are deities in all human cultures We are natural worshippers and followers We worship and follow leaders things desires Thats what lead some guys to write stories not the other way aroundOf course that does not mean those guys were right about anything It just tells us something about ourselvesgt I am completely sure there is in fact no god I can not prove that one doesnt exist but I cant prove the nonexistence of somethingHow can you be completely sure of something you cant even begin to understandSure once you give a deity traces and stories you can begin to criticize and think rationally about it You can have arguments for the Christian god Zeus Ra but any god Howgt One reason is because of evolution another is abiogenesis another is big bangNone of them are arguments against any godgt Seriously Im not buying the claim that some personal omnipotent mind was bored and created it all I also dont buy that But I cant know I do believe however based on my previous experiences that no god exists But this is a hunch a belief I could be entirely wrong How could I possibly knowgt I dont care if its wrong to say because I cant be completely sure I am certain that god doesnt existYou are beginning to understand what faith is,1,cdlyxci,1rcjy9,atheism,top_week,2.0,1
Xylemicarious,Depends on the god as usual I tend to be a strong atheist about all the gods that are directly contradicted by large amounts of evidence as opposed to the ones who arent supported by any evidence which is all of them Still the set of gods is infinite so I cant rule them all out Im even making an assumption when I rule out some of them that assumption being that I am here typing a comment and this is reality which is supported by lots of evidence but you never know I could be dreaming this or I could be someone elses dream Anyway long story short I dont think its taboo I just think gnostic atheists have a hard time being selfconsistent with the way we actually know or dont know things about the world Science only gives degrees of confidence But hey your life your thoughts whatever,0,cdlzlmn,1rcjy9,atheism,top_week,1.0,1
BuccaneerRex,The nature of epistemology does not allow certainty on some types of claims But the lack of certainty is not a vote for belief in the claim An agnostic atheist simply acknowledges the lack of certainty Some people like to denigrate that as fence sitting or holding out but its really not It is just admitting that the concept of a deity is not one that can ever really be proven or not because of the nature of the claim not because of a failure of knowledge or scienceTheist hypotheses are to paraphrase Wolfgang Pauli Not even wrong They cant be scientifically proven or disproven because theyre not science The supernatural is an oxymoron If something has an effect in the universe it can be studied scientifically If something does not have an effect within the universe it cant be said to existWhat this leads to is the conception of a deity being goalpostshifted until deity is simply defined as the universe itself at which point youve just made the deity irrelevant as an entity within your hypothesis I cant say with perfect certainty that no deity exists anywhere But not because I expect one to be hiding somewhere in the universe its because I dont make any claims regarding a deity I can say that any theist claims Ive ever heard of are ruled out by the nature of reality as exposed through scientific investigation and that I do not accept any theist hypothesis as an explanation for the observed phenomena around me By holding this stance I am not making any claims and therefore leave no rhetorical cracks to get an argument into The burden of proof remains completely on the side of the theist and thanks to Hitchens Razor I can reject claims without evidence without needing any more justificationThe strong or gnostic atheist position strikes me as a doth protest too much assertion It is like including And we have ruled out Leprechauns explicitly as the mechanism for this phenomenon in a scientific paper,1,cdm01w9,1rcjy9,atheism,top_week,2.0,1

BdrLen,Because many atheists feel that admitting that they are entirely sure that God does not exist will shift the burden of proof to them from theistsMany will argue that it is not possible to know or for anyone to know if God truly exits or not This is a valid philosophical positionTaking the same line of reasoning to its logical conclusion it can be said that one cannot know anything with certainty While as I say this is a viable philosophical position I do not find it a particularly useful one,0,cdmzu2v,1rcjy9,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

Iceborg,Well if you look at the wiki for Gnosticism you see the main themes Gnosticism is basically an ancient set of religious ideals or philosophies  The notion of a remote supreme monadic divinity The introduction of a distinct creator god or demiurge The estimation of the world owing to the above as flawed or a production of error but possibly good as its constituent material might allow The explanation of this state through the use of a complex mythologicalcosmological drama in which a divine element falls into the material realm and lodges itself within certain human beingsI would suggest that anyone who understands the description of having gnostic ideals when referring to their beliefs means that you potentially submit to some abstracted form of TheismDeism and are therefore not an Atheist Source not just the wiki I used to live with a PhilosophyReligion student who spent ages trying to explain Gnosticism to me when I was a Christian,1,cdly62t,1rcjy9,atheism,top_week,1.0,0

rileysill,The beauty of atheism and theism is that still to do this and as far as our rational minds can forecast nobody truly knows anything Science which is the atheist foundation and backbone for intellectual support when used to counter religion is only an observation through our perception of our natural and biological surroundings It is in a constant state of evolution through observation and realization of the outside world Religion or theism is internal self assessment and processes to better yourself and grow your consciousness and guide you through life situations to help create a higher potential for a sensible moral amp rational ideology Nothing more than a tool to guide us through times good and the bad Forget religions different conceptual views remove yourself from the stigmas of afterlife and reincarnation and evil vs good And judgement days That Is all symbolism for certain instances that could potentially occur in everyday life that is what most atheists dont seem to understand Atheism Is founded upon the opposition of a radical amp extremist interpretation that paints a literal picture of what is meant to be symbolical Atheism is an uneducated assessment of an off the mark attempt to interpret holy texts in a literal sense No you are not a bad person no its not bad to laugh nor tell your family you are unbelieving in their religion You just have developed a different conceptual model of the way things are for your journey in life In the end should there be a tyrannical ruling god of salvation who is to judge us at pearly gates If you live your life to the fullest and be the best person you could be Whether you read this book or that book Would it matter at all No Hope that gives a different non bias ideology I have been in your shoes before Rational thoughts that are removed from emotion will guide you to a justifiable outcome  ,0,cdm5g67,1rdclj,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

HermesTheMessenger,My personal focus is on mythology so if you are looking for a classic on myth get The Golden Bough by Sir James George Frazer  While it is not explicitly atheistic and it is not as old as Feuerbach let alone Hegel it is a good work on cultural anthropology and he generally states what he thinks along with his well documented research summaryIf you get a printed version do not get the full version with full citations  Get the smaller one  The smaller one is still huge Audio  hours httpslibrivoxorgthegoldenboughbysirjamesfrazer Book about  printed pages httpwwwgutenbergorgebooks The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason to find a sound theory for an absurd practice  Sir James George FrazerHeres an excerpt from The Golden Bough with the above quote in context to see if you appreciate his attention to detail and method of presentation Virbius and the HorseWE are now in a position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the tradition that Virbius the first of the divine Kings of the Wood at Aricia had been killed in the character of Hippolytus by horses Having found first that spirits of the corn are not infrequently represented in the form of horses and second that the animal which in later legends is said to have injured the god was sometimes originally the god himself we may conjecture that the horses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said to have been slain were really embodiments of him as a deity of vegetation The myth that he had been killed by horses was probably invented to explain certain features in his worship amongst others the custom of excluding horses from his sacred grove For myth changes while custom remains constant men continue to do what their fathers did before them though the reasons on which their fathers acted have been long forgotten The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason to find a sound theory for an absurd practice In the case before us we may be sure that the myth is more modern than the custom and by no means represents the original reason for excluding horses from the grove From their exclusion it might be inferred that horses could not be the sacred animals or embodiments of the god of the grove But the inference would be rash The goat was at one time a sacred animal or embodiment of Athena as may be inferred from the practice of representing the goddess clad in a goatskin aegis Yet the goat was neither sacrificed to her as a rule nor allowed to enter her great sanctuary the Acropolis at Athens The reason alleged for this was that the goat injured the olive the sacred tree of Athena So far therefore the relation of the goat to Athena is parallel to the relation of the horse to Virbius both animals being excluded from the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god But from Varro we learn that there was an exception to the rule which excluded the goat from the Acropolis Once a year he says the goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary sacrifice Now as has been remarked before when an animal is sacrificed once and once only in the year it is probably slain not as a victim offered to the god but as a representative of the god himself Therefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed on the Acropolis once a year it was sacrificed in the character of Athena herself and it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed animal was placed on the statue of the goddess and formed the aegis which would thus be renewed annually Similarly at Thebes in Egypt rams were sacred and were not sacrificed But on one day in the year a ram was killed and its skin was placed on the statue of the god Ammon Now if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove better we might find that the rule of excluding horses from it like the rule of excluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens was subject to an annual exception a horse being once a year taken into the grove and sacrificed as an embodiment of the god Virbius By the usual misunderstanding the horse thus killed would come in time to be regarded as an enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he had injured like the pig which was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris or the goat which was sacrificed to Dionysus and possibly to Athena It is so easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing an exception that we need not wonder at finding the rule of the Arician grove recorded without any mention of an exception such as I suppose If we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny we should have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of goats to Athena and excluded them from the Acropolis without being aware of the important exception which the fortunate preservation of Varros work has revealed to usThe conjecture that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in the Arician grove as a representative of the deity of the grove derives some support from the similar sacrifice of a horse which took place once a year at Rome On the fifteenth of October in each year a chariotrace was run on the Field of Mars Stabbed with a spear the righthand horse of the victorious team was then sacrificed to Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops and its head was cut off and adorned with a string of loaves Thereupon the inhabitants of two wardsthe Sacred Way and the Suburacontended with each other who should get the head If the people of the Sacred Way got it they fastened it to a wall of the kings house if the people of the Subura got it they fastened it to the Mamilian tower The horses tail was cut off and carried to the kings house with such speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the house Further it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and preserved till the twentyfirst of April when the Vestal Virgins mixed it with the blood of the unborn calves which had been sacrificed six days before The mixture was then distributed to shepherds

shamdalar,Even though you seem to have plenty of responses I like answering these kinds of thingsgtWhat is the role of familyGood one Families are obviously most important for raising children and providing for their physical emotional and developmental needs In todays society where theres a lot of value placed on individual achievement I think successful families will instill values of thinking and acting independently while providing a physical and emotional safety net to fall back on when difficulties arise Outside of childhood I think the obligations of family only extend as far as the strength of the relationships that make them up If a family member repeatedly or severely mistreats you there is no obligation to continue a relationship with that person just because they are familygtIs the universe ordered or randomThere are obvious examples of both order and randomness at work in the universegtWhat is the meaning of lifeLife does not have a meaning in the way a sentence has a meaning since it arose through natural forces acting on random events see there is order and randomness again Our lives have meaning because we as thinking agents assign them meaning However this meaning cannot be a monolith since each of us has our own perspective I find meaning by concentrating on developing my strengths and creating good feeling in the people around megtIs truth subjective or objectivePretty obviously it is objective since truth is determined by comparing a statements meaning to reality Of course if one makes statements about subjective things such as favorite colors then the truth of those statements is in some sense subjective Furthermore since truth depends upon meaning if the meaning of the statement depends on subjective evaluations then the truth can be subjective as wellgtWhere does evil come fromTo the extent that evil is a thing say a disregard for the wellbeing of others to the point of taking intentional harmful action there are evolutionary reasons why these impulses still exist despite our best efforts to eliminate them Individuals can act evilly because greed and selfinterest have been successful strategies for propagating genes and groups can act evilly towards other groups because defending ones tribe against outsiders allowed the tribes gene pool to succeed collectivelygtThose kinds of questionsHow about this onegtWhat role if any does your atheism play in determining your worldviewIt plays a huge role by omission Theistic views tend to have a pretty oppressive effect on the formation of worldviews Its pretty hard to ignore something like a sky dictator when determining how you feel about things My atheism allows me to consider each issue according to its observable properties and find the answers best supported by evidence and reasoning When challenged by good arguments or new data my atheism allows me to throw out previous beliefs and adopt new ones that better suit the new informationId love to give follow up answers if you have more questions,0,cdmhzj6,1rdoty,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

thorne,As an Atheist as well I know exactly how confounded people are by the fact that I participate in Christmas This answer may be kind of long but I want to go into why I participate in Christmas even though I fundamentally disagree with the idea of it Btw I want to use the phrase participate in xmas rather than celebrate xmas because although I celebrate the gifts friends and moments of Christmas I dont celebrate ChristFirst of all I want to criticize the Christian idea of Xmas Im sure long ago xmas started out as truly a Christian celebration of their messiah and to some or maybe even most it still is However it has since turned into an industry and an embedded AMERICAN tradition I can only speak for the US One example and I understand this example may be hard to make since almost all the US is Christian Hanukkah As xmas grew in to the huge commercial enterprise it has over the years a relatively insignificant Jewish holiday seems to have had undue importance placed on it to compete with the commercial enterprise of xmas Seemingly indicating that there is an underlying value to the holiday outside of its religious value That other value in my opinion is economic enterprise It ultimately is an enormous American economic enterprise that cant be ignored by other religious preferences within the population Its a time when large segments of the population dont have to work when bonuses are paid and an almost nationallyagreedupon time of year for a day off for lack of a better term The American economy nearly comes to a halt which makes Christmas too big to be ignored But if its too big to be ignored what should we do as Atheists Come up with an Atheistmas and try to apply some type of values to it when the rest of the country is doing something else that way more fun  You could try that and write your own xmastype holiday that takes place at the same time but assign your own traditions to it festivus I think most of us arent as bold as Frank Costanza though and were stuck celebrating an enterprise that has a religious origin but now is simply an American enterpriseAfter all that I want to say I agree with you I like all the festivities the music the gifts and everything that xmas brings I think its fun to celebrate the enterprise that is Christmas but I just exclude the religious elements of itThe last thing I want to say is a warning to Atheists who participate in xmas Like I said I feel xmas is an American industry that we choose to participate in but there is a danger in us participating We belittle the cause of Atheism by participating if we allow the Christian part of xmas appear to be the part of xmas that we participate in If we allow it to be seen by others in that light we seem to admit defeat to go along with the status quo rather than adhering to our beliefs The danger is that we appear to others to not be serious about our cause and lose the little bit of traction that we have in juxtaposition to Christianity in America So I dont feel its bad to participate just that we have to let others know why it is that we do participatetldr Christmas is an American Industry not necessarily a religious holiday   ,0,cdmeqbs,1rdpcq,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

CirclesforInfinity,I came out to my parents and inlaws in a letter format My wife to be and myself ran into a roadblock with the priest that was to marry us when I started asking questions about leaving the mention of God out of my portion of the vows It was important to me that I not vow something that I didnt intend to hold up and live by and I didnt want to lie to the church by vowing certain things before God More importantly this priest was my god father and was full aware where my journey of faith had taken me over the years and that I had become an atheist as a result Instead it was his way or the highway so we elected to take the highway As such we needed to break the news to our families about what had transpired so I printed out the email exchanges that we had had with him and presented them to the parents Of course they were able to connect the dots and soon became aware of my doubts and rejection of faith and belief in the supernatural It was a tough pill to swallow for my parents and my inlaws absolutely freaked out and wanted to stop the marriage proceedings After my parents talked sense into them the wedding went off without a hitch My inlaws still take issue with my lack of faith but that is an entire different story and long post My parents on the other hand started asking me questions Long story short both of my parents have quite a bit of doubt and continue to be interested in where I am and what my thoughts are regarding certain issues They both read many thoughts and links that I post and expand and challenge their own comfort zone with faith In fact they both recently admitted to me that the only thing that keeps them involved in the church is the sense of community and family that it offers They pretty much admit that nothing in the text makes sense and that science is a far better explanation for things than magicTLDR By coming out as an atheist my parents have challenged their own upbringing and beliefs They now embrace doubt and pretty much reject the teachings of the church,0,cdmoqm4,1re4b2,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

BunnyTVS,The best description Ive heard is that objective morality is making decisions regarding the well being of everyone  The greater the ratio of benefit to detriment an action causes in total the more moral it is This being the case for every situation we encounter there are a number of actions and choices possible  One or more of these choices will therefore deliver the greatest benefitleast detriment to everyone  This choice is the most moral one possible therefore it represents the objective moralityPeople may disagree with the level of benefitdetriment an action causes however this is due to each person having incomplete knowledge of the situation and weighting the knowledge they do have differently  However simply because we are unaware of all the data or how to weigh it does not alter the actuality of the situation  Simply because we differ on what the best choice should be does not mean that there isnt an actual optimal decisionAnother confusion that some people have is that this objective moral choice only applies to this particular situation at this particular instant  If the same thing happens tomorrow the objective moral choice may be different  Therefore every choice needs to be the result of reason,0,cdmjq3e,1rete0,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

Sebas, I dont speak good English  I apologize Objective morality means that moral dont change with the contextFor example  your will not lie  but what if you must lie to save your life or someone else  see in the Bible  Joshua  Rahab and the spies If lying is not an objective value  then never  no matter the context  you will lie Theres more objective values implies that moral values are universal  which means moral values apply to everyone without exceptionsObjective values also implies that moral values are immutable  they do not change over time The Bible has no objective moral values  you ll see Numbers  According this story we should kill anyone who violates the Sabbath Why Christians dont kill someone who works on the Sabbath Christian Excuses  There is a new and old covenant  see Hebrews  we are in the new covenantOr Jesus changed those lawsSo moral values change over time  then they are not immutable values  goodbye moral objectivity  The covenant with those laws was only for the JewsThen moral values are not universal again bye moral objectivity And finally  the most antiobjectivity excuse  It was another historical contextCan not be more clear that this argument removes any objectivityIn summary Christians believes that morality is objective in theory but in practice  they need moral relativism to justify or explain the Bible,0,cdmls8p,1rete0,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

NukeThePope,Ive kept a link to this expense breakdown for a Catholic churchhttpwwwchristianitytodaycomspecialycresourcespdfexecreportchurchbudgetprioritiespdf  at least thats what I think it isThe breakdown clearly shows that only a small percentage of the incoming money goes to charitable works and servicesIn fairness churches vary wildly in how effective they are at pushing money out to where its needed The best charities according to charity rating sites are  effective Churches tend to be a lot less effective simply because charity is not their primary product  proselytization is Perhaps the report I showed you with its roughly  effectiveness is typicalThat said the Salvation Army had high marks  around the  bracket IIRC from when I last looked I recently read that Catholic Charities had an  rate but I suspect that number is artificially inflated thanks to crosssubsidy from the Catholic Church properThis brings me to a general problem you may encounter with finding financial stats for church income Many churches fiercely resist making their finances transparent In the US they are routinely exempt from IRS audits and are not required to publish financial reports as other nonprofits doThats pretty much all I know on the topic Good luck,0,cdmkamm,1rey85,atheism,top_week,3.0,3

jmsr,Here now while my first reaction is like everyone else just move out its possible that OP lives in a culture in which the children stay at home until they marry  Now as someone who was raised in north america i know how weird that sounds but ive met multiple people classmates coworkers etc who are the children of first generation immigrants and currently live at home even though theyre freaking  goddamn years old and what the hell rightIn my culture im canadian we expect children to move out at  and make their own way in the world because living on your own teaches independence and maturity and we view people who stay at home as being either weird or immature or suffering significant misfortune like being longterm unemployed However one of my coworkers once explained to me that her culture has the opposite view and basically views parents that kick their children out as abandoning them  Whats more this is the standard model of child rearing throughout the majority of the world  In other words posters have to remember that the north american tradition of moving out at  is unusual and simply moving out may not be an option for the OPTherefore it is incumbent on us to try to think of suggestions for the OP to deal with this situation without belittling himher or saying just move out because that may not be an option for many reasonsIN THAT SPIRIT i would suggest to OP that she tell her mom that she is  years old and that because she is an adult now taking her belongings is technically theft a criminal offense  Further  adults are guaranteed freedom of association and can choose to associate with anyone they want and avoid anyone they choose  As a fellow adult her mom no longer has power over her only influence like freedom of speech though you dont have to listen  THAT SAID perhaps OP can contribute to the household as an adult would say by paying rent  What would mum think of thatIn any case good luck and feel free to vent here anytime jmsr,1,cdmvpsq,1rfcif,atheism,top_week,3.0,2

and interesting you mean shallow primitive and selfcontradictorygt think of any science textbook which supports the theory of evolutionIm specifically going to think of the works cited and references

abovegt Until you can show that something came from nothing I cant believe there is no creatorUntil you can show there is a creator you shouldnt believe there is a creatorUntil you can prove that there was ever a nothing which is a contradiction in terms you shouldnt be asking anyone to prove something came from nothingAnd since the theory of evolution isnt even remotely about the origin of

AgentSmith,Ive always had a problem with the burden of proof fallacy since it is probably the most fallaciously used fallacy  I think it would be more accurate to say that if people are to believe your position you should put some work into supporting it with facts and logicIt is too often the case that people end up arguing over who is making the claim when the fact is that both sides are making some sorts of claims  In these cases no one is supposed to get an automatic pass and avoid supporting your argumentScience knows this quite well and everyone in the scientific community strives to support their hypothesis with as much hard data and provable facts as they can  For instance evolution has quite a lot of evidence behind it In a fair argument or debate you shouldnt be sidestepping your obligation to present the evidence  You should be presenting it in all its gloryHowever the fact of the matter is that its easier just to put the obligation on someone else  This also puts the other side on the defensive and makes the argument easier to win  Its a good tactic but its often labelled correctly as a disingenuous argument by the other side  If the person asserts X is true they have to support it and if you are asserting Y or even if you are just asserting NOT X you have to support your argument to,0,cdn7gev,1rfws4,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

BrianJ,uHastyUsernameChoice  I have a question Why is the fallacy appeal to authority a fallacy The Principle of Testimonial Arguments maintains that you should accept a testimonial argument that satisfies the following premises   It is true that the proposition is reasonable to believe   It is true that the proposer is sincere in saying that the proposition is true   It is true that the proposer is knowledgeable in the topic at hand I understand that you shouldnt accept someones argument based solely on the fact that they are an expert without first weighing the reasonability of the claim made and the sincerity of the proposer But this is what this poster states about the authority fallacy gtThe authority that such a person or institution holds does not have any intrinsic bearing upon whether their claims are true or notBut their authority does have an intrinsic bearing on how close to the Truth their claims might be Unless someone makes an unreasonable claim or seemingly has a reason to spread falsities shouldnt we accept testimony on the basis that someone is an expert Consider this Biology Professor A and your crazy uncle on Facebook B who cut a frog open in high school one time have two contradicting arguments A makes a sincere reasonable proposition regarding Biology B though crazy is sincere in refuting it and does so with an equally reasonable statement For the sake of my enlightenment lets pretend that you have absolutely zero knowledge of the topic at hand and therefore are not in a place to weigh the truth of the premises against each other All you know is that both A and B have presented identically reasonable arguments and neither have anything to lose or gain out from establishing their proposition as True Would it therefore be logically fallacious to accept As proposition as deductively or inductively stronger than Bs on the basis that A is a certified expert whereas B is not Because it seems to me that the fallacy of appealing to authority is not a fallacy at all In fact it seems like quite the opposite It seems like it would be logically fallacious to presume that someone who is a nonexpert on the given topic is as capable of proposing a True proposition about the topic as an expert of course with all other premises constant ,0,cdn8fwo,1rfws4,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

Zamboniman,Sure you can pose that questionHeres my take on this issueThe question itself contains an unproven assumption To ask What is the purpose of life implies that there is one in the first place we just have to figure out what it is and that perhaps this purpose is imposed outside of ourselvesWhy could we or should we make this assumption First we need to determine if there is or must be a purpose before we can even get to your questionAll our current evidence shows that the purpose of life in quotes because I suspect this use of the word may be slightly or radically different than the one in the title is to reproduceThe purpose of our lives or at least of my life as a sentient human being is that which I ascribe to itSo for some it may be to be the best football player on the planet and make lots of money and entertain people Or it may be to heal the sick and save as many people as possible Or it may be to be a good parent and spouse Or perhaps leave a written legacy on some topic for future generationsWe choose our own purpose as human beingsThere is no evidence whatsoever that there is any outside influence or force that would or could ascribe an external purpose to our lives notwithstanding meddlesome parents and others,1,cdmv6zw,1rfzvj,atheism,top_week,3.0,2

taterbizkit,There are two primary ways to look at purpose in this context  The subjective do YOU have a sense of purpose that is personal to you and fulfills your expectations of what your life should be like and the objective is there a purpose to existence itselfThe second question is usually easy for religious people to answer God has a purpose for each of us even if we dont know what that is  For atheists its not so generally straightforward  Lots of atheists still believe that there is or should be some larger purpose that transcends the individual  Even atheists who will discount a larger purpose when the question comes up directly a lot of us will still make appeals to purpose or direction when the idea comes up obliquely  Youll hear As atheists we should be about making the human race better or questions like what is the next stage for human evolutionThose are both appeals to teleology that is a direction that movesshapes us and our futuresI reject teleology in any form  There is no such thing as should as an expression of objective truth  I can say I should of course because its clear that my own standards are involved  To say we should or you should or they should or People should though implies that there is a necessity that is larger than the individuals being discussedYou see this a lot coming from atheists who think atheism means skepticism or that atheism implies secular humanism or that it at least implies utilitarianism  I even do it sometimes out of habit or because there are some things its difficult to say in English in teleologyneutral termsSo for me of the two types of purpose the only one that does now or has ever had any meaning whatsoever is the purely personal kind  I enter the world with exactly zero obligations to anyone any thing any idea or any doctrine   If I am a utilitarian its because I made that my direction in life  If I want to be an astronaut thats because I chose it  If I want to be a world dictator and dont care how many bodies I leave in my wake thats because I made that my purposeThe term I use is  I am existentially free to be a nice person a caring person a hateful person a serial killer  My purpose is entirely and only my own  And by extension so is yours and everyone elsesThe universe does not has never and will never care that I or you or any human being ever existed  Weve been civilized for a few thousand years  maybe as much as  years  The universe will be many many trillions of years old before it starts winding down  The idea that any human being ever could have a significant role that transcends humanity is preposterous  Even if you found a way to destroy the milky way galaxy there are still at least  billion other galaxies  You dont matter and you never willSo all you can do is live your life for yourself  For most people me included that means some kind of utilitarian moral sense which is why we get along so well in millionplus sized citesAs to the cosmic purpose  I cant even say life is a purpose  Continuing the species  Procreation  Nah  Universe doesnt care and Ill be dead relatively soon so I wont eitherThe closes thing weve got to a purpose beyond the subjective is that were little entropy machines helping to smooth out the universe  Were not even good at it but its the only purpose we have in common with the universe itself,0,cdmw3yu,1rfzvj,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

lordslag,Young SirI find your ability to genuinely question what youre being told to indicate your curiosity and intelligence that said please let me tell you some things about atheism and atheistsFirstly your teacher is lying to you about everything hes said about atheists  Whether thats intentional or not I cant say because I dont know the contents of his mind or whether or not he knows better  Keep in mind that almost all atheists were indoctrinated with religion as toddlers and children before we knew to question or seek answers for ourselves just like you were  And most of us were threatened with eternal torture for disagreeing with it most likely just like you were  We simply set out to find out what the truth was no matter where the evidence led us or what the consequences of that search would beRegarding morality and ethics we get those things from the same place that everyone does that is from the social instincts were all born with  The necessity to work together in a group to provide for our needs and defense against privation the elements and predators whether that be from animals or other groups of humans  It is very important to realize that religious people DO NOT get their morals from the bible or other holy books  No one stones people to death for working on the sabbath or not being a virgin on their wedding night or being a disobedient child or breaking certain commandments or worshiping other gods all of which is in the bible  Instead evolution equipped us with an inherent sense of right wrong and justice which we codify and adhere to in order to build civilizations we call this sense a conscience and even babies toddlers and animals exhibit it  The reason I bring up those three groups is that they cant possibly know about religion yet have a sense of right and wrong anyway proving my point  Most atheists that I know myself included subscribe to Secular Humanism as a moral framework and I wont belabor that subject here since google will provide you with plenty of resources on that subjectSo far as a soul is concerned no one has ever located one or presented any evidence that one exists  Add a little critical thinking on top of that lack of evidence and one must eschew belief in that concept unless and until better evidence is forthcomingRegarding his accusation that atheists just dont care about anything I think its obvious to you thats just bigoted drivel  We love our family and friends just as much as any other person we strive to be good people do good works for their own sake instead of in pursuit of divine reward feel the pain of sympathy when we see others suffering and enjoy candy music and sex just like any of our fellow humansIn closing please keep questioning everything around you and never accept anything that anyone tells you at face value  Demand they cite evidence in reality to prove what they claim  Search out more evidence for yourself to make sure youre not being lied to  Seek out the educated and wise outside your friends and family who are willing to speak with you because they will have nothing to gain by lying in order to manipulate youStrive seek findand never EVER yield young sir  Good luck on your journey and I can only promise two things about it It will NOT be easy and it will be TOTALLY worth itSincerelySlagTLDR Never believe anything without evidence to back it up  Keep questioning everything everyone tells you including your own instincts and conclusions  The journey will be VERY difficult and even more rewarding,6,cdn1q6j,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,21.0,15

HermesTheMessenger,First off I would be glad to talk with your teacher privately  As I have talked with thelogians seminary students evangelicals and more than a few Catholic priests over the span of decades I think his objections to me cant be based on something as arbitrary as how old I am nor how informed and patient I may beSo please if it would not cause you any harm ask your teacher to make an account on Reddit and then click this httpwwwredditcommessagecomposetoHermesTheMessengerI await a cordial and even tempered discussion  not an argument  from themgt Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrong This struck a lot of us odd as we had just thought of Atheism as another religion people believed in Once he saw our blank looks he added on For example and Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head Why silence Because Atheists dont care A few kids questioned him only to be silenced and we moved onTwo basic points If the Roman Catholic Church has a clear vision of morality a deep understanding then why is it infamous for protecting and shielding those who rape children  Didnt the Pope and the cardinals realize what even the most hardened criminals know  that abusing children is one of the worst crimes of humanity As for any atheist doing what the teacher accuses us of the teacher only needs to demonstrate that what they say is true  If they cant or wont then they have to retract the claim  Failure to do so is an indication that they are either lying andor a bigotgt What bothered me is that this class and his teachings have put me off of religion completelyTake a look at cultural anthropology  Religion is fascinating and as a cultural practice does indeed exist in tens of thousands of variations  I do not think it is a source of greater morality nor do I think that theism describes realityRelated Dr Robert Sapolskys lecture about Biological Underpinnings of ReligiosityhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvWwAQqWUkpI,1,cdmz1a7,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,5.0,4

shamdalar,As you surmised your teacher is an ignorant jerk To address some specific pointsNo atheism is not just another religion A religion is a set of rites and beliefs associated to a supernatural powerNo an atheist is not going to walk up and shoot you in the head In fact atheists are statistically much less likely to commit crimes than religious peopleYes you might say many atheists have turned away from God those that were at some point theists but obviously we believe we have merely turned away from the concept of God Other atheists have never believed in God so obviously cant be said to have turned away from himFinally a lot of atheists care deeply about right and wrong I think its wrong to poison the minds of children against a whole group of people based on lies and ignorance I think its wrong to threaten eternal damnation for insignificant crimes I think its wrong to murder an innocent person and claim that somehow this murder balances out crimes committed by different people at different times My atheism is based on my evaluation of the evidence but the reasons I care about discussing it and defending it are all moral,2,cdn07cq,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,5.0,3

DerberAuner,my  cents on thisim gonna go through the assertions made by your teacher that you published through your post step by step i hope i get them all Atheists arent like us Catholics They dont know about the difference between right and wrongi would say this is just plain wrong my guess is it is based on the assumption that only religious people can know what right and wrong is because atheists dont have a frame of reference to go from personally i would adress this argument as followsa deity is not neccessary for us to have a sense of right and wrong we can use our own minds and think for ourselves about whether or not we think something is good for us or our society or bad a good starting point here is the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you i personally use a variation of it namely treat others as you think they want to be treated i am somewhat conflict averting unless they have shown themselves to be douchebags if they have treat them as they treated you Atheists are people who have turned away from Godjust plain wrong not everybody believes in god or ever believed in god personally i was raised as a protestant but i never truely believed so did i turn away from god you might see it that way but i wouldnt i would say i looked at the idea of god and thought meh seems to be without evidence once i was old enough but i never really believed in the first place others might never have been raised religiously from the start Atheists dont care paraphrasedplain wrong not much more to say about this atheists care about as much as religious people in general we care about the world people and life in general because we are life we are part of the world and how we act towards life will influence how our fellow humans act towards uswhat we dont care about is souls since we dont believe in the concept i hope im not stepping out of line here fellow atheistsi hope this was helpful,0,cdn1oa6,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,3.0,3

MxM,OK I am an atheist and for me it is strange that what people think what is morally right and wrong is simply because it is written in the book which is older than thousand years and parts of it are really old  thousands instead of trying to understand for yourself what is right and what is wrong It is also strange for me to think that something is moral and right because somebody told me so priest for example because priests are people and they can make mistakesNo for me right and wrong is result of my thinking about common interests about humanity You can read up on humanism which specifically deals with morals without reference to particular religion To me religion reflects moral values not dictates it Can I make mistake in understanding what is right and what is wrong Sure But I will make everything possible to avoid this by carefully thinking about it not just referring to the book and removing my responsibility from my decisionAlso those books bible if you are a christian contains lots of stuff of questionable morality slavery is OK inequity between people men and women etc which many people even if they call themselves Catholics reject WHAT DO THEY USE TO REJECT THOSE AS IMMORAL Critical thinking So we atheists use critical thinking and feelings to understand what is right and what is wrong Not an ancient textAlso a bit off topic but may be useful for you to understand where we atheists coming from atheism strictly speaking is not belief into absence of God but it is absence of believe into God For many of us there is just not enough evidence to support Gods existence in the way it is described in religious text For example personally for me while I can easily answer the question do you believe into God as no I can not answer the question do you think God exists Because it is meaningless question for me I do not know what God is Ask different peoplereligions you get different explanation of what gods isare Does god exist as it is described in the bible with creation of the world in  days including humans Very likely not since we know from our scientific achievements how the universe was developed and how humans evolve Can this universe be created by something Could be But even in this case how I distinguish just an alien civilization with power to create universes from God What makes God to be God and not advanced civilizationYou see I honestly can not answer the question Does God exist since the word God is just not defined It is meaningless for me I do not reject God I do not know what possibly God can be and I do not have blind faith that something that is called God exists  I just do not see need for that and I see lots of damage that can be done if people use blind faithIn shot we atheist do not reject God per say We reject blind faith and welcome rational thinking about everything including morals,2,cdmz7do,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,4.0,2

LIQUIPOOPS,One of the things about right and wrong is that overall most religions agree There are some things like whether to eat meat or which kinds are okay festivals rites and so on that differ but overall morality is universal Dont kill people Dont steal Dont be an ass Do things that will improve the lives of others Bathe regularly Examine yourself and grow as a person THINK about actions before doing them Thing is there are some foul atheists throughout history and were statistically just going to get the good with the bad among our numbers Overall most sane people agree on a common standard of morality without being explicitly told by religion and the things that we disagree on are almost always dictated by religionI was raised in the Bible Belt in an atheist Catholic family historically but open household Ive read the bible have tried to read the Koran but its tough work when it reads like an internet comment with the caps lock on have read neopagan stuff Buddhist literature and some Hindu stories I think in a lot of ways the parables of Jesus are indicative of the Bible as a whole parables and stories that made it easy for a nonliterate population to share a code of laws Overall Jesus if he were real seemed like a decent guy A guy who had some Kanye Westlike tendencies like the oil for anointing himself and speech at the last supper but someone who brought moderation to the highly closed and tribal Jewish society he lived in He was a reformer who stole a donkey and called himself the son of god That being said the book of Revelations is just NUTS I think its a sign that as an atheist that I do care because heck I cant believe that stuff one bit and I would really rather not have that happen to the world Also because I care Id rather not believe that someone who was born before Christianity or in a different section of the world would automatically go to hell just for not knowing about it Dante gave this some thought with his discussion of Limbo in the Inferno ,0,cdn12si,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

richertai,Atheists do care  They care about right and wrong  They have to justify it though  Its not just a because I said so justificationgtFor example an Atheist would walk up to you and shoot you in the head WhyBecause some people are sick in the head  You get this with religious people as well  Sometimes the crime can be tied directly to their religious instruction coupled with a sociopathic lack of empathy for others  Those parents that have been killing their kids because of some religious book on childrearing that have come up recently  They didnt care  At least they didnt care about the person  Any moron could see the damage being done but they believed that it had to be right  And whether or not they could justify it to themselves only indicates the level of mental problems they had  They did the damage of their own will  They killed children through negligence outright denial of necessary care or even violencePeople are capable of these things  Motivators like greed and doctrine seem to be the largest perpetrators  Greed can blind you to all others making you unfeeling  Doctrine can blind you but even those with eyes to see the damage are constantly being told and telling themselves that it is worth it  Because this life doesnt matter  They are striving for the next life so all things can be sacrificed on the altar of What We Think God Wants Based On This Book  And it IS a sacrifice of blood of knowledge of pain  This is my book  There are many like it but this one is MINEConfirmation provided me with no answers  I understood scripture better but no real answers to the real questions or mysteries  Occasionally theyd touch on the buzzwords of the day but those are the surface symptoms of deeper issuesThe best thing you can do as a believer is avoid religion  If the truth is manifest in the Bible then you dont need an establishment to interpret and spoonfeed it to you  Read that book from cover to cover  It will drastically change your outlook on what YOU believe and why  You will come across a great many things that you dont agree with  In times like that find out why you dont agree with it  It does help to talk to someone to get a different perspective on the story  Sometimes I genuinely didnt understand the moral of a parable  When I discussed it I understood the meaning more and then either agreed or disagreed with the moral being expounded  Either way it was me judging the book not the book shaping me  It is just a book and can be taken or left at your whim  But you owe it to yourself to understand why you take it or leave it  It tells you more about yourself than any religion ever could  If someone does not answer your question to your satisfaction then delve deeper  Find the source of your dissatisfaction and ask further questions  If they respond with anger or they try to brush it off then they dont know why they believe what they believe and are threatened by your questions  These people are not suitable leaders of any group  Do not look to them for guidance because they have no grounds to provide itFind your own answers and dont be afraid to question others  You will be more at peace about some things and more conflicted about others  This is good  Conflict exists in the presence of opposing forces  These forces are both within you  They are not external  They are not God or the Devil fighting over your soul  They are you trying to figure yourself outThere are external forces that will try to drive you into conflict with yourself and they are most manifest in religion  The pressure of doctrine and the sheeplike nature it fosters and requires is no way for a person to live  You are not yourself  You are what someone else is trying to make you  You will feel it inside  It will be a sense of unease or discomfort  Listen to that  Find out who is wrong and whyNever follow doctrine either political or religious or any other kind  Allowing yourself to be blindly led is no way to live,0,cdn6dw8,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

gbuuun,Well the most interesting point to me has been how religious people hate atheists more than other people of other religions If atheists have no morals then surely Muslims and Hindus have false morals If I were to believe that my god was the one true god and that everyone else had it wrong Id be more suspicious of people who fell for easytospot lies about a doctrine than people who didnt believe one way or another I was also raised Catholic except my church was fairly liberal and didnt really talk about hating anybody However I did ask a lot of questions that in hindsight were indicative of my growing skepticism and my questions were often suppressed or mocked as being incredibly stupid I feel my intellectual growth was heavily stunted during my most formative years due to constant rejection by others of what I thought to be common sense Im surprised and happy that some people were put off by this unfair attack From personal experience Catholicism in developed nations is like Christianity Lite Evolution is accepted nobody really follows the doctrines of birth control and nobody really believes in the Bible literally Because Catholic doctrines so rarely matter in real life Catholics end up falling into two general categories of indifference one believes its doctrines are true and accepts that while it cant be proved it cannot be disproved a lot of apologists are Catholic and the other cares so little that heshe can be dissuaded of the doctrines of the church much more easily than the standard Baptist for example Most people fall into the former and once you dont care to really apply yourself its easier to be nasty to a group of people that you were told are evil than to think for yourself I realized that Catholicism had absolutely nothing to do with morality when my mom said to me in high school that I had to confess my sin of not going to church one Sunday I was actually helping out by giving food to the homeless that day and it made me confused that doing some good in the world was still a form of sin Every confession Id have to come up with sins or make what I did seem even worse so I would have something to say Once you realize you dont have to feel guilty for just being alive or that telling your wrongdoings to a priest doesnt absolve you of your responsibilities to other people you begin to see a glimpse of what it truly means to be moral ,0,cdn95ho,1rgb8p,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

ktreanor,The best analogy I ever heard to help explain evolution are how languages changeFrench Spanish Italian are all romance languages meaning they all use Latin as their base  Its easy to imagine how Latin eventual became these different languages  When the Roman Empire fell different areas separated by distance or geological barriers first started having distinct accents much like how Boston and New York City have very different accents  These accents continued to change to the point they became dialects using their own words grammar and pronunciation  Finally after enough time has passed these dialects become their own languages  This is how Latin morphed into Italian over a long period  What never happened was a Latin speaking mother gave birth to an Italian speaking childThats the keymuch like Latin changing into Italian by small shifts over a long period so has life changed by small small amounts over a long period to form all the species we see today,0,cdn3cjl,1rgjae,atheism,top_week,3.0,3

MartinTheRound,Well perhaps first you should ask her how she understands evolution which is quite probably a flawed understanding Then you can work to correct her misunderstandingOne common misunderstanding is that evolution works on individuals another is that evolution works on entire species In reality it works on groups of individuals You take one species put them in two different environments theyll start diverging separatelyAnother common misunderstanding is about mutation rates many people assume mutations are either good or bad There are mutations that are inert and sometimes several inert mutations in combination will produce an effect So some mutations produce slow changes and others faster changesBut simply evolution is inevitable The logic is this mutations happen this is an observed fact confirmed both in laboratory experiments and in nature they produce change whether the changes are good or bad depends on the environment hot climate less fur cold climate more fur thus changes will produce effects over time Thus well see divergence of populations of organisms The longer the time the larger the effectsThis is of course a very simplified explanation Whole books can be and had been written on the topicMaybe you can start by watching some of the youtube videos recommended then watch some of them with her and asking her what she thinks about what was said and engaging in a debate and finding more information when requiredBut you should probably start by finding out what her notion of evolution is and go from there Good luck and keep posting on your progress,0,cdn9qg7,1rgjae,atheism,top_week,2.0,2
SpHornet,The theory of evolution If traits are inherited by the next generation If there is variation in those traits If there is a selection pressure on one of those traitsThen Those traits selected for will be more abundant in the genepool each generation as long the selection continuesyou can show  by pointing out that kids look like their parents you can show  by pointing out that people look different except for identical twins you can explain  by explaining that genes are not passed on if they dont have kids and  follows pretty clear out of So in words if a  legged lizard has a higher chance of survival it will on average get more children you give your genes to your children so they will be  legged to all children  or none depending on the genetics but it does not matter that much if you look in detail Because those children have also  legs they to will have better survival and thus more children etc until all lizards of that species have  legs or  legs no longer give an advantage,0,cdnaxec,1rgjae,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

MartinTheRound,You say she looked at evolution and it didnt make sense to her Im not sure what exactly she missed butAsk her to compare the anatomy of mammals A comparison of skeletal structures of for example a mouse camel human bear tiger and a dolphin might show that either the creator has a severe lack of creativity or that there is a relationship between all of these animalsAsk her to have a look at the similarity of brain structures in mammals She will see the same or similar degree of similarity in general as with the skeletal structuresAsk her to consider that weve mapped the DNA of many animals including humans and we see that there is a similarity that matches the previous conclusions about evolution If humans were created separately from other animals you would expect no similarity Indeed if you assume separate creation of every animal you would expect no similarity between any animalsAsk her to consider that the HIV virus was originally infecting monkeys SIV but their bodies were close enough to ours that the virus could jump and evolve into a new virusAsk her to consider that actual evolution was observed in laboratory environment in bacteria and those experiments can be repeated but creation wasnt observed in laboratory conditions nor can in explain the diversity of life on this planet At least not according to the old jewish bibles story old testament Consider that according to this story the earth was depopulated by god and the only land animals and only humans to survive were on the same ship consider how big a ship would have to be just to house every species of spiders Consider that not many birds can sustain flight for  days so there would have to be a lot of space for birds And there are numerous snakes that wouldnt survive a flood Its neither credible nor verifiable And the evidence for evolution is both credible if you understand it and verifiable You might also tell her to look up the documentary hypothesis Its not about evolution at all its about the literary and historical analysis of the jewish bible aka old testament and it shows that the bible has been edited many christian religious scholars accept it in one form or another and to be sure there is disagreement about the details but not about the fact that whats known as the jewish bibleold testament is a composite work edited with an agenda Ask her to consider how after the great flood all the kangaroos ended up in one place and all the pandas somewhere else And most importantly if only Noah and his bunch survived who owed their existence to this god how come the Incas never heard about him And how from the same bunch of people we ended up with all black people in africa and india all white people in europe asian people in asia etc etc And the only people who ever heard about Noah were the people in the same neighborhood Ask her to consider whats more likely that people invented different gods in different places or that some forgot remembered their god and many others simultaneously forgot and invented new onesI dont know what mental process lead you to stop believing but you might ask her to consider that there are many religions some of which must be invented and wrong because they dont agree with each other So we have a proof that humans create religions or does god want to have a laugh at our expense So when choosing a religion ask her what standards would she apply if she didnt have her mind made up already Then ask her if those standards are fair and if her chosen religion passes them and every other religion fails Then ask her why you should not be allowed to make a choice based on such a comparison and conclude that since many must be invented and you cant see why any would be more true then all are probably invented and decide that living a life without the burden of pleasing a god that isnt willing to show himself in a clear an unambiguous fashionThis is not an explanation of evolution just some points that might undermine her certainty in the things she beliefs in and have been shown incorrect and maybe make her able to listen to an actual explanation Maybe The problem is that religions very often make sustained ignorance into a virtue,0,cdnc6im,1rgjae,atheism,top_week,2.0,2
eritassisiht,I think the best way to really cut to the heart of it is to point out the difference between the evidence for small changes microevolution ltyes I know there is no real difference between micromacro just timegt and bigger differences like humans being related to apesThe kind of evidence for this is different  Not fruit flies  While the fruit fly stuff is real it just isnt very impressive to most peopleStuff like pseudogenes endogenous retroviruses the fusion of human chromosome These may sound too indepth but they are the best ways of proving that even vastly different animals including us are relatedI have an analogy that helps explain one of the things I mentioned pseudogenesA judge is hearing a case where the defendant is being accused of copying information for their atlas from the plaintiffs copyrighted atlasIf there was only similar information in the defendants atlas there wouldnt be much of a case this is analogous to the defense creationists use to explain similarities between different species  Such as Well a Creator would use similar genes for similar needs of the animalBut what if there were typos in the plaintiffs atlas  If the defendant really did copy directly from the plaintiff and not just research the same information then the same typos would appear in the same places as the plaintiffsThe same scenario is written in our genes  One example is the loss of the ability to produce vitamin CgtVestigial characters should also be found at the molecular level Humans do not have the capability to synthesize ascorbic acid otherwise known as Vitamin C and the unfortunate consequence can be the nutritional deficiency called scurvy However the predicted ancestors of humans had this function as do most other animals except primates and guinea pigs Therefore we predict that humans other primates and guinea pigs should carry evidence of this lost function as a molecular vestigial character nota bene this very prediction was explicitly made by Nishikimi and others and was the impetus for the research detailed below Nishikimi et al  Nishikimi et al gtConfirmationgtRecently the Lgulanoγlactone oxidase gene the gene required for Vitamin C synthesis was found in humans and guinea pigs Nishikimi et al  Nishikimi et al  It exists as a pseudogene present but incapable of functioning see prediction  for more about pseudogenes In fact since this was originally written the vitamin C pseudogene has been found in other primates exactly as predicted by evolutionary theory We now have the DNA sequences for this broken gene in chimpanzees orangutans and macaques Ohta and Nishikimi  And as predicted the malfunctioning human and chimpanzee pseudogenes are the most similar followed by the human and orangutan genes followed by the human and macaque genes precisely as predicted by evolutionary theory Furthermore all of these genes have accumulated mutations at the exact rate predicted the background rate of mutation for neutral DNA regions like pseudogenes Ohta and Nishikimi httpwwwtalkoriginsorgfaqscomdescsectionhtmlmolvestigesThese sorts of evidences are hard to ignore or dismiss  Unless they want to claim that God Jehovah designed our and other animals DNA like this on purpose  That would be a pretty deceptive God to worship though,0,cdnhhez,1rgjae,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

MartinTheRound,A few more things to considerThe question of our existence can be separated into four different areas of study The emergence of the universe the big bang theory the formation of galaxies cosmology the emergence of life from non living matter abiogenesis the emergence of more complex life from simple life evolutionThe religious answer to all of these questions is god did it which doesnt actually explain anything god did it doesnt give us any information where as investigating the chemical properties of life allows us to gain further knowledgeWe have good theories for each of these A theory in the scientific sense isnt the same as saying we have a definite answer But IMHO having a good answer is better than having an unsubstantiated claim no matter how definite it is especially if that claim doesnt help us in any wayFor example we know about Newtons laws for a long time and today we know they are inaccurate but they are accurate enough to build many of todays structures Some of our technology requires more accurate theories like quantum mechanics microelectornics or the theory of relativity GPS But others work with less precise theories that have since been falsified civil engineering hydraulicsA scientific theory is a hypothesis that explains the observations and makes testable predictions which can be verified A theory that makes more accurate predictions is better a theory that makes predictions that are contradicted by observations is said to be falsified But as I said a theory that has been falsified may still be useful if the error difference between its prediction and a superior theorys prediction is not significant in the specific circumstances and the inferior theory is easier to apply For example newtons laws of motion break down at speeds comparable to the speed of light and or distances great enough But for calculating automobiles we dont need the precision that wed get from using the theory of relativity Since the distances and speeds are way too small and the errors would be smaller than an atomIn terms of evolution the theory of evolution made predictions that were confirmed For example at the time of Darwin we didnt know about DNA and didnt have the capability to directly compare the DNA of various animals The theory of evolution predicted that animals that were considered related for example based on their skeletal anatomy would have more similar than animals that were considered less related Also the prediction was that all animals would share some DNA All of these have been confirmed The theory of evolution also predicted that if we perform an experiment well get a specific result which was confirmed The experiment was this we take the same bacterium we put it into sealed containers and we regularly add two kinds of food one of which would be edible by the bacterium the other wouldnt We would expect one or more of the jars to have at some later point a strand of bacterium that can digest the other kind of food And this was confirmed I may be oversimplifying the experiment but Im sure you can look it upHowever the so called theory of creation doesnt make any predictions that were confirmed The creationists dont make predictions Ive heard of But my interpretation of the theory would be that there wouldnt be any correspondence between us and any other animal since we were separately created But we see anatomical and genetic similarities between us and other animals So we cant be said to be separately created as some sort of crowning achievement which is what were supposed to be And if the creation theory is stated as intelligent design I would ask why an intelligent designer would give some creatures blind eyes And if were supposed to be the crowning achievement I would expect us to have UV and heat vision And what is the intelligent purpose of nipples on males of the species So by the standards of scientific inquiry creation and intelligent design are both uninformative useless and falsifiedIMHO science is better because it accepts and welcomes revisions As I said somewhere before when you successfully argue with religion you get a new denomination if you successfully argue with science you get better science   science is not the sum total of our knowledge its the method by which weve acquired the existing knowledge and by which we expand the knowledge further Engineering is how we apply the knowledge and marketing is how we make people pay for it  And religion is how we exploit gullible people scientology is an obvious example,0,cdo37ce,1rgjae,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

Snabelpaprika,One function in our brain is to think of predictable things and events as dead and also to imagine a purpose or agenda behind everything that acts irrational or unpredictable When something moves our brain screams its alive no matter what it is We see rocks and they are dead We can throw them fling them or let them fall It always acts the way we expect them to Our brain is comfortable with this and think it is safe because everything is under controlBut as soon as something is unpredictable we assume a mind behind it This is a consequence of being a social animal We need to all the time consider and interact with other beings often with hidden motives and goals Our biggest fear is someone who is dead and then he suddenly open his eyes Our brain freaks out and is clearly not comfortable with being surprised with predicable things suddenly being alive and unpredictable This would indicate that the brain did a mistake and need to remember this so it is not repeated And everyone remember things that freak them out We often cant sleep for days after being seriously frightenedBut there are a lot of things in nature that is unpredictable And until we find a pattern or a way to predict it our brains need to be careful and watch those unpredictable things so they dont surprise us Weather earthquakes accidents luck fights Everything is extremely unpredictable and dangerous So of course our brains think well something must be behind these weird things and then it takes the step to well someONE might be behind it But we cant find that someone But we know that he is incredibly powerful he can control earthquakes He must be magical just like our shaman that made all those colors appear when we tasted his weird mushrooms last year Maybe its someone who controls the weather and lightning And then someone else controls earthquakes and someone wars disease destruction luck the ocean plants the abundance of animals in the forest They are all very powerful and magical so they probably know each otherThen a few thousand years later someone comes up with maybe it is a single one who controls all those uncontrollable things Bet he is the most powerful thing it is Probably powerful enough to create everything I asked him for a favor before hunting yesterday and i immediately found a deer Im going to keep asking him for stuff But i must be friendly to him so he likes me just like i behave to all my friends Maybe he wants some of the meat from the deer yesterday How do i give it to him The only time i hear him is with thunder and the only time i see him is in the beautiful clouds that change all the time Bet he lives there The only way i can get the meat there is to turn it into smoke like we do when we cook it Lets burn some of the meat so it pleases the magic guy thats upthere somewhere,0,cdn5rjk,1rgqt7,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

supposed to do  but I have to explain to you that that wasnt a very good question and that Ken Ham is a poor teacher There are better questions you could have askedOne serious problem with the Were you there question is that it is not very sincere You knew the answer already You knew that woman had not been to the moon and you definitely knew that she had not been around to see the rock forming  billion years ago You knew the only answer she could give was no which is not very informativeAnother problem is that if we can only trust what we have seen with our own two eyes in our short lives then theres very little we can know at all You probably know that there are penguins in Antarctica and that the Civil War was fought in the s and that there are fish swimming deep in the ocean and you also believe that Jesus was crucified two thousand years ago but if I asked you Were you there about each of those facts youd also have to answer no to each one Does that mean they are all falseOf course not You know those things because you have other kinds of evidence There are photographs and movies of penguins and fish there are documents from the time of the Civil War as well as the fact that in many places you can still find old bullets and cannon balls buried in the ground from the time of the war and you have a book the Bible that tells stories about Jesus You have evidence other than that you personally witnessed somethingThis is important because we live in a big ol beautiful world far older than your  years and theres so much to learn about it  far more than youll ever be able to see for yourself Theres a gigantic universe beyond South Carolina and while you probably wont ever visit a distant star or go inside a cell there are instruments we can use to see farther and deeper than your eyes can go and there are books that describe all kinds of wonders Dont close yourself off to them simply because you werent thereId like to teach you a different easy question one that is far far more useful than Ken Hams silly Were you there The question you can always ask is How do you know thatRight away you should be able to see the difference You already knew the answer to the Were you there question but you dont know the answer to the How do you know that question That means the person answering it will tell you something you dont know and you will learn something new And that is the coolest thing everYou could have asked the lady at the exhibit How do you know that moon rock is  billion years old and she would have explained it to you Maybe you would disagree with her maybe youd think theres a better answer maybe youd still want to believe Ken Ham who is not a scientist but the important thing is that youd have learned why she thought the rock was that old and why scientists have said that it is that old and how they worked out the age even if they werent there And youd be a little bit more knowledgeable todayIll assume youre actually interested in knowing how they figured out the age of the rock so Ill try to explain it to youThe technique scientists use is called radiometric dating It uses the fact that some radioactive elements slowly fall apart turning into other elements For instance a radioactive isotope of potassium will decay over time into an isotope of another element argonOne way to think of it is that its like an hourglass You know how they work you start with all the sand in the top half of the hourglass and it slowly trickles into the bottom half If you see an hourglass with all the sand at the top and none at the bottom you know it was recently flipped over If you see one with half the sand in the top and half in the bottom you know its about halfway through the time it will run And if you look at how quickly the sand moves through the neck of the hourglass you could even figure out how long until it all runs outIn radiometric dating the scientists are looking at how far along all the radioactive potassium is in the process of turning into argon The amount of potassium is like the amount of sand in the top half of the hourglass while the amount of argon is like the amount in the bottom half By measuring the relative amounts of the two elements and by measuring how fast radioactive potassium turns into argon we can figure out how long its been since the rock solidifiedIt takes a very long time for the decay to occur It takes  and a quarter billion years for half the potassium to turn into argon When they measured those elements in the moon rocks they found that the radiometric hourglass had mostly run out so they knew that it was very very oldScientists doublecheck everything They also looked at other elements like how quickly uranium turns into lead or rubidium into strontium and they all agree on the date even though these are decay processes that run at different rates All the radiometric hourglasses theyve used give the same answer  billion years None of them say  yearsI think youre off to a great start  being brave enough to ask older people to explain themselves is exactly what you need to do to learn more and more and open up the whole new exciting world of science for yourself But that means you have to ask good questions to get good answers so that you will learn moreDont use Ken Hams bad question and most importantly dont pay attention to Ken Hams bad answers Theres a wealth of wonderful truths that reveal so much more about our universe out there and you do not want to close your eyes to them Maybe someday you could be a woman who does go to the moon and sees the rocks there or a geologist who sees how rocks erode and form here on earth or the biologist who observes life in exotic parts of the worldbut you wont achieve any of those things if you limit your mind to the dogma of Answers in GenesisBest wishes for future learningP Z MeyersSourcehttpscienceblogscompharynguladearemmab,2,cdncigl,1rh877,atheism,top_week,4.0,2

Hambone,okay the first argumentgt Our senses prove that some things are in motion grantedgt Things move when potential motion becomes actual motion grantedgt Only an actual motion can convert a potential motion into an actual motion This is a very Newtonian view of the world but alrightgt Nothing can be at once in both actuality and potentiality in the same respect ie if both actual and potential it is actual in one respect and potential in another the existence of the superposition of quantum states proves this assertion to be falsegt Therefore nothing can move itself not granted it is not possible for subatomic particles NOT to be moving the uncertainty principle means that it is physically impossible for any particles momentum to be zerogt Therefore each thing in motion is moved by something else whatever well grant it and get to the conclusiongt The sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum grantedgt Therefore it is necessary to arrive at a first mover put in motion by no other and this everyone understands to be God the existence of a first cause is obvious  causal chains cannot extend indefinitely because we know the age of the universe to be finite you cannot fit an infinite causal sequance into a finite universe ergo a first cause must be present this proof is only valid for proving the existence of some form of first cause It is not valid for proving the existence of a theistic godthe second proof is basically the same argument Okay we accept the need for there to be a first cause Again this argument fails to prove that first cause  god There is a nonsequitur involved It follows that there is a first cause It does NOT follow that said first cause must be a theistic godThe third proof is debunked by the existence of evolutionary forces In a universe in which things can evolve there is no need for there to be a sentient agent at all timesthe very first premise of the fourth proof isgt There is a gradation to be found in things some are better or worse than othersThis is not granted A big stone is not better than a small stone nor is up better than down humans are not better than mice we are simply different Any evaluation of a thing as being better than something else is a purely subjective one and prejudiced a hotter star is not a better star it is simply a hotter star The first premise is completely flawed I reject it outright and with it all subsequent reasoningThe fifth proof is similarly flawed from the outsetgt We see that natural bodies work toward some goal and do not do so by chance This is the teleological argument What is the goal of a mountain Or of an asteroid What is the goal of a comet orbiting a distant star in a system containing no worlds with any form of life What is the goal of a quasar billions of light years away What is the goal of a hydrogen atom lost in intergalactic space What is the goal of water or of solar flaresClouds are not for raining they dont have the goal of raining to water crops The fact that clouds DO rain and that crops are watered as a result can be explained as an emergent phenomenon of natural forces without having to invoke the notion that this was the clouds objectiveAquinas was ignorant to the possibility that natural forces can play out in a sequential nonrandom way without the need for conscious direction An arrow fired from a bow does not fly because the human wishes it  the human is instead exploiting an emergent property of the laws of physics Aquinas has the relationship between action and intent backwards  humans do not cause the phenomenon they exploit it,0,cdni317,1rhvy1,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

KublaKhan,Although I was baptized a Catholic and most of my family are practicing Catholics I was pretty much raised as a Baptist  Considering that half of my mothers family are also Jehovas Witnesses and we had a few Presbyterian family members here and there I got a very accurate viewpoint of religion quite earlier than most other people  This actually helped to question doctrine and eventually wean me off of religion altogetheranother positive thing that was brought about thanks to being raised a Baptist is that my particular church was hugely into charity which was a real eye opener  the church would often have fundraising events for poor community members and for Christmas we would do food drives and collect toys for indigenous villages in Mexico  seeing firsthand the extent of poverty that these people lived in and the effects of this poverty on their culture really gave me insight on the issues that plague our society and honestly it was humbling  You can rationalize that poverty is bad and that marginalizing a huge section of society is wrong but you dont really feel that until you actually see it for yourself in person  For that I thank the church,0,cdniz66,1rhz5o,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

SpHornet,Many organisms have similar genes that differ in sequence in certain unimportant structuralcoding regions of that gene Some of those sequences look more similar then others So you get clusters of sequences that look more similar and other clusters that are similar within their cluster but more different then other clusters and some sequences that just are very different from the restthis could just be coincidence when you look at differences in a group you will always find this But the problem is for creationists that we didnt just look at  gene we looked at many and all those genes showed the same clustering This shows all organisms are ordered in a specific way and not because these sequences have slghtly different functions and contribute to small changes that define the groups Like I said in the beginning these are unimportant parts of the genes we can change them and nothing changes in the organisms themselfesNow the argument If god or anyone intelligent created the DNA he would not use slightly different genes that are also slightly different in unimportant parts in a way that suggested similar animals would have the same changes we would expect the unimportant DNA to either be all the same or differ at randomYet we find that not only that those clusters match in every gene those clusters also correspond to same evolutionairy tree that was already proposed by morphological analysis of species And again very important these small differences are not responcible for the morphological differences because we can change them at will and nothing changesFor god to have created DNA like this he would have intended to make it appear organisms evolved So either life evolved or god wanted to make it seem it did either way why wouldnt you believe it didAlso the more they are related the more these genes seem to line up along the chromosomes,0,cdnpt40,1rixqa,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

BuccaneerRex,First off you cant exactly be forced to do it You can be forced to attend the classes and to go to the ceremony but if you tell the priest you are being forced under threat to participate he probably wont do it Youre supposed to enter into the thing of your own free willAs to what you label yourself dont worry about it One of the things about being an atheist is that all you have to do is not accept the existence of a deity as claimed by others Some people around here have really strong feelings about labels but theyre just adding on their own baggage The standard advice for young atheists who are still under their parents control is to keep your mouth shut If the natives rub blue mud into their belly buttons you go right along and rub that mudTheres no such thing as magic and there isnt a god listening so there is no reason to not participate if it saves you trouble Let them cast their silly little magic spells and just go along with it At your first opportunity you can walk away as long as you can support yourself,2,cdntsdw,1rj4wz,atheism,top_week,6.0,4

ca,I think it is a fine ideaI do attend a UU church as an atheist and enjoy it Many of their sermons come down to two big issues relationship and community two things missing in the very individualistic atheist worldI can see why Atheist Assemblies would appeal to some for those two reasons alone I would go if there were one near me I like the UUs but I dont really care for the religious aspectsI think a good question is Why do people attend churchOf course the religious go to worship andor praise God and to seek eternal life But there are other reasons as well to show gratitude and reverence to belong to a communityAtheists humanists agnostics skeptics the spiritual but not religious and even some Christians who dont fit in with the various flavors of Christianity available in their neighborhoods might like to place and time to meet up Sundays are the traditional time we have done that here in the US so Sunday it isMany people attend church less for the religious aspects and more out of habit for family sometimes to hide their nonbeliefBut having a secular place where like or even unlike minded folks can discuss the big ticket issues in life such as why are we here and where are we going seek fellowship celebrate good fortunes and losses and garner a sense of support and belonging to engage with others politically and morally to express gratitude andor reverence for this awesome life we have and to discuss and ponder what it means to be human and consider our obligations to each other well that just cant be a bad idea for those interestedSomeone said life is not an individual proposition  Sunday Assemblies would be a good place to connect with others For many of the nonreligious it would be nice to have a group to belong to that doesnt involve fake stuff or faking stuff,0,cdo45cr,1rju35,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

MisanthropicScott,Whose death is a good question that should not be ignoredWhen dealing with the death of a loved one there are three possibilities The person died after a long bout of suffering Having seen upcloseandpersonal that there are indeed fates worth than death death can sometimes be a relief Imagine quality of life as a scale from  to  where  is perfect health and  is death hence not part of the quality of life Quality of life can actually go negative This is when life is worse than death In such cases death is an improvement in condition Read the lyrics to the theme from MASH which were never played on the TV show Theyre quite uplifting and comforting for those of us who have seen worse than death An untimely death These are the worst deaths with which we sometimes must deal There is precious little comfort to be had from religion or nonreligion in such times Family members of mine have lost faith at times like these All one can do is cling to the loved ones who are still with us and grieve together I dont have any great advice here However I can say that religion in such times is actually downright scary Were I to have religion at this point Id be thinking that some god or other actively had it in for me and my family Id be looking over my shoulder wondering what was coming next In a better place With the sick god who just took my loved one from me Thats not a better place Thats worse Someone who goes peacefully at an appropriate time There are times when someone has not suffered unduly has never had their quality of life go negative and simply dies preferably in their sleep Here I would grieve the loss of life of course And yet I would honestly feel some hope that I might have the same opportunity when my time comesLastly there is ones own death Many people fear death and have trouble dealing with the fact that death means oblivion To me I just imagine the way that I felt before I was born or even conceived Why would I fear that As I was for the first  billion years of the universe so I shall be againI do not fear deathI do however fear fates worse than death My big fears are always about the road toward death and what it may entail near the end To that end I have made a living will I hope that my lawyer has correctly worded my living will to say the legal equivalent of If youre reading my living will pull the plugThe idea of having air pumped through the meat that used to be me for many months or until my money runs out is my own biggest fear I take comfort in the fact that as an insulin dependent diabetic I have a reasonably painless way out involving a very large dose of insulin far larger than the one that left Sunny von Bulow in a coma for  years Unfortunately this requires me to be conscious and in control at the timeBTW for atheists writing up advanced directives talk to your lawyer about the fact that hospitals need not honor them One extra bit of protection that may or may not help is to put in a clause that if you are ever taken to a hospital that will not honor your directives you wish to be moved to one that will as soon as possible This may help give your family some leverage to get you out of a Catholic or other religious hospital that believes in preserving life at all costsDeath is always a tough one I hope Ive given a bit of help Atheism will never give you the questionable benefit of being able to deny mortality On the upside it does make life more precious when you know that this life is all we have,0,cdo1w1n,1rk2ps,atheism,top_week,3.0,3

oldviscosity,gt I follow the Catholic churchYoure not clear on which of the Churchs positions you accept or reject so Ive got to give a blanket answer Dont take it the wrong way if you do already reject some of the following issues So anyway the Church as you may or may not agree advocates some pretty irrational positions with detrimental consequences For example its position on contraception abortion homosexuality protection of child molesters outright insistence on maintaining a number of bizarre taboos and womens ranking within the church If you were to reject the Churchs position on these points then you be a better person by default no effort required You may feel the same you know there may not be any immediate feedback with your new found beliefs but because we behave according to our beliefs then intrinsically the affect of your behavior will have a more positive impact on the world than if you were to behave according to the Churchs beliefs on these issues There can be no better metric of goodness than that I think,0,cdo3c9o,1rk4vw,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

Diknak, You dont need to suck up to us here to prevent from being downvoted  Most posts from religious people are treated kindly as long as they are condescending and offensive of course Do you give money to the Catholic church  If yes and if you really want to be a better person stop immediately  I have no problem with religious people I am married to a practicing christian and there are a lot of good churches out there but the catholic church is not one of them  The church is the epitome of corruption and immorality  Take that money and give it to a good charity instead thats what I do Atheists dont have a belief system because there is no dogma that we subscribe to  It is simply the rejection of magic and unfounded claims  I reject your god for the same reason you reject Zeus Odin Buddha etc  Because of this every answer you get from us will be different My perspective love everyone  I dont mean love them like a spouse but love the idea of them love them for who they are and what the represent and never deny the freedoms that you so freely enjoy  Its really that simple  Unlike your belief I believe this one life is the only one that we get so make it countMy main problems with most christian sects including catholics is the extreme hypocrisy  Love thy neighbor is preached in one breath and in the next breath it is preached that gay people dont deserve to be married  If you step in the way of peoples right to peruse happiness you do not love them  There is no such thing as loving the sinner not the sin it is complete and utter bullshit  Another example is that of contraception  The church will tell you that it is gods will if you get pregnant and birth control is going against gods will  Yet they have ZERO problem with viagra  If it was gods will he would give you the ability to get a boner and taking viagra is going against gods will the same way that contraception is,0,cdo5i17,1rk4vw,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

Wingflier,Ive definitely rethought monogamy since I became an atheist For many years after I left Christianity the concept of monogamy never even occurred to me as potentially flawed It was only after I began to study the divorce rates of industrialized nations that I really began to notice that there was a problemTo me the question is whether monogamy actually produces the most happiness and success for the individuals There is also the question of children and what is most beneficial for them as well However as a person who has no plans on having children this is not a factor for me I recently read a study which seems to prove that unmarried couples are happier in general than married couples httpnewshealthcomlivingtogethermaybementallyhealthierthanmarriagestudyThere have also been societies in the past which did not put such a strong or mandatory emphasis on monogamous relationships and which were quite successful in spite of thatOne reason I despise the idea of monogamy in the st world is that nobody is truly monogamous anyway What we have is known in psychology as serial monogamy In other words were monogamous with one person until were tired of them or theyre tired of us and then we search for someone else to be monogamous with When you look at it from this perspective monogamy just seems ridiculous to me Ive seen so many examples of women men too who are extremely nice and caring to me and who I have daily conversations with until they get a boyfriend after which they disappear off the face of the Earth They will continue to avoid contact with me until that relationship with their new boyfriend ends after which they will come back into my life acting like nothing ever happened This wouldnt be that concerning if it had happened only once or twice but it has happened to me countless times In fact I think its a bigger part of our American cultureAs a person who studies and adheres to the Buddhist philosophy and as a person who is mastering in Psychology I think that jealousy and possessiveness are two of the worst characteristics any person can display especially when it comes to their mental and emotional health and the heath of the relationship While I also disagree with polygamy as I feel that it puts women in most cases into the position of secondclass citizens I do wish people in America and other st world countries would reevaluate their stances on marriage and monogamy when clearly they do not work exclusively speaking Perhaps a culture that was more loving less jealous and less possessive would be a healthier happier one,0,cdo6py7,1rk5z6,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

MyJokesArentFunny,Marriage and the concept of monogamy being the norm was created by humans  Essentially polygamy is the true norm as it is in our primal nature  Naturally men and women have urges to have sex with attractive people whether they have a partner or not  It is an involuntary response to sexually attractive stimuli which we acquired from our ancestors down the evolutionary line who did not practice monogamy as ritually as we do todayIts a little crazy when you think about it how finding one man or woman to be your husband or wife is considered the normal thing to do  Because of our natural instincts I do not think less of people who are polygamous or who are in unorthodox relationships  I prefer monogamy though as I like the feeling of having one special person to care for,0,cdobfwy,1rk5z6,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

MalakElohim,As a fellow Australian and Atheist keep your grades up Since youre planning on getting a university education and going white collar dont give a crap about school captains student council etc at high school Employers arent going to look at what you did in High School if they have  years at uni to look atThis isnt like the states where quality universities will go through your achievements and tuttut over them Ensure your ATAR or equivalent is high enough to get into the course you want or at least a related course then you should get a CSP and be done with all the religious crapThat said if you go to the right government school their education is as good if not better than the religious schools I did High School in Victoria in Bendigo in particular and there were  schools in total where I could do my VCE HSC equivalent Bendigo Senior Secondary College Girton Grammar Catholic College Girton was Anglican Girton had by far the best average marks across the board but their marks were matched by BSSC on raw numbers Of course BSSC had far more people and accepted anyone Catholic College had an average similar to BSSC but no where near as many high performersDo your research you might be lucky and have a decent government school nearby or you only have access to shit ones its a lottery but if you do think about moving there it sounds like it might be worth it to get away from the bullshit religionThat said if you want a high paying job to improve your chances go into a STEM degree especially Engineering or Medicine or Law Essentially professional degrees where they directly qualify you for a jobits illegal to do the job without the relevant degree Aim for a Group of  University if possible Will the education be any better than a nonGo uni Probably not if youre dedicated But that doesnt really matter for that first job its getting in the door and reputations count for a lotIf youre looking for an ArtsCommerce degree good luck getting a job unless youre rocking Acturial studies or are doing it as a double degree that said CommerceArts is GREAT as a double with Engineering it gives you downtime from Engineering subjects lessens the stress levels and gives you the opportunity to study things that are interesting to you Also heres an example Im an Engineer which is why my examples all revolve around it If you cant get into say an Engineering degree do a closely related Science degree to the type of Engineering you want to do It might push your degree back  semester which can be made up over summer breaks but it gets you in the door Getting INTO uni is the hardest part of getting into the degree you want Keep your grades up through the first  months to a year and you can transfer uniscourses tldr focus on getting into uni for your goals your school activities are virtually meaningless to getting into uni and eventually final employment,0,cdo4l2g,1rkfxo,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

scornucopia,gt Atheists say that the burden of proof lies with the person making a positive claim that something exists Again many other alternatives Not really Whether something exists or not is a purely empirical matter Either there is evidence that it exists or there is notWhen entertaining such claims there are essentially only two rules we can apply either we work on the assumption that an existential claim X exists is false until we have empirical evidence that it is true or we assume that it is true until we have empirical evidence that it is falseIf someone says leprechauns exist we assume thats false until someone shows us a leprechaun If we apply this rule consistently we dont have to admit the existence of fairies or goblins or gods without evidenceIf however someone says God exists suddenly the shoe is on the other foot and were expected to assume that its true until we can show evidence that its not But if we apply that rule consistently we then have to admit leprechauns and goblins until we can disprove them too This is untenableThe only rational rule for existential claims is that we assume that they are false until there is empirical evidence for the claimed thingIf you apply one rule to leprechauns and goblins and the other rule to God you are guilty of special pleadinghttpenwikipediaorgwikiSpecialpleading,0,cdoget6,1rl7kh,atheism,top_week,4.0,4

Thestrangeone,Once again depends on how you define god And if youre trying to define god into existence then it is not begging the question as you had assumed but rather moving the goalposts You see we can argue against the bible and its claims of infallibility inaccurate historical descriptions and all around just some absolutely awful advice so if you define god as the bible or Koran or book of Mormon or some other holy text then it is easy to disprove him But when you define god as a bland and generic creator or higher power thats when moving the goalposts come in Because a bland creatorhigher power does nothing to speak to any of the claims of the bible or any other similar holy text Also most if not all of the arguments for the existence of even such a poorly defined and vague god are riddled with logical fallacies If you want to believe in a god that is your choice but simply know that it is indeed a choice It is not a decision made out of a rational consideration of the evidence but on a purely emotional level and in some cases despite the evidence You choose the god that is familiar to you just as the muslim chooses the god that his parents taught him or the Hindu chooses the gods that were taught to him Even if you werent born in a religious family the supposedly tolerant America tends to have an attitude that Christianity is the only true religion and all others are false So if you are in an emotionally vulnerable place the first person that is going to race to stuff your mind full of nonsense will most likely be a Christian Theres a reason conversion stories often have a bottoming out part Its the emotionally vulnerable place where intellect is put aside for the sake of pure emotion So many arguments from the cosmological argument to the watchmaker argument to the ontological argument all involve pure appeals to emotion rather then any actual data supporting any one religion Yet all monotheistic religions claim to be the only true religion Gets a little suspicious after a while,1,cdotr3u,1rl7kh,atheism,top_week,3.0,2

Hicrayert,This is exactly what my comment said yesterday Sorry if im not doing this right but im new to Reddit Here is my comment on the post of Atheists Take IRS To Court Over Preferential Treatment Given To Religious Organizations I am a complete atheist but I am also a political science nerd Now in my personal views I dont agree with the fact that religious establishments get tax writeoffs But what everyone seems to forget is that its not just the churches but all nonprofit organisations This means red cross charities across the country and if the atheist were to unite and create a nonprofit group that solely benefits atheist then that wouldnt be taxed either This was written in to the bill of rights and is a intertwined with the st amendment and will probably never change and i like thatThe true problem is when so called nonprofit organizations start intermingling with politics As soon as a penny of their nontaxed collected money starts lobbying for their favorite probably catholic politician then that is where the problem lies But as far as in general no I dont have a problem with taxexempt churches because of the history with the positive outcomes of nonprofit organizationsI know most atheist will disagree with this but that is the beauty with being atheist it comes with the ability toI just wanted to share this sorry its long  ,2,cdolmne,1rlz0g,atheism,top_week,4.0,2

ELSenorGuapo,Back story I grew up in a Christian household hell I went to a Christian School until I was in th grade I ended up marrying a girl from that school with  children nowfor me it was my Dad dying of Cancer it was the first death I was ever exposed to It really really shook me and for the first time in my life I asked why did he deserve this He smoked earlier in his life but had quit for years the next question was simply what kind of loving god would put someone through this and from there I got angry because the answers I found were it was because of original sin Simply put my Dad died of Cancer because some bitch and asshole ate an apple they shouldnt of  years ago From there it was very simple I started questioning everything from the basic stories of the Arc to Jonah to Jesus I mean seriously for years how the fuck did I believe someone got every animal on the planet into  boat and fed them for over a month and kept them or a fish swalled a man for  days and he was ok or shit a woman somehow became pregnant magically I mean seriously we all know what it takes for a child to be conceived From there it I realized just how much of a bigot I was for having a belief that homosexuality was wrong that they were going to burn in hell for what they are I then thought about other religions and how each religion thinks they are right and then thought why I am right it was chance I was born where i was so a person living in a remote jungle on the other side of the world who is not exposed to Christianity would burn in hell because they were not exposed to itFor me really came down to  basic question Does this make sense I then applied it to a lot of what I was taught and came to the conclusion that I could no longer accept that there was a specific religious god i actually do not believe there is any kind of supreme being because frankly it did not make any sense Im still very early in the process of becoming an atheist so its all new to me but thats how i got here,0,cdonucc,1rm8c1,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

xKaylaTaylor, First letting your wife knowWhen I decided that I should tell my SO about my change in what I identified myself as I started by telling them that Im not sure what I believed in was true anymore I moved that conversation towards that I could not call myself a Christian anymore and instead am an atheist to simplify it because most people wont understand agnostic atheism Humanism or skepticism Of course it will come with a negative reaction most of the time if they are truly Christian and arent keeping their nonbelief from you I encountered many fights over that fact that I changed religion to nonbelief including my SO saying that I was lying that I was joking that my SO did not need to know that nonbelief was an option and my SO saying I was still Catholic Just prepare for some fights and the storm will eventually settle Most people will get over the fact that you arent Christian and understand that it doesnt matter unless they are a extremely rightwing Christian morals come from Christianity Gays will burn everyone must believe what I do Most Christians these days arent rightwing and will accept people who they are no matter their religious or sexual preferences so hopefully your marriage wont have but a tiny bump discussing your newfound nonreligious identify Second raising your kidsThink about how you grew up Chances are you were born into a family with both parents believing in Christianity since you hinted towards your wife being Christian as I did and we managed to make our way towards AtheismAgnosticism That being said we are probably two of the few that make it past that I dont think that if your wife starts wanting you and your children to attend church that its the end of the world You can always talk to your children and tell them to be skeptical of what they hear from others to always ask questions and come talk to you if they need any helpI am sorry you had to deal with the stress of realizing everything you grew up with about your beliefs may not be true but I am happy you took the red pill I can only hope that your children and maybe someday your wife will also take the red pill Good luck with this and Ill send some positive energy your way,0,cdoows9,1rmb0r,atheism,top_week,4.0,4

Thorwwyccun,Heres my experience as far as InLaws goFor one it was a bad idea to just come out and say in essence Yeah were having sex Hot steamy bangin sex And shes tighter than an overapplied tourniquet Thats their kid and even if you just said Yes were having sex the above is precisely what they will end up hearingAs for the hostility back off of the mother Next year if youre still together propose going to meet with your family Its not unheard of to alternate years and your Gfs Mother should be understanding in that given this year you visited them its only fair she visit your family next year The next year after that if youre still together give her Family another round If theyre still hostile then simply stick to visiting your family but allow the Gf to visit hers with the option of coming with you to visit yours Or why not start doing your own private Thanksgiving DinnerforTwo When the Mother begins asking why you dont come for Thanksgiving Dinner anymore simply have the Gf explain Hes sick of the hostility he gets treated with so rather than come and spoil everyones holiday by putting them in such a bad mood he has excused himself from our presence Perhaps if he were treated a bit nicer when he was here instead of being glared at all the timenow who wants DressingAs for Mother hurting your relationship on down the road it would depend on how tightly knit her mother is with her and how seriously Daughter takes her mothers suggestions in this arena I am assuming your Gf knows about you being an atheist If Gf loves you despite knowing this she should love you enough to stick up for you should people start badtalking you behind your back Theres no reason why MotherinLaw should interfere with your own life but it happens and people let it happen You cant control what goes on under her roof but under your own you make the rulesIn junction with your Gf I hopeI think if you drop the reveal at this point though you stand to gain little and lose quite a bit Dropping the aBomb at this point would ensure the hostility would most likely continue and from what I see youre wanting to build bridges not incinerate them Save the BigA for a time when things are a bit smoother Something we may be overlooking is that its entirely possible that this hostility is not intended Its a wellknown social dynamic in Pack Structures Which are quite similar to Human Family Structures that outsiders are potential interlopers and thus not to be trusted until they have earned the approval of the Pack Despite our evolution into intelligent social primates we still have quite a bit of that reptilian brain left over just enough to keep us acting on feral instinct when we are not aware of it Sometimes its a good thing like when we get that gut feeling not to go down that dark alleyway before we realize its a dark alleyway Other times it leads to inconveniences Hence why I suggested the above scenario of alternating visiting years That way it gives you time to work out precisely why shes being hostile because despite appearances its possible she may not even be aware shes doing itJust some food for thought Hopefully shell realize that a shes not losing a daughter shes gaining a son and b acting hostile assuming the two of you are devoted enough to break from the Pack and forge your own path is just going to lose her both,0,cdow37m,1rmqxq,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

adamwho,If you dont want to click on an FTB link here is the articlePart Neither Veil nor SubmissionMaryam NamazieThe niqab and burqa must be banned to protect womens rights and secularism  and not just out of concern for security Its a shroud strait jacket and mobile prison for women and girls who are bound and gagged and made invisible According to Algerian writer Karima Bennoune the veil represents the everencroaching fabric erasure of womens bodiesCalling it a right and choice is as formal as formal can be when it is often deemed compulsory and imposed and policed by Islamists  often using brute force Also lets not forget the veil is a tool like many others to control and restrict women and girls To me saying it is a right and choice is like saying FGM the chastity belt footbinding or Suttee are suchA ban is not a violation of the right to religion Whilst the right to religion and belief is absolute the right to manifest and express ones beliefs can be and is at times restricted for a number of reasons including protecting public security health order and the fundamental rights and freedoms of othersMen in Shia Islam might have the right and choice to marry four permanent wives and unlimited temporary wives for example but it is nonetheless banned in many places because it is deemed to be exploitative Uniforms are another way in which the right to dress is restricted in society for health reasonsThe European Court of Human Rights confirmed this when it ruled in favour of Turkeys right to ban the veil at universities now under question due to Erdogans efforts to Islamicise the country If dress can be restricted to protect health or public safety why not to protect womens rights and secularismMoreover rights often conflict with one another What about the adverse impact of the niqab and burqa on the rights and choices of unveiled or differently veiled women It is not as harmless as is often portrayed In the Shabina Begum case the House of Lords granted that restricting Shabina from wearing the jilbab to school was permissible in order to protect the rights of others who feared being coerced into veiling As Algerian sociologist Marieme Helie Lucas says The right to veil is always followed with the right to beat up women who do not Clearly the right to veil has a corresponding right to unveil or not veil at all The unveiled or improperly veiled woman is always held up adversely in comparison to the chaste veiled womanMoreover this is more than merely a question of dress It is important to remember that the niqab as well as the burqa and the veil in general is a highly contested political and social symbol Many Muslims or those labelled as such are at the forefront of the fight against the burqa niqab and veil  often at great risk to themselvesIn Iran the slogan neither veil nor submission has become a rallying cry in the ongoing fight between women and Islamic regimes morality police In another recent case in Sudan Amira Osman Hamed who faces flogging for refusing to wear the hijab says Im Sudanese Im Muslim and Im not going to cover my headIn this day and age the veil in general and the burka and niqab in particular are associated with Islamisms efforts to limit rights and impose Sharia law The enormous increase of veiled women and girls across the world and in Europe is a direct result of the rise of the contemporary Islamist movement and the ensuing pressure on women and girls to veil Women are always the first targets of Islamism And veiling restrictions on women is a particular signifier of things to come The lawyer putting forth Turkeys case for restricting the veil at universities said it well the hijab is not just a dress but a sign of political conviction it shows near and present dangerA good case in point is Madani Free school in Derby where girls as young as  have to wear the burqa all teachers including nonMuslims must wear the veil Those who criticise the fuss over a piece of clothing miss the point The niqab and burqa are the most visible signs of Islamisms war on women It also represents sex apartheid and Sharia law and all that follows In Madani School burqaclad girls must sit in the back of the classroom On school trips they must give way to boys and male teachers who cut in front of them in queues Music is banned As an aside child veiling is tantamount to child abuse In the same way that children are not labelled Conservative or Marxist children because of their parents political beliefs children should also be free of religious labels and faith schools until they are ready to make a choice of their own upon reaching Calling for a ban on the niqab or burqa is not about criminalising Muslim women anymore than banning FGM criminalises girls and women who are mutilated Whilst a ban wont solve everything there has yet to be a single prosecution with regards FGM changes in the law including bans are important steps in changing culture and attitudes and defending rightsMoreover calling for a ban is not about cultural imperialism or colonialism Islamist efforts in many places are forms of colonialism too The burqa and niqab are not traditional forms of dress but newly imposed ones for a majority of contexts Plus there are bans on the niqab or veil in a number of countries outside of Europe This is not about East versus West In Egypt the Ministry of Health has prohibited the wearing of the niqab by nurses in hospitals Egypts top Islamic school alAzhar has issued a ban on wearing the niqab in classrooms and dormitories of all its affiliate schools and educational institutes Al Azhar also obliges women to show their faces in court via a decree issued in  In Iraq the niqab has been banned by a fatwa In Kuwait women wearing the niqab have been banned from driving In Azerbaijan and Tunisia veils are banned from public buildings and schools In Syria until recently teachers were banned from wearing the niqabUnfortunately many secularists in Europe have shown a lack of clarity and moral courage when it comes to banning the burqa and niqab Secularism is a human right as philosopher AC Grayling says and one that needs to be actively defended promoted and articulated it is a fundamental precondition for womens rights and equalitySecularists have a responsibility to seize the initiative particularly given the farRights attempts at hijacking the issue to promote their antiimmigrant and antiMuslim bigotry Calling for a ban is not in and of itself racist though racism and prejudice are very real and need to be opposed on par with sex discriminationA ban has nothing to do with a clash of civilisations it has everything to do with a global struggle between secularists including many Muslims on the one hand and theocrats and the religiousRight on the otherA Manifesto against Totalitarianism which I signed in  with  others including Salman Rushdie on the Danish cartoon controversy still applies todayWe reject the cultural relativism which implies an acceptance that men and women of Muslim culture are deprived of the right to equality freedom and secularism in the name of the respect for certain cultures and traditionsWe refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of Islamophobia a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatisation of those who believe in itAnd to that I must add the wretched concept that confuses a criticism of the niqab burqa and veil as a stigmatisation of those who believe in it and wear

HermesTheMessenger,Do religious organizations foster good deeds  YesDo people act positively in society for religious reasons  YesThats not in dispute  Though is there a good reason to promote religious organizations and individuals beyond how they already promote their own virtues Is religion a netpositive on societyI say it is not and I think that the case that it is not can be made with using the best available evidenceHere are some of my notes and some databases that can be used to check the evidence httpwhywontgodhealamputeescomforumsindexphptopicAlso we can ask questions about morality  Here is a repost of mine on that topicWhat you are asking is that we trade good deeds done to one group for bad deeds done to another  or in this case done to the same group  While I see the need to compromise I want you to realize that what you are asking is unethical even if it results in some people benefitingConsider this If religion is a netnegative and I think it is demonstrably a netnegative then why not criticize it as a whole without having to constantly say there are some good things about it  There are plenty of good things about the tobacco industry yet that does not mean that those good things should be emphasized in all discussions to have some sort of balance or fairness  My notes including databases that can be used to examine the issue httpwhywontgodhealamputeescomforumsindexphptopic In addition I pose this question to many religious theists How many good deeds done to one group of people make up for the bad deeds done to anotherThe answer may seem so obvious that it is silly  It should seem obvious  Yet it is not  The issue of vicarious redemption or forgiveness permeates some religions ex Jesus died for your sins you can ask God for forgiveness for deeds done to others Here are some comments that I made in another thread with the above part in contextIf you walk out of a grocery store and a kids club has a table where they are selling cookies should you buy the cookiesIf you know nothing about the kids club you will casually make an assessment and buy them depending on your mood what your views of kids clubs are andor what they are selling There are no special responsibilities involved and no deep moral issuesYou may even get a lift out of supporting what you see is a small contribution to the grand effort at building tomorrows leaders You feel responsible for their success however small your individual contribution Every bit counts after allYet lets say that you learned earlier in the day that the kids club will use the profits of the cookie sales for their summer camp program to help with a soup kitchen and to fund new robes for the local chapter of the KKK Ku Klux KlanAssuming that you see the last item on the list as a bad thing do you have any responsibility for that bad deed  supporting the KKK  if you buy the cookies Are you only responsible for the good Do you have no responsibilities either way If so did that change from before your learning where the money went toTo expand on the example lets say that you were a kids club group leader and up to this point in time you were completely unaware of the group giving donations to the KKK for the robes As a group leader in the club do you have a responsibility for the donations from before What about the donations from this time forward If you do and you think that the KKK robes are a bad thing then what do you do to meet your responsibilities Do you even have any Where do you draw the lineTo put it another way How many good deeds are needed to pay for the bad deeds done to other peopleAs an example if I mug you and put you in the hospital is that OK if I work as a volunteer in a recovery clinic helping other people but not you fix their disabilities,0,cdp02lr,1rncsw,atheism,top_week,2.0,2

MartinTheRound, When europeans came to the americas they encountered an entire continent full of people that didnt have the same spiritual connection They had a different spiritual connection Some people have a spiritual connection to nature and not gods Some people have a connection to art that could be called spiritual That only means that as social animals we have certain needs to feel connected to something As for the probabilities he simply doesnt understand what hes talking about  But when I see many religions each claiming to be the only answer and none of them providing anything better than I am right because I have a book that is right that says that the book is right what I conclude is that all of them are equally invented If and when one of them can be verified externally I would reconsider but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence If someone told you yesterday I ate grapes you wouldnt find it difficult to believe but if he continued with and then I went to the toilet and when I was done what I found out what came out was solid gold you would have a hard time to believe it If someone said there was a guy who preached I find it easy to believe and if he continues with they killed him and he came back to life I find it hard to believe What would it take for your pastor to believe I excrete gold after eating grapes If he believes it just based on my claim I have some more claims for him God could have given Adam a choice without giving him a choice to sin God could have prevented Adam from sinning like when he demanded the sons life but at the last moment he made it stop But god didnt  But wishing there was a nice little story doesnt mean there is one some of those letters are forgeries many of the christian traditions were purposely thrown out because of an editing process well after jesus and every of his followers were dead What about the council of nicea why was there a council needed to establish what the truth is What about Marceon who made his own bible What he should do is study the history of the bible from a historical point of view and not just choosing what he accepts based on what he already believesAnd I believe the bible says somewhere that some of the people around jesus would live to see the kingdom of god Someone please help me with which passage that is That verse alone proves that either the bible is wrong jesus lied we already live in this kingdom or we have some very old people running around Which one is it,0,cdpda0o,1rncwt,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

BuccaneerRex,Your first problem is thisgtAs atheists we can proudly say that we have questioned the existence of God and certainly religion itself We have used our critical thinking skills and curiosity to look beyond what others have told usThis is not the case for everyone Some people never accepted the existence of a deity in the first place therefore have nothing to question Some of us have never been a member of a religion And as annoying as it is some people are atheists merely because nobody ever taught them religion they never reasoned their way into or out of anythingYou do not require a deity to have a religion this is true But your definition of religion is more of a definition of Abrahamic religion not all possible religions Not all religions include afterlives Not all have a central text Not all believe their deity is the creator They do all generally include moral prescripts so thats one Not all include eternal punishments of the ones that do include afterlives And some do not believe that any deities interveneIts a good start and defining terms should really be the first effort of any intellectual activityBut religion is an extremely broad catchall term and you cant really define all possible members of the category in five bullet points,0,cdp9sre,1roh7u,atheism,top_week,6.0,6

Thestrangeone,I think a better place to start is why you chose Christianity Because I cant truly address your misconceptions if I dont know what they are But starting with the limited information I have I will address the exact words you said Your first misconception which is rather common is that atheism is a choice implying it is a religion It is neither of those things Atheism is first and foremost the rejection of all deistic claims If you ask me why I reject the god of the bible which I assume the title of Christianity means that specific god I would first ask you why you reject Allah or Vishnu or Xenu or Zues Because if your answer has anything to do with faith let me tell you something there are people out there who have the exact same amount of faith and certainty that you do in fact some of them even more that believe that one of these gods are real So now the question becomes how do you determine which is true Because that is what would matter if it mattered at all I mean if the bible is wrong and Islam was true then you could see where calling yourself a Christian could become a problem for youThink about the radical muslims who engage in acts of terror How much faith do you have to have in order to strap a bomb to your chest and detonate it I bet you that guy is pretty damn convinced that his religion is true And if it is true and yours is wrong once again you can see where you might end up running into a problem somewhere You see the thing that you dont understand is that you are actually an atheist as well You do not believe in Allah you do not believe in Zues you do not believe in Vishnu Im betting you know pretty much next to nothing about hinduism yet you instantly reject it without knowing a single thing about it Back in the Roman times the christians were the athiests as they were denying the deistic claims of the emperor All Christians are actually atheists as they deny many many deistic claims often without ever considering them There is only one difference between you and me and that is I deny  one more god then you do By the way nondenominational many Christians would view you no better then an atheist as they would believe you to have just another one of the wrong religions Some Christians take those denominations very seriously to the point that they view everyone who doesnt agree with them as heritics see baptists and catholics and going back to your point about seeing no problem with science that doesnt actually tell me anything I know another christian that tells me that same thing yet he also believes in a literal  day creation along with the idea that Noahs flood actually happened and all of the other supernatural events of the bible actually happened So Im going to need a little more than that So Id like to know your position first in order to properly explain my position as I cannot explain something if I dont know what you actually know yet You are coming in with some very clear and obvious misconceptions and I need to know what those are before we end up having a big misunderstanding about what we actually think A nondenominational christian who sees no problem with science really doesnt tell me that much about what you actually think or why you think it And I need to know that I need to know what your methods are for determining truth and whether or not you care if what you believe is true,0,cdpezv8,1roxnm,atheism,top_week,54.0,54

Aberu,I will spare the common answer to this which isnt the answer you are seeking The whole we didnt choose atheism kind of thingTo answer the question how did I become an atheist which is the implication of your question it was because I wanted to rationalize the things I believed I was raised Southern Baptist Moved around to many nondenominational churches seeking answers for conflicts that I saw in each branch that I had arrived at previously I converted Mormon since a good friend of mine was Mormon and opened me up to listening to the missionaries They had answers for why the bible seemed conflicting edited for power and profit grabs etc Then the next logical step was to question the Mormon church after being baptised for some reason my skepticism wasnt honed fully yet I found it difficult to question the Mormon church without every source being tainted by Christian apologist writers and their criticisms or Mormon apologists and their responsese of those criticisms I couldnt find a verifiable independent source I dont remember what I found since its been about  years but I found a pretty independent source and it opened me up to thinking very critically about what I believed I used to wear a religion like a badge amongst many badges on my vest and I never felt like it was the most important thing to know anything about Just one of many things I felt I was expected to have an opinion on and expected to have a belief in something And I thought it was a given to believe in God but I always assumed everyone else believed in God in some form or anotherAfter questioning Mormonism I approached a kind of Deism and was firmly opposed to religious institution I had a deist friend bridge that gap comfortably for me in the same circle of friends as the Mormon friend Then I discussed my ideas with a coworker who I respected greatly a british born Californian punk rock bassist who was there washing dishes with me at the pizza place as a fellow delivery driver He got me to the point to ask myself How do I know what I think I know In other words he was requiring me to rationally justify the existence of a deistic god to him through logic I couldnt and I started sliding slowly into becoming an Atheist over the next year First time I admitted I was an atheist was after hearing a debate that Christopher Hitchens did I dont remember who it was against it was a while ago and he just made very good arguments to embrace what I had already been feeling that I was an atheist He was a brave voice that made me much more comfortable with being outspoken about it and outspoken publically against irrational beliefs That was my introduction to me enlightenment I dont like calling it this but I dont know a bettter wordHope that gives you a unique perspective but I assume most others peoples posts are similar in essence,0,cdpkm72,1roxnm,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

gidikh,Mine started with the  commandments  The one thing in the bible that god supposedly wrote himself  He starts off by saying for I the LORD your God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me  then proceeds to wrap up the commandments by telling us not to be jealousenvious of our neighborsThe first thing that struck me was that this supposedly perfect being gets jealous  I dont get jealous beyond thinking someone is a dbag for hitting on my wife in front of me  But this all powerful all benevolent god gets jealous enough that he punishes children grandchildren and great grandchildren if someone doesnt love himI then proceeded to start reading the bible objectively and wow the god of the old testament is such a dick  Even if you skip all the parts where god is helping his chosen people btw choosing a small tribe of illiterate nomads out of the entire world as your favorite seems a little weird to me but whatever floods your planet kill rape and pillage their neighbors you still have stories of god screwing people over for no other reason that to prove how great he is  Read exodus pharaoh is ready to give up and let everyone go but god hardens pharaohs heart just so god can unless his plagues and get the credit for freeing the slaves  Those plagues by the way include slaughtering the first born of each family include babies unless of course you painted your door with lambs blood because god apparently couldnt tell the difference between his people and the egyptians  This is just one example of manyThen we move into the new testament and suddenly god isnt as much as a dick any more  If god is perfect why would he have a mideternity crisis and suddenly become the cool dad  Jesus shows up and has some pretty good things to say but then they have to throw in some pretty pathetic miracles   Your average doctor has cured more diseases and saved more lives by several orders of magnitude greater than jesus did  My favorite was using his omnipotent powers to save a run to the liquor store during a weddingSo after being thoroughly disenfranchised I started looking at some of the other major religions and found flaws with those as well  I then came to the realization that if there was an all powerful deity that cared whether or not we knew of it and worshiped it there wouldnt be any sort of doubt  It could easily come up with a way to get all its laws and such distributed to its creations that doesnt include having a bunch of illiterate desert dwellers witness something that takes them several decades before they find someone to actually write it downThis lead me to the conclusion that if there is a super powerful intelligent being that created everything it doesnt care about us Or much more likely we are just a random fluke of natural processes,0,cdpnbfm,1roxnm,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

NukeThePope,Funny thing this morning I came across a Guardian article which tried to paint Russell both as a closet theist and a eugenicist I got a strong impression this was an attempted hit piece This isnt surprising its normal particularly in the US but not unheard of elsewhere obviously as the article shows to dig through the trash looking for stuff to saddle the other side with Hell thats a big part of what we do here in ratheismHeres a few thoughts of mine hopefully clarifyingIn an intellectual environment of theism the idea is that everyone and everything is formed by God When you leave that environment ie think as an atheist its almost a nobrainer to consider that the breedingforexcellence humans have been doing with animals for thousands of years could and likely would also work with humans As intellectuals came out from underneath the shadow of the churches this became a legitimate topic for thought and discussion Im not surprised that Russell considered it thinking about stuff like this was his job after allAnyway my point is that yes because this kind of thinking was anathema to most theists  youre more likely to see it associated with atheists Interesting exception Hitler Germany was  theistic CatholicLutheran officially nearly as hostile toward atheists as Jews and yet did a lot of thinking and some practical work on the topic of creating the ideal German The German Aryan movement displayed a weird mixture of national patriotism religiosity with some NordicPagan influences and pseudoscientismGetting back to Russell I dont know that his alleged support for eugenics isnt exaggerated in that piece from Vice What does seem apparent from a brief jaunt into WikipediahttpenwikipediaorgwikiBertrandRussellsviewsonsociety is that after noodling on the topic for a bit he was no big fan of eugenicsgt Russell later criticized eugenic programs for their vulnerability to corruption and in  he condemned the unwarranted assumption that Negroes are congenitally inferior to white men Education and the Social Order Chap This mention of eugenics programs led me to looking at the role of eugenics in the USA as a whole I highly recommend the article on Eugenics in the United StateshttpenwikipediaorgwikiEugenicsintheUnitedStates I was a little shocked to see thisgt Eugenics was widely accepted in the US academic community By  there were  separate university courses in some of the United States leading schools enrolling more than  students which included eugenics in the curriculum I find it hard to believe that this was a field worked only by atheists It was quite apparently a societal fad at the time asgt Several feminist reformers advocated an agenda of eugenic legal reform The National Federation of Womens Clubs the Womans Christian Temperance Union and the National League of Women Voters were among the variety of state and local feminist organization that at some point lobbied for eugenic reformsTheres more on eugenics advocated by organizations in the deep South and Im willing to bet these werent exactly hotbeds of atheist thoughtMy conclusion This is like saying that slave ownership in the US was an atheist thing because Thomas Paine was an atheist and slave owner Russell was singled out because he was a vocal atheist Pieces like the one you linked try to make it look like this was his idea Condemning atheists today for intellectual work done by not only atheists a century ago from which all of society eventually learned a better understanding and rejection of eugenics is a cheap shot viciously unfair and deeply antiintellectual I feel the authors should be ashamed of themselves for it,0,cdpi4hc,1rpa5a,atheism,top_week,6.0,6

Greghole,Theres nothing in the bible that says you should baptise babies  Baptism in the bible was a way for people to publicly declare their faith and trust in god  Its something you do not something that is done to you  The Catholic tradition of infant baptism was a loophole to get dead babies who never had a chance to accept Jesus into heaven instead of purgatory  The official position of the church has changed and they no longer teach that unbaptized children get punished  Basically anyone under five years old goes directly to heaven  If youre not willing to tell your grandparents that youre not a catholic just tell them you dont see any point to infant baptism since they decided to let dead babies into heaven,0,cdpzoyn,1rpngg,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

ReyTheRed,There are two ways of knowing that I am aware of Deductive logic starts from a few assumptions for example we assume that inference works that modus ponens holds etc and there are other axioms that can be adopted for various purposes and then under those assumptions we can prove things with certainty The weakness of this system is that it relies on our rejection of absurdity Our axioms are considered strongest when the negation is most absurdScientific reasoning is a bit different in scientific reasoning we come up with the simplest possible explanation then expand the field of testing as widely as possible In science we accept things tentatively and do our best to get them thrown out Each real test a theory passes strengthens it But again this is based on the rejection of absurdity and also on a more practical usabilityWhen it comes down to it the only two modes of reasoning that Ive seen make any sense rely on rejecting absurdityAnd if you dont reject absurdity there is no god because tomato is left brick,0,cdpmqjd,1rpqas,atheism,top_week,1.0,1

Rixxali,Atheists dont believe in godsThats it Thats it about our beliefs As for your question I will answer not as an atheist since the question has nothing to do with my nonbelief in gods but as someone with a little bit of knowledge about scienceA theory in science means that the idea has a LOT of evidence and NO evidence that contradicts it A hypothesis is an idea that does NOT have a lot of evidence for it If evidence is gathered for the hypothesis it eventually becomes a theory if all evidence shows it to be correct However people usually use the word theory to mean any old guess or idea that explains something As you can see the word theory means two different thingsTherefore it is unfair to use the word theory in one sentence with two separate meanings Theory for scientists is NOT the same as theory in the common vernacular The Flying Spaghetti Monster is NOT a scientific theory At best its an unproven hypothesis Just like any other religion If scientists and mathematicians are looking for a grand unified theory it means that they have some reasonevidence to believe that it MIGHT exist And to determine whether it really exists or not they are doing experiments and such looking for evidenceComparing scientists who are experimenting and figuring out how reality works and trying to determine the truth of whether a certain concept exists or not is NOT the same as believing an idea with absolutely zero evidence that its true So no believing that a unified field theory may exist and looking for it  is NOT the same as believing in a supernatural being,0,cdpq05e,1rq2pi,atheism,top_week,3.0,3

berfner,It seems to me that you have lost your faith in the enterprise of Religion not in the innate understanding of something larger out there  When you look around at the world and universe it seems so completely improbable that this was all the happy accident of some big bang that we cannot explain  However this human understanding of something larger has been hijacked into religion for two purposes to control people and make money  Just because you dont have faith in religion should not stop your quest to come to an understanding with the universal question of what is the purpose of lifeThis is not a blackwhite issue either accept the doctrine of religion completely or accept that there is nothing  There are infinite alternatives between these two positions  ,2,cdpt1rz,1rqgkk,atheism,top_week,2.0,0
