Lawlish,Full time seven year employee of WalMart here I couldnt thank Colbert enough for talking about these problems When it comes to wages I make just a bit over k WalMart is testing a new scheduling system call FixedFlexed when people who opt in for flex scheduling are only able to grab at additional hours that the stores have available but theyll get better discounts and Merritt raises This is going  to push more people into part time positions so WalMart wont have to pay for medical benefits retirement etc,36,cdjk2wb,1r4epp,politics,hot,265.0,229

cmdiii,OKHas anyone done an analysis of Walmarts pay scales versus Targets or Kmarts or Home Depots for that matter the momandpop gift shop down at the strip mall  If they have I havent see one  Or could it be that everyone in the retail business with the possible exception of Costco is paying their employees crap and the unionists are going after the biggest target looking for the biggest headlineWalmart isnt the problem its a symptom  The problem is that there arent the number or quality of entrylevel jobs out there for lowskill workers  Racking boxes on a shelf or punching register keys is a great job for a teenagers first job but for a yearold single parent laid off from their factory or finance job not so much  So rather that beating on Walmart and the retail sector in general how about having a dialogue on how to create good jobs with good wages  You know the kind that we used to have with career paths and futures that sort of thing  Give these people somewhere thats not Walmart to work at and two things will happen  there will be more money in the economy for people to spend and  Walmart will have to raise their wages to retain employees who would otherwise be defecting to better jobsI worked in retail for eight years  Retail is fine as as job  But once you get past say  or so you need a career  And retail was never intended to be a career,39,cdjorqc,1r4epp,politics,hot,49.0,10

DrKlootzak,It seems to me that serious news unfortunately does not attract viewers so in an economy where everything is based on profits journalism suffers To make a profit news are compromised in one of two major ways either news are sensationalized and biased and journalist ethics abandoned or viewers are attracted through comedy where news are presented in the form of satire I love the Colbert Report and the Daily Show but it is a shame when comedy shows hold a better journalistic standard than news agencies ,4,cdjrtdj,1r4epp,politics,hot,12.0,8

myusernamesux,The issues with birth and abortion can never be solved with black and white absolutes  Until it is all done in a testtube the burden is inordinately on women  For a women to have a baby she gives up not just nutrients and comfort but potentially a career the ability to support herself or even her life  There are definitely inequities in the what rights the father has  He should have the right to say whether his own child is bornin a fair world  But it is not a fair world   There is nothing fair about the way a baby impacts a woman compared to a man and nothing right now can change that  Any woman who has an abortion in a blase manner shouldnt be a mother anyway and for most it is a difficult highly personal decision  Its simply not anyone elses business  Protecting a fetus at the expense of the mother is not protecting life  It is trading one for the other,1,cdjy39b,1r4wbh,politics,hot,6.0,5

BrutalTruth,But the prolife position whether or not it is based on religious orthodoxy is more ethically highly evolved than my own tenet of unconstrained access to abortion on demand My argument as in my first book Sexual Personae has always been that nature has a master plan pushing every species toward procreation and that it is our right and even obligation as rational human beings to defy natures fascism Nature herself is a mass murderer making casual cruel experiments and condemning  to die so that one more fit will live and thriveHence I have always frankly admitted that abortion is murder the extermination of the powerless by the powerful Liberals for the most part have shrunk from facing the ethical consequences of their embrace of abortion which results in the annihilation of concrete individuals and not just clumps of insensate tissue The state in my view has no authority whatever to intervene in the biological processes of any womans body which nature has implanted there before birth and hence before that womans entrance into society and citizenshipOn the other hand I support the death penalty for atrocious crimes such as rapemurder or the murder of children I have never understood the standard Democratic combo of support for abortion and yet opposition to the death penalty Surely it is the guilty rather than the innocent who deserve execution What I am getting at here is that not until the Democratic Party stringently reexamines its own implicit assumptions and rhetorical formulas will it be able to deal effectively with the enduring and now escalating challenge from the prolife right wing Because prochoice Democrats have been arguing from cold expedience they have thus far been unable to make an effective ethical case for the right to abortion Camille Paglia Author FeministAs a conservative I see abortion as a necessary evil It is for those who cant or wont take birth control or use condoms They choose to subject themselves to the hormone roller coaster ride and guilt associated with an abortion rather than taking precautions It is their choiceMake no mistake it is wrong It has bad consequences for the woman ,5,cdkadf5,1r4wbh,politics,hot,7.0,2

bondtg,First the filibuster was not one of the intentions of the Founding Fathers and was not included in the Constitution In fact the filibuster was an unintended future consequence from a Senate rule changeThe filibuster is inherently undemocratic and was typically not an issue in the past as it was used very infrequently with the exceptions of some wartime policies and Civil Rights Today it is used orders of magnitudes more by Senators in an attempt to hold the Senate hostage to give into minority demands Bonus info The reason it is called the nuclear option is due to the fact that Democrats were filibustering Bushs nominees so the Republicans at the time were threatening to get rid of filibuster rules In response to that the Democrats said that they would do everything in their power to bring the Senate to a halt creating a metaphorical nuclear winterFor those wondering I am not a Democrat just a guy trying to educate some people,2,cdk9qsw,1r5hmq,politics,hot,8.0,6

juicius,One of the things that must happen in a case like this is that the local defense bar has to get in and use these incidents and footage to chip away on the officers credibility in thorough and sifting crossexaminations Probable cause is a low threshold It basically says that itself probable A lot of things are probable I can tell you  probable things right now and make  of them be lies And it is predicate to any arrest and defense attorneys as a whole are skilled in exploring that issue because if you kill probable cause you kill everything else after that as a fruit of the poisonous treeSo an officers perception of probable cause is always relevant and probative which means that if Im a defense attorney trying a completely unrelated case but with the same Miami Gardens officer I can bring up his arrests of Samson or other people around this store I can question how his probable cause in those incidents are flawed and whether he applies that same flawed standard to my case I can probably spend good  hours grilling the asshole and watch him squirm all that in front of the juryMaybe thatll help my case or maybe it wont Every case being different is true It may be that even with crappy untrustworthy cops as witnesses there might be sufficient evidence to convict my dude But at least the asshole will walk away with those glorious  hours in the hot seat burned into his memoryDo that to enough cops and enough cases and sooner or later it will change even without any directives from the top A couple of issues Its not always easy to mobilize people for doing something that is not immediately beneficial to them defense attorneys not excepted If I have a marginal case for the state then attacking the cops credibility always pays dividends But by the time a case gets to the trial level very few of them actually are because the state is able to weed those cases out by pleas or dismissals So if I have a case that would be very difficult to win it may not pay dividends for me to antagonize the cops I may do better by leading them to a conclusion I likeSecondly the prosecutors and the judges may not like it and slam the door making it a battle each time to introduce it This rounds back to the first point For little or no benefit would anyone be willing to fight this at the preliminary levelBut if it works its a more effective solution than a civil rights lawsuit It crowdsources the fight distributes it,3,cdkgzvp,1r6zix,politics,hot,13.0,10

Cruciverbalism,Sexual Assault statists in the military wouldnt look nearly as bad if those statistics didnt count sexual harassment the same as they count a rape forced sexual contact via verbal physical or psychological abuse Sexual assault and sexual harassment are two different issues to me and while both are unacceptable one is definitely worse than the other You also have to factor in how many of us live We are constantly stressed most days are a stones throw from our breaking points and we tend to destress via alcohol and partying I think a lot of sexual assaults in the military involve alcohol and usually they would fall under the classification of a mutual assault both parties were too drunk to consent This is part of the party culture that younger off duty service members have Removing alcohol from the military would reduce some of the statistics and separating the statistics would make the issues more easily resolvable via targeted resolutionMaybe I am to close to the issue as I am Active Duty but the way they are resolving it now isnt effective and its not likely to get more effective until they have resolved issues such as the drinkingparty atmosphere the chain of command issues hes a good insert branch here or light slaps on the wrist and separate sexual assault cases from the chain  ,0,cdktgo6,1r7orp,politics,hot,1.0,1

BurgerBoyBarry,I think theres a deeper sociological reason why Americans hate their government and its all about the concept of Us and Them If you have a minute allow me to explain In the UK we traditionally had three seats of power the church the monarchy and the people  Henry VIII basically got rid of the church leaving two seats of power the Monarchy and the People  Then Oliver Cromwell tried to get rid of the Monarchy to leave just the People but crucially the People brought the Monarchy back but with no power  So what I hear you cry  Whats the point of an impotent Monarch  Well it satisfies the basic mammalian desire to split society into Us and Them  We do it monkeys do it dolphins do it its a fact of life  Having a monarchy lets us British assign the Them label to a group with no power over us it satisfies our basic mammalian desire and lets us identify ourselves with our elected government  Americans on the other hand cant do this so they assign the Them label to their government even though its made up of people that they voted for from their own ranks  And that ladies and gentlemen is why Americans will always hate their government,2,cdkkm9z,1r7q8n,politics,hot,4.0,2

Gates,Seems like democrats arent much better I submitted the following links on HR  to Rep Mike QuigleyThe bill HR  or the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act would severely limit the reach of Sec  in DoddFrank which requires banks that are eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Federal Reserve lending discounts to spin off their derivatives activities into separate corporate entities that would not be eligible for federal assistanceAccording to the New York Times lobbyists from Citigroup played a major role in the bills creation Citigroups recommendations were reflected in more than  lines of the House committees line bill Eric Lipton and Ben Protess write Two crucial paragraphs prepared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks were copied nearly word for word Lawmakers changed two words to make them pluralhttpwwwforbescomsitestomgroenfeldtbanksledbycitilobbyhousesuccessfullytolimitdoddfrankonderivativeshttpswwwgovtrackuscongressvoteshHere was his responseI voted for HR  because it improves derivatives regulation by increasing the transparency and oversight that were the hallmark of the Dodd Frank Act Many regulators and economists agree Section  is problematic because in its current form it would actually create a MORE dangerous environment in which swaps would trade because they would be removed from the heavilyregulated bank holding companies and put into lessregulated environments Further HR  does not allow depository institutions to deal in the type of structured assetbacked swaps that contributed significantly to the economic collapse of  As Barney Frank himself said it addresses the valid criticisms of Section  without weakening the financial reform laws important derivative safeguards or prohibitions on bank proprietary tradingHes on the Subcommittee on TARP Financial Services and Bailouts of Public and Private Programs Its also notable that he voted against an audit of the Federal ReserveNow admittedly I dont know enough about these complex issues to really make competent observations but it sure seems like the current congress is more concerned about instituting the facade of regulation and mitigating the backlash against their most treasured constituents like financial institutions than actually protecting the American taxpayer,0,cdkmy9r,1r7u7o,politics,hot,4.0,4

imatschoolyo,Math teacher jumping in hereHonestly Im not against dropping Algebra  as a graduation requirement and many in the math teacher blogosphere agree with meDont get me wrong I see a lot of value in math education obviously and Algebra  is the foundation of higher level math such as CalculusHowever for noncollege bound students Algebra  is basically punishment Students would be much better served if they had to learn both basic financial math easy stuff like balancing a checkbook as well as harder stuff like how the stock market works etc and statistics Those things would make more informed citizens would help prevent things like predatory lenders being able to take advantage of undereducated consumers etc Those types of maths are applicable to more career paths than Algebra  isAlgebra  is also the place where we start divorcing math from the realworld meanings Algebra  is all about rates of change and slope and relating variables and seeing what happens to one thing when you change something else Everything in Algebra  can be modeled to real life For many things in Algebra  you have to do a lot of stretching to get it to relate to real life and there are very few good answers to the question of why do I need to know this in my life Because honestly You dont If you dont find the material interesting then you should learn it to become better at learning hard things Thats about the only reason If youre not a science engineering or math person as a grown up youve most likely forgotten all the Algebra  you learned or are functioning quite nicely without using what you do remember As a plumber you probably dont care about synthetic division of polynomials As a polisci major you probably dont need to understand how inverse functions are reflected across the line y  x to function Keep in mind these are all minimum graduation requirements I would encourage those who enjoy math or learning in general to take Algebra  PreCalc and Calculus I think its a shame however that not being able to pass Algebra  would prevent someone from getting a high school diploma ,63,cdkhs2s,1r7z5u,politics,hot,325.0,262

KriegerHLS,There was actually an essay making the argument for dropping Algebra II as a high school requirement in Harpers Magazine a few months ago Requires a subscription so I wont bother to link it The basic thrust was that while we may want STEM graduates in our future the students who will be STEM graduates are going to take algebra II anyway but for everyone else it has a demoralizing effect that reduces performance in school overall It adds a lot of stress and takes a lot of students time and effort that creates an adversarial relationship with school all for students who have no natural aptitude for mathematics and who will not become scientists and mathematicians in the futureI think its very easy to have a kneejerk reaction like Oh theyre dumbing down school this is stupid But were not heading towards some futuristic society where everyone will be a scientist anytime soon One size fits all does nothing to help students in the real world College bound students should be taking algebra II but those who are not college bound will be better served by spending their time and effort on vocational subjects and finding something that they enjoy that fits with their abilities Algebra II should be a requirement for college entrance not high school graduation Those arent the same thing,23,cdki9sp,1r7z5u,politics,hot,98.0,75

Andrew, I can count up the amount of money I have spent on health care as less than  dollars over the last three years  Now I find myself with a government that thinks it can force me to buy a private product  The cost of this private product as found on the government website ranges for me from  to  dollars not a year but every month  This increases my health costs from less than  dollars over three years to  every year  This represents an  increase of my health care costs  Based on my income the fee for me not carrying insurance would be less than  dollars which represents an increase of  increase of my health care costs  I am not ignorant of the consequences of not having insurance  But the fact is that  of people will never use their catastrophic coverage  That percentage goes up even more when accounting for my particular demographicI see no reason why I should pay for the issues others have incurred over their lifetime through a lifetime of smoking drinking and doing drugs  Furthermore I will not be bullied by ANYONE into spending my hard earned money in any other fashion than I choose least of all a dysfunctional  party government who is owned by big corporations and special interests  Ill pay my tax penalty but thats it,17,cdkxioa,1r81qz,politics,hot,31.0,14

FortHouston,Last year the GOP tried something similar in many Texas counties  They tried to schedule primary elections onto the same day as municipal elections which is in May for many Texas towns  They wanted to force Republican amp Democratic primary election judges into the same room while implementing municipal elections that are supposed to be nonpartisanIn Dallas amp Tarrant Counties the matter was brought before the County Executive Committee of each party  Of course the Republicans voted for their plan which was stopped by votes from the Democratic CEC in each county  As a result many towns in Dallas amp Tarrant counties are moving their municipal elections from May to the same day as the general election in November  This saves taxpayers a lot of money and ensures nonpartisanship at the polls  Meanwhile the primary elections will be held at the same time in separate facilitiesThe moral of the story  Some of this crap can be stopped at the county level even in a redstate like Texas  So get involved with your preferred political party,9,cdkk581,1r86ai,politics,hot,35.0,26

deaconblues,gtAny discussion about raising the minimum wage needs to recognize that small employers often have to operate under very slim profit margins and will have the hardest time absorbing these higher labor costs They will have to find more revenues or trim costs to make up the difference This reality is never part of the discussion Furthermore indexing the minimum wage to inflation means that employers will likely be faced with automatically increasing labor costs without an automatic increase in revenues or profitsThese discussions always eventually come around to What about the small business owners what if they cant make a profitMy reply is Then they fail and someone else who can make a profit in the existing climate will take their placeBusiness owners dont have a right to success  They have a right to try to succeed but if theyre doing that on the backs of their employees by paying them a pittance then I dont have a lot of sympathy when the business owners go underMeanwhile my girlfriend works for a company that is just barely turning a profit and they still pay her more than minimum wage  If they can do it other companies can too,28,cdkkkm0,1r86hk,politics,hot,117.0,89

SailorBexar,I cant help but feel like this event more than anything reflect an utter failure in American politics The only real winners are those who see politics as some battle to the death between forces of good and evil instead of an art of governingI think there is a legitimate place for the use of filibuster to block a nominee if the president insists on trying to force through a choice that is extreme But the key word is extreme and filibusters should accordingly be rare because extremes theoretically are rareDemocrats during the Bush Jr years increased the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees above historic norms Republicans  most noisily and notoriously wanted to change Senate rules to abolish filibustersWhen their turn came in the minority Republicans not only reciprocated but escalated  to the point that half of the filibustered nominations in US history have come in just the past  yearsI think its fair to call what has happened a perversion of the intent of those who originally passed the filibuster ruleThat doesnt mean I think its right to make it almost impossible to filibuster presidential nomineesThe Republicans have a point in saying that they will use this new weapon to the fullest extent when they have a chance Once they have the power theyll forget that theyre calling it a power grab todayThe Democrats have a point in saying they reasonably suspect that the Republicans would have exercised the nuclear option once they regain the majority no matter what the Democrats did today Maybe theyre wrong but given the way things are these days I cant blame them for their suspicionIt all just provides further reason to believe that our country is becoming ungovernable,10,cdl3twr,1r93vj,politics,hot,22.0,12

Isellmacs,Mobile redirect warning Text below for easier viewingA federal district court judge has declared unconstitutional a portion of US law that allows a minister of the gospel to not pay income tax on a specific portion of their compensationUS District Court Judge Barbara B Crabb of the Western District of Wisconsin ruled that the socalled parish exemption which allows religious ministers to avoid paying taxes on the value of their housing granted to them by their religious employers violates the establishment clause of the US Constitution and must be discontinuedThe law  US C   has been on the books since The tax exemption was estimated to cost US taxpayers  billion from  alone likely more in the years sinceHeralding it as a major federal court victory the Freedom From Religion Foundation which brought the lawsuit along with their copresidents Annie Laurie Gaylor and Dan Barker offered an explanation of yesterdays rulinggtMinisters may for instance use the untaxed income to purchase a home and in a practice known as double dipping may then deduct interest paid on the mortgage and property taxesgtThe Courts decision does not evince hostility to religion  nor should it even seem controversial commented Richard L Bolton FFRFs attorney in the case The Court has simply recognized the reality that a tax free housing allowance available only to ministers is a significant benefit from the government unconstitutionally provided on the basis of religiongtCrabb wrote Some might view a rule against preferential treatment as exhibiting hostility toward religion but equality should never be mistaken for hostility It is important to remember that the establishment clause protects the religious and nonreligious alikegtThe  bills sponsor Rep Peter Mack argued ministers should be rewarded for carrying on such a courageous fight against this godless and antireligious world movementgtI agree with plaintiffs that  does not have a secular purpose or effect wrote Crabb adding that a reasonable observer would view it as an endorsement of religiongtCrabb wrote that the exemption provides a benefit to religious persons and no one else even though doing so is not necessary to alleviate a special burden on religious exercisegtAll taxpayers are burdened by taxes Crabb noted Defendants do not identify any reason why a requirement on ministers to pay taxes on a housing allowance is more burdensome for them than for the many millions of others who must pay taxes on income used for housing expensesOne study has estimated that in total combined religious tax exemptions cost American taxpayers  billion each yearThe Foundation sued Jacob Lew Secretary of the Treasury Department and Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Daniel WerfelThe ruling which you can read in full below notesgtIt is DECLARED that  USC   violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States ConstitutiongtDefendants the government are ENJOINED from enforcing   The injunction shall take effect at the conclusion of any appeals filed by defendants or the expiration of defendants deadline for filing an appeal whichever is laterIn other words the ruling right now is on hold until the appeals process is completeIt is not known if the government will appeal but expect a fullthroated attack from the religious right demanding the law be rewritten to comply with the Constitution,0,cdla6iu,1r9bor,politics,hot,1.0,1

Whynekid,I was homeschooled until th grade and I hated it towards the end  I just found it kind of boring though it was nice being able to finish a days work by around noon  That said I do not think that homeschooling limits a child in anyway academically and the individual attention might help boost grades and scores in certain subjects  My fear is that it limits the childs exposure to the variety that the world has to offer  By the time that I went to public school I had developed a somewhat simplistic schema when it came to interacting with the greater world  this was likely just a result of lack of exposure  I quickly adapted and became a rather normally functioning adult  I would never homeschool my own childern if I ever have any preferring instead to enroll them in private school if that is an option or just actually being engaged in their education experience,1,cdldvvn,1rauaz,politics,hot,5.0,4

Joocemann,I think universal income would be abused too widely When it comes to social programs I am much more supportive of a direct funding connection between the program funding pool treasury and the intended expenses recipient lender landlord grocery store energy company etcI like the idea but I would like it in things like vouchers or credits You could look for a rental and show you have a voucher for X amount to go to the landlord each month and then show you have the personal income to make up the difference if youre going for a higher cost placePutting thousands of dollars directly into peoples hands is probably useful for many but will probably be mismanaged by many as well  Personal finance is not well emphasized anymore,7,cdmfu6w,1rci35,politics,hot,4.0,-3

principle,If a government stopped borrowing worthless paper from private central banks and instead issued interest free goverment currency then basic minimum income would be needed to combat deflation Money as DebthttpyoutubejqvKjsIxTThe problem with government issuing money directly is deflation considering that currently banks create  dollars for every  dollar US government borrows via treasury bonds To address deflation the government would have to pay everyone a basic minimum income  Its the upsidedown of what we have now To understand this paradox one has to examine the process of money creation When a bank creates a loan out of borrowers collateral like a house nothing new is added or created in the economy  The bank does not print the money it simply makes an electronic entry   This is why real money represents less than  of the total money supply in circulation  Also note that the bank did not create the amount of money corresponding to the interest on the loan which now has to come from the physical world What the bank did is add new money to the existing supply without backing the new money with corresponding value  The excess in money supply vs goods and services causes inflation  On the other hand when a government creates money to buy goods and services the new money are created along with newly created goods and services so there is no disbalance,11,cdlzmmw,1rci35,politics,hot,8.0,-3

debunkingbunk,California is however an especially useful test case First of all its huge if a system can work for  million people it can work for America as a wholeFirst this is really just the logical fallacy of begging the question Many Republicans have argued all along that the best solution is a perstate solution and there is zero evidence that the success of one large state implies success of an entire country look at current differences in education and testing scores between various statesSecond as an economist and numbers guy it is disingenuous of him to completely overlook the fact that the current enrollment ratios are well below the threshold of young and healthy necessary to avoid the death spiral He must just be hoping that the mantra of the young and healthy will sign up at the last minute is true,40,cdml3wp,1rev7s,politics,hot,15.0,-25

students,A sampling of the over  bills blocked by the GOP senate or not moved on by the Teapublican house since Obama took officeHR   Paycheck Fairness Act  While the Lily Ledbetter Act was a good start this bill would have mandated pay fairness and prohibited pay discrimination based on sex In other words while Lilys Bill made it easier for women to sue this would have created fair workplace system with regard to pay In other words Republicans voted in favor of paying women less money for the same job HR   Wounded Veteran Job Security Act  This bill would actually provide job security for veterans who are receiving medical treatment for injuries suffered while fighting in defense of their country It would prohibit employers from terminating employees who miss work while receiving treatment for a servicerelated disability Guess that answers that question they dont care about the troops either This isnt the only bill they have blocked having to do with the troops eitherHR   Radioactive Import Deterrence Act  This one has to make you scratch your head Basically this bill would prohibit the issuance of licenses to import of lowlevel nuclear material and waste to this country It specifically exempts nuclear waste belonging to the United States and it allows the president to make exceptions where necessaryHR   Veterans Retraining Act  This bill would provide for assistance to help veterans who are currently unemployed with their expenses while retraining for the current job marketHR   Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization  Once again you have to wonder what do Republicans have against those who have served our country This bill would reauthorize programs in support of homeless veterans to assist them with job training counseling and placement services through the Department of Veterans Affairs through  HR  Water Quality Investment Act  This bill would not only invest needed funds into improving water quality in areas where its needed but it would also create jobs for those who work in that industry HR   Disabled Veterans Home Improvement and Structural Alteration Grant Increase Act of   Heres another bill in support of those who have fought for their country passed by House Democrats and blocked from becoming law by Republicans Clearly Republicans hate the troops because there is no other reason to be against this bill This would increase the amount paid by the VA to disabled veterans for necessary home structural improvements from  to  for those who are more than  disabled and from  to  who are less than  disabled,35,cdmoocr,1rewyp,politics,hot,46.0,11

kosherpoultry,No one seems to have actually read this article  It spends considerable time discussing how the word profit can be misleading due to the unusual accounting methods required by federal budgetary rules  Without going into detail about those methods about which I am hardly an expert let me explain why it is mathematically impossible for the government to have earned B in profit from student loans in one yearThe total amount of student debt outstanding in this country according to the article is T  Assuming the average interest rate on this debt is  which is almost certainly too high given how many old loans carry a lower rate but which is a conservative estimate for the purposes of my argument the total interest earned on the debt is B  However the governments year borrowing cost is currently  which translates to a cost of B for a gross profit of B B  B  This amount which is already less than the B noted in the article does not take into account several important factors  First the government does not hold the entire T pool of loans  It liquidates approximately half of the loans generated each year by issuing assetbacked securities ABS through Sallie Mae  The government captures a portion of the gross spread value the amount calculated above through the sale of these securities but the portion captured is always be smaller than the full amount Otherwise no one would purchase the securitiesSecond the gross figure does not account for defaults  The lifetime default rate on student loans is expected to be a shocking  and the  year cohort default rate the actual year default rate for loans that entered repayment in  was   httpwwwifapedgoveannouncementsattachmentsDefaultRatespdf  A conservative slapdash combination of these figures suggests that annual defaults on the entire pool are roughly  translating to an annual loss of B bringing us down to a total profit of B  However this figure does not account for the discounts on sales of the ABSs or losses due to late payments timing really matters when you finance using ABSsSome of you are now crying But student loans are not dischargeable in bankrupcty so defaults dont cost the governemnt anything  This couldnt be farther from the truth  Just because the obligations arent discharged doesnt mean the government gets paid  If the borrower is bankrupt the government isnt going to see its loan repaid even if the legal obligation survivesThird and most difficult to quantify is the embedded cost of the subsidized rate  If the marketthirdparties provided rates lower than the governments then students would be flocking to borrow from the other parties  They are not  If I recall correctly more than  of student loan value is initiated by the government  This means that the government must be providing belowmarket rates and terms to most borrowers even at the high rates that they currently offer and is assuming an uncompensated riskcost that is not accounted for in this analysis  A certain amount of this ends up being captured through default rates but given that the defaultrelated figureds above are based largely on actual results the true degree of uncertainty is unknownIn the end these articles are designed to inflame and give people a scapegoat for the state of their personal finances  I take them with a massive grain of saltedit cohesion  ,43,cdmmepa,1rexe3,politics,hot,171.0,128

KerfluffleKazaam,Its amazing to me that people take these kind of articles at face value without any sort of context and these loan misconceptionsYes students can default on student loans its called not paying lots of loans simply go unpaidThe reason the government took on student loans is because private lenders didnt want to do it anymore especially after the crash so the government took on all the risk and little reward I doubt these profit numbers are actually profit when compared to the amount of unpaid loans that occur every year I mean I get wanting to enrich higher education by investing in our students and taking some of the financial burden off students but it confuses me when people in the comment sections set up the government as this racketscam trying to trick students when the reality is that they will work with you in almost any situation to make a plan that works for you Truly confuses me Their flexibility and locked in interest rates go well beyond what any private  lender would offer you especially if you didnt have the makings of a good credit score as of yet ,0,cdmkv9u,1rexe3,politics,hot,5.0,5

BeneficiaryOtheDoubt,Im dont think we should or can overturn of roe v wade but in examining the economic justificationsa st trimester abortion costs about  on average  Is that too much for a low income person too pay if it will save them in the long run  Would they rather accept the pregnancy as they wont be footing the hospiral bill anyways  Does universal insurance address this as theyll now be paying for their hospital bill and have to rake those costs into consideration  Id rather not factor in abortion as a health risk if its such a controversial moral issueContraception and educational outreach should be adequate I think  And even if it isnt hopefully it will spur us to increase the capability and efficiency of the our social safety net  When half the population thinks its tantamount to murder we shouldnt make it hard for them to make the choice to not subsidize it  Currently few plans in the exchanges are offered that dont cover elective abortions so the remaining plans force those consumers to pick plans that are otherwise inferior for their needsTo make a more concise point  Quality education a stronger safety net that enables parents to provide that and universal health coverage including contraceptives should be adequate in addressing  the issue of unwanted pregnancies  I dont think we should force anyone to subsidize elective abortionsEdit I am in favor of roe v wade  Not sure what I was trying to do with the wording there,6,cdnadjx,1rfeng,politics,hot,2.0,-4
Selcopa,Its always interesting to see the abortion topic come up on reddit who usually worships the late Christopher Hitchens everyone seems to forget that he was pretty strongly pro life Its also interesting to see how usually reddit is very proscience they tend to ignore the advancements in knowledge with regard to this topicMorally its really hard to argue that a pro choice slant is the morally superior side the science has taught us too much about the process of life so much that a prolife oriented position seems to be morally superiorIm not suggesting that we go balls deep and ban every single instance of abortion but it seems morally we would want to have a pro life slant to our laws and processes to protect our future generation of the speciesThere is no perfect answer to this problem and its a mockery for people to suggest that your position on the issue can be boiled down to a catch phrase like Im Pro Choice or Pro Life its far more complicated than that and dont denigrate it by making it so shorthanded We as humans should be doing as much as we can to protect the lives of our future generations improving sex ed and condom access to prevent as many unwanted pregnancies as possible having as much charity and assistance for children in poverty as possibleI can tell you the Michigan Right to Life does this including setting up daycares and helping single mothers finish their college degrees And as a last resort having the abortion optionIm all for womens rights and them having a choice but we also need to be protecting the life of the child who didnt chose this either however as I said this problem should be being addressed before someone is getting pregnant in the first placeAlso anyone who compares the US abortion laws to Haiti or the Dominican should be ridiculed and shunned thats ridiculously blown out of proportion and is a byproduct of the notorious circle jerk of the liberal slanted reddit here and no intelligent person should respect a post like that,5,cdmsysp,1rfeng,politics,hot,2.0,-3

RantsAtClouds,There are a number of reasons why Iran hasnt achieved nuclear fruition First and foremost is international pressure They paused their program from  in the wake of US military action in Iraq It was restarted again when it became obvious that the US was not willing to risk another major venture into the Middle East quagmire This upset the Israelis because they had constantly said that Iran was the true danger in the Middle East and not Iraq despite Saddams bankrolling of Palestinian terrorism Because of the fact that military action was not possible at that time the Israelis and the Americans used far more covert means to stop Irans acquisition of nuclear weaponry This took the form of the funding of opposition groups in Iran and training them how to use weapons including exiles They would take them over to Kurdistan and teach them a number of different tricks of the trade When it was believed that this was taking too long the Israelis began to take a far more handson approach They began to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists This began in  and has continued to this day That being said assassinations in Iran are often blamed on Israel and sometimes may be the work merely of opposition groups Whilst all of this was going on the NSA or CIA but most likely the NSA was working with an Israeli army unit called  This army unit specialises in SIGINT and attracts the brightest computer minds that Israel has to offer a huge amount of hitech startups in Israel have been formed by ex soldiers Over the course of a period of several years they developed a piece of malware called Stuxnet Stuxnet was one of the most complex pieces of malicious code ever assembled It also had a huge number of safeguards It would only activate if it was on a machine that had the specific operating system connected to specific hardware and was part of a specific network One computer security expert stated that The attackers took great care to make sure that only their designated targets were hitIt was a marksmans jobhttpwwwnytimescomworldmiddleeaststuxnethtmlramprefgeneralampsrcmeamppagewantedallamp All of this had the hallmarks of a professional statesponsored attack The worm was designed to spin centrifuges incredibly quickly whilst showing normal operations to the person who was looking over it However what OP and several commentators is implying is that conservatives have simply brought out Iran as a way to scare people into military action Theres some truth to that However theres also quite a bit of truth to the fact that Iran is heading towards nuclear weapons Iran has often said one thing and done another It has deceived the IAEA and openly acquired materials whose only use could be nuclear weaponryhttpwwwisisonlineorguploadsisisreportsdocumentsIAEAIranNovpdfAlong with this Irans continued sponsorship of proxy terror forces their relationship with AQ KhanhttpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticleARhtml and their role in the Syrian nuclear program along with North Korea means that the immediate neighbours Israel and Saudi Arabia are becoming nervous at this deal They believe that with the sanctions lifted Iran will simply go ahead and continue working towards nuclear weaponry TLDR Theres truth that Iran is one more year away from nuclear weapons Covert actions in the form of assassinations and cyberwar have delayed the effort by several years Irans nuclear weapons program is far more likely to be an actual nuclear weapons program than Saddams ,7,cdna52j,1rgebz,politics,hot,12.0,5

OctopusPirate,Probably going to get buried but as a liberal who doesnt want to attack Iran I have to speak out Theyre right even though theyre misleading the public and scaremongeringIran is a year away from a bomb quite likely less now and has been for years  Japan is also a year to five away from a bomb and has been for decades  And were okay with bothWhat being a year away means is that if the Supreme Leader gives the final goahead and he has not and Iran raced full speed for a bomb they could have one in a year  Iran is currently building up stockpiles of  enriched uranium and other materials that could potentially be used for a weapon the process is not linear and it takes much less time for the final enrichment steps  Based on their stockpiles and available facilities we know how long it would take them to reach those points of no return  If Iran maintained current stockpiles and added no new facilities they will always be one year or so away from building a bombIf they increase stockpiles or capacity this time will be reduced  If they have more centrifuges and material available then they could reduce the breakout time to a month or weeks  And they could maintain that posture no bomb but have the ability to produce one if desired within a month  Our media would then say Iran is a month away from a bomb for a few years and they would be rightSo yeah  Even though they are scaremongering it isnt contradictory to say they are a year away from a bomb for years on end  Its a statement of how quickly Iran could produce a bomb if they chose to race for one at full speed  Not a timer of how long until they actually build one from today,2,cdnduwh,1rgebz,politics,hot,2.0,0

ThrowawayXTREME,Unauditable does not equal fraudulent wasteThe expenditures are inspected approved tracked and recorded  The problem is that the financial systems of the DoD are largely fragmented and as the money flows from system to system visibility from the point or origin is lost  The spending within each system is tracked but the fact that the money can not be traced in whole is what makes the system unauditableI get sick of seeing this crap journalism where reporters completely bury their head in the ground and ignore the highly if not overly regulated procurement process and say that all the money is being flushed away because it cant be accounted for in a wholistic audit of disparate systemsIts really just a bunch senseless potstirring anyways because the DoD has already poured a bunch of resources into being audit compliant by CY  under FIARhttpcomptrollerdefensegovfiaroverviewhtml  Theyre already working on itFurthermore it is hilarious how many people dont understand this in the article comments and the comments here but that unaccounted for  Trillion that the author had to reach all the way back to  to find which as a  of total DoD spending over that period is very small isnt just sitting in a box somewhere that we can unlock and throw at public infastructure projects  Its been spent  We just cant trace where it went because the disparate systems dont talk to each other,66,cdnfzf1,1rht7d,politics,hot,93.0,27

war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it ongt Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished On the other hand the proximity of an army causes prices to go up and high prices cause the peoples substance to be drained away When their substance is drained away the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions With this loss of

before assassination httpmlkkppstanfordeduindexphpencyclopediadocumentsentrydocbeyondvietnamgtA few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor both black and white through the poverty program There were experiments hopes new beginnings Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched this program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything on a society gone mad on war And I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as suchgt As I have walked among the desperate rejected and angry young men I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action But they asked and rightly so What about Vietnam They asked if our own nation wasnt using massive doses of violence to solve its problems to bring about the changes it wanted Their questions hit home and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos

CodexAngel,Ill comment here the same way I did on FacebookAs a retail slave fuck this notion If people want to shop Ill work I can spend time with my family whenever What makes this one day so fucking magical Its one of the few days in the year I can make a living wage why do people want to take that away from me Yes most of my family will be eating dinner together And when I get home a little after six Ill join them Knowing that this one day I made over ten dollars an hour will make the turkey taste way better How about some justified outrage over how insanely underpaid retail workers are instead of how terrible it is that we have to work on a holiday People needed to get their priorities straight,33,cdnxkzh,1rip9d,politics,hot,37.0,4

ajagoff,Id like to add to this despite what the last portion of the article states convenience stores are NOT the exception to the rule  We have families wed love to be spending the holiday with just as much as the people in retail  My parents tell me stories about how in the s you made sure you had what you needed BEFORE Thanksgiving Day because you couldnt even buy gas for your car that day  And if you forgot something you needed for dinner you would have to god forbid ask one of your neighbors to borrow something  EVERYTHING was closed  Today I have customers who come in to my store like its just a regular day of the week to buy lottery tickets or a candy bar or cup of coffee then have he nerve to tell me they think it sucks that I have to work on a holiday  Then they give me the stinkeye when I tell them that if customers like them thought ahead and bought what they needed the previous day I wouldnt have to be there  When they realize THEIR PRECIOUS CONVENIENCE is at stake suddenly all their sympathy goes out the window  Thanksgiving is supposed to be about being THANKFUL for what you already have not about acquiring more and more  Take a day off of being a greedy spoiled consumer for ONE DAY  It wont kill you,1,cdo2cuu,1rip9d,politics,hot,6.0,5
PureLuck,I work at JCPenney and have to be at work at pmstore opens at  but we all have to be there at  so we dont get stuck in expected masses of people  am I have to come back that afternoon at pm pm to close Were not expected to be out of the store until maybe midnightam I then have to come in Saturday morning at am to open I wont be able to spend Thanksgiving with my family because of that whack scheduleThis is my first job and first Black Friday I wont just be at home eating day after Thanksgiving dinner or sleeping Ive never been shopping on a Black Friday nor ever plan to but I can say I already hate Black Friday,3,cdo2dj7,1rip9d,politics,hot,6.0,3

AmandarIsCool,Im picturing in my head one of those really moving and touching minute or minute and a half long commercials on tv by one of these really big retailersIt could have a solemn voice overtone some pretty and emotional music in the background The message would be employee and family oriented and say essentially that we are NOT going to open on thanksgiving like all the others do anymore just to have a competitive edge like all the other bad companies do They could have slow motion footage of families eating meals and throwing the pigskin in the yard Really hammer the point homeThe story and the commercial itself would go viral and be picked up by all the news folks It would get re aired over and over for free Its go viral on the net and on Facebook walls People would naturally fall for its message because EVERYONE knows what a hassle it is to go try to find good deals And since we are all lazy at heart wed love to be part of a movement to help out retail workers simply by doing what we love anyway eating rather than going out into the mad house that is holiday shopping day  Wed all proudly show our support in social media and boycott all the stores who are forcing their low income workers into that hell hole and walk around with smug looks on our faces Wed look at those idiot or greedy day  shoppers and believe ourselves to be better than them The best part is that I think this would be a rare chance for human nature to help out,0,cdo1njn,1rip9d,politics,hot,2.0,2

ecsa,With the help of sites like Slickdeals I get deals throughout the year that are much much better than black friday deals I cant be the only who has realized that the black friday deals gets worse and worse every year Why Because retailers know that most people are already conditioned to be out shopping regardless  All they have to do is slap deal or sale on something and some rabid shopper will fight to get it It always got me how people would literally come to blows over the laptop deals at walmart on black friday Did they not notice that those models werent sold any other time of the year Theres a reason for that that laptop selling for  is not a steal It is just an  laptop made with the cheapest crappiest parts possible Stores wont sell them throughout the year because the are so crappy but they dont mind using them as lures to get shoppers fired up on black fridayI will be keeping my butt at home and money in my wallet this black friday,0,cdo07v2,1rip9d,politics,hot,2.0,2

Foresight,Ive always doubted how effective this would be as blackmail or a form of attack How would you release the data Surely any report on the viewing habits of the target of this kind of attack would raise big questions about how the information was obtained I would imagine as long as its nothing illegal the average person would be far more concerned with the side of the story where NSA spied on someones personal computer usage rather than what that person was into Besides as a victim you could always deny it and it would be very hard for someone to provide proof without damning themselves of what most would likely consider a much worse action In this story they were going after radical Muslims How would this even work as a plan to discredit The targets could just tell their followers that the NSA was fabricating everything how could you trust information from an organization thats effectively admitting to spying on people by the nature of releasing such information and the target could play up distrust of the US Hell why would the NSA even go through the hassle of collecting such information in the first place it would be easier to fabricate it and would have the exact same effect The target should just deny it and then the followers decide whether they believe the target or the NSA it doesnt really matter if the information is true or not,5,cdo4wzs,1rjtxe,politics,hot,6.0,1

acore,The problem with this case is that while giving an exception to these employers of faith to provide contraceptives will not impose a huge burden on female employees it sets a dangerous precedent moving forwardIf employers can use their religious sentiment to gut parts of their healthcare they provide for employees then whats to stop exceptions for religious employers providing spousal benefits to samesex couples  Here were talking about maybe  dollars in birthcontrol a month but in my hypothetical the stakes are much much higher  The bottom line is I dont feel comfortable allowing regular businesses to be imbued with the essence of the religion of their founders  If these are truly separate legal entities that live in perpetuity then it doesnt make sense to give them the religious beliefs of their founders  Its one thing if the organization is truly religious like say a massive Christian soup drive but its entirely another matter if it merely sells glue and model trains like Hobby Lobby  People will argue that employees are free to move around the marketplace but most reasonable thinkers will recognize that in todays world workers do not have a litany of options  For now not too many businesses would adopt these type of religious tenants for its employees but imagine the social problem if say Walmart adopted such religious code banning contraceptives or samesex benefits for its million employeesBottom Line as long as we live under an employerbased health care system we have to ensure that employers arent dictating the healthcare services of employees and that includes religious beliefs,6,cdo5pzv,1rkefv,politics,hot,39.0,33

threetwomany,I dislike Walmart as much as the next person  but can someone explain to me why they even need to go to judges to keep people out of their stores  Isnt a Walmart store private property  Couldnt they just call the cops and have them removed for any reason  It would be different if they were trying to keep them from protesting at all but that doesnt seem to be the case  Again I dont like Walmart and dont shop there but it seems like their legal right to kick anyone off their property they dont want on it  ,1,cdo9806,1rkkcw,politics,hot,5.0,4

funchy,The whole premise of the article is based on what I think are very flawed opinions of welfare and food stamps Author writes Many welfare recipients are required to undergo drug testsIf employed professionals are able to fulfil their duties at work while also maintaining a recreational drug habit why should welfare recipients be treated differentlyIn many professions workers are tested for drugs doctors nurses any type of commercial driver equipment operator etc Any job where the employee handles or sells controlled pharmaceuticals eg pharmacist any job where worker controls equipment or vehicle that may harm others Security jobs  Jobs where applicant handles lots of cash Even working somewhere as mundane as home depot requires drug testing  In fact in the last year welfare recipients in Utah were found to test positive for illegal drugs at rates less than the national average This is more likely explained in one of two waysIt motived some people to give up recreational drugs  This is a win because if the person is in such dire straights to qualify for welfare they cant afford the luxury of recreational drugs    This is more money for them to spend  on essentials a win for their familyOr because people knew about the tests  those who preferred to use drugs made a choice of the drug recreation over government help  Perhaps they didnt need government help that much to begin withPerhaps the best example of the demeaning nature of the current welfare system  is SNAPAlcohol tobacco pet food and vitamins are only some of the products that those on food stamps cannot buy because the powers that be have determined that they know what is the best lifestyle for food stamp recipientsNo its not that a bureaucrat in some office somewhere is making more judgements on a person asking for government help  The author needs to look up what SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition  The program is designed to supplement the familys food   Alcohol and smokes are not a food   Food is a necessity  Beer and plastic cups and dog treats are not   How can you fault a food program when it was only meant for foodIf this is based on libertarianism what I admit I am confused on why wed push for higher taxation in order to make welfare and nutrition programs available to those who may not need it,3,cdomay5,1rkxmr,politics,hot,5.0,2

Drs,There is a huge misconception that the US budget is similar to a household budget a misconception that is pushed by people who want austerity But the US budget is actually nothing like a household budget and its scary how many people think it is Thats not to say we shouldnt try and cut back where we can but more importantly we should be looking for ways to invest in the future like education and infrastructure spending We used to build big infrastructure projects in times like this that not only spurred growth now but paid off for decades TVA Hoover Damn LA aqueduct highways subways but we do nothing like that now Then you look at education and it starts to get scary When we passed NAFTA everyone knew wed lose tons of jobs especially in manufacturing since one day it was not profitable to build factories in Mexico where you could pay workers a fraction of what they were paying workers then NAFTA passed and the next day it was enourmous lay profitable to build in Mexico We got some good things out of NAFTA but the whole key was wed be transitioning to a new economy which meant new skills were needed for millions so we were going to build up education spending to meet those needs that never happened Instead now to get those skills you either have to already be rich or willing to go a hundred thousand or so in debt That has to change On top of that we need to keep up about  growth to say the economy is doing good when was the last time we had  growth that wasnt really just a bubble Our complete lack on infrastructure spending is more concerning to pass to future generations than debt since at least that infrastructure can be used to spur growth and the same for education,25,cdp95g9,1rnia3,politics,hot,64.0,39

harbison,Austrian economists claim you cant spend your way out of debt  Actually you can  Its call investment  You cant not spend your way to prosperity  Thats the only truthTo make this easy for the simpletons to understand lets use the household analogy  Say your household is  in debt  In order to get out if this debt you stop paying your car payment stop paying your bills you dont any investment in stocks or anything of significant return and you bury your cash in the backyard  How the hell are you ever supposed to pay down the debt Especially considering you lost your job because you no longer have a vehicle This is what Austrians want to do with our economys he debtNow as for spending your way out of debt lets use the same household example  You current have  in debt you net  a month but youre spending   You make ends meet by using credit borrowing money which is further increasing your debt  Common knowledge says that if you spend more on crap and junk you will never get out if debt  However if you were to borrow a loan of  to make an investment for simplicity say a paper route  Its costs you  of borrowed money to start this paper route but the original  investment enabled you to start this business that nets you  a week profit  After a short time that  is paid off and you are now making an extra  a month because YOU ORIGINALLY SPENT A BORROWED   THIS IS WHATS KNOWN AS INVESTMENTInvestment starts as SPENDING  Good investments generate returns eventually greater than the originally money spent  IT IS BY THIS CONCEPT THAT ALL BUSINESSES ORIGINATE  This is how you spend your way out if debt  ,7,cdp4l3s,1rnia3,politics,hot,14.0,7

aradil,My biggest problem with this conversation is that no one ever mentions whether or not they are talking about anthropogenic climate change or not Presumably thats what this conversation is about There is a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is taking place and that climate change is largely related to the greenhouse effect which I was taught about in grade  in the mid s But in these conversations with conservatives its never mentioned I have spoken with folks who believe that there is a current change in climate including overall warming of the planet but arent convinced we have enough evidence to determine the cause  There are many of possible alternate explanations solar cycles natural atmospheric changes volcanoes etc The article discusses in the first paragraph a Democrat who has made statements about Republicans and others whogt say that the planet is not warming or if it is the warming isnt caused by human activityYet the study discussed in the article something that isnt mentioned until the summary of the article may have some problemsgt That term can also include people who acknowledge that climate change is occurring but dont believe its caused by humans Whitehouse is making a leap by suggesting that the League survey is a gauge of how all deniers are regarded by younger RepublicansSo what this means is that we as a group discussing this topic including the OP of this thread need to be clear what we are talking about And what we are talking about is anthropogenic climate changeOn the other hand I believe that whether or not climate change is occurring through anthropogenic means and is causing harm and suffering to fellow humans it is our responsibility to study research and act in any manner we can to prevent or at least mitigate it,17,cdpecip,1ro8nt,politics,hot,64.0,47

arguingwithmymonkey,I have been reading a lot of articles about Blackstone  Just because they have deep pockets doesnt mean they know what they are doingThe idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous  They cant maintain those properties properly  Each house has its own set of unique issues because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves  The people who cooked up this plan should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes  Oversight would be easier the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently  For all we know the reason they didnt go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual propertiesRemember the part in Upton Sinclairs book The Jungle where the family rents to own a property that is in fact just badly built with a cess pool underneath  This is what is happening againAll they are creating are slums in neighborhoods destroying the true market value of properties and denying regular folk the opportunity to own a home,25,cdpkf6e,1rpgir,politics,hot,65.0,40

ctjwa,Its not surprising that this article takes an antiinvestor stance and is chock full of misleading information  Its a slow day at work today so I thought Id write a few bullet points as I was reading through it Blackstone isnt owned by any of those banks listed  The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstones common stock ticker BX  The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund you own a portion of those BX shares which gets aggregated in that list  Not so evil The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter and safer  There are no more zero money down purchases  If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans then you cant also blame them for now not giving these loans  The besuited businessmen paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close  These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks or at large auctions  Not so evil  After buying the houses they are hiring property management companies contractors and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible within  days  Thats literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most  Blackstone isnt speculating on housing prices looking to quickly flip them or creating another housing bubble  The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties  These are all houses that already exist and they are simply fixing them back up and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way  Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now  They dont have  savings to put down they are probably living check to check  But their family and kids are used to living in a house in a neighborhood  They dont want to move into a  bedroom apartment building  Now Blackstone comes in and offers the opportunity to stay in a house with the same schools etc  This isnt predatory  People are paying rent but now they have the option to do so while living in a house  Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone they are in no hurry to flip them for profit because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them  The new boilers new roof and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability  Most leases are  years so there isnt constant turnover and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect    Eventually the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work See the recent IPO of SilverBaySBY  The company will continue to own and operate the homes pay income to shareholders and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do  The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multifamily apartment real estate investing  Not so evilUltimately this is actually making it easier for lower income people to live in homes  While renting they can continue to save and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budgetHopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what Blackstone and other institutional investors are doing rather than just shake their fists and yell Damn Wall Street Republicans and Obama  There was a lot of anecdotal malarkey at the end of the article which is where I stopped reading  ,8,cdpmyaf,1rpgir,politics,hot,25.0,17

easwaran,Im a bit confused by this article Normally I like what I read in Mother Jones but this article doesnt really explain the systemic risk of rentbacked securities With both mortgagebacked securities and rentbacked securities if the foreclosure rate or vacancy rate go up in a coordinated way higher than the investors planned then supposedly safer tranches of the investment can get hit Lets assume that the investors are just as bad at evaluating the risks of these products this time as they were last time If the investment goes bad that means that some of the investors get to claim the collateral from the owner which means that title of the home transfers to a new company How does that evict anyone As I understand in most jurisdictions just because your landlord has sold the house doesnt mean that you have to move out and in fact the new owner normally has to allow you to stay as long as the existing lease lastsAs far as I can tell what these companies are doing is allowing ordinary people to keep living in houses even when ownership is out of reach or not desired The article seems to start from the premise that owning a home is a good or important thing but it seems to me that this is actually the attitude that led to past trouble more than securitization,0,cdpxvv1,1rpgir,politics,hot,1.0,1

DnWeava,this has been going on for years  I used to work in code enforcement  in one of  the worst inner cities  in the US   everyone knows about how suburban  sprawl  and  white  flight  had  major  impacts  on inner  cities  but  something I  never  see  get talked  about  is  black  flight   we  are currently  seeing blacks  leaving  the  inner cities in record numbers for suburbs  for  the  lower  crime  rates and  better  schools this is leaving the  problem of when the  banks  have  been foreclosing  on tons  of inner city  homes  during  the  housing crisis  is that  there  was no demand  for  these  houses   Ive  seen houses sell  for kk USD   these banks  are seeing  that  many of these houses  can only  be sold  for k so they  are betting  that if they hold onto  these properties  for a  few  years  that  the  market  will recover  abd  they  will be able  to sell  the  houses  for k  for  example  to a  potential  homeowner  or flipper  who  will  still  need  to drop s  of  thousands  into  these  to make  them livable after  they  have sat vavant  for  years   the  copper  thieves  dont  take  long  to  figure  out  when a  house  is vacant  so most  inner  city  homes  owned  by  out  of  state  banks  are stripped of wiring ac coils pipes etc  that  can  be  sold as scrap because  these  banks  arent  investing  in any  security  my city  saw the  problem of the out  of town banks owning  these  properties  which  is they  are sitting unlivable killing land values even more  on  top  of  the  black  flight  that is already  wrecking  values  in these  areas  and they  have  quit  selling  homes taken  for  back  taxes  to out  of  area  owners   they  are  now  selling to locals who will renovate  the  properties and  they  are spending  more  on  demolishing  homes  because a vacant  lot  is better  than a  house  filed with crackheads   another  issue  that doesnt  get  talked about  is that  the inner  cities  are  becoming a  much  older  population  because of the black  flight  issue  so  when these older  home owners die  they  are leaving  nearly worthless  homes  to  their  kids  who have  left  for  the burbs  and  I  have  seen many  leave  the  house  to get  taken  back  by  the  bank  or  for  back  taxes   the  issue  is  very  complicated  but  unless  cities  can make  these  areas  more  desirable  then  the  problem isnt  going  to get  better,1,cdpml9w,1rpgir,politics,hot,2.0,1

doctorbooshka,The whole idea of banning a substance as simple as Marijuana is mind boggling Typically the effects of marijuana only last an hour and for most people quite functional There are no deaths directly caused by it and there are actually health benefits from it Now look at the legal drug of choice alcohol How many does it kill a year just from poisoning livers and then add alcohol related deaths from motors vehicles plus the deaths associated with being to drunk and falling off a bridge or something The one thing weed will do is make the country have munchies and think Tim and Eric are funny,0,cdppg6l,1rphh5,politics,hot,2.0,2

Lillith,Saw the same type of thing last year guess what Walmart is a greedy corporation just like any other and will never change They dont care about the workers Staff are replaceable because there is always someone else willing to do the job for the same or less moneyYou start working there and at some point you are told this in either direct or indirect words and theyre right people are desperate and will do anything to keep a job in todays economy,0,cdq0ieg,1rqbyt,politics,hot,1.0,1
