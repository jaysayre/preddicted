LordAnubis,same here My family actually went over to my neighbors house to have dinner with her family who are christians instead of praying we went around the table telling everyone what we were thankful for then afterwards we watched the th anniversary of Doctor Whotoday was a good day,0,cdpap0i,1roaog,atheism,top_day,8,8

EC,In my opinion even if I was christian I wouldnt be thanking god for the food someone worked hard to raise and kill then send to grocery companies from which we then went an purchased Clearly there are other things to be thankful for but most of them come from the work of humans,0,cdplgf9,1roaog,atheism,top_day,2,2

flattedfifth,Twenty three years cleean and sober without a slip here Went into detox day rehab and havent been to a meeting since AA is garbage I looked within and found the strength and determination to persevere in my efforts to become a fully functioning human being I looked at a big book at the library about a year ago Almost as strange as the bible,1,cdpbjbo,1roasf,atheism,top_day,39,38
AcademGreen,AA has been ruled religious in two district courtsIt is based off of the Christian Oxford groupsThe big book is holy and treats agnostics as being in need of conversion to join the AA way  Atheists are just called savage by the literatureThe preamble to each meeting says that AA believes only god can remove our desire to drink  Each meeting ends with the Lords PrayerTop it off with work that shows AA is as affective as doing nothing and you end up with a pseudocivil religious churchI am forced to go to meetings for my first DUI  The constant god thing gets on my nerves  I dont pray or believe in the supernatural so it feels like I am an outsider or not doing the program right  Overall it is a cult with bad recovery rates that courts force people into  The people may be nice sand helpful but the program is  year old Christlight dogma about identifying your sins and repenting,0,cdpc2u1,1roasf,atheism,top_day,30,30
xpass,For me it was the only thing that actually worked Im an atheist and I particularly like the later steps which no one really talks about and they have to do with figuring out my own mistakes making sure I dont make them again and trying to mend my relationships with other people All other treatments I tried left me with no clue what to do with myself after I stop drinking and blasting through drugsAnother huge benefit is the abundance of meetings I am all up for options but I dont think I can find anything else with the sheer amount of support that AA gives meWhat would really make me happy is if there were other options for people Seems everyone only bitches about AA and god Thats easy enough  ,12,cdpa98i,1roasf,atheism,top_day,35,23
kzielinski,Many modern approaches to addition seek to do the exact opposit of what the early AA steps say Specifically to build an Internal Locus of Control so that the patient can take ownership of their own behavior and change it rather than blaming the drugs for his or her addiction ,0,cdpccwg,1roasf,atheism,top_day,10,10
Cardioman,my mom sent me to one during college guess what it sucked i was told i should rely on a higher power for help did not roll ok with me i told them i was going to base my recovery if any on myself i was told that that was impossible when i said i was an atheist i was told that even if i had to deposit my future on something else than me even if it was a tree in my backyard i got out of there as soon as i found my first job,0,cdpfrhj,1roasf,atheism,top_day,6,6
panamared,Atheist alcoholic here In the big book it states our steps are meant to be suggestive only The idea that you have to believe in God is not true I know many people who have had extreme life changing experiences due to this program I have been a bible thumping christian and there is no comparison Do the people who comment about AA base their ideas on experience or just the fact that the steps mention god,4,cdpaduw,1roasf,atheism,top_day,10,6
SIMULATIONTERMINATED,Spent three years in AA before I figured out how to pull myself up by my own bootstraps I absolutely saw first hand the harm the initial steps can inflict So many young people who were taught that if they drank or got high one more time they would die because that would mean they lost contact with God Many of them fulfilled this prophecy because of this knowledge about themselves and their situation It was frightening The AA community is a somber one I attended far too many funerals,2,cdpafdb,1roasf,atheism,top_day,7,5
darklightsun,Well DUHAll religious based treatment programs are doing is replacing one addiction chemical with another metaphysical  Shit one of the first rules of a religious based program is to trust in a higher power to save you from yourselfSorry the only person that can save you from yourself and your personnel demons is you,3,cdp9mxe,1roasf,atheism,top_day,6,3

wuollett,From the Article cited by the article OP cited  gt Support from a husband or wife was important in sustaining the resolution In reference to people that quit on their ownTreatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction  Part III The Harvard Mental Health Letter Volume  Number  October  page  See Aug Part I Sept Part II Oct  Part IIISo much for the sayings that Everybody needs a support group and Nobody can do it alone Most successful people do This is a contradictory statement having the support of a husband or wife isnt doing it alone  gt Nothing could be further from the truth Even the most ardent true believers who will be honest about it recognize that AA and NA have at least  failure rates And the real numbers are more like  or  or  failure rates It depends on who is doing the counting how they are counting and what they are counting or measuringIn  a different study the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism NIAAA conducted the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions NESARC found data from a survey of  people where  responded that they had been in an AAtype meeting a  continuance rate was shown after  year of AA Cited from Wikipedia as  L A Kaskutas Y Ye T K Greenfield J Witbrodt amp J Bond  Epidemiology or Alcoholics Anonymous Participation Recent Developments in Alcoholism Vol  Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery   From the article itselfgtI believe that whatever successes AA can claim are due the the dedication and tireless efforts of the volunteer sponsors That is a lifeaffirming positive way to help someone in the grips of alcohol or drugs So the article OP linked cites an article that states a support group doesnt work but in the article itself it clearly states that the sponsor system which is a form of support group is a good way to help And with a group like AA to bring them all together how would addicts find these sponsorsFurthermore studies have proven that more studies are needed to properly determine the effectiveness of AA Cited from Wikpedia as  Ferri M Amato L Davoli M Alcoholics Anonymous and other step programmes for alcohol dependence Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  Issue Both articles make the statement that Christians elements in AA make the program have a negative effect by citing data that doesnt really study the actually effectiveness of AA Nothing is said in regards to time it takes for spontaneous remission to occur and at that point the effects of constant alcoholism may be much more pronouncedWhat needs to happen is a long study that shows the effectiveness of AA versus nontreatment and alcohol addiction specialty centers and the differences in health between the three groups as well as the amount of people who stay completely and utterly sober as opposed to  or  beers every now and then and being considered not an alcoholic anymore whether the alcoholism had any pronounced medical or personal effects and the amount of time between when they started drinking and when they stopped and if AA was more effective in reducing this time If you can provide data showing that people who were turned away by the God aspect of AA quit completely by themselves in the same or less amount of time those that stayed in AA did and stayed sober longer I will believe that AA has a negative effect but until you can produce this data I highly recommend not citing inconclusive sources since all of this is really not comprehensive enough to make the statement that the God aspect of AA makes it negatively effective ,2,cdpgv5v,1roasf,atheism,top_day,5,3
TheoVert,Im an alcoholic yet I dont like AA Been  months sober yet if I go to that place the talk of god may trigger me to drink And it does cost money especially if you cant drive getting the bus to meetings outside of your city It costs about the same as the alcohol you could buy They are also forceful in the fact that you should try getting to a meeting every day,0,cdph45d,1roasf,atheism,top_day,3,3
airplaneshooter,Atheist in AA here  Couple of things it is indeed a cult and an overtly religious one at that  I went to a  day step based treatment center  The twice a day AA meetings and AA based films were the biggest waste of time ever  Small group sessions and counselor sessions helped as did a ton of free time for me to write and do selfreflection  When I left they planted the seed in my wifes mind that I needed AA or I would relapse  So I started going to meetings to appease my wife  I went ahead and got a sponsor read the Big Book started doing the steps  Stopped doing the steps when it became apparent that this is amateur level parapsychology  Dropped my sponsor so I wouldnt waste his time anymore  I go to one meeting a week to offload the weeks frustrations of not being able to partake in drinking anymore  So basicallyAA only works for me because I have decided to be sober  I will have a year in January,0,cdphu54,1roasf,atheism,top_day,3,3

fcsuper,Although I am no supporter of AA this article is based on another article that seems to be extremely biasedgtBased on the records of rearrests only  of the AAtreated clients were deemed successful while  of the untreated clients were successful Clearly Alcoholics Anonymous treatment had a detrimental effect That means that AA had a success rate of less than zero The line that got me was this means that AA has a success rate of less than zero  No it means that AA had a success rate of  which is stated in the cited study  That is lower than other methods but that is still well above zero,0,cdpill8,1roasf,atheism,top_day,2,2
meanman,When I was forced into an AA treatment program People in the program would laugh when I told them that AA would be a lot better if they removed the steps and stuck to it being strictly a group support program without all the Religious or Spiritual  stuff as they like to say I am sober now but just wish I had a non  step alternative when I was younger because I did a lot of damage to myself before I finally got sober,0,cdpvicx,1roasf,atheism,top_day,2,2

,For real This is a reddit thing I cant get behid Gay or straight is not black or white someone could be  gay and  straight just like someone can be  straight I do agree that religious indoctrination of those who have an inclination towards the one side is wrong as is any other outside pressure on the development of the Self but if I really wanted to I am sure I could be attracted to a man Would have to be the perfect man but still it is possible This thinking in black or white is hurtful to those who discover they are Bi after first choosing one orientation over the other Practically Everyone is Bi but you would obviously choose to associate closer to the side where you are more likely to find a mate Thus I consider myself straightThen on the other hand if someone is  straight and  gay then social stigma would probably force him or her to align with Heterosexuality Easier that way as long as they dont actually fall in love and have it reciprocated by a member of the same sex This is also wrong IMHOHetero  Hetero to  HeteroGay  Gay to  GayBi  Gay to  HeteroAnd what the fuck does it matter anyway That is noones business unless they are in love with someone with a definite different sexual orientation If they are well that sucks I am not attracted to very fat people idiots or boring people either In short the whole gaystraight discussion is pointless and hurtful to everyone involvedif you are  gay then obviously it is a choice just ignore whatever lust you feel for the same sex and live on  of your sexuality If you do however then you are a chicken and not living your life in full I would feel sorry for such a person,1,cdphog6,1robbw,atheism,top_day,3,2

BuccaneerRex,Your first problem is thisgtAs atheists we can proudly say that we have questioned the existence of God and certainly religion itself We have used our critical thinking skills and curiosity to look beyond what others have told usThis is not the case for everyone Some people never accepted the existence of a deity in the first place therefore have nothing to question Some of us have never been a member of a religion And as annoying as it is some people are atheists merely because nobody ever taught them religion they never reasoned their way into or out of anythingYou do not require a deity to have a religion this is true But your definition of religion is more of a definition of Abrahamic religion not all possible religions Not all religions include afterlives Not all have a central text Not all believe their deity is the creator They do all generally include moral prescripts so thats one Not all include eternal punishments of the ones that do include afterlives And some do not believe that any deities interveneIts a good start and defining terms should really be the first effort of any intellectual activityBut religion is an extremely broad catchall term and you cant really define all possible members of the category in five bullet points,0,cdp9sre,1roh7u,atheism,top_day,6,6

powercow,Most of us understand thatwe get pissed when you pretend to know who the deity hates Then we start demanding you give us his phone number so we can check for ourselvesalso people are in a bad habit of doing what you just did not chastising because it is human nature people dont think of it this way But especially for some atheists when you say gtBelief that a deity may or may not existwe are going to say well that is all and good but you have to remember then that there is an infinite number of things that might be picking a deity makes no more sense than all the other thingsIf someone demands that their is no way you can prove there is or isnt a deity so i should be open to that Then i demand you be open to the idea that that deity is the spaghetti monster or you have to be open to teh idea that all of life is just a hologram on a surfaceand some science thinks thatFor me it is just spin religion loves to live in the infinite unknown no matter how much the known grows that infinite unknown is sanctuary for them Your talking about agnostics but religions do it all the time with more specific claims It was initially religion that rejected the idea of an earth going around the sun when they were proven wrong they just move to other unknowns and say therefore god well when it is unknown it can be therefore anything possible and even things we dont know if they are possible so when you say there may be or may not be a god i say there may be or may not be an advanced civilization that made a computer and we think we are alive its meaningless conjecture and really serves little purpose outside of philosophy nothing in the info about it might or might not exist can tell you anything about your life how you should live it or anything at allhey he could be an evil god too and no good god and he is picking all the murderers and rapists for everlasting happiness You have at least got to be open to the possibility,1,cdp9uk7,1roh7u,atheism,top_day,2,1

weshallrise,In my opinionThe historical Jesus of Nazareth was an apocalyptic JewishhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiApocalypticliterature preacher who was charismatic enough to gain a bit of a following I believe he may have thought of himself as a Jewish messiahhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiJewishmessianism of sorts and that he would raise an army of his fellow Jews to fight and defeat the Roman occupiers thus establishing Gods kingdom in Judea After entering Jerusalem and attempting to provoke the authorities however he was arrested for claiming to be the King of the Jews This was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of Caesar and was a crime punishable by death As a result he was crucified by the RomansAs for the mythical Jesus Christ we cant really say what if anything written in the New Testament is true The earliest books in that canon are those of Paul who never personally knew Jesus The earliest gospel is Mark written sometime after  ce by someone who could not have known Jesus Consider also that the writings of the New Testament have been changed and edited countless times since they were written and that none of the original copies exist The bottom line here is that we simply do not know what this character named Jesus actually said or taught other than that it was probably apocalyptic in natureIf you consider his teachings to be socialistic in nature as the teachings in Matthew suggest then they are really no different than those of most other great teachers throughout history The only thing that ever made Jesus of Nazareth special was the myth of his resurrection Without that Jesus was just another preacher and that is where history should have left him,0,cdpomvi,1ror9x,atheism,top_day,1,1

Thestrangeone,I think a better place to start is why you chose Christianity Because I cant truly address your misconceptions if I dont know what they are But starting with the limited information I have I will address the exact words you said Your first misconception which is rather common is that atheism is a choice implying it is a religion It is neither of those things Atheism is first and foremost the rejection of all deistic claims If you ask me why I reject the god of the bible which I assume the title of Christianity means that specific god I would first ask you why you reject Allah or Vishnu or Xenu or Zues Because if your answer has anything to do with faith let me tell you something there are people out there who have the exact same amount of faith and certainty that you do in fact some of them even more that believe that one of these gods are real So now the question becomes how do you determine which is true Because that is what would matter if it mattered at all I mean if the bible is wrong and Islam was true then you could see where calling yourself a Christian could become a problem for youThink about the radical muslims who engage in acts of terror How much faith do you have to have in order to strap a bomb to your chest and detonate it I bet you that guy is pretty damn convinced that his religion is true And if it is true and yours is wrong once again you can see where you might end up running into a problem somewhere You see the thing that you dont understand is that you are actually an atheist as well You do not believe in Allah you do not believe in Zues you do not believe in Vishnu Im betting you know pretty much next to nothing about hinduism yet you instantly reject it without knowing a single thing about it Back in the Roman times the christians were the athiests as they were denying the deistic claims of the emperor All Christians are actually atheists as they deny many many deistic claims often without ever considering them There is only one difference between you and me and that is I deny  one more god then you do By the way nondenominational many Christians would view you no better then an atheist as they would believe you to have just another one of the wrong religions Some Christians take those denominations very seriously to the point that they view everyone who doesnt agree with them as heritics see baptists and catholics and going back to your point about seeing no problem with science that doesnt actually tell me anything I know another christian that tells me that same thing yet he also believes in a literal  day creation along with the idea that Noahs flood actually happened and all of the other supernatural events of the bible actually happened So Im going to need a little more than that So Id like to know your position first in order to properly explain my position as I cannot explain something if I dont know what you actually know yet You are coming in with some very clear and obvious misconceptions and I need to know what those are before we end up having a big misunderstanding about what we actually think A nondenominational christian who sees no problem with science really doesnt tell me that much about what you actually think or why you think it And I need to know that I need to know what your methods are for determining truth and whether or not you care if what you believe is true,0,cdpezv8,1roxnm,atheism,top_day,54,54

WilliamDhalgren,Pretty short q so youre just wondering why I dont believe in any gods OK  because Ive not been presented with any convincing evidence that any exist And further for it doesnt even seem to be an empirically testable hypothesis as its commonly stated which makes it predictively worthless regardless of its truth if truth is even seperable from empirical methodology which establishes it that isId evaluate the claim that gods exist the same way one evaluates the claim Higgs particle exists or cosmic inflation happened in the early history of the universe or supersymmetry exists or luminiferous aether exists or that a china teapot currently orbits the sun in a long and elliptical orbit Those hypothesis are respectively  solidly proven possible and indicated by evidence but unproven possible but unproven and under increasing tension with the evidence solidly rejected and finally worse than wrong ie unscientific for not offering no empirical testsAny empirical claims ever made in favor of the god hypothesis are in the solidly rejected camp and all that remains seems to be worse than wrong So its not worthy of consideration,0,cdphgsi,1roxnm,atheism,top_day,1,1

Aberu,I will spare the common answer to this which isnt the answer you are seeking The whole we didnt choose atheism kind of thingTo answer the question how did I become an atheist which is the implication of your question it was because I wanted to rationalize the things I believed I was raised Southern Baptist Moved around to many nondenominational churches seeking answers for conflicts that I saw in each branch that I had arrived at previously I converted Mormon since a good friend of mine was Mormon and opened me up to listening to the missionaries They had answers for why the bible seemed conflicting edited for power and profit grabs etc Then the next logical step was to question the Mormon church after being baptised for some reason my skepticism wasnt honed fully yet I found it difficult to question the Mormon church without every source being tainted by Christian apologist writers and their criticisms or Mormon apologists and their responsese of those criticisms I couldnt find a verifiable independent source I dont remember what I found since its been about  years but I found a pretty independent source and it opened me up to thinking very critically about what I believed I used to wear a religion like a badge amongst many badges on my vest and I never felt like it was the most important thing to know anything about Just one of many things I felt I was expected to have an opinion on and expected to have a belief in something And I thought it was a given to believe in God but I always assumed everyone else believed in God in some form or anotherAfter questioning Mormonism I approached a kind of Deism and was firmly opposed to religious institution I had a deist friend bridge that gap comfortably for me in the same circle of friends as the Mormon friend Then I discussed my ideas with a coworker who I respected greatly a british born Californian punk rock bassist who was there washing dishes with me at the pizza place as a fellow delivery driver He got me to the point to ask myself How do I know what I think I know In other words he was requiring me to rationally justify the existence of a deistic god to him through logic I couldnt and I started sliding slowly into becoming an Atheist over the next year First time I admitted I was an atheist was after hearing a debate that Christopher Hitchens did I dont remember who it was against it was a while ago and he just made very good arguments to embrace what I had already been feeling that I was an atheist He was a brave voice that made me much more comfortable with being outspoken about it and outspoken publically against irrational beliefs That was my introduction to me enlightenment I dont like calling it this but I dont know a bettter wordHope that gives you a unique perspective but I assume most others peoples posts are similar in essence,0,cdpkm72,1roxnm,atheism,top_day,1,1

NukeThePope,Funny thing this morning I came across a Guardian article which tried to paint Russell both as a closet theist and a eugenicist I got a strong impression this was an attempted hit piece This isnt surprising its normal particularly in the US but not unheard of elsewhere obviously as the article shows to dig through the trash looking for stuff to saddle the other side with Hell thats a big part of what we do here in ratheismHeres a few thoughts of mine hopefully clarifyingIn an intellectual environment of theism the idea is that everyone and everything is formed by God When you leave that environment ie think as an atheist its almost a nobrainer to consider that the breedingforexcellence humans have been doing with animals for thousands of years could and likely would also work with humans As intellectuals came out from underneath the shadow of the churches this became a legitimate topic for thought and discussion Im not surprised that Russell considered it thinking about stuff like this was his job after allAnyway my point is that yes because this kind of thinking was anathema to most theists  youre more likely to see it associated with atheists Interesting exception Hitler Germany was  theistic CatholicLutheran officially nearly as hostile toward atheists as Jews and yet did a lot of thinking and some practical work on the topic of creating the ideal German The German Aryan movement displayed a weird mixture of national patriotism religiosity with some NordicPagan influences and pseudoscientismGetting back to Russell I dont know that his alleged support for eugenics isnt exaggerated in that piece from Vice What does seem apparent from a brief jaunt into WikipediahttpenwikipediaorgwikiBertrandRussellsviewsonsociety is that after noodling on the topic for a bit he was no big fan of eugenicsgt Russell later criticized eugenic programs for their vulnerability to corruption and in  he condemned the unwarranted assumption that Negroes are congenitally inferior to white men Education and the Social Order Chap This mention of eugenics programs led me to looking at the role of eugenics in the USA as a whole I highly recommend the article on Eugenics in the United StateshttpenwikipediaorgwikiEugenicsintheUnitedStates I was a little shocked to see thisgt Eugenics was widely accepted in the US academic community By  there were  separate university courses in some of the United States leading schools enrolling more than  students which included eugenics in the curriculum I find it hard to believe that this was a field worked only by atheists It was quite apparently a societal fad at the time asgt Several feminist reformers advocated an agenda of eugenic legal reform The National Federation of Womens Clubs the Womans Christian Temperance Union and the National League of Women Voters were among the variety of state and local feminist organization that at some point lobbied for eugenic reformsTheres more on eugenics advocated by organizations in the deep South and Im willing to bet these werent exactly hotbeds of atheist thoughtMy conclusion This is like saying that slave ownership in the US was an atheist thing because Thomas Paine was an atheist and slave owner Russell was singled out because he was a vocal atheist Pieces like the one you linked try to make it look like this was his idea Condemning atheists today for intellectual work done by not only atheists a century ago from which all of society eventually learned a better understanding and rejection of eugenics is a cheap shot viciously unfair and deeply antiintellectual I feel the authors should be ashamed of themselves for it,0,cdpi4hc,1rpa5a,atheism,top_day,6,6

MasterAdkins,Definition  Most commonly nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism which argues that life is without objective meaning purpose or intrinsic valueIm an atheist and I believe there are all kinds of meaning to life  To have fun and enjoy oneself  To bring more good than bad to the world  To leave the world a better place than I found it  To try to work towards the common good so that everyones life is better  We can see and appreciate the wonder of creation and therefore we have value to creationSo either your christian doesnt know what nihilism means most likely they usually dont know the meanings of a lot of things or they are being disingenuous ,0,cdpjuj7,1rphwy,atheism,top_day,3,3

Greghole,Theres nothing in the bible that says you should baptise babies  Baptism in the bible was a way for people to publicly declare their faith and trust in god  Its something you do not something that is done to you  The Catholic tradition of infant baptism was a loophole to get dead babies who never had a chance to accept Jesus into heaven instead of purgatory  The official position of the church has changed and they no longer teach that unbaptized children get punished  Basically anyone under five years old goes directly to heaven  If youre not willing to tell your grandparents that youre not a catholic just tell them you dont see any point to infant baptism since they decided to let dead babies into heaven,0,cdpzoyn,1rpngg,atheism,top_day,1,1

JimDixon,I think youre mistaken unless you were deliberately being facetious about the origin of memeRichard Dawkins coined the word meme and popularized it in his book The Selfish Gene I think he was thinking on the lines ofmeme  culture  gene  inheritanceormeme  culture  phoneme  languageAt any rate his concept was quite different from what the meme has evolved into at Reddit,1,cdpoysx,1rprui,atheism,top_day,9,8

amadorUSA,I initially welcomed the changes then became progressively alienated by the mods and I stand by my objections  Some of the changes are not bad per se and lack of moderation was clearly an issue  However the topdown paternalistic nonconsensual approach in which they were made stands against everything a freethinking community should be  The vindictive and immature butthurt in redditspeak reactions of the mods gave me the distinct impression they were just a bunch of underachieving millennials with selfesteem issues  ,3,cdpo47n,1rprui,atheism,top_day,9,6

studentthinker,I mostly agree but what I feltfeel is that ratheism should be the broad coverall with the other subs being more specific say ratheistdiscussion ratheistnews and radviceatheistsGiven that one of the major problems atheists face when they do actually face problems is a misunderstanding of what atheism means I rather liked that ratheism was one of the autosubscribe pages It meant a large number of people who described themselves as agnostic or even as their religion without actually believing it would realise the term atheist wasnt the view they thought it was and so would answer censuses more accurately That and redditers who believe and had the misconception would discover that things like secularism wouldnt mean no religion allowed,1,cdpn7aa,1rprui,atheism,top_day,4,3
