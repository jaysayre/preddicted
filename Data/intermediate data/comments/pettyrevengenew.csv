Gonefar,At least you knocked up a successful woman and not a scum bag like I did I was the sole provider for myself and my ex partner when we were together even before she fell pregnant I was the one who worked  hour weeks on apprentice wages to support the house hold while she looked for work that suited herWhen she fell pregnant I told her she didnt need to look for work and that I would provide for us and quit my cooking apprenticeship to be a kitchen hand at the same place for better pay but worse conditions and no chance of a certificate  When my son was born I was working  hours a week and doing all the cookingcleaning at home as well as looking after my son through the night so she could restWhen he was  months old she threatened to leave me because I was too sick to work for a week and too sick to look after our son or do the housework We had a massive fight and as soon as I was well enough to get out of bed it was pretty bad and I was bed ridden with swollen glands in my chest pneumonia and bronchitis at once I probably should have been hospitalised I moved back into my mothers and broke up with herWe did  shared care for  months and she got the single parent pension and I helped her with bills A little after he turned one her house was in a putrid state and full of cockroaches and other nasty vermin so she gave me full care of our son and continued to collect the single parent pension while I worked and my family babysat my son for me Just before he turned three she was still collecting the single parent pension I had had enough of her shit and decided to do something about her abusing me financially I contacted centrelink Australias form of welfare and let them know what had been going on for the past two years I was extremely bitter at her because in that entire time she had never once helped me with any of the financial burdens or even bought a single bottle of milk or pack of baby wipes let alone any child support and it put me in debtThey backdated my claim for the single parent pension and gave me a lump sum payment which pretty much cleared the debt I had gotten myself into She copped a massive bill and was risking jail time for fraud as a result but they let her off with a  debt with the government to be paid back slowly Now I still have full custody and its my sons fourth birthday soon In the past three years she has had very little to do with him and has only recently started having him one or two nights a month and I have documented every interaction that we have with her including all text messages and phone calls I still receive nothing from her financially at all and I like it that way it means I have even less to do with her and my son and I are better off that way Look on the bright side your situation could be a lot worse I manage to look on the bright side of mine so you can too,22,ccjfxfm,1njzho,pettyrevenge,new,135,113

powerfulsquid,gt And as she told it the fact is she simply couldnt afford the rate they were suggestingIm not in Australia murica but this isnt entirely an outrageous claim Albeit she went into her k salary knowing full well she had a daughter I would hope lol so the point I am making isnt necessarily in defense of her but for others who go into happy marriages have kids but for one reason or another things fall apartWhen most couples start a life together they tend to accumulate debt together When child support is calculated it doesnt take into account any of the debt especially any debt accumulated prior to the divorce Its almost as if the state thinks you said Oh Im single now I can spend thousands of dollars a month and go into a ridiculous amount of debt without having to worry about caring for my childIts absurd My wife has worked for two different states child services departments and she has calculated what I would owe if I had to pay child support for our son if we ever divorced Its ridiculous I make a little more than double what she does and we have a pretty decent lifestyle but if I ever had to pay what the state mandates for my salary I would be screwed A few of my bills would not be getting paid on a monthly basis,4,ccjjx64,1njzho,pettyrevenge,new,8,4

RabbitsRuse,My friends older brother was in the reverse of this situation During the divorce proceedings he was fine working out a private agreement for paying child support to his ex who as I understand it would be keeping the child most of the time They negotiated a price that ended up being a significant chunk of his salary but he didnt try to argue At least until shortly afterward when she started trying to renegotiate for more He was already barely able to support himself and make the payments as it was but she refused to back off and took him to court The part that makes me smile is that the court determined that he was already paying above the amount required by the state based on his income and she actually started getting less than she had been originally Still feel bad for the kid tho,0,cckflic,1njzho,pettyrevenge,new,3,3

Mn,I am at a loss why any parent feels they deserve a pay check from the other parent Child support is created for one thing The transfer of a portion of the wealth to the state and redistribution of a portion to a person more likely to spend it People with money have it because they are frugal Poorer people are likely to spend more frivolously especially when they did not have to work for it so they do not value it because theyre was no personal or sweat equity invested to create the wealth There is no investment The state loves it because they can skim off every payment plus all the lawyers and court costs and fees But its law so its perfectly fine right years ago I could beat my slaves and my wife with the same tree branch and it was lawEver seen people on welfare with new cars nice apartmentshouses new clothing and shoes internet computers cell phones and mp players  video game consoles custom nailsbeauty treatmentshair etc Or ex wives with all that stuff while Dad eats canned beans and balogna sammiches driving a  year old clunker or walking biking or taking the bus while sleeping on mom and Dads a friends couch or rathole fleabag apartment busting his ass working  jobs just to maintain a rd parties legislated and ordered quality of life standard for the children Do different human offspring children require a different quality andor quantity of food water and shelter to survive If not then why does one dad pay  a month another  another  and that rich bastard ,32,ccjj7hw,1njzho,pettyrevenge,new,16,-16

Pitmattman,Her perspectiveSo I started my new job at unnamed taco joint the other day and already I want to quit  I was on the till and the guy training me had left for his  min break  Sure thing the second he leaves I get some asshat AH for short up to my till  This is how the conversation abbreviated wentMe  Hi what can I get for you todayAH  Id like  jumbo tacos and a BurritoMe  Sure thing that will be AH  Shuffles around and grumbles a bit  Shit I only have  even can I just have it for thatMe  Im sorry sir but I cant let you do that  I cant have my till off at the end of the night  No way was this happening on my first shift at workAH  Cmon please its just cMe  Im sorry sir but I cant  If you want we can take the burrito off and it will come to less than  dollarsAH Are you serious  Its  cents  Who caresMe  Well if everyone I served today did that and I didnt care then I would end up several dollars off and I dont want to treat you differently than everyone elseAH  Fine whatever just take the burrito off and get my foodMe  Ok sir  Sorry about thatSo the guy gets his food and I thought all was well  My coworker comes back and says that it wouldnt have been that big of a deal and shows me the dish under the counter where the cashiers put pennies that customers didnt want as change so that the till doesnt end up off at the end of the nightSure enough it cant just end at that  The next freakin day this jerkoff came back and I know it was intentional based on the following  Orders the exact same thing and then pulls out  effing rolls of pennies and unwraps them right in front of me so he can dump them on the counter for me to countObviously I count them and it doesnt even come to   Its  ffs  At this point I dont care and just get him his food to get him out of my face  He probably felt so smug because he thought of this super clever ploy to annoy a minimum wage workerFYI youre an asshole and youre lucky she wasnt more informed  If you had done that to me I would have told you that Im not legally required to accept unrolled coinage for that matter I dont think rolled coinage has to be accepted either as payment and to get the fuck out of my store Its been upheld in court and people have been cited with disorderly conduct for trying to pay in coins as a way to annoy or piss off clerkscashiers,9,ccjnsud,1nl4c9,pettyrevenge,new,25,16

SelkieMaid,To everyone who doesnt seem to be aware cashiers let pennies slide all the freaking time At my store its common to let people slide on amounts up to and including cents In our area a lot of stores dont accept pennies because they dont want to deal with such small change Hence letting the small stuff slide On top of that even when you do everything in your power to make every interaction right on the money your till might still be off at the end of the night Probably not much but most employers arent going to roast your ass for being over or short by less than a dollarlet alone by two everloving pennies People make mistakes and more often than not theyre for more than cents My manager would be seriously pissed off at me if I refused a sale based on the customer being short two penniesbut our store is concerned about repeat business and we have a great relationship with most of our customers He wasnt asking for free food he wasnt looking for a massive discount he even offered to bring the PENNIES in the next day People probably threw at least that much on the ground on their way out of the store over the course of her shift She wouldnt have gotten in trouble All my friends work in fast food and do WAY worse than just letting someone slide on two penniesshe just was having a bad day and decided she was going to power trip To the people saying pay for your order op and dont be so cheap I say have a little common sensehe wasnt robbing a bank or stealing Two pennies are not worth bunching up anyones panties I bet if shed ASKED her manager the transaction would have gone through without having to remove anything But no Shed rather piss off a customer Im sure she got the message Counting pennies is a bitch Edit to say I dont support the use of unrolled coin as a weapon mainly because as mentioned earlier cashiers dont have to accept it I refuse to deal with it and so will a lot of people Really this would have been just as good to me if youd left the pennies rolled and then added two extras to make it EXACTLY  in pennies Even though they would be rolled theyd still swamp her till and shed probably still get the msg It would have still been a pain in the ass and shed have no grounds to think youre a jerk You get to be petty AND take the high road ,16,ccjocrg,1nl4c9,pettyrevenge,new,10,-6

SilentLurker,With some companies especially ones that record these interactions this could result in YOU getting in trouble  Racist people are a blight on society but shes paying for service not rendered regardless of how she treats you which was terrible  If she calls back on Monday and gets told that all she has to do is a channel search or she complains that she should be credited back the days she was unable to use the service that could open up floodgates for people who already dont like your company to complain about terrible customer service  She deserved to be called out and probably belittled but knowingly with holding information channel search and directly lying saying that techs were working on it which you said the outage was brief so they probably werent working on it anymore and that you cannot assist further has potential to come back to bite you  Im all for petty revenge but not at the cost of ones job unless you hate your job and just want to get petty revenge on them as well by making their customers angry before you quit,37,ccmszf2,1nwm08,pettyrevenge,new,133,96

Blaaamo,I have formatted this for easier readingSome crappy lady let her dog out to play with us when we were in college Instead of taking some time from our busy frisbee game and play with this poor animal for a few minutes an animal who was undoubtedly kooped up all day with the old lady and whose only respite and physical activity was running around with us we decided to douse the innocent animal with tabasco So much hot sauce that eventually the dog had intestinal problemsArent we fucking funny,21,ccp4j5x,1o5zvw,pettyrevenge,new,30,9
Raveynfyre,I have formatted this for easier readinggtSo as you may be able to guess this is a story my dad told me years ago that always made me laugh Back when my dad was in college he was living in an apartment building The building had four levels of apartments with three stories above ground and then a basement level of apartments gtMy dad and his roommates would sometimes go the the field outside of the gated area around the apartment to play Frisbee The apartment allowed pets and the woman who lived by the stairs in the basement level of the apartment had a dog Somehow this dog always knew when my dad and his friends were outside playing Frisbee and it had no problem getting out of the apartment through the doggy door and squeezing through the bars of the fence going around the building to play with them Unfortunately the dogs favorite game was to steel my dads Frisbee and play keep away until it could chew it up I dont know if they ever went to confront the woman about her dog before they came up with the plan but it kept happening and they were getting pissed about this dog gtFinally they decide to teach the dog a lesson They all knew that the dog loved tennis balls just as much as Frisbees so the next time they went out they took a tennis ball with them plus a large new bottle of Tabasco sauce They threw the ball a few times and sure enough the dog comes running They then completely doused the ball in Tabasco until it was completely red and threw it for the dog The dog snatches the ball and starts to play its game of keep away when suddenly it drops the ball and stands there barking at it They walk over and pick the ball back up and douse it again before throwing it for the dog Again the dog takes off after the ball picks it up drops it and starts barking at it unable to figure it out My dad and his friends being college guys are laughing hysterically by now and keep repeating the cycle By the time they call it a day they have literally used about half of the large bottle of Tabasco gtEveryone goes to bed that night thinking that they have had their fun and that it is all over but of course it wasnt Sometime that night the Tabasco finished running its course through the dogs digestive track and it really had to go Something interesting about dogs that you may or may not know is that they will do anything in their power to not poop where they sleep The dog left the basement apartment and made its way up the stairs One feature of the building that is important to this story is that the stairs connecting each level of the building went up along the outside of the building but there was in fact about an inch wide gap between the staircase and the wall they ran parallel to gtThe dog made it all the way up the the third floor of the building before it decided that it had gone far enough an turned its back end to the wall of the building If you have guessed watery diarrhea at this point then you are correct and because of the gap between the stairs and the outside wall of the building it ran all the way down the side of the building and puddled outside of the womans apartment The next day my dad woke up to the sound of the woman shouting at the poor dog and felt really guilty about everything Not enough to confess about it though so the woman had to clean it off the side of every floor of the building I guess she should have trained the dog to be better behavedgtTLDR Three floors of dog diarrhea for owner to clean up,7,ccp2xnz,1o5zvw,pettyrevenge,new,16,9

NoClaimToFame,My grandpa told me a story of something like this that happened when he lived in Idaho long ago I guess some high school boys were driving around and one of the kids in the back would hang his arm out the window while holding a baseball bat and they would knock over mailboxes while driving down the road This one guy got tired of it after it happening to his house several times so he filled up a new mailbox with concrete The next time the boys drove by the kid holding the baseball bat got his arm almost completely broken off when he hit the concrete since they were driving by while doing it Apparently the bone was hanging out and everything The parents brought the casted up boy to the house the next day to apologize and he had to fix the mailbox even with a broken arm,2,ccqobgc,1o7rju,pettyrevenge,new,4,2

leveldrummer,It never crossed your mind that she was attempting to get comfortable in her own seat As a person with a bad back  I can see how she would constantly adjust her seat trying to find that magic spot  sit a while and get sore  adjust again rinse repeat  Youre a dick  Learn to sleep lying back like everyone else and other peoples comfort wont affect you ,24,ccy018g,1p23p1,pettyrevenge,new,65,41

Daegs,What I hear is someone incapable of communicating who thinks that caveman like grunts are an acceptable way to communicate did you also try sending her psychic thought waves After the second jerk why didnt you just say Excuse me Im try to sleep and when you move the seat it wakes me up could you please pick one place for your seat Polite direct and would give you sleep instead of steaming for  hours and committing arguably theft ,19,ccy02qp,1p23p1,pettyrevenge,new,42,23

HPLoveshack,Similar story except I was doing close to  in the middlelane of a lane highway  There was some truck with a trailer a few dozen cars ahead that was cruising in the left hand lane at mph so everyone in my lane the middle lane was passing people on both the left and the right at a steady intervalThen some douche weaves through traffic in the back and jets up behind me in a truck with a lift kit and flashes his brights directly into my rearview mirror several times  Got a bit angry but ignored it then  seconds later he flashes them three more times fucking blinding me because his lights were  feet from my rear window and at the exact level of my rearview mirror due to the lift kit  So I reached out and gave him the finger as I slowed down to match the exact speed of the two much slower cars on either side of me that were doing roughly  forming an impassable wall  After about  minutes of that we came to a part of the highway with a generous shoulder and he decided to jet up that before forcing his way into traffic aheadThe only time Ive ever genuinely felt road rage for a few minutes there I was  down to throw everything away to stomp that guy unconscious on the side of the road  Wish I could say I saw him wrecked up or pulled over by a cop on the side of the road later but unfortunately theres no justice in the world,12,cd0c2ke,1pa2v0,pettyrevenge,new,58,46

ryloshawk,My dad got a call like this last weekend Fun fact hes been working with computers for  years and specializes in network security So when an Indian lady tells him his computer is pinging the government of canada servers in mexico while it wasnt even turned on he tore her apart  She was crying when he finished yelling at herEdit Full storySo she asked him to turn his computer on so he proceeded to Then she wanted him to go into the windows options and turn his firewall off for security reasons so she could see what might be causing the problem Next he was to go into his antivirus program and allow access to some ip address she gave my dad So my dad asked her why the government would be doing network security over the phone which is highly unsecure She said she sent many letters and no one replied so she had to call My dad asked her to send him another letter and he would verify it with the police as he has done work with the government before so he could find out of it was legit She proceeded to te him it wasnt necessary and if he followed her steps they could fix the problem now So he ripped her a new one Asked her to define secure and questioned why the government would do anything over the phone and why the caller Id didnt show up as Government of Canada  She tried to explain it was for security reasons and he asked for her ip address so he could ping her server and see if he could see her She gave it to him So he yelled at her and told her he reverse engineered her scam and was reporting her to the police She started begging him not too and hung up crying I sat there dying of laughter the entire time,32,cd4alkm,1pnwh6,pettyrevenge,new,229,197

EmperorOfCanada,I have long used a horrible technique that I heard once Basically you just ask them to keep repeating the Last bit No before that No the other thing you mentioned Yes I got that but I missed the other thing you said Thats cool but I dont think that I understood the bit before that and so on You are obviously quite interested in what they have to say but they dont like to move on with their script when you are missing some Often they get a bit frustrated so just start rereading the whole script The key is that you are not quite fitting into their script formula You arent saying no you arent asking questions and you arent saying yesAlmost any telemarketer can be spun in circles for a bizarrely long time,19,cd49mh0,1pnwh6,pettyrevenge,new,143,124

FutureCatHorder,I mentioned in another thread that I drove my kids around and everyone gave me hell I can understand why it would seem like I was a helicopter parent but Im not My main concern was bears We live in an area that is heavily wooded and we see bears so much that we recognize each one There are only two bears that I am concerned about this year They have stuck together since they left there mother in the spring and they are rambunctious teenage trouble making bears that have absolutely no fear of humans because some idiot fed them when they were small Now they walk into peoples yards and up onto their porches in the middle of the day time They seem to be more attracted to noise than afraid of it and have come to our yard during parties just to see what was going on So its not a good idea for anyone including adults to wander around out in the woods at night I do still let the kids play outside and walk to friends houses in the daytime just as long as they have the dog with them if they go into the woodsWhat I do have going for me is that my kids are not overweight They are actually very close to the low end of a healthy weight and when they get sick we have to keep a close eye on how much they lose We dont have very many overweight children at all in our area Even kids that move here and are overweight at first quickly lose at least some of it I think it is because they spend so much time playing outside The woods may be a bit dangerous but to a  year old they are like a giant playground Once they get older and want to walk to stores ext They have to walk at least  miles to get there and they do it because there isnt really anything else to do When I was a teenager I walked  miles a day during the summer every day to go fishing because thats what people do around here for funTLDR If you want to solve childhood obesity live in an area where exorcise is necessary to get around Save the car for the few times when its dangerous to be walking like Halloween night when rambunctious teenage bears are looking for trouble,2,cd532p5,1pp55i,pettyrevenge,new,5,3

Mikarevur,One time a neighbor of mine left their full trash bag in front of my door I guess they didnt want to throw it in the dumpster thats literally on the way out of the complex  So I opened it up looking for any sort of identifying information  I was in luck as there was a piece of mail near the top I saw they lived one above me and over  I grabbed the trash bag and my car keys walked up stairs to their door and cut open the bottom of the bag letting the smelly grimy and slightly gooey trash spill all over the ground in front of their door  I scribbled a note on their mail saying to take care of their own trash and set it noticeably on top of the pile  They came down that afternoon to apoli g ize It was so so sweet,5,cd79vzv,1pxvyh,pettyrevenge,new,58,53

coriny,So this reminds me of when we had an upstairs neighbour who kept flicking his cigarette butts out of his window and down onto the lawn outside our window we were ground floor And in the same way this really started to build up and look pretty skankyBut handily Karma decided to sort things out for usSo were sitting by the window and we can smell that our neighbour is smoking out of his window We then hear intercom bell ringing in his flat and his footsteps as he goes over to answer it Then some running footsteps and a muffled litany of panicked swearing Some sounds of spraying Meanwhile we can hear the newcomer going up the stairs and then straight into the flat upstairsThen a pauseThen a torrent of increasingly voluminous shouting as our upstairs neighbours girlfriend discovered that he hadnt given up smoking despite his promises Attempts to claim that it was a one off quickly undermined by the pile of gt butts on the ground Several minutes of enraged shouting  this was clearly a big deal  followed by slamming and stamping feet back down the stairs and out the doorNo more butts were thrown down from that point on I like to think that he successfully gave up smoking rather than being axemurdered by an angry lover,2,cd7deb2,1pxvyh,pettyrevenge,new,19,17

RabbitsRuse,As a former counselor the actions of the director dont surprise me at all I agree its complete shit but summer camps never want to loose potential clients and their money and especially dont want anything in the way of legal attention to come their way a lawyer will never sue a counselor when they can get real money by going after the camp The only time I know of when my camp sent a camper home early was when he tried to run away from camp technically he tried to swim away but same idea On the other hand Ive seen  counselors be let go within  years My camp took a policy of punishing not only the counselors who were in the wrong but also the counselor who tried to confront them The story is too long for here thoughAlso in my personal experience  week campers are the easiest to deal with In that first week they are still not used to each other and it takes some time to put together a pecking order Dont get me wrong a piece of shit camper is going to be a piece of shit for however long you have them for but things tend to escalate starting half way through the second week It seems to take about that long for the cabins alpha campers to form their groups and start going after each other Then again I never had too much trouble from my  year old campersSorry for the rant but being a camp counselor was one of the best times in my life and despite some of the negative experiences I wouldnt trade it for anything,0,cd7g7fw,1pycav,pettyrevenge,new,9,9

Lonestarlonghorn,I dont see that they are racists They simply havent been exposed to many things I would like to know the actual things they said as you simply saying they said racist things does not convince me And just because they felt unsafe in certain neighborhoods does not make them racists There are plenty of neighborhoods that truly are not safe in many cities Instead of acting like a dick and judging your family so harshly why not an open dialogue instead of petty games,5,cdebx6z,1qj3ex,pettyrevenge,new,1,-4
BlackBirdSings,Racial slurrs is a habit I need to breakI personally love saying nigger Maybe because its such a mindblank restricted word It gives me physical satisfaction to say itSometimes I yell as loud as I can when I vacuum or mow the lawn And I have started using it casually with friends coining such terms as nig nogging and nigbot But now its actually becoming a bad habit What used to be for quick personal satisfaction is consuming my mental vocabulary And if I dont turn back soon Im afraid Ill say it at workThe endTLDR Nigbot ,20,cdde55e,1qj3ex,pettyrevenge,new,8,-12

Larrygiggles,Its a good story but Holy wall o text Batman much easier to read when its broken up into paragraphs Here it is for anyone elseYears ago working in a little burger shack on Maui one of the best jobs I ever had Just about closing time and were a man down so there are only two of us in the store One of the responsibilities of closing is of course taking out the trash Here we run into a problem as its against Policy to take the trash out alone and against Policy to leave the store unattended We opt seeing as how the place is empty except for one guy who is a non paying customer checking his email to take the trash out as quickly as possible and rush back in I see this guy every day and we all know him fairly well I take the keys out of the register and ask him to inform anyone coming in that someone will be back in two to three minutes to help them and he gladly agrees to do so Trash goes out I come back in by myself and the other guy stays outside to mop the back deck As I come in I hear a bit of commotion from the front someone yelling Where the hell is everybody I walk through a door to the front and the only person there is my webmail dude WebTV thats how long ago this was He points to the other door leading back to the kitchen says dude just went in there looking for you I go into the kitchen through that door as the guy looking to be served goes back out the other one We repeat Finding each other at last I am left to be berated by this person for not being immediately available and told hows hes friends with the owner and helped build this damn place I apologize for the delay and take his order comes out to  I will never forget that totalUpon being asked to pay for the food he becomes even more of an ass Youre CHARGING ME Im friends with the owner and built this place and you are CHARGING ME  Yes sir I have to charge you as it is my job and I dont know you nor have I been instructed to give you free food sorry I replied and turned to begin making his food IT doesnt take long its burgers hot dogs and fries FFS but this dude is standing right behind me the whole time open kitchen with bar for customers to sit at mumbling under his breath at me about how slow I am and how if the place was being run right he wouldnt be having all these problems Cursing at me and in general just being a complete prick I finished up his food and went back to the register pulled  out and put it on the counter while I boxed up his food after getting it all bagged and boxed nicely I handed him his  and threw his dinner in the trash right in front of him I told him he had to leave as we were closing and not to come back as I was informing the rest of the crew not to serve him ever He leaves threatening all kinds of dire consequences cause hes friends with the owner Once he knows how you were running this place youll be fired I replied Do you SEE the owner No huh Who do you think he put in charge Im here and he is not because he trusts me with his business you go tell him anything you want just get out of my store before I call the police He left foodless and angry as hell cursing me the whole way I should mention at this point Maui closes at pm being open till pm we were literally the last option for food in town besides cold egg rolls from foodland so its a good bet he went dinnerless that night Best part of the whole thing the webTV guy gets up after watching all this and says to me Hey man I have the same name as that guy and that whole thing makes us look bad you want me to go kick his ass No i said but Id love your phone number so when my boss asks me about this I can refer him to a customer that was here at the time I got to work the next day and was questioned by my boss who did in fact know the asshole and when he found out about the behavior of his friend then verified the account through Webtv guy he permabanned him Me and the Web tv guy became pretty good friends and the guy mopping well he went to the emergency room for swollen testicles but thats another storyTlDr Do not fuck with the people who serve your foodEdit it has nothing to do with petty revenge but while he was mpping the back dock and I was dealing with above prick he tripped over the mop somehow and racked himself The pain was apparently bad enough that he called his girlfriend to come pick him up He no showed for work the next morning and I got a call from his SO telling me he wouldnt be in for a few days with no explanation When I told her that wasnt good enough she told me he had to go to the emergency room at am to have surgery on testicles the size of a grapefruit One had apparently gotten tangled up and was strangling itself He said they cut his sac open and rolled it out on a tray right in front of him Yes I eventually saw them  days later and they were horrifying yellow and purple swollen beyond belief and wrapped in so much gauze he couldnt zip his pants,0,cdfisv3,1qpivx,pettyrevenge,new,6,6

ivegotthegoldenticke,I totally relate on this I just had an AWFUL flight experience because of the person sitting next to me To begin with the girl was overweight and on the border of needing two seats She was in the aisle seat and I had the window seat She would NOT put down the armrest between our seats I dont even know if it wouldve fit because her leg was spilling into my side This was extra annoying because it was JetBlue and the headphone plugs are in the middle armrestand I was only flying JetBlue because they have cable Anyway I just awkwardly plugged in the headphones and shrugged it offThen came take off She was not wearing a seat belt AND she left her phone on I was convinced the plane was going to crash because she was just tempting fate too much and I took solace in the fact that her death wouldve been extra violent in the event of a crash But again I just dealt with itonly a  hour flightSoon after take off I get hangovermotion sickness nausea So I politely ask if I can get out of the seat and go to the bathroom This bitch has the nerve to try and squeeze her large body into the seat so I can slide past her Who doesnt just stand up and let the other person out Let alone the fact that a child couldnt even squeeze between the chair and her bodyMy revenge I hadnt showered prior to the flight and made sure to rub my stench on her as I squeezed past Hope she enjoys the smell of sweaty ass Bitch ,2,cdimlnk,1qzcxw,pettyrevenge,new,5,3

BurgerThyme,Ugh I once had some sillylooking bitch ask me if I would mind swapping seats so she and her bimbo friends could sit together Of course I didnt mind at all because she was switching out of an emergency row seat and I am a tall girl who appreciates her extra leg room but before I could even open my mouth to respond bitch just says she doesnt mind to the flight attendant I was debating for a microsecond about concocting a ridiculous excuse and denying them but ohhhhh that sweet leg roomgtA friend and I were traveling together but had been assigned an aisle and window seat We were hoping no one would be seated between us but some guy hopped on the flight just before we left My friend asked him if he wanted an aisle seathe said sure and started to get up but when she pointed out that in the row next to ours  and the one behind us there were empty aisle and middle seats he refused politely and sat back down Weird but no big deal We expected someone to be in the middle seat when we got the seating assignments so this guys own stupidity confused us more than it annoyed usgtGenerally I tend to give the person in the middle seat a lot of leeway full reign of the armrest keeping any of my movements into their space to a minimum air lights etc He began our relationship by splaying his elbows into my seating area and listening to shitty live music on his phone without headphones but electronic devices would be turned off soon enough and I figured Id only need to say something if he did it again after takeoff I used a magazine as a force field to get his elbow out of my seat turned the channel to something boring enough to sleep to and settled in Thankfully the music stopped once he turned off his phone for takeoff and I thought it would be the end of thatgtOnce we were in the air though he threw his jacket over himself spilling sleeves and coattails into my seat and my friends seat and both of us kept handing back his sleeves asking him to be more careful Hed make a show of tucking in loose ends and being in his own space but every time he shifted it would happen again I later found out he had also used my friends armrest controls and gotten wildly confused when his channels werent changing but when he was asked to stop did he apologize Of course not He was just generally a clueless idiotgtHeres the thing clueless idiot thing aside he really wasnt that bad UntilgtMy personal last straw was when I fell asleep comfortably and woke up in a deep sweat because he had taken it upon himself to turn off my air He kept craning his neck into my seating area to look out the window so once I caught on to that I shut it for the rest of the flight so I could sleep Thing is I like to see the lights in the city when we land so I had to weigh my options when we began to descend I knew he would enjoy the show but I too wanted to see the lights and I felt an opportunity for petty revengegtSo I opened the window and he jumped into action craning his neck moving his elbows into my space trying to see better So I made sure my whole face was taking up that window and I turned around to make my best Wow this is AMAZING face at my friend Eventually he reached behind me to open the window between us and the row behind us but by then he was clearly agitated and the plane had reached the landing striptoo late I leaned back in my seat affecting his view of the other window and shut my own window pointedlygtWhen we got off the plane we were behind him talking about how pretty the city looks from up in the sky and he shot me a nasty look before we parted ways I could only gringttldr Guy is a bad airplane seatmate he gets a nice view of the back of my head while we land,3,cdio4j3,1qzcxw,pettyrevenge,new,3,0

knightjohannes,gt About three months later I got my Eagle Scout awardJust to clear up and I think in the context got is accurate but I might say received  since you received it at your ceremony where you hammered the asshat ASM with his just desserts But in the future make sure that you refer to your earning the award Because you earned it Using the word earned is better to all scouts past present and future Youre part of the club welcome to it happy to have you  now  make sure you give back  Youll have gotten something from the earning of the award there will be a time to give back And maybe since youve a personal stake in it that might include your own lobbying for opening up the adult leadership to inclusivity  Cheers ,2,cdjox2b,1r3jsq,pettyrevenge,new,4,2

Raveynfyre,Just let them know that if the bill doesnt come to the correct name youre not obligated to pay itIm sure you are in reality but that should get someone on their end to have a mini freak out and get it fixed quicklyGood job on the name thing Ive done that myself once or twice when my name has been misspelled consistently After the second time Ill purposely misspell your name and call it an accident Magically everyone learns to fucking read after that because its in print in my signature to my eMail at work so there is no excuse,0,cdl4lrg,1r8lwy,pettyrevenge,new,10,10

sleptpoorlylastnight,I used to work at the guest service counter for a large retail store  One of my favorite memories is having a Spanishspeaking lady get pissed at me for not being able to understand her when half of her sentences werent EnglishShe ended up having me call my manager over  He handled the transaction but could tell she wasnt being helpful  So he intentionally took as long as possible to process her exchange returning two items and buying two others and kept stopping to call back to the department the items were in and verify prices  All in all he made a transaction that should have taken about  seconds take about  minutesEven better than just wasting the ladys time is that she was supposed to get a  giftcard with the purchase of the two new items  He didnt mention it at all to the woman and doesnt give it to her before she leaves  Once she was gone he showed me the giftcard asked if I was hungry and went over to the food court to buy me food to snack on for the rest of my shift It made my daytldr Woman makes me call manager over  Manager can tell she isnt pleasant and purposely annoys her  Manager doesnt give her the gift card she was supposed to get and buys food for me and himself haha,2,cdktofw,1r8w6v,pettyrevenge,new,22,20

RenaKunisaki,Ive always wanted to fuck with a telemarketer but never had the opportunity Answer the phone in Japanese When they speak say in Japanese or Engrish something about going to get someone who speaks English Switch to another personvoice speaking English with a thick accent Let them explain their product to you in great detail Act very interested Ask lots of questions Get them to tell you all about it But ask them to speak slowly and repeat themselves often because youre not good with the English Interrupt often to ask what that means Eventually tell them that all sounds great but you dont want to give credit card info over the phone so if theyd just give you the address of the business youll come down in person to make the sale When given the address act confused Is that in Kyoto USA Well why you call me here then no this Kunisaki Sushi in Tokyo Why you call here if you no have office in Japan See their reaction when they realize theyve somehow been in an international call all this timeIt might not work because it would be difficult to believe they accidentally called the wrong country but I guess it must have been some strange glitch,0,cdle1st,1r8w6v,pettyrevenge,new,3,3

COLISSAYING,My grandmothers phone number was one digit different then the supermarkets pharmacy number for some reason the printed labels they put on the bottles the number always came out to look like my grandmothers we had gotten our own prescriptions there as well and could see how people could make the mistake she would get calls constantly asking to renew their prescriptions or ask questions she was a nice old lady and would inform people that they had the wrong number and even give them the correct one she would then call the pharmacy asking them to either check the ink or fix the label that the number on the bottle looked like hers not theirs they should have had an  but it looked like a  they never did anything about it and we would get calls all day and night finally i just started telling people their prescription would be ready in an hour i guess they got a lot of complaints cause months later their label was totally different and the number was clear ,0,cdpze51,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,new,6,6
tidymaze,My grandparents phone number was oneoff from a local taxi company When the phone would ring in the middle of the night as it invariably did about once a month my grandfather would politely ask where they were and where they were going tell them a cab was en route then hang up His reasoning was that if they couldnt pay attention to the greeting a sleepy Hello compared to a snippy Valley Cab that wasnt his problem,1,cdpzo1y,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,new,7,6
