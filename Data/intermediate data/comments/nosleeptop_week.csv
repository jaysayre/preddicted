Hors,Spirits are idiots and you have to be pretty firm with them I can see them and I usually just make them leave None have ever scratched me or made me feel in danger Well once they did but they were furious at me for getting help against them Which may be what you need someone more experienced than you are Just make sure its the correct help My family doesnt mess with spirits either and we are a Christian family Just this year though I found I am sensitive to the spiritual realm more so than others so yeah I had invisible friends whose actual identities were demons Yeah crazy soundingBu the thing with them is that if youre a Christian they have to obey you and leave when you order them to in Jesus name Pull in some people who are more spiritually mature than you are and actually believe in this Some dont and they are zero help Message me for more info if you want itEdit Just because you can see these things doesnt make you wiccan,1,cdld8ys,1r8xlh,nosleep,top_week,2.0,1
PenguinWiccan,Read this it will explain more than me A medium is someone who gets messages from the spirit world This can take many forms  some mediums see and hear actual spirits others get messages via dreams or visions Some can even channel the spirit who may then write or speak through the medium,0,cdlwzqn,1r8xlh,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1

iammrsnezbit,It sounds to me that the old woman is possessed Im no expert but try to bring religious paraphernalia to work and see how she reacts to that As for what is going on in your home it undoubtedly seems intertwined with the situation at work I know whats happening in your home is scary but you need to not be scared As crazy as it sounds you need to tell it to go away and I mean firmly tell it literally yell at it and assert yourself Entities especially demons sense your energy With that being said you need your energy to read powerful to them Youre the human youre the one alive and you are bigger than it Do not let its bullshit moaning scratching etc get to you Its its way of breaking down your energy if you succumb to it it wins Take control I wish you the best of luck Hope what I said makes some sense and helps That stuff is crazy and you deserve to live in peace ,0,cdl4170,1ra0o4,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1

boredboarder,Ive formatted your story so it isnt such a wall of text    So Im not sure who to go to about this but I feel like this story needs to be told if only for my own piece of mind Im an intern in a city hospital which serves a notoriously underserved community The hospital itself is old its been standing since the late s it used to be a tuberculosis sanitarium Ive never really encountered anything supernatural but I havent written off the existence of such phenomena That being said a shadow in the night isnt enough to make me start thinking of ghosties and ghoulies and long legged beasties and things that go bump in the night So when I started working nights in the hospital things seemed to go pretty wellId have my admissions Id take care of the current patients without issue Then one night I got an admission Ill call this patient Jerry Now Jerry as it turns out has a very long history of coming to this hospital to the point where admitting him is almost a rite of passage for any wouldbephysician that trains at this facility He has a whole boat load of medical issues kidney problems diabetes high blood pressure He also has a history of schizophrenia and on top of that he has some good old fashion dementia Before meeting Jerry I was told hes actually a really fun guy hes always enthusiastic and seemingly happy to be here So when I went in to see him and found him very sullen I was a little anxious The admission was done the orders were placed and I didnt think more of it He had been admitted for chest pain so I knew I would be going back to draw additional blood work later that night It was around  in the morning when I went back to see Jerry I was hoping that I could just do it real fast before he fully woke up When I went in there Jerry wasnt in his bed Jerry was now sitting in a corner of the room with his sheet his gown and pillows all wrapped around him in some sort of makeshift armor I quickly walked over to Jerry and saw that he was crying not crying but rather whimpering as if he didnt have the stamina to make it a full cry I tried putting on a brave face and said Jerry whats going on For an old guy Jerry was quicker than I thought and stronger than I would have believed He grabbed my wrist and pulled me towards him They wont leave me alone they wont let me sleep they wont let me eat He continued on in this line of things the phantom they wouldnt let him do I assumed it was the staff taking care of him at his nursing home As upsetting as it was to see Jerry like this I still needed the blood and this wasnt the first time Id dealt with a confused older patient I helped Jerry back to his bed Then I explained to him how I needed to draw blood to make sure that he was OK Strangely enough or maybe not so strangely enough this made Jerry feel better maybe it was something he knew from his long history of being a patient it was something familiar I tied the tourniquet in place then I cleaned his arm found my vein and went for it Im not the greatest phlebotomist so its always a relief and a bit of an ego boost when I see the blood traveling through the tubing I was filling up my vial it was about half way full when Jerry started screaming LEAVE ME ALONE LEAVE ME ALONE He began to jerk violently somehow the needle stayed in place but then to my disbelief the blood in the vial started backing up the tube as if some force in Jerrys body was pulling it back I was so shocked I tried to pull the needle right out of his arm but the needle didnt budge In shock I pulled harder my efforts still could not budge the needle In response I quickly pulled the vial of blood out from the opposite end of the tubing The vial which had been collecting blood had gone from being  full to maybe being about  full After I pulled the bottle out from the other end of the tubing the needle dropped from Jerrys arm leaving in its wake what I could already tell would be a one nasty sonofabitch bruise Again owing to his deceptive quickness and strength Jerry grabbed me and pulled me close again and in a voice that wreaked of desperation and fear he asked me Can you see them I pulled my arm free and I ran out of that room I walked back to the nursing station one of the nurses asked what had happened because of the screaming I played it off as being a result of my own mediocre at best blood drawing skill With the blood now drawn I would be able to get some sleep I made my way to the oncall room which happens to be in one of the older parts of the hospital I climbed into one of the beds and closed my eyes All I could see with my eyes shut was the look in Jerrys eyes when he pulled me close and asked me if I could see them I resolved that this was a case of some funky weird vacuum trick in the tubing and a senile sick old man The only trouble is since then the shadows Ive seen in dark rooms seem darker the lights unable to pierce them The noises from the old pipes have shifted from random tings and pings to rhythmic tappings Im not really sure what to make of it In the past few days the shadows have gotten darker the tapping louder and now I cant shake a feeling that Im being

arglebarg,TRADOC is the US Armys Training and Doctrine Command whereas the Air Forces version of the same is Air Education and Training Command AETC  Both are in charge of things from basic training all the way to how to teach someone how to fix nuclear missiles or properly assault a fixed position  Just FYIEdit  Heres FM httpswwwfasorgirpdoddirarmyfmpdf which is just a field manual many many manuals are called that which just means its reference material really explaining some basic nonclassified concepts behind electronic warfare  The version on the hard drives probably much older though  Granted FM numbers get changed rearranged etc and the FM  of today isnt necessarily the one of yesteryear,0,cdlhmjg,1ragny,nosleep,top_week,12.0,12

LucklessLemings,Lurker here  If you follow the UFO conspiracy theories MJ stands for the group called Majestic  which took over from Project Blue Book for investigating or rather covering up supposed UFO phenomenon  When I researched FM  TRADOC I found a handy powerpoint outlining what it is  Its a field manual outlining terms and things to consider in Electronic Warfare  The manual is available to look at here  httparmypubsarmymildoctrineDRpubsdrapdfFMpdf  As all publicly available field manuals are it contains very little info on how to wage Electronic Warfare but just outlines terms and things to consider  However some interesting things to consider  The powerpoint I found was written by two people simply called COL Dixon and williamdarley which are microsoft usernames  There are no links to communicate  The powerpoint was made in  edited in  and looks like an intro  Considering how this field is much newer than MJ and the purpose of the powerpoint it seems like FM  could have been written in  but Im not sure  The version available online was released November of   So it has been in operation since at least   One interesting thing is that FM  is mostly an Army manual although there is an entire chapter dedicated to working with different agencies and friendly nations  I havent found anything specifically outlining hard drive security although you can bet if it says Erase and Destroy and it was sent to be destroyed its probably been erased  Now that doesnt mean all is lost  Many less experienced people would simply wave a magnet over it which is an imperfect way of wiping data  Most likely they would use a program which erases and writes over the disk several times erasing it pretty well  Still if it has not been physically damaged there could still be a chance to recover the data  If they were uber secure about data they might have a program which alerts a server if its being tampered with by anything with internet access  So if you have someone checking it out take out the internet card  Id recommend taking a look at Wikipedia since even the existence of MJ is debated  From what I understand though if it did exist it closed down decades ago  What would most likely be on there is scanned and conslidated old information  What is strange is that it would be in a desk meaning it was being used somehow rather than in a storage bin or server  I havent found any news about air force bases being turned into a nature preserve  But Ive only been looking for half an hour  Im gonna find you out  ,3,cdlnhwb,1ragny,nosleep,top_week,3.0,0

URKhaleesi,I have been to seminars every once and a while From what it sounds like she may have been started on a new medication to help with depression or anxiety Some of the medications such as Zyprexa have terrible side affects at first I was a complete zombie Like falling asleep standing up lol Its only like that until you build it up then your body starts getting used to itI wouldnt get paranoid I am sure she is having a hard time with coping She married the love of her life and now she wants a baby and can never have one with him Its a very big life decision that she is faced with right now These seminars require a lot of feeling and talking She is likely exhausted from built up emotions Put yourself in her shoes and think about what she is going through She can either stay with you and be happy but always have the yearning to know what it would have been like to be a mother or she can leave you and go through the process of finding someone else on equal footing as you which may be impossible to her and have a childall the while thinking what if I do all of this and then find out I am not cut out to be a mom Or what if I leave him never find someone else and then Im alone and Im not a momComing from a womanthis is a huge life decision It sounds like she is emotionally exhausted Check all around for any knew meds that she may be hiding Or just talk with her Tell her that you understand and that your just not ready to discuss kids Yall have a whole life a head of you take it as it comes and enjoy it,2,cdmj1ia,1reivz,nosleep,top_week,20.0,18

SleepingBeauty,It might be worthwhile for you to do some reading up on covert hypnosis She very well could have been hypnotized and not even know it  httpenmwikipediaorgwikiCoverthypnosisAs far as the past life regression goes there are techniques that involve being hypnotized and some that do not Usually hypnosis is only done one on one for past life regression not in a group setting The other way is basically just like a guided meditation where you relax to a point where your mind is clear and then slowly recall vivid memories from your past going backward to the beginning of your life Past life regression happens after you recall your earliest memories from this life then keep going and recalling memories from someone elses or your past life You can find guided meditations for past life regression on YouTube Hope this helps ,1,cdnfebv,1rhbuc,nosleep,top_week,5.0,4

menubalk,Well I dont know how mirrors influence dreams but I know to never look into a mirror when lucid dreamingLucid dreaming is the state in which you can control your dreaming Think as your dreams as a semisandbox You can only partially influence the world you are in but you can completely manipulate that world fly findthink up guns etc Look up how to trigger it Its tiresome but funHowever since the part in your brain that controls logic is shut down during sleep a few things consistently dont work as intended These are so called reality checks You can perform these on a bihourly basis in real life You will subconsciously then also perform them in your dreams When you notice something is not right you become aware you are dreaming Do note that some reality checks might work as intended yet you can still be dreaming This is why it is wise to perform multiple to be sureAlso the shockjoy of this fact alone wakes you up however you can prevent waking from a lucid dream by spinning around very fast This forces your mind to think about balancing thus canceling out your waking up signalWithout further ad reality checks Digital numbers are all garbled Your average nightclock might suddenly display something like this httpgooglrUVPRC Light switches dont work Remember no logic Due to this light switches dont trigger changes in luminance They might trigger other stuff Your body is only semisolid This means that you can for example with enough force push your finger through the palm of your hand This is a very easy reality check to work into your daily routine Creepy check number one your hands will often have more than five fingers on each hand And usually they arent even matched up in number Creepy check number two mirrors show a distorteddisturbed version of yourself It sounds interesting but it is jarring to watch sometimes enough to wake you up You can breathe through a closed noseTldr Mirrors in dreams  scary,7,cdo12tn,1rjwb3,nosleep,top_week,24.0,17

Laurashrti,A few things about mirrors that are considered old wives tales Dont let two mirrors face each other because it can stop the flow of energy in the house Dont put a mirror in your bedroom because it allows bad spirits into your dreams and they can steal your soul If your soul wanders during the night a mirror can capture it Another possible reason to keep it out of the bedroom Mirrors can be gateways from spirits both good and badJust a few things to consider but take them with a grain of salt The gateway thing would concern me Having two gateways facing each other would possibly allow for heavy traffic if you believe in that sort of thing From wwwconstantlyworkingwithspiritcomhttpwwwconstantlyworkingwithspiritcompagehtml ,0,cdoeljc,1rjwb3,nosleep,top_week,3.0,3

Creepyslenderpasta,I have  things one it may have been a guardian angel telling you to move the mirror which would lead into about  hours worth of discussion and  this has nothing to do with this  subject except lucid dreaming if you turn on and off light switches when you are awake A couple of times to make it almost a routine you will more than likely do it in a dream realize it doesnt work and if your mind doesnt automatically rationalize about stuff you will realize its a dream which in that case you can do whatever you wantEDIT Oh ya um at my school on the th grade floor there are  mirrors facing each other and when I go to the bathroom in there the only sink that works So Far is the one under the mirror,1,cdomxf8,1rjwb3,nosleep,top_week,2.0,1

ApaLova,As far as I have heard staring into a mirror in a dream is a bad thing What couldve happened is that part of your brain stops working while dreaming which leaves a distorted image of you once you look in the mirror Since the ghost wanted to talk about death you had the thought stuck in your mind about death and your brain emitted screaming in return In return of your paranormal encounter and your nightmare you things that its from the ghost in which gives your brain the fuel for dark thoughtsI for one do not believe in paranormal activity but I do know that your mind and hypnosis is a powerful thing thing Just make yourself believe that the ghost isnt doing anything to you and might turn back to normal,0,cdoxsou,1rmeqd,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2

SakuraTwilight,Have you ever heard of the creature The Rake Your description reminded me of it sort of You werent completely descriptive However it looks a bit like a dog and seems to come more often at night time It has been known to watch people sleep This creature is pretty popular on creepypasta This is a website with not exactly accurate information so Im not sure if the rake really does exist What you have could be entirely different Either way I think it may benefit you to google The Rake and maybe even stories of other people experiencing what youre going through You may find a way to get this to stop Good luck,0,cdp6yup,1rmua2,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
NarwhalBanana,Interesting it seems to be a common creature By common that would mean a lot of them exist I have seen this before but cant put my finger on where Oddly i felt nothing bad from it So my conclusion is that it is a spirit which is around but rarely attacks it was probably curious of you If you saw it it knows that you can see it so its curious,0,cdq2bdx,1rmua2,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1

NarwhalBanana,Wow Im so sorry about your loss Therapists are a waste of time in some states Everyone jumps to the conclusion of if you see things you need a therapist You shouldnt hold in hatred The hatred will consume you Sounded like something what leaching off your wife and your wife knew The fact of her being happy at work could of been the people around her hesitated what ever was affecting her Her being alone probably gave it a chance to get at her What i m talking about is we as humans see things but shrug them off Some people have these things attached to them and they drain off our life force per say The only thing that can stop it is unfortunately death Therapists say they do good but when they dont know what they are dealing with  it can make what ever the problem is angry and worse,0,cdq0h32,1rn4sa,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1

Allycat,Im sorry but Ive read all  parts and theres something about Mia that isnt entirely human  She almost reminds me of the fairy folk as they have their own world and I can imagine that they can enter both worldsTheres also some mysticism revolving reincarnation and youWhatever deal your greatgrandmother made with mia your family definitely does not want you to continue it and I agree with them  There are wicked strong enchantments around Mia and God knows what could happen if you slipped up and apologizeAlso a word of caution The more you speak to Mia the more likely she is going to trick you into giving her an unofficial apology out of you  Whe this happens Im afraid you will find out exactly what is going onI know it bugs you but dont mess with a hornets nest with its giving you a very clear signal to back off,0,cdp6keo,1rnj6d,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
Maxomos,READ THIS What if she is immortal and the deal was that she needed to transfer that blessing or in this case curse to someone else so she could finally die Thats probably why your greatgrandmother didnt want to live forever because shed live forever If she shows up again ask her that directly to see her reaction otherwise dont go looking for her It may sound ridiculous but hey with the shit youre hearing now its worth a try right,0,cdp88tq,1rnj6d,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2

ephique,Since people are in eager need of having some questions answered I am going to fill them in for you Vote this up so it gets on topWhen did the sister die  Shortly after the last time she interacted with JonathanWhy was the father acting as if he had seen the sister when he assumed she was in Jonathans room  He was playing along pretending like she was alive in order to give Jonathan the idea that she wasnt dead Alternatively he could have seen the ghost of the sister much like Jonathan did with his mother Its up to the readerHow did the mother die  Jonathan first saw her when she was a rotten corpse he never knew The father still stated she died of a liverfailure during interviews If she did or not no one knowsWhy was the father acting like a british doctor of some sort He was suffering from schizophrenia Most important though the story actually has all the hints and details in order to figure this out and some of you did I failed as a writer to make some stuff clearer Its always hard knowing how other people will interpret your story This is the first story that Ive written that is longer than a thousand wordsI want to thank everyone who read it who gave me tips and who upvoted it Ive enjoyed these  days of reddit posts of my story I really enjoyed reading what people were speculating about the ending someone mentioned that he would have something behind the fridge that was my favorite one Thank you Edit Ive noticed one of the moderators has removed  comments all of which were just positive critique on the story Why not remove the negative ones if NoSleep has a No critique policy I believe a moderator should be impartial when it comes to something like this upon deleting fellow peoples comments,14,cdp9nkt,1ro3vw,nosleep,top_week,91.0,77

AssassinCorgi,With the exception to the voices at the same time I have experienced as a kid the whole room expanding like you have It always felt very surreal ,4,cdpkkw8,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,68.0,64
koutavi,I experienced something very similar as a child where late at night the room would shrink and close in around me or seem to dramatically expand Sometimes my body parts most often my hands would shrink or grow and feel too light or heavy as well Id hear music or whispers frequently on the rare occasion it would turn into the roar of a crowd The walls of my room were woodpaneled and the knots and whorls would sometimes turn into faces I believed there were people were trapped in my walls for most of my childhood I heard them after all But if my grandmother came in for any reason it would all stopSometimes it still happens and my doctor believes that both the shrinkingexpanding and the musicwhispers are a neurological phenomenon related to my migraines He calls it AliceinWonderlandSyndrome Aura or lilliputian hallucinations that cause the feeling of the room warping and that sometimes children experience this but grow out of itI still hate that room though,5,cdpn6m5,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,29.0,24
Bulldog,I had a similar thing happen  The room would feel really big and I would hear voices  The voices werent really screaming but a few people talking at once in an angry tone  I could never hear words but the voices would get louder and louder and I would feel physically stressed  The weird thing is when I would have these episodes I would always think of thesehttpusrfcomwmarualestebanarualestebanarualestebanhayballsinwhiteplasticcoverwrapbalesstackedoutdoorforfeedinganimalsinfarmsjpg for some reason,1,cdpnjb6,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,7.0,6

Quatr,I would have something similar to what your describing happen to me often when I had a fever It is hard to describe It happened more in my head like a dream Everything in my mind would clear like I was standing alone in a matrixlike white empty room I remember at the center if the vast empty space there was what I perceived as a bombI could feel the bomb was about to go off but never would Like the constant stress would build and build until I was overwhelmed with it pulsing and compressing the bomb and its space But the bomb would fight back growing rapidly The two forces would fight in the large white room expanding and contrasting violently inside my head until I awoke ears ringing head throbbing and quietly crying It was always the same Then never happened again,0,cdpntfa,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,4.0,4
zackisazombie,Ive had this exact thing happen to me when I was a little kid I only recently figured out that they were probably panic attacks I still get the room growing bigger thing and I believe it is a form of dissociation The voices are actually the blood roaring in your ears ,0,cdppbwi,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,4.0,4
witchofchaos,Sounds similar to something Ive experienced  When I was a kid usually when falling asleep but occasionally when playing everything around me would seem to distort stretching out or squishing kind of like it was made of rubber and being pulled on  Sometimes thered be a spinning or wobbling sensation too and and it would make me feel a little sickI found it more fascinating than scary though and would often watch my hands or my toys and feel them holding still and staying the same as I see them change and move in front of me  Usually it would go away awhile after I focused on it intently  I grew out of it around the time I started kindergartenI also heard voices whenever it was dark and quiet  I still do as an adult  They always seem just out of reach to focus on  I still need to have some light and sound in my room to be able to sleep,0,cdppfd6,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,3.0,3
manudouble,Even at  I still get this sometimes  It normally happens when Im sick or something else is going on that keeps me from sleeping well  The room starts expanding and I feel so small but I at this point I can typically snap myself out of it ,1,cdppobw,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,5.0,4
Pooner,When I was young I would experience a similar thing where I felt very small and the room was expanding but no voices Apparently my mother told me when I had these experiences I would be saying Its so big Its so big I assume I was referring to the room,0,cdpn936,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
Sedentary,Ive only heard heavy breathing but heard my name called from the closet It started very faintly and i sort of awoke then my name was called again slightly louder I was thinking I may be imagining it and it came again and again each time louder until it was loud enough that i jumped out of bed turned on the light and proceeded to run to my parents room,0,cdpos72,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,3.0,3
ATyp,Holy shit Ive experienced exactly this Usually when I get the flu yearly Ill be laying there feeling like death and then sit up to get some water or something and then this will happen Also I have out of body experiences like this too Pretty cool never has been scary really ,0,cdpp7ug,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
Leenlopez,Ive experienced something like that even the room expanding it always happened when I was alone and not only during my childhood maybe the last time it happened to me was  years ago Its very weird and hard to explain but yeah the loud whispers that I couldnt make out what was being said made me feel like I was going insane,0,cdpqecg,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
HairStylistAndrea,Ive had this my whole life Sometimes it feels like I cant move but I can if I try The voices I hear too and theyre so loud I always thought that if I could just hear the words theyre saying Ide be able to understand what was happening It scared the shit out of me as a kid and now Im so curious about it I remember the room expanding and contracting almost like your looking through a magnifying glass and it would go up and down my body as well My limbs would feel really huge and then really small The room would get extremely dark and then return to normal when the voices would finally quiet down My mom would just brush it off and say my eyes are playing tricks on me but I always thought there was more to it  than that ,0,cdptp0e,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
LillaNissen,I once woke up and couldnt move I could see the roof in my room and the wall next to me but I couldnt move any part of the body I didnt really know what to do so I just waited to see ig I would really wake up then I think I got tired of waiting and fell asleep again and woke up as normal later Dont know the name of this english not my native language blablabla,0,cdpwon1,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,3.0,3

Captainwhackschlong,I had almost the same experience All I could see was black though I was asleep when it happened I would always be inside a D cube The  voice would whisper but it was so loud like a screaming whisper it was terrifying It still happens occasionally still The whispers are the worst part,0,cdpp1e3,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
cnfvsed,This has happened to me Im  now and I still get the screaming voices However theyre not just when Im in bed about to fall asleep they happen during the daytime as well ,0,cdpp3uc,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
grrn,I had the voicessame thing Numerous persons sometimes whispering and sometimes yelling The room stayed the same size But I remember something else I remember being semi awake and I would float face down up to the ceiling I would float around my house and if my parents were up I could see them they couldnt see me and if I tried to talk or scream nothing came out I couldnt get their attention couldnt float lower It was something similar to reverse gravity like swimming will keep you at the top of the water This was a similar feeling ,1,cdpp675,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,1
oakles,I had something similar but Im not entirely sure if I remember there being voices When I was little Id occasionally wake up in the middle of the night and see someone standing in the doorway usually my mom or dad and they would just be staring at me When Id call out to them I wouldnt get a response and they would just keep staring After like  minutes they would just fade away and be gone it was really weird now that I look back on it,0,cdpp9kg,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
HarleiQuinn,I used to hear voices screaming in my head However it only happened when I was sick or when I was in that part of the brain between sleep and awake I had it happen so many times it was terrifying,0,cdpq2zd,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
Troghen,Yeah Im not sure if this is at all similar but I remember on a few occasions having something like that happen with the shrinkingwithout the voices but I also remember something I can best describe as pins not needle pins but like the inside of a lock pins and this is a vague descriptionits really hard to describe all lined up possibly floating slightly above the ground and all of the sudden they would just drop sometimes they also expanded and shrunk before or while falling and make a really loud crashing noise and it scared the hell out of me I remember it happened a lot when I was sick or if I woke up in the middle of the night,0,cdpqo4v,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
qaudforce,I actually do have the weird feeling thing often for like feeling small and disoriented I found that its a hit and miss sort of sideeffect that I get for decongestants,0,cdpqv90,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1

leialoup,I had it when I was a child but static and not voices Now I sometimes get the static still and my hearing will go and literally focus just on the static It disappears after about  seconds to a minuteOne thing I do also have is a weird sense of hearing When there are lots of people in a room I can hear everything and everyone to a point where its unbearable I cant be in a crowded restaurant and I hate shopping centres I hear everyones conversations Its so strange,0,cdpuo0z,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
Claireski,I have experienced voices I first noticed it in my late teensearly twenties amp still get it now Just as Im trying to fall asleep I can hear taking but cant make out words like you describe I find they get louder amp louder amp suddenly I jolt awake As soon as my eyes open they stop Sometimes it sounds like theyre talking in a different language Occasionally Ill just ride it out amp keep my eyes closed eventually Ill see faces but its nobody I recognise Someone once told me it could be caused by some kind of epilepsy how true that is I dont know Ive never paid enough mind to it to bring it up at the doctors,0,cdpux02,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2

Nicolestormborn,I used to experience something very similar to this when I was about  However I would hear music like s jazz music instead of voices The first few times it happened I would run out into my living to ask my mom to turn down whatever it was she was listening to but as soon as I left my room the music would stop Needless to say I still cant listen to jazz music without feeling creeped out,0,cdpzfvb,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
pizzamann,Sounds like an OEB experienceWhere all your surroundings seem surreal in a sense and everything looks different yet the same Its kinda like lucid dreaming only youre not really dreaming but its kinda hard to explain lol after a while though if you practice you can actually willing have oeb experiencesive done a few but the last time I did oneugh never again for a while anyways haha,0,cdpzq6l,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
Alison,This happened to me too Only a small difference I couldnt hear voices but I saw people I never recognized the people and they were talking but I couldnt hear what they were saying Or I would hear it in extreme slow motion My parents always said they were night terrors But I never actually fell asleep before it started,0,cdq0bhw,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
GhostOfDawn,I used to have many nightmares and I always heard strange noises when I was younger I would always keep a light on because I felt a lot safer that way A few nights I heard strange sounds coming from my living room it sounded like high pitched gibberish sounded like two beings were communicating Those nights terrified me This went on for a week or two,0,cdq0st9,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
epulella,Minus the voices Ive been experiencing this occasionally all my lifeThe room seems to become larger objects in it appear smaller and everything seems to go faster than normal movements speech etcIm glad someone brought up the Alice in Wonderland Syndrome as Ive always wondered heh what this was and if I was the only one experiencing itYour experience sounds quite terrifying though I couldnt deal with the voices,0,cdq100j,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
Eatsleepfag,Wow The same thing actually happened to me as a kid Every time I fell slightly asleep I would hear the voices They started as whispers and grew louder I could never understand what they were saying either As soon as I opened my eyes they would stop and I would like jump up and turn on the lights And the room stretching would always occur before I closed my eyes Later I concluded that it wouldnt happen when I left something on like the radio or the lights And Still to this day I sleep with something on ,0,cdq1ap5,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,2.0,2
Whiteblonde,I didnt hear any voices but ya the whole room expanding for a brief moment yes for that matter even outside in open amp it still happens sometimes May be its our eyes adjusting to conditions thats what i thought of it until now,0,cdq1ufa,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
kHvie,I dont know if this is true or nosleeptrue but something really similar used to happen to me all the time I would be just about to fall asleep when I would hear whispering never recognizable words though just sounds I only ever experienced one voice but it would get louder and louder over  minutes  and eternity as a  year old until the voice reached a deafening volume It was like a human roar that echoed in my hear for a solid  minutes and then suddenly Id be waking up in the morning or after a nap and everything would be fine,0,cdq1xgt,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
cimplosive,I do sometimes get that wired disorienting feeling from laying down perhaps too quickly  Like when you close your eyes you lose your balance and you think your about to fall No voices for me though,0,cdq2if3,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
stillborn,Im almost  and I still get this usually just before I get sick No voices but things seem disproportionate Thats not even the right term but its the best one I can think of Things seem small and far away but theyre proportionate with everything else Just far away My hands seems far away the walls seem far away everything seems like its far away but not disproportionate to each other Kind of like how things in the mirror seem to change size when you get closerfarther from the mirror but they really dont Ive had people suggest its AIWS but none of the symptoms match My body parts are proportionate Im not hearing things Im not having migraines etc It just feels like everything is SUPER far away ,0,cdq2k1i,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
haleywho,This happened to me a few different times when I was younger actually I  used to get really sick when I was little and wake up in the hospital so my child mind connected sleeping with that and I always got really nervous to fall asleep And thats when this started to happen I would experience the change in area size It felt like I was being pushed and pulled in my room while not moving at all Things becoming large and then me feeling small Then I heard the voices A very cluttered collection of voices and it would get so loud and my mom would have to come and help me fall asleep I hated it so much Reading this I felt like I knew what you were talking about ,0,cdq2oco,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
glbracer,Yeah this happened to me all the time from when I was around four to six maybe up until seven Sometimes it would be growing smaller sometimes larger I didnt hear voices or whispers but this loud music it would grow louder as time went on I reacted pretty much the same way Ive always wondered if this has ever happened to anyone else It stopped when I moved out of the house,0,cdq2qkl,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
WorldsWorstCanadian,When I was young I constantly had the room stretch out on me I would often reach for my night stand just to kind of gauge how far it was for me I never heard voices but Id see things during Rhodes times ,0,cdq2zgx,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
kahakiman,Oh god reading this has really freaked me out Aside from the voices this exact thing happened to me as I was a kid I think the doctors Ive been to called it Alice In Wonderland Syndrome I remember the room an my body and everything warping and changing and causing migraines and nausea I remember that I would end up so nauseous that I would often vomit and afterwards I would have to watch tv because every time I closed my eyes it would get worse  ,0,cdq3zu0,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
theaviatroy,This is what happens to me which I learned as they became frequent from ages   Whenever I fall asleep where I will accidentally put weight on an arm like sleeping with an arm behind you back  the larger space of my environment happens I would cry because sleep paralysis is also involved but like I said it only happens whenever an arm of mine is being weighed down by my asleep body Thank you for sharing,0,cdq4eyn,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1

Sheltonio,I used to have dreams where gradually peoples voices and tone would become more violent until they were finally shouting at me I almost always woke up sobbing in my bed nervous the people I loved in my dreams would be upset with me know real life ,0,cdq53u7,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
bleeblahblow,My experiences  yrs oldwere both awake and asleep Voices would crescendo into a roar and Id feel like taffy getting worked over My flesh would seem to expand with the space around me while my bones would condense A majority of the time I would wake and be so nauseous that dinner would leave me It was an oppressive feeling but hollowing It may have been a way for my mind to cope with things or it couldve been something else entirely swear Ive seen ghosts or something similar Either way Id wait and ride it out If I got sick the run into a lit bathroom and sounds of it would get drowned out and not come back It happened sporadically,0,cdq5ux8,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
Tinuva,Yeah this is nothing new to me Its been happening since i was five or so as well Eighteen years later and it still happens at least two or three times a week It starts with a complete lack of control of my body Im assuming some version of sleep paralysis then the expansion of space in my room it can often feel like Im lying in the middle of a football field Then its a weightlessness or the feeling of my limbs weighing a thousand times heavier Then the incessant whispering growing louder and louder with every passing minute until it becomes a roar I can never full hear what the voices say Probably should go see a psychiatrist about it one of these days ,0,cdq6gmp,1rplro,nosleep,top_week,1.0,1
