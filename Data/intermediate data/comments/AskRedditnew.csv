AdminWhore,I grew up in East Central Florida near the beach We saw tourists all the time and usually didnt think much of them They were important to our local economy so we always treated them well while making fun of them behind their backsI was in my early twenties heading home from work when I saw a station wagon broken down on the highway at the end of my street I lived a few houses down so I parked in my driveway and walked back to the highway where the broken car was parked It was a couple in their early s and two children  and  years old The car had a blown radiator hose that the guy had tried fixing with duct tape but it was still leaking I talked with them for a while and learned they were from the Chicago area on vacation heading to Miami to visit familyIt was getting late on a Sunday afternoon and it wasnt a very nice neighborhood so I helped Luis push the car down the street to my driveway and invited them in Isabella was a little nervous at first because I had long hair and a beard and was still dirty from work she told me that later They came inside and my house was clean and comfortable They were going to call a taxi and go to a motel until the morning when the parts stores opened I invited them to stay in my guest room and offered to drive them to the parts store in the morning  They were polite and tried to refuse saying it was too much but I insisted and they gladly accepted They were already tired and hungryWe ordered some pizzas and I brought out some cold beer The kids went to sleep in the guest room and I let Luis and Bella have my bed while I bunked on the couch In the morning we fixed the car and they were on their way I really liked them but I didnt think I would ever hear from them again I was wrongThis was  years ago and I still talk to them regularly They have sent me Christmas cards every year We exchanged letters and later emails and facebook over the years  They have returned to Florida and always stop and visit My wife loves them too and we are like family The children have always called me Uncle AdminWhore and I have been to their graduations and weddings Luis mom wouldnt leave Florida to be near her children in Chicago but we did talk her into moving up the cost from Miami She lived in a retirement home in my town until she died I visited her and she taught me to speak Spanish she was Cuban tldr a little kindness to strangers leads to lifelong family friendship,0,cdpphpl,1rpu1g,AskReddit,new,2.0,2

AlsoTheyReallyDo,In college my neighbor lived with his girlfriend and they were pretty wild party people One day there was a really cute blonde over there and I was invited over to hang out and all It was pretty cool That Friday the girl was over again and I was invited to go out to the club with them Afterwards we all took a taxi home and were drunkenly hanging out in their living room The guy and his girlfriend disappeared and soonafter we heard loud sex noises moaning headboard slamming against wall etc The blonde and I laughed about it and she put her hand on my leg and said They sound like theyre having funIm jealousI nervously took her hand off my leg and said yea it was weird and I should probably get to bed anywaySo I live literally right next door but she gets up and asks if she can walk me home and I was like sure and then she follows me in and is sitting on my bed undressing while I brush my teeth etc She is in her bra and panties laying on my bed  its a twinsize small bed so I climb over her and squish myself against the wall and fall asleepEven drunk I dont know what the fuck I was or wasnt thinking Could I have been THAT drunk tired and oblivious The thing is that the girl was pretty damn cute AND hot but I wasnt dating her and she was a friend so I somehow didnt process all of the obvious signals I remember having a pretty bad hangover the next morning and driving her back to her place and as she was getting out she sorta grabbed my head and pulled me in for a kiss on the cheek and told me I was a nice guyI did find out later that she was quite promiscuous so she was probably just hoping for another notch on her headboard but goddamn did I miss out I tell myself she probably had an STD to make it seem like I dodged a bullet instead of just a wild night of hot sex I still have a picture of all four of us at the clubbar that night,5,cdpo6tn,1rpufd,AskReddit,new,20.0,15

averagecanadiandude,As a smoker I dont think I could ever stop until I actually wanted to and felt ready to do so myself  You wanting her to stop could be that catalyst though so only time will tell  You have every right to break things off if she doesnt but like uTWFM said no one can decide that except you  You also have to consider the changes in her behaviour  If you are indeed the catalyst for her quitting and she decides to stop solely because of you you can expect to get a fair amount of stress  quitterrage taken out on you  I know that when I dont have a smoke for a day or two I can get very easily agitated something I would hate to see in my SO  And keep in mind I smoke much less than a pack per day  ,0,cdpn05l,1rpuov,AskReddit,new,5.0,5

heidismiles,Because of Youtube  People were doing this kind of thing in the past as well but it didnt go viral and nobody heard about it except the loved ones  Nowadays you can watch all kinds of elaborate proposals on the internet  It makes it seem like its becoming more prevalent and then it actually DOES become more prevalentIts the same thing as asking Why are there so many political scandals nowadays  While its possible that our politicians ARE becoming increasingly corrupt  its also because of the information age  In the past if a politician said or did something stupid or outrageous chances are wed never know about it unless it hit your local newspaper  Nowadays anything remotely scandalous and it can become national news within minutes,0,cdpofr2,1rpwo6,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

MyAngryAccount,When I woke up one morning to my alarm blaring and not being able to lift my arm to turn it off I thought I was still dreaming and tried very hard to wake up After a few minutes I realized that I was almost completely paralyzed The only thing I could move was my neck and so I was staring at my alarm clock as it blared unable to do anything about itNothing is scarier than waking up one morning and realizing that you may never be able to move again The fear sets in slowly as you start thinking about how long it will take before someone finds you You become your own worst enemy with the constant stream of thoughtsAm I dieingWill I die of dehydration before someone finds meWill I ever be able to move againThis is what goes through your head I lived with roommates but they were out and I knew they would not be back for at least hours from the time I woke up I fought with my body trying to force myself to move for about two hours before I was able to move my arms It was another couple of hours before I could roll myself off my bed and I started inching towards my bedroom door It took about five hours before I was able to pull the phone off my living room table by the cord and call for an ambulanceI started regaining the ability to move and by the night time that day I was back to walking The doctors had no idea what was going on I woke up the next morning in the exact same state After much testing it was determined to be thyrotoxic periodic paralysisIt changed my life because I chose to control my illness through diet and exercise Im now much healthier even though I am going against my doctors recommendation of radiation therapy Ive completely been able to keep my condition in check I did have to stop drinking alcohol though,62,cdpp5li,1rpwpk,AskReddit,new,290.0,228

Grnbltprimo,I was always way behind the other students in elementary school  In fifth grade we had to take a math aptitude test and the results would determine if we were to be placed in the average advanced or special level the following year  I took the test and just hoped that I wasnt going to be the only one in the special class  The results came back and the teacher announced to the class that three of the  students would be going on to the advanced class  The first unsurprisingly was the smartest girl in the class and the second was the teachers pet  I had pretty much tuned out at this point and had moved on to turning my mechanical pencil into a rocket ship with some folded paper when I heard my name  I was so surprised I thought I was in trouble  Apparently I got the highest score in the class and I would be going in to the advanced class  From that day on I had more confidence in my school work and my grades improved in other subjects as well  I skipped another grade in math by high school and I was even took calculus from the local community college before graduating  I went on to get a degree in electrical engineering and am now an engineer and enjoy the work the I do  I cant help but think that without that aptitude test I probably would have continued school as the below average student that everyone including myself thought I was    ,41,cdpoz05,1rpwpk,AskReddit,new,198.0,157

eodiv,Ive had several but the most recent happened just two days ago    I was married but ended up separating from my wife due to my own substance abuse issues mainly alcohol At one point during the separation we didnt talk at all for a good  months  During that time I landed a great job was able to buy a brand new car and was really turning things around  Then one day she called me and said she wanted to meet up  So we met at an iHOP for breakfast  It was August and she was wearing a hoodie which I found odd  After we sat down she proceeded to tell me that she wanted to tell me about what she had been doing  It turns out she had started using and became addicted to heroin  One night she overdosed and was found by a neighbor unconscious on the floor  They called   An ambulance and police came and the police searched her apartment finding heroin and paraphernalia After she was released from the hospital she was taken to jail and charged  Her parents who were extremely well off got her a good attorney and she pled out getting only probation and an order to attend outpatient rehab    Needless to say I was upset and disappointed about all of this  We had done other substances together in the past but we had an agreement that cocaine and heroin were the two things we would never do because of how dangerous they are    About two months into her probation and rehab she was tested randomly at rehab Ive been they pick one person at random each session  which occur every other day three times a week  and test them and she pissed dirty for heroin  She was taken back to jail bonded out and went back to court  Her lawyer negotiated a deal to keep her out of jail but requiring her to attend a  day inpatient rehab facility   During all of this she pressured by her parents decided our marriage was irreparable and we got divorced in January of   We still kept in touch though  The rehab seemed to do her good at first but once she really got clean about half way through it she turned into a huge asshole  She would call me or text me and say degrading things  Eventually she stopped and then I never heard from her again    Due to the divorce and my own mental health issues I was struggling worse than ever with substance abuse  I was drinking heavily every day and abusing Adderall and Klonopin  Last June under the influence of a lot of alcohol and Klonopin I lost my balance and fell through a plate glass topped coffee table  The glass shattered and a large piece lodged itself near my shoulder and as I learned at the hospital nicked my caroted artery  I had to call  and was rushed to the hospital where I received  stitches and was told that if the glass had gone in a half an inch further up I possibly would have bled to death  Just the next month last July  I was hospitalized after I began hearing things due to being up for  days straight on Adderall amphetamine psychosis basically and probated for  days  I had to attend a court hearing and basically convince a judge that I was capable of taking care of myself and living on my own  I bullshitted my way through it and was released from the hospital got on medication for bipolar disorder and began seeing a social workercounselor twice a month  I stayed clean for awhile and would text my ex to let her know how I was doing but never got any response  It pissed me off    A few months ago I began drinking again as well as abusing Adderall and Klonopin and smoking weed and I could see myself sinking fast  A couple of weeks ago after talking to my parents I decided I needed help and checked myself into the emergency room attempting to be admitted to the psych ward or referred to a rehab facility  They refused to do either because I was drunk as hell and released me instead after keeping me for about  hours and giving me IV fluids to rehydrate me  When I got home I texted my ex and told her that I was planning on checking myself into a rehab facility Again no response I figured she would have been proud of me for doing the right thing    Two nights ago I found out why she hadnt been responding    I looked her up on Facebook as I knew she had an account but nothing came up for her name  I found that strange  So I Googled her name and the first result was an obituary She died from a heroin overdose in her parents basement in October of last year  Even though we were divorced I never stopped loving her so I pretty much lost it and began crying    After regaining my composure it hit me  While I may not be doing heroin the Adderall and Klonopin abuse could be just as dangerous  I could take too many of one or a lethal combination of the two and die and since I live alone no one would find me for days  As much as I abuse them I have been extremely lucky up until this point even though Ive been put on a  hour hold in the hospital twice the one I mentioned previously and prior to that in  for overdosing on Adderall and flipping out    So I took both pill bottles into the bathroom and flushed the contents of them down the toilet  Today I called my doctor who has been prescribing them to me and admitted what I have been doing and asked him to stop prescribing them to me  I have resolved to never drink or smoke weed ever again and Im researching Narcotics Anonymous meetings that are close to my house and I will start attending them at least once a week    Im absolutely heartbroken over my ex wifes death  She was only  years old had moved back in with her family and seemed like she was on a good road to recovery  Part of me is mad that noone called and told me that she passed  It wouldve been fine if they didnt want me at the funeral but a phone call wouldve been nice  Yes we were divorced but we were together for almost  years  We started dating when she was   I was a huge part of her life  When I told my parents about this yesterday they were shocked that noone called me  Another part of me is upset because she had told me when we met up for breakfast after she ODed that she started doing heroin because I was doing so well at the time and she felt like she deserved to feel good too  In a roundabout way blaming me  Im sure she shared that with her parents who never liked me to begin with so I wonder if they hold even more of a grudge against me in light of her death  I thought for an hour straight earlier today about calling them but after talking to my dad I have decided against it  Im not going to get anything out of it and its only going to upset them and open up the wound Im sure they have and probably still are working extremely hard to heal I do know where she is buried though and this weekend I am going to go buy some flowers and place them on her grave with a little note so that anyone who comes to visit her will know I was there   I dont know what Im going to do to cope with her death but I do know that I will never use drugs or alcohol again  If she couldnt overcome her addiction and died as a result of it I could just as easily suffer the same fate  I realize this is going to be the hardest thing Ive ever done  Im going to need support and I may slip up but  I dont want to die  Despite my drug and alcohol abuse life has been going really well for me lately  The medication I take for Bipolar disorder is working well and its basically in remission  I dont get hyper manic like I used to  I dont always think people are talking bad about me and Im not constantly paranoid  Ive turned into a pretty friendly outgoing normal person  On the surface at least  After being unemployed for over a year Ive landed a great new job that pays well and I enjoy and have started dating a cool intelligent and beautiful girl  In addition to not wanting to die I dont want to risk losing any or all of those things just so I can get high    Drugs and alcohol have cost me a  a year job my aforementioned new car almost all of my friends my marriage and have landed me in the hospital numerous times  Yet I basically flipped fate a big ol middle finger and kept at it  Now that I know drugs have taken the person that I was closer to than anyone ever in my life my eyes have finally been opened Im done  I wish I wouldve known sooner and had this eye opening experience a year ago but despite the sadness Im feeling right now Im filled with the hope of having a happy healthy and substance free future  TLDR  I abuse drugs found out my ex wife died of a heroin overdose threw all my drugs away and have resolved to never use again,4,cdpny7t,1rpwpk,AskReddit,new,29.0,25

Trevastation,June  I went to a day camp that occasionally went on field trips and for the first week we went to the beach It was after the th grade and I was struggling to make friends only some years later til I learn I have Aspergers For one reason or another I had been in the sand and someone shaped it to be like I was a turtle Details hazy Over above me there was a girl taking pictures She had the most beautiful body and golden blonde hair with eyes as grey as a valiant knights armor She also has the most adorable laugh and smile that would make your heart melt I asked her for her name I had never asked a girl for her name before still havent after her Her name was Ally short for Allyson I swear I heard that name for the first time that day even though it was the name of my neighbors cat He hung out that day and many days after that during the summer I spent some of the best days of my life that summer and the summer after that We never had time during school because she went to a private school and I went to a public school For the first time I felt like some girl understood me was weird like me yet wanted to be my friend Never in my life had I had a female friend She became my best friend and one of my only friends But I started to fall in love with herI ruined our friendship and maybe a possible relationship Shes dating a girl and I never felt so alone in my life especially with me mom who really understood me just died of Ovarian Cancer I fucked it all up and she wont even talk to me her GF doesnt want her talking to me either I wish so much to just have a second chance Just fix all the mistakes I made She was different from all the other girls I didnt look at her with lust to take her to bed I saw beauty and magnificence in her I saw a future I saw a chance of not being afraid anymore I remember that day because that day I met a girl A girl who rocked my world and Ill always treasure her tldr Met an amazing girl Sorry for wall of text,4,cdpqssw,1rpwpk,AskReddit,new,25.0,21

Daringestdo,I chose to not be Catholic anymore I was raised that way  and even though my parents never go to church they still want me to go get a confirmation done and marry in a Catholic Church I honesty dont see why they make religion such a big deal if neither of them practice it anymore I respect other peoples religions and beliefs but if I had to call myself something it would probably be agnostic ,0,cdpnwti,1rpy88,AskReddit,new,2.0,2

HayricanSAMA,Oh I got a nice one for this Or sad oneIm from Germany and in summer  I was in England for two weeks It was kind of a language course and there were about  other students in my age Two weeks passed and I had a lot of fun meeting people living at a host family and doing stuff with my frined who had come with meOn our last evening when there was almost no time to meet the others because early in the morning we had to return the whole group ate pizza at a restaurant I sat there with my friend and all of the sudden a girl I havent seen before sat down on the other side of the tableWe had one of the most magical and enthusiastic conversations EVER It was amazing Ive never before felt such a deep and strong connection to anyone We were definitely meant for each otherUnfortunately we were seperated because when we had to go back to Germany I got to know she lives in the south and I rather in the north Im so glad I asked her for her number usually I am not the guy to make such a optimistic move when getting someone to knowWe chatted since then everyday on Whatsapp and it is still amazing because she felt the same way I did in that restaurant our conversation was absolutely fantastic and we soon fell in love with each other There are like km between us and we didnt have the chance to meet each other yet but we willAnd as soon as I can finally hug and feel her this story will be complete,20,cdpobib,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,115.0,95
OlivesRose,I started talking to this guy on facebook he was blunt opinionated and from what I could tell a genius He intrigued the fuck out of me on an intellectual level and we started talking Mostly joking and insulting eachother Eventually I got comfortable with him and Id vent to him even though I was sure it only bothered him It didnt One particularly bad day I wasnt really in the mood to talk to anyone and I made it known He told me that he didnt count when I didnt want to talk to anyone and he ended up giving me his phone number so I could text him about it I did I stayed up all night texting him He kind of became the only person I went to to talk about things but at that point we werent interested in eachother romantically He was pursuing a different girl kind of quietly but I ended up catching on after a couple monthsNow I have to take a second to say we were totally opposite people He smoked drank partied and generally didnt give a single fuck And I went to church every Sunday got straight As and had never gotten drunk It sort of bothered me that he was into those things but Im also not the type of person that will tell you how to live And like I said he intrigued the fuck out of meOne night he called me I thought it was on accident because it was late at night and well hed never called me before I answered hesitantly and sure enough he called on purpose We talked for about  hours that night He was so interesting to me and from then on we talked on the phone quite a bit often for hours at a timeAnyway the girl he had been pursuing ended up changing her mind It broke his heart and I remember him telling me that I was the only girl he didnt hate now At the time I didnt know what he meant By this time I cared about him more than he knew This is where it gets scary I almost lost him before anything began He almost ran away he stole a truck and made it to the border of our state and then decided to turn back He later told me he came back because of me He didnt tell me this even happened until a while after it did I remember a little while after he told me he went camping in a part of our state that is essentially wilderness There was no cell service and he didnt answer me for  days By the th day I thought he left It scared the shit out of me We werent even dating at that pointFast forward a little and we started actually hanging out It was kind of an unsaid date the first time we hung out He walked all the way across town to meet me and we hung out at a park Hed comment on how small my hands were just so he could compare hand sizes and almost hold my hands I think he thought I was oblivious I wasnt We continued hanging out and everytime he would walk all the way across town Hed say sweet things to me and we both knew where it was going One day we were sitting on a hill overlooking a feild at just about dusk and he put his arm around me It was the time of year where your not quite used to the colder fall air He was warm and I was shivering Half because of excitement the other half cold I remember it like it was yesterday Then he officially ask me out It was all so perfect Hed call me every night before I fell asleep to say goodnight Actually he still does only now sometimes Im asleep first Wed write eachother letters and he made me music Wed lay on a blanket outside and look at stars and we even danced under the moon Hed sing Frank Sinatra to me when we go on walks One time we met at the beach and it started pouring rain I wanted to wait it out under a gazebo but he insisted we just walk back to his house So we did It was summer and the rain was warm enough to comfortably get soaked We ran the couple blocks back kicking water at eachother and laughing I only wish I would have kissed him to make it more cliche Nonethless that day was wonderful Weve been together a little over a year now and I feel like my life is a romance novel We of course have our fights not everything is perfect But I am incredibly greatful for the memories I have shared with this man He means the world to meTL DR I got carried away Literally and figuratively Edit spelling and a few more details Also Im on mobile and this post doesnt really do it justice ,15,cdppakk,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,61.0,46
GettinHooked,Time for another addition of Super Gayliterally Story TimeI fell in love with my female best friend when I was  years old It was confusing and given the fact that she was extremely religious conservative and by all noticeable signs straight it was pretty much a bummer I never told her I was gay let alone in love with her and it strained our relationship throughout the years As most  year old girls are she become pretty much awful throughout high school Obsessed with social climbing and doing whatever was the status quo We drifted apart and I had to painfully watch her date d bag after d bag for a few years Eventually I came out and had a few relationships in the long attempt to move on and forget about her Toward the end of high school we rekindled our friendship and she apologized for letting peer pressure get the best of her Right before graduation we got drunk and hooked up It was about as amazing as I ever thought it could be But afterward she freaked out and insisted we should talk or see each other especially next yearwe ended up at the same collegeAs much as it hurt I respected her decision and figured it would stick since she was going Greek which is essentially the college version of high school cliques I had accepted this end until she called me one day a few months into freshman year saying she had to see meWe met up and she instantly started sobbing saying she couldnt do this anymore That shed always been in love with me and had tried so hard to just ignore it She had no idea what this meant for her life or sexuality but she knew she couldnt fight it any moreIt was a long long journey and it hasnt ever been easy but were now out to friends and my family Going strong for over a year now I still cant believe it when I wake up next to the love of my life who I thought would never be mine There were a thousand times when all reason and sense told me to give up on it forever but sometimes the heart knows best TLDR After many years my first lesbian crush turned into the happiest relationship of my lifeAlso for the record OP idk if love stories are gonna make you feel better little masochistic but your wish is my command,10,cdprrdx,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,50.0,40

freedomsong,You want a love story Um Okay Lets see Oh yeah Okay so um yeah here we goMet my husband back in high school We were friends He married one of my best friends We had a series of party houses with semiregular room mates Basically lived together including his wifemy bff and othersoff and on for years She cheats They have a crappy divorce I was right there for him I am still best friends with him at the end of it We continue living together with friends for a couple of years One day I am just sitting around looking at him and realize I have a HUGE crush on him Im talking one of those scramble to the journal and freak out moments Since we were best friends I decided that going for it was a terrible idea that would end our friendship and destroy the house dynamics My world is crumbling So I set him up with a girl I know Logical solution IDK Obviously that doesnt work out Then the worst luck ever has to strike He and I wind up going after the same girl Crazy confusing I know That doesnt work out for either of us So I start dating a guy and we hit it off Future hubby finds out and his world comes crashing down now too He starts going after me HARD I soon find myself in a bad break up Presto Future hubby and I start talking about our feelings I was VERY resistant to the idea To the extent that we sat down and had several very long talks about it I never saw myself with someone like him I didnt think he could handle the kind of relationship I needed and I couldnt see our relationship change going well Basically my answer was a cautiously stern NOLittle did I know that he was a man who had finely crafted the Wear them down approach to love and war Through a series wide of romantic gestures like ninja kisses he slowly won me over It was a week or two before I realized we had already transitioned from best friends to boygirlfriend Surprisingly it worked VERY wellI have never been good with relationships Honestly the fact that we were friends for a decade before anything happened was probably the only reason we lasted the first year We dated for a year were engaged for another year and have been married for four years now We were inseparable as friends As in if someone either of us dated wouldnt deal with our close friendship and constant presence in each others lives the relationship was over In hindsight that was probably a BIG clue I cant imagine my life without himI always had a rule that I would never date my best friend Friendship is important and lasting friendships are more precious then you realize when you are younger If it werent for the series of insane events that brought us closer and closer together wenever would have gotten married Today I would highly advise anyone considering letting a possible happy relationship pass them by due to friendship alone to feel it out and give it a try It is not a normal love story I suppose It was chaos from the start It was exactly what we needed Finally saying YES to him was by far the best decision I have ever made I am happy and we have an amazing child together This really could not have turned out any better for us ,4,cdpq94r,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,14.0,10

RosalindSHH,This will probably get buried because its late in the game Im not great at articulating things or writing stories and this is so goddamn long Im sorry Im so sorry But hopefully it might cheer you up Or not WARNING THIS IS REALLY LONG BECAUSE I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BREVITYI was home from University for winter break I had broken up with my SO over a year ago just had the worst sex of my life with the first guy I had a hint of feelings for and was not looking for a relationshipI had never been in love and wasnt sure it existed I didnt think Id fall in love  I had worked my whole life to get into a top university and now I was working to get into a good graduate school  Relationships were too time consumingMy cousinclose friend and I are hanging out during winter break and she suggests we go see a movie at one of those dinnerandamovie movie theaters After much debate I reluctantly settle for the Hobbit It was a great movie but I didnt think I would like it at the timeI walk into the theater and in the enormous loungebar area I see a cutehandsome waiter Completely out of my league   Im pretty socially awkward and have never considered myself attractive but my friends describe it  as ugly duckling syndrome Ugly in high school Less shitty now  I quickly look down when he lifts his head We walk past him and I dont dare make eye contact When I think its safe I turn around to get my last look at him   We make eye contact because we both did a double take at the same time  Oops  Now I know he was checking my ass out How romanticI head into the theater and we sit down for prepreviews  Although my cousin is pushing me to talk about my past quarter Im raving about how hot that guy is to my cousin  There are four people in the whole theater   I see a waiter walk into the theater and squat down to take their order As the waiter gets up I realize its him  Hes coming towards us  Oh shit I should order something I wasnt planning toHe squats down near my legs Focus Focus Hi My name is cant hear over the panic in my head what would you like After fumbling with the menu I order peanut MampMs  He comes back with the order  I want to see him again I push the button he returns so I order a Kit Kat bar   Then I push the button again and order watertwo cups  Ive spent  on overpriced candy  Not good I still have to buy presentsAnd now I have to pee I get up and as I walk out of the theater out of nowhere I hear Can I help youOH MY GOD Oh god Sorry You scared meHe laughs um yeah no Im goodjust DONT TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO PEE RosalindSHH outAt this point I realize my pants only have back pockets into which to place my hands uncomfortably He replies Oh ok Hows the movieIts good its good Yeah silence Say something Anything Youre wearing TWO sets of glasses  What Oh yeah this is so I can watch the Monsters inc movie in D I love those moviesMe too I really like pixarWe banter about pixar and some other stuff for a while and then the desire to pee becomes overwhelming Ok well nice meeting you In the bathroom I decide Ill write my number on the receipt Hell never call Thats going to be so embarrassing  Worth a shot Right Right Something something miss  of the shots you dont take Now Ive been in the bathroom too long and hope I dont run into himAs Im turning the corner back to my theater he is opening the door to deliver the receiptsHey I waveOh hey he replies nervously I thinkAs I get closer I ask him Which one is mine Ill take it nowNo dont worry about it  I got it He repliesThats silly Ill just bring it inside I had given my card beforeNo no really I got itI see my receipt  Theres another piece of paper on top of it with writing on it A careful smile appears on my face as I take the receipts and I read itHey I dont mean to embarrass you but you are cute and you seem like youre worth getting to know  Maybe give me a call sometime Hes red Im beaming And admit Dont worry I was thinking of doing the exact same thing I write my phone number down on his copy Make some awkward comment about tipping being awkward now Give a  tip because my brain isnt working  And run back into the theater to inform my cousinWe text for a bit and settle on a coffee shop for our first date  I cant go for drinks because Im under  I find out later hes  and working that in addition to a normal business job to make extra cashThe start of the first date was horrible  We just sit there and drink tea because neither of us actually drinks coffee Interviewstyle questions are occasionally interspersed between sips The rest is awkward silence  Look Im really bad at this whole sitting and talking thing I just dont know I dont do this I dont know how can we go for a walkHe replies yeah sureThree blocks in I realize that the fleecelined tights I borrowed from my mom are too big They are slipping closer to the ground with every step I take ShitHey I need to stop in that dark spot And I need you to turn around and dont ask questions Ok Im not going to kill you or mug you I swear Just stare at that treeWe do this several times until I finally admit that my tights are coming off We talk back to my car where I take off the tights and leave them behindThen we walk around For miles  hours of walking Its freezing and we dont care   hours later we do care and return to the coffee shop for an hour to warm up We talk about everything We even happened to have watched the same neuroscience TED talks Hes actually really funny and smart  Its  am now and the coffee shop closesHe walks me to my car and we hug goodbye Its awkward but kissing doesnt feel right quite yetOur next date we end up just walking around my neighborhood for  hoursThe next date same thing  hours Just talking and getting to know each other In the following weeks he drives me crazy He seems to be hot and cold and it bothers me like its never bothered me before  My sister asks me if Im in love and I tell her that thats ridiculous because I just

chatttheleaper,Im not doing this to get advice Im doing it because you asked I met her  years ago Actually we have varying opinions on where we first met She says we sat together at one point and I talked to her briefly I say we met staffing a Halloween carnival Shes entirely right about where we first met but she likes to mock me with what I said so I tend to forget At the class where I first met her I thought she was kind of strange Cute but not somebody I thought Id have any interest in Looking back it seems funny that someone whos come to matter so much to me initially seemed like somebody I had no interest in as a friend So later at the carnival I was stuck working a booth with her So I made some small talk and we wound up hitting it off pretty well And then at the end of the night she introduced me to the girl I had sat with at the class Confused So was I Turns out the girl I was working with was the identical twin of the girl from the class So we talked for a bit more before I left At the classes after that wed hang out and times were good I started to fall in love with both of them since they were both great friends and I enjoyed hanging out with both of them As we started to hang out more I only loved them more However our schedules caused us to see each other infrequently After about a year we saw each other less and most of our communication was electronic This worked fine at first but even that slowly stagnated But then this year we started attending the same school They were new to the area and didnt have many friends so they spent a lot of time with me It was around this point I figured out which one of them I wanted to be with However they started to make new friends as well I became obsessive and started to worry every time they talked to a guy who wasnt me I saw them flirting where they werent and I started to become more closed off However I recently managed to shake those fears and Im now back to whatever state am ambiguous platonicism we were formerly in,1,cdpsdlz,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,3.0,2

charlie,My story is pathetic Im pathetic I met her when I was young even before high school I was relatively new to this school but I already knew most people by that time apart from her Some friends were talking about her and I didnt know who she was so they pointed her out and my god it was like I had seen an angel It may sound cliché but I really have never experienced something like that again Ive had a few crushes before this was very differentI was still pretty social back then so I didnt really have any trouble introducing myself and I learned she lived nearby From then on I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible When I was playing on the streets I would always check if she was out aswell or when we were at school Id try to be around her as much as possibleWeve had some good times together some are definitely highlights of my life Most likely not as meaningful to her as they are to me however I honestly didnt try having a relationship with her If she wanted it heck yeah but I didnt want to force it in that way I just enjoyed being with her I was happy But then of course the clouds got darker See my brother was also in love with her but he didnt approach it in the same way He told her pretty much right away and he got rejected He didnt give up though and made several other desperate attempts to confess his love to her Eventually she got fed up with it I think cant blame her and she insulted him by calling him a fatass Weve always been larger than most kids not obese or anything just bulkier Ive always been pretty insecure about my body and this certainly didnt help since I was a few kilos heavier than my brother It didnt change the way I feel about her though I simply realised she doesnt feel the same way about me or atleast my chances would be very low Then my parents split up and we had to move and change schools We lost touch The whole family situation stepmom mainly had quite an impact on me To put it short became very insecure got addicted to computer games which made me lose pretty much all my friends and my social skills are zero Got fatter on top of that Still didnt get back in touch with herThis went on until my last year of high school  I started thinking about whats gonna happen after high school I had zero ambition I started looking at some possible educations and decided studying IT would be my safest bet Then I looked at what collegesunis would be possible and I noticed she went to the one that stood out the most Some other good stuff happened aswell which made me realise it isnt all that bad and some changes made me lose my MMORPG addiction I started going to the gym which made me lose quite some weight Life was starting to get betterSkip to my first year in college I wanted to see her so badly but Im so fucking shy and socially awkward My appearance improved a lot but Im still fucking insecure I checked when and where she would have class and Id try to accidently meet her This went on for a few weeks but I never saw her for some reason Until one day it finally happened There she was so beautiful I got so nervous I could barely walk and I definitely didnt have the courage to go talk to her I walked past her and hoped she wouldnt notice me This went on for the rest of my first year I saw her a few times but never had the guts to go talk to her Now Im in my second year I lost some more weight but still very insecure shy and socially awkward I already saw her a few times in the first period but again I always chickened out Until one time I just thought fuck it and I finally said hi It was fucking awkward She was so nice to me but I just didnt know what to say It turned into some awkward smalltalk I wanted to know so much about her but I just didnt get to it Now Im still trying to accidently meet her on the subway and have a second chanceEven after all these years she means so much to me eventhough nothing serious ever happened and she probably couldnt care less about me Shes what has kept me going for the last  years Without her or atleast the idea of her I would have ended up much worse I just want her to be a real part of my life again I dont want to be just a stranger from the past Im pathetic,0,cdpu3uq,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

ObviousBicycle,Are we just talking happy love stories Because surely theres such a thing as unhappy love stories Not unrequited love stories Just shitty love that doesnt work out because youre both too afraid to properly commit Both too afraid to admit how much you adore each other because you have both been hurt in the past and you both have weird issues Weird issues that the other only really knows a fraction about because that one time you got hammered and spoke about it a little before bursting into tears You kiss its there you can feel it Its totally there Theres a connection that youll never forget ever Theres that feeling you get in the pits of your stomach when you think back on it How when you first kissed there was such an urgency in it An urgency that wont ever be repeated with anyone else You wanted each other so much in that moment You knew you loved each other right then and there It wasnt just lust Weve all felt lust before but this was something completely extraordinary Everything completely disappeared around you in those moments Moments you replay over and over again in your headTheres the comfort of them just being there physically but then at the same time being totally unattainable because you cant communicate properly because you dont know how You can feel the frustration at yourself and them growing inside you but you cant do anything about it because that would require changing each other and that would in turn affect everything you love about them already But then you try and do something about it because you want them all you want all of them You start being selfish and you say you dont want half of them any more But that means that youve blown it Youve blown it forever because you tried to change it and even though it wasnt healthy it was still love And love is eternal you cant change the way you love someone You love someone because you love someone And risking it all because its not the normal way of loving someone is foolish But you do it You ruin it You ruin the complete and utter life changing love that you once had that you cant ever brush under the carpet ,0,cdpxsp8,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

SergeantCoodles,Boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now  We met on the same University dorm floor and initially didnt like each other He seemed outspoken and slightly rude and liked to flaunt his knowledge He also had some experience with drinking and drug use which I didnt at that time I was in the middle of a tryingtobreakupwithmyex while my exs best friend was also trying to pursue me I was confused and on top of that was a new freshman attempting to make friends so I had a difficult time adjustingWe had mutual friends on the floor and that brought us infinitely closer He was there to talk me through my relationship issues and just be someone I could message or drop in with I could eventually cut off ties with the ex and the bad situation with his BFF We went deerwatching and stargazing and had random sleep overs and movie nights with other floor members One night we awoke and we were the only ones still up after a night of social drinking and horrible movie watching He asked if I wanted to spend the rest of the AM in his room I was reluctant but obliged Thus began over a month or so of us purely cuddling  spooning and just talking I felt safe Eventually he wanted us to be official It took me a while to come around out of fear of how my other relationships spiralled down but he awaited patiently Now I have no regretsSure we fight a lot and have squabbles about purely nothing Hes annoying and games way too much But he pulled me out of a bad time in my life  I was dealing with family issues and am now having trouble with anxiety and depression Even with meds I can be moody and unstable assigning blame and crying a lotNo matter what though hes stuck through it with me at all times Its a learning pathway for the both of us We grow and learn how to communicate better each and every time Most of all  Im happyId give him a hug but alas were on the verge of a new disagreementHUG PENDING,0,cdpxzx4,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

WhiteCocoa,Sorry in advance for the wall of text whenever I tell this story I have to tell it exactly as I remember it amp it has a happy ending  It all started a little over three years ago I went to my college orientation at SLU in St Louis I remember one of the speakersleaders said Look around you people make life time friends with people starting out at SLU  what they called our orientation I remember I scoffed at that amp thought Yeah right with all these random people here How do they know that Fast forward to that night everyone in our group was playing Scoot Your Boot a game that had the same concept as musical chairs but you had to state something that you could do amp everyone else that could do that would have to run across the room to another empty chair This literally is going to sound cheesy but I saw him across the room from me and I remember thinking that he was really attractive so I was like Im gonna go ahead and run on whatever this next thing is and sit right next to him So I did Annnnd he got up and ran somewhere else haha Fast forward a couple of months we were friends on facebook and I saw him make a status about his nephew wanting to be like him so I liked it He poked me I thought it was an accident haha so I poked him back He sent me a message saying How come I never see you around campus and I told him that I was a commuter so we decided to meet up and hang out I still to this day can remember what he was wearing the first day we hung out but not what I was wearing and where we decided to meet to walk back to his place  The Bean When I saw him he opened his arms for a hug amp we hugged which I wasnt expecting at first because I realized everyone at SLU shook hands So this always stands out to me We walked back to his dorm and watched The Crazies I was instantly comfortable with him which never happens to me Around guys Ive always had my guard up but with him never We were sitting in chairs in front of his TV and my legs were wrapped in his and I remember thinking that this felt right I felt like I was supposed to be there with him The next day we hung out again It honestly was what I was looking forward to all day We ended up watching tv at his place and one of his chairs broke Totally out of character for me I said Well I dont mind just sitting on your lap Again I felt comfortable and right Like I was supposed to be there with him I felt him looking at me so I turned my head and looked down at him and he was smiling Before I could say anything to him he said Whos my pretty girl and I said in a joking manner I mean you could be talking about me Is it me maybe He chuckled at me and pulled me in for a kiss Reddit let me tell you that a kiss had never been so perfect and felt so right I lost track of time I was only concentrated on the two of us In two weeks well be celebrating our third anniversary  Over the course of three years Ive fallen in love with him again and again everyday It not just his looks that attract me to him Its his soul his mannerisms his smell the way he still gives me butterflies like he did on day one I love this man With all I have and all that I am,0,cdq0xhb,1rpyj1,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

Lonewolf,Im an emergency dispatcher for a company that monitors emergency elevator help and pool phones I work the night shift on weekends so I get a lot of weird calls Honestly after a while they all kind of blend together but a few stick out Back when I first started I had a lawyer who was stuck in a public storage elevator call in I ask my questions and Im just about to hang up and begin calling for help when she starts ranting about how shes a big fancy lawyer and is going to sue public storage and my company if shes not freed from the elevator in the next five minutes I had to try hard not to laugh at the absurdity of threatening the only people who can help you I believe she ended up staying in the elevator for another thirty minutes or so Which is actually pretty quick as far as elevator entrapments go Another time we got trolled hard by this one guy Now being a little fucker and misusing the phones isnt uncommon but it usually amounts to some asshole kid calling yelling DICK into the phone and running off This time was different At the time we were acting as the answering service for an elevator company The only thing about that thats relevant is that when someone called in on that line it wouldnt pull up the exact location of the caller So this highly irate gentleman calls in yelling about hows hes stuck in the elevator Im unable to get a location message to play and all the guy will say when asked is a nonexistent address in Manhattan Then he starts calling me a cunt among other colorful things Now the elevator company I was answering for was based in Colorado not New York When i pointed that out hed just repeat the address in Manhattan he listed earlier then rattle off the same string of insults After about five minutes of arguing with him and becoming more and more irritated it dawned on me that everytime he said something hed say it in the exact same tone and rythm Yep It was one of those Soundboard things I wasnt even mad Id been duped by a machine I transferred it to my supervisor and told her my Soundboard theory The best part is that she proceeded to argue with it for another five minutes even though I told her it was a machine Theres probably a recording on YouTube somewhereIve got a few more but Im on my phone and this took forever Also Im actually at work right now Ill post more later Maybe ,1,cdpullf,1rpzgf,AskReddit,new,15.0,14

spoiledfruit,When I came to the US at the age of  I was so immersed in fitting in and learning to be Americanspeak English that I lost a large portion of my Russian speaking ability  I think speech is tied to memory at least for me it is as I have trouble remembering a lot of the things that happened before I was   I speak English as well as a native without an accent  A lot of people have trouble believing that I wasnt born in the US  The one memory that is very much vivid and sad that sticks out is when my grandmother passed away  I remember my father bringing me to my grandparents apartment and my mom was there in all black clothing sweeping when she sees me she starts crying and tells me that babushka isnt here anymore and that I wont be able to see her  I think the reason this memory sticks out so much is because my grandmother and me had such a strong bond  Off topic but the most fun memory I have is  My grandmother was disabled on the left side of her body because of the flood of BabiYar  Even though she was disabled she would still horse around with me and be a regular grandma   My grandmother and I were sitting on a circular bench in her kitchen that curved around a table we started at one end and I kept sliding close to her and bumping her and she would move over  When we got to the other end she fell off the bench  My family still talks about this story even though it was  years ago  I was the younger of only two grandkids and Im pretty sure I was her favorite  Anyway the saddest part of this is how it hurt my mom to lose her  ,0,cdpovf2,1rq0lf,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

abetterthief,Mainly coworker blunders Had one guy leave the back door of a  door sedan open and back it off of a  post lift Post on the right rear caught the door and bent it forward till it was flush with the passengers front door Little old lady driving it didnt seem too upset about it We of course ended up paying for it to be repaired Had another coworker who removed all the lugnuts off the wheel before lifting the vehicle off the ground He hadnt even set the hoist up just started removing nuts Called me over because he was confused as to why he couldnt get the wheel offI my self have had butthole puckering moments where the lock on one of the posts of a  post lift stays locked but the rest of the lift keeps lowering In essence the vehicle starts tipping towards one direction and will keep doing so unless you lift it back up off the lock  Did this with a BMW  series that rolled until the tire chucks stopped it because I wasnt paying attention  Ive got more if anyone caresEDIT TO ADDI had a coworker who forgot to take the expensive alignment head reflectors off the passengers side of the vehicle after aligning it Drove it around the block and somehow they managed to stay on Luckily as they are atleast  a pieceI had a service manager have one of the techs remove an air pressure regulator off our tire machine because it was too slow to fill up tires Service manager later had his drag racing buddy bring in pure aluminum rims so they could mount some tires for him Machine ended up completely warping the rims beyond use because there was nothing to stop it from continuously putting force on the rim Shop ended up paying out  for a new rimSooo many double gaskets So many I had a  year old alcoholic coworker while he was welding exhaust accidentally weld a hole into a metal gas tank on a s somethingoranotherit was while ago so I cant remember what kind of vehicle Maybe a Maverick Seriously starts dripping gasoline out right next to his arc Only moments away from horrible firey disasterI watched the owner of the previous shop I worked for spray brake cleaner all over the underside while it was in the air to clean up some oil Which is no big deal its what we all do But he did it moments before the tech working on it came back and did not tell him so The tech was going to get the acetylene torch to cut off some exhaust shielding It was too late to tell him before the underside of the car started on fire with a poof Luckily the tech had a water hose in front the the car to spray it down withSomething driver related Had a  Acura Integra brought in for a clunking noise While I was lifting up the vehicle the upper ball joint fell out of its socket Like just fell out so the knuckle was hanging by the lower control arm and the tie rod We tell the driver she cant drive it like this its  going to cause a crash She says she will call a tow truck to come tow it away I set the ball joint back in the socket while im lowering it so that we can atleast roll it out of the shop While we werent paying attention the driver grabbed her keys off of the hang up hook and drove the vehicle away never to be seen again Thats is as dangerous as you can getWe nicknamed a previous coworker chicken sandwich He had just gotten lunch at Wendys and had a unwrapped chicken sandwich in his hand Other coworker comes up behind him with a lighter and brake clean Proceeds to light it and spray said sandwich eating coworker which then lights sandwich eating coworkers ass on fire Takes his sandwich and pats out the flames then proceeds to continue eating it like nothing happened Still have more if anyone is still readingMOARA guy who got canned shortly after I started was fired for accidentally crashing a Landrover into the pillar between our baysl He said he mixed up the brake pedal and the gas pedal This was his second time doing thisOne of my shops fired a guy because we was just a full on dumbass We had an oil gun that had a gallon meter that didnt work This guy used only that gun for  whole day basically guessing about how much oil he was putting in No one noticed until the end of the day  Same guy put the wrong oil filter on a Scion XB which then fell off as he was pulling it out A Chevy Express came back into the shop  days after he was canned for a complaint of  a oil leak Guy did the oil change on that vehicle but didnt tighten down the oil filter enough and it spun off Engine was ok just had to pay for the underbody clean upThe scariest things that I saw pop up where what we called wheel offs or when the tech forgot to properly torque down the lugnuts My friend did this on a Hummer H with s Guy got down the road and his front wheel went rolling past him My friend had completely forgotten to put the lug nuts on that wheel My shop owner ran to his bay grabbed the lug nuts and threw them into the parking lot where the guy picked his H up from after we worked on it Told the guy someone must have been trying to steal his rims He was a shitty owner had I been there I would have called him on that bullshit Friend did a timing belt on a Hyundai Started it to make sure the timing was set right and it ran fine Sadly while doing this the timing belt walked itself off the crank pulley and being an interference engine one of the valves slammed a hole through the piston His shop owner had him put in a used engine with more miles and never told the driver what happened Had a driver complain that his tail lights were not working Explained to him that they do not come on while your daytime running lights are on and that you have to actually turn the headlights on to turn on your tail lights He told us we didnt know what we where talking about and said he was going to bring his car to the dealer Whatever I guess Go embarass yourself elsewhereHad a crazy lady who would sob uncontrollably everytime she brought her Santa Fe to our shop She was know around town as being nutty Kept bringing her truck in

PraxisLD,They tell a story in engineering class about a guy who complained his car would never start when he bought vanilla ice creamAny other flavor and the car started fine but never with vanillaThey car checked out fine they couldnt reproduce the problem etc but the owner kept complainingFinally they sent a tech with the customer to buy ice creamTurns out that all the ice cream was kept in the back of the store except for vanilla which had its own freezer right up front So buying vanilla ice cream was a very quick trip and the car wouldnt start because it was still overheated and vapor locked from the short time it was turned offSince the other ice cream was further back the longer stop gave the car enough time to cool so it would start againOnce they had changed the symptom from vanilla ice cream to car wont start soon after being turned off they were able to find the problem and fix it properlyTLDR Sometimes the customer knows what is wrong but not how to describe it correctly,4,cdpsr8w,1rq14u,AskReddit,new,18.0,14

ConfusingUsername,I used to consider myself one and I honestly had  relationships going at once all knew the others existed and usually would have sex with  of the women a minimum of  times a day  Apparently they loved the arrangement due to the lack of strings and they trusted that I wasnt going to break that bond  They would even out source said info as well and sometimes I often found myself in new company Oddly enough though I had a testosterone deficiency at the time  After a while my sex drive went from multiple times a day to nothing  No masterbation no thoughts no arousal at all really  I have no idea when or why it happened but I have had no desire at all for  years now and honestly have to concentrate very hard if a situation arises for sex and is just selfish for me to reject the person for whatever reason  Its amazing how completely objective everything became after that as well Also no sperm at all so children are out of the picture   If you ever have any questions  regarding either lifestyle please dont hesitate to ask ,0,cdpovss,1rq1fq,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

braindeadidiot,Absolutely If youre in LA proper you might be able get around with public transportation but bring lots of cash because its not cheap If youre in any one of the multitude of suburbs then you will definitely need a vehicle or youll spend more time getting to your destination than you will being at your destination For example I live  miles from work I used to have to get up at  in the morning to catch three different buses in order to arrive at work by  and Id still have to walk at least a half mile from the nearest bus stop to work once I got there A car may cost you but itll save you tons of time in the end,0,cdppnp7,1rq34h,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

nojustice,One of the few useful things I learned from a driver reeducation class I had to take one time was that every feeling we experience has a finite lifetime in our brains The neurochemicals that are released when we feel happy or sad or angry or aroused or need a drink quickly fade away again unless we keep reactivating the pathways that released them in the first place This is why they tell you to count to ten But its not enough to just count to ten and let the time pass you have to also not keep triggering the emotion The way that I like to think about it is that i experience whatever emotion it is I let it have its moment and then I let is pass Its like I neither suppress it nor reinforce it but rather let it pass over me You will find your own way of dealing with it but just remember that each emotion only lasts a few seconds to half a minute Any more than that is you choosing to keep feeling it All you have to do is choose not to I say all you have to do but I understand its not as easy as that It takes practice and it takes intention but it can be done ,0,cdppl3m,1rq3gy,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

thesamroberts,From Wikipedia alcohols primary effect is the increase of the GABAa receptor promoting central nervous system depression  With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number resulting in tolerance and physical dependenceThats clinical but more anecdotal also involves reasons for different individuals wanting to be in a different state of mind  Some people cant face the day sober or will drink to be more social in situations where they usually arent  It all depends on the personMyself I cannot fathom people who dont drink or have never been drunk  ,0,cdpppmf,1rq3u3,AskReddit,new,2.0,2

Lisaland,I broke up with my boyfriend of nine months after his girlfriend informed me she had been with him the last three years and they were still together  Swore to me he wouldnt see her  Showed up unannounced and she was there on the couch next to him  Broke up again  Refused to talk to him  Over the course of the next six weeks he broke into my house poured water down the back of my  plasma tv stole items of emotional value stalked me keyed my car that I had bought six months ago and reported to my boss I was selling drugs out of her office  Not true Endless texts and phone messages at all hours  Finally got a Stalking Protective Order when he left a voicemail message that said Im going to kill you bitch He spent  days in jail and got out after pleading to a class A Felony   No previous felonies or jail timeLeft me alone for four months  Then texts and messages started arriving from unknown and blocked numbers  Begging me to meet him so he could say he was sorry and return my stuff  Three weeks of this  In retrospect I should have reported him for violating SPO which carries a mandatory minimum  But I didnt  Foolishly enough I met him with the hope of getting my stuff back and that he would then leave me aloneEnded up dating him again for about three weeks then realized he was still the same pathetic loser I could never be happy with  When he showed up to take me out last Saturday night as prearranged I just couldnt do it  I just didnt want to be with him  Not even for dancing and drinking  He hung out two hours hours while I did other stuff and finally said he was going hone he was tired  Great  Finally  I then left for some pool at my favorite barRan into what I thought was his ex  Nope  We started talking and sharing texts and pics only to discover he had never broken up with her  He literally was either with her or me leaving my house for hers and vice versa  While chatting she receives a text from him inviting her over for movies  I said of course he did I cancelled on him  We decide to set him up  She replies shell be right there  Then I text him saying I changed my mind and decided to come over  He then texts her and says something came up gotta cancelWe arrive at his home arm in arm a united front both deciding neither of us want to be with the lying cheating idiot  We also commit to supporting each other as friends  While all three of us are standing there and she is civilly laying it out I start looking around and thinking about all he hurt Ive allowed him to cause me and I started loosing it  I did something Ive never done before  In an act of pure freedom hurt anger and self loathing I threw my arm out in a wide sweep taking out a lamp tv and Bose speaker system that all crashed to he ground complete with the sound of breaking glass  He threw me on the ground  He pinned me  We exchanged punches  He is screaming at his adult niece who lives with me to call he cops  His ex and niece are screaming back that if she does he will go to jail because of the SPO   They repeatedly order him to let me go I manage a few feet every so often towards the front door until he rep ins me  Finally I break free and we are out of thereSo me and his other girlfriend go to my place and stay up talking until  am  Real life plot twist  shes been MARRIED for the last ten yearsSunday afternoon the sheriffs office calls  Apparently he demanded we both be arrested and jailed for assault burglary and that I pay restitution  We talked a very long time and he also called the other chic he was seeing that I was withMonday morning he was arrested on SPO violation and he remains in jail  The cop I spoke to sounded more than amused when I shared my part of the event and assured me none of the females involved were going to jailI am  in fact all three of us are  I own my own home and have worked in the lea gal field for over  years  Im a Notary Public for Gods sakesThis was my first relationship in  years  Being single the rest of my life doesnt sound so bad ,0,cdpro9h,1rq43j,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

ThatsSoDorian,I was a cook at a Sonic DriveIn in small town Iowa I mean I hated it but there were also some fun stories that I took away from it  There was a guyLukewho was a redneck slacker Youd ask him to do something he would make you explain it six times until you get up and did it yourself then later brag about how he got out of work I hated working with him and so did everyone else Fall rolls around and school was starting again We were open until  Despite being  at the time I was closing  or  nights a week I liked the money but pulling  hour weeks while in high school and living at home is a tad extreme What made it infuriating to me was that they never announced the closers Managers just told cooks to go home at random intervals until there were two left It was like a gameshow from hell But somehow it was always me and Luke and Luke always got out of it saying he had a big test tomorrow or hed close next time It was bullshit that I had to close until midnight four days a week because he had other things to do One night the manager told him at the start of the shift Luke youre closing tonight Thatssodorian has closed for the last three His response I cant My mom wont let me close Spat ensues with the manager and she lets him go around  under the stipulation that his mother calls and explains to her why her son cant close Once he leaves about  minutes goes by and the phone rings Manager answers a few uhhuhs later the conversation ends That was Lukes mom pause There was no way that girl was over  So she got out Lukes application and called his home number to speak to his real mom She made no such rule In fact he doesnt come home until  am claiming that he was closing every night So yeah I closed that night for the th time in a row but I closed with a plainly visible justice boner  I had a coworker quit by changing his voicemail to Fuck you I quit and not coming into work One of the cooks well call him Jeff was a selfdescribed fuck up Military background but left after a tour I thinkhe was vague on the details currently working as a cook dreamed of opening a car stereo shop in my town Nice guy if a little coarse When I worked with him hed always say things like Yeah Im good at this because Ive been doing it so long I dont like it but Im okay with it Every now and again we hire kids and theyre really fucking smart you know If I can scare one of those smart kids to doing something better with their life like my life as an example like you dont want to end up like me man Like thatssodorian youre pretty fuckin smart you know Theres nothing glamorous or rewarding about this job and you gotta go do something better when you grow upThis story has a little less of a plot I guess I just still remember Jeff and his Dont fuck up your life like I did speeches I dont know if he ever opened a shop I occasionally Google his name and find nothing I doubt hed even remember me But as a  year old kid in Iowa I remember him pretty vividly It wasnt a glamorous job at all I worked shit hours and got paid hour but I had some laughs some fights and eventually ragequit for a better job that didnt involve fry oil,7,cdps5vg,1rq58k,AskReddit,new,25.0,18

Hded,I was on a holiday with my best mate We couldnt get anyone else to come along so it was pretty gay We were on an island full of couples and newlyweds and their families etc No single women around for miles Two blokes drinking sex on the beachs and swimming and hiking and playing mini golf  facebook was fairly new to most of us and my friend happened to have a lot of family as his friends I posted some pretty light status update as him saying Im glad I came here to come out no need to hide it anymore free at last and left it at that He comes back from getting more drinks and we play some pool and hang out Head back to the hotel room to watch a movie or drink and smoke more or listen to music a few hours passThen his mum calls him and asks him if hes gay With me Hell never live that down His mum wasnt on Facebook his sister had seen it called his mum she freaked out and called him Absolute gold The look on his face when she asked and then he turned to me and I just about shat my pants ,0,cdpq1oa,1rq5o0,AskReddit,new,1.0,1
swampcracker,An obnoxious neighbor bought a very nice new truck and insisted on bragging about it on every possible occasion  Over the course of several months I would squirt a moderate amount of transmission fluid under the truck at night I did this  times a week  He took it to the dealership and several other shops but of course they could find nothing wrong  I guess the dealership told him there was nothing they could do since nothing appeared to be wrong  He eventually got so frustrated that he traded it for something else  It was exceptionally hard not to laugh when he told me how much money he lost in the deal,0,cdpq9ny,1rq5o0,AskReddit,new,1.0,1
aughtomat,A friend in college was a pharmacy major While learning how to make compounds and capsules hed often bring materials back to the dorm with him Once he showed me a powdered dye chemists use to mark specimens on a slide When mixed with water it looked an awful lot like blood It got me to thinkingI asked him to fill the largest gelatin capsule he could find with the stuff Sensing we were on the verge of prank greatness he readily agreed Next day he produced the goods I explain that were going to embed the capsule in one of dorm shower heads specifically the shower in the corner with the best pressure  the one everyone used if it was available Why Because one of our pals was in the habit of hitting the gym every night and would always be alone in the shower by himself when he returned So after his workout this guy toddles off in his flipflops with his shower caddy The rest of us gather in the hallway waiting to see how itll all unfold We hear him turn the shower on but it sounds strange and sputtering I bet hes looking right at the shower head I exclaim There was a rush of water as the capsule broke followed by terrified screams and the laughter that comes with a good prank He came out covered in dye As though hed stood beneath an animal being slaughtered He laughed it off but then got serious You guys I think we have a problem thoughWe all went into the shower room and found that the capsule had exploded magnificently It wast localized to the corner there was fake blood everywhere Like something out of Natural Born Killers We decided to speak no more of it The custodial staff hated our floor ,0,cdprdee,1rq5o0,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

lumpypotato,My SO is Christian I was raised a Hindu but tend to be less religiousspiritual about itIt can be tough when our beliefs clash but the most important thing is to be mutually supportive  my SO understands that I have my beliefs and respects them I do the same for my SO  this is important in a relationship with differing religious beliefs or lack thereofThis is a struggle for some people because their interpretation of religion is such where they might feel that their spousepartners lack or differences in religious belief might actually be a burden on their own relationship with GodReligion  this is kind of a dangerous thing because it can sometimes become my spousepartner is coming between me and GodYou need to have a long talk and really discuss what is important  make it clear you respect her beliefs I assume you do but you want to be able to believe what you feel is right Remind her that we all have to walk our own paths and that you feel I assume that as long as you live a good and moral life you are doing the right thing overallThere will be many conversations to be had if you are serious about your GF  how to raise kids dealing with church etc I know at least a few couples other than my SO and I who are different in terms of religious upbringing and it can work  but both sides need to be open to compromise Ive seen a Christian participating in a Hindu wedding and a Hindu participating in a Christian wedding  it can be done but it really depends on how that other person perceives thingsThis shouldnt be a fight to convince her that you are right or wrong  just a conversation on how to find a middle ground where you can both live your lives according to your own moral grounds without too much conflict people are different conflict is inevitable good relationships are based on finding mutually beneficial solutions to them,0,cdpq25h,1rq5sg,AskReddit,new,4.0,4

blueit,This is tough I think this is serious deal breaker territory for many people Sounds like she wishes you shared her beliefs and I think thats a warning sign frankly I mean if its a focul point in her life for instance if she likes to be surrounded by religion the church shes in etc it may be hard to share a life if you arent a part of that I think when kids enter the equation its a big challenge as well I am in the same boat I am a non believer and my gf and her family are religious It works because she doesnt push any of it on me and frankly I dont have a problem with religion as long is it doesnt hurt anyone or its forced on me I asked her in the beginning how important it was and she said it wasnt important I be religious if I respected she had these beliefs  years later its not been an issue at all I respect when her family says grace at dinners or if she says something religious I dont tease her So I think well work I think you just need to have this talk Be honest with each other and very realistic about what you expect becasue Ive all seen this break up relationships People often make the mistake of trying to change each other in relationships The only concession ive made is now dropping JCs around the house being the son of a French Canadian mother JCs is not a big deal so ive respected that  ,0,cdprx5p,1rq5sg,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

Pleecu,Anyone with natural dreads that has even a bit of self respect washes them with soap and water just like everyone else We dont roll around in mud or  put weird shit on our head so its just hair most people dont anyway Since its essentially long tangled mats of hair you run soapy water through them and squeeze them out and they rinse clean like once a week or so I dont understand why everyone assumes theyre dirty some are but like i said any self respecting person with dreads takes care of them even going through great lengths to do so special oils shampoos and other junkOn the flip side some people who are impatient or ignorant to natural dreads will put dread wax in their hair to achieve the look with uniformity in size and shape this method is fast and somewhat reversible but the wax will cause the dreads to pick up dirt and other gross stuff over time and holds water causing mildew If you see gross looking dreads theyre probably these type which do not clean easily and in fact attract grossnesstldr Natural dreads can be washed weekly quite easily and are usually clean Waxed dreads cheater dreads on the other hand dont clean easily and attract dust and dirt and other crud They also need a TON of maintainence,1,cdpw2me,1rq5v3,AskReddit,new,4.0,3

LizardRock,Someone else just asked this Here is what I saidThese kind of questions are frowned upon by developers It take a lot of practice learning and effort to be a programmer even more to develop games or appsHere is what I recommend if your in college take a programming logic class if youre still up for it take an objectiveC class the code language iOS is developed inI know Stanford has a free class on developing for iOS  but without those other classes you wont be able to keep upAlso get a Mac the native sdk is only compatible with themTo publish the apps you need an apple dev certificate you can learn that laterGood luck,0,cdpq2ts,1rq69i,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

lumpypotato,Youll probably have to spend some time relearning the basics of programming iOS might be easier if you are coming from a C background Android has Java and might be cheaper if you cant afford the apple hardware On the other hand Android has more issues with device compatibility so if you plan on being a legi longterm dev prepare ot have a drawer full of android gadgets Youll have a drawer full of iOS gadgets as well but you will probably be able to get more Android ones for the same price as a few Apple onesI went into mobile programming with limited knowledge and learned enough to get through the basics Doing something more complicated like involving graphics or something like that will be more time consuming  but if you have evenings to spare and are willing to put a serious effort into it theres no reason you cant  but it will be difficult because any project where you want the end product to be quality should be difficult,0,cdpq56u,1rq69i,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

awilditguy,Because it brings out the absolute worst in people Personally and this is just me but the entire winter holiday thing is supposed to be about togetherness appreciating what you have and helping others The only of those three main tenets that is touched upon in this Black Friday garbage is togetherness and even then only in the sense of TOGETHER WE CAN DEMOLISH THIS BARRICADE AND GET TO THE TASTY DEALS WITHIN And you better believe that as soon as that barricade raises or comes down all semblance of cohesion is lost as everyone starts running around grabbing shoving and fighting like fucking retards What it comes down to is that this behavior speaks ill of Americans as a whole A casual observer may believe that we are incapable of acting in a manner resembling civility Having worked in  different types of store over the course of  holiday seasons I am inclined to agree You always roll the dice with customer interaction it comes with the territory But in my experience Black Friday dice are weighted to roll snake eyes The ability to get a TV at half price or what have you seems to bring out the worst in people Not just in their wanton destruction of whatever retail environment they may currently inhabit but their treatment of other people as well Id never heard someone actually call a person a cunt with intent to insult until Black Friday Granted I swear like a sailor and jokingly throw that word around like its and but here you will find that it is the baddest of words for some reason I have seen groups of people break out swinging when told we are out of stock on a high demand item Stealing shit out of other peoples carts No civilized person should be acting this wayGranted not everyone acts this way even among those who are habitual Black Friday shoppers I met quite a lot who were just out didnt like the packed stores or long lines but couldnt afford high price gifts if they didnt get them at a Black Friday sale and really wanted to get them These folks were more often than not courteous and understanding and the ones that werent didnt force it too terribly These folks are exempt from my rant They may go and do whatever they must today with no ill will from me Theres a lot more to my hatred of Black Friday than listed above but those are the main points Its not all bad as an idea butTLDR it attracts all the wrong kinds of people and causes them to behave in a way that I find fucking reprehensible ,0,cdpshrq,1rq6vq,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

Jabbawookiee,I was in sixth or seventh grade  I and another friend went over to a friends house for a sleepover  I had never stayed over the other friend hadAnyhow we had dinner kinda early pm and planned to walk to the video store after  That didnt happenDuring dinner the friend whose house it was accused his father of being an alcoholic which was true  Further the friend chose this night to tell his parents that he was leaving to find his biological parents he was adopted  The father turned to us rather calmly and told us to call our parents to be picked up  I think we raced to the phone to get out of thereOf course this was sixth or seventh grade  In retrospect I think my and my friends presence made our friend braver but damn that was awkward,0,cdpr1mf,1rq8q6,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

Xealaz,Everything starts falling into everything else The moon into the Earth the planets into the Sun the Sun and other stars into the galactic core  on and on until all matter is condensed into a single black holeIf however we assume they are frozen in place things become a bit more interesting On earth the fact that one side of the planet is now always facing the sun will result in the day side becoming warmer and warmer and the night side becoming colder and colder Life on Earth would eventually have to cluster around the daynight terminator Weather would become increasingly more erratic as dayside oceans boil cool and get carried over to the night side creating huge winds and storms The moon constantly tugging the tides in one direction would probably have some strange effects tooAnd thats about all my limited science knowledge can guess at,1,cdpqz4p,1rq8xf,AskReddit,new,2.0,1

rhythmforest,I believe quite a bit of it has to do with egoThey want to soften the situation or avoid the discomfort because its not just an uncomfortable situation  its also a miniature pandoras box of selfdoubt and questioning for some people If someone knows and has to own up to being responsible for something negative they may have to face the fact that they dont always have all of the answers They may smart to question whether or not they are smart brave responsible etcIts natural to want to protect your selfesteemAs for facing a situation  again discomfort We are creatures of comfort and habit We enjoy happiness and positive sensations Just as the majority of people have an aversion to physical pain and will go great lengths to avoid it some people have aversions to social pain and avoid situations that they may see as potentially painful Situations involving rejection andor the questioning of their abilities decisions etc and therefore who they are as a personOf course often if people would just face the situation or answer the question concisely they would probably suffer less but they dont consider the consequences in the future With the people who do it to me Ive noticed its somewhat of a kneejerk reaction for them as a means to try and avoid what they dont realize is ultimately inevitable ,0,cdps3td,1rq9ck,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

Amadeus,To preempt some criticism which I welcome my goal is to foster discussion I will state that I am American and have been since birth and my family has a long history in the US  This discussion was prompted by discussions last night with my family  My discussion here will focus on the US however but I am sure people from other countries will agree that things are similar in their own countries  I encourage people to add to what I have or rebut my points  After all I can be wrong too but please keep it civil  You can still disagree without being profane or attacking me personally The things that I think need improvement in the USA culture of consumerism  one of the huge reasons why businesses have grown so large and influential is that we have let them do so  One example is the existence of Black Friday and its encroachment into Thanksgiving  Every year people rush to stores to save a few hundred dollars on Christmas gifts I find the idea of fighting someone for the barebones model of a plasma TV and waiting in line for an hour to buy it to be asinine  No one needs something that badly and all the deaths and serious injuries each year are senseless  I feel sorry for the unfortunate souls that have to work these stores over night and deal with insane customers the next day instead of enjoying the company of their families for ThanksgivingFailure to perform ones civic duty  the social contract that all Americans have with their government is that the power of the government is derived from them not the other way around  A government that does not serve its people is not a legitimate government  Many Americans fail to stay informed about what is going on  I am not saying that you need to follow all the happenings of the world but you should know what your local and state governments are doing in a general sense  Also investigating candidates before voting for them and not just voting along party lines is also your dutyLack of accountability and oversight of government  do you know who your state and federal representatives are in your states legislature and in Congress  Do you know what this person doesdid before becoming a politician  Probably not  A majority of politician are probably good in that that they arent embezzling or conveniently awarding contracts to a relatives company or their own but this happens sometimes  A politician can construct the law so that they andor their family comes out on top  Its hard to do anything after the fact because its legal  The recent fiasco of the healthcare law should be lesson that someone needs to be watching and guiding this processLobbying  this the most deleterious and the result of the previous three points  They are inherently selfinterested  Groups like the NRA AARP Cassidy and Associates and many other have undue influence over governmental affairs  Lobbying has its place but its power has grown unchecked and much of what goes on is obscured so that the laity cannot understand what is going on  People should be allowed to form groups to request their representatives help with an issue but the representative should not be pressured because those groups might not support them in the next election or actively undermine them laterElectionsgerrymandering  in this technologically advanced country elections should all be by popular vote the Electoral College is archaic and is no longer needed  In this way the person who is truly favored by the people is the one in office and not the one whos good a playing the system  The same is true for gerrymandering carving out safe districts so that the same people continually get elected leads to stagnation in the government  Campaign finance needs to be reformed  There is no need to spend tens of millions of dollars on a campaign election campaigns should be funded from taxes and private donations should be banned  The defense that contributing to elections is freedom of speech is weak your First Amendment rights end where someone elses begins and downing out other voices because you can write a bigger check is not respecting others rightsBlindly following  just because your pastor parent church political party news channel or other authority says something does not make it true  You must think for yourself and not let others tell you how to vote  It is your right and no one elses any arguments to the contrary are inherently false  I have had friends in college tell me she votes in line with her parents because they support her financially and her father knows which candidate is best so that he wont hurt financially  This again shows lack of civic duty on her part she should investigate for herself  In the end she may decide to vote the same way her parents do but at least she decided to do it  Another good example is the war in Iraq  At its beginning if you did not support the war you were viewed as unAmerican  The Dixie Chicks are a good illustration of how an essentially brainwashed fan base ended their music career granted the girls should have known but still  I doubt many of the people that hated them knew anything about what was going on in Iraq and to this day still probably dont understand what went onLack of foresight  years of borrowing has left the federal government in disarray and threatens to destabilize the economy  Never should the government been allowed to borrow so much money  Government services should be paid for through taxes if you dont want more taxes then you get fewer services  Borrowing money to pay for these is poor financial planning on the part of politicians they should not be advocating for plans that they then dont want to fund by increasing taxes  As a nation we must choose lots of services and higher taxes or fewer services and lower taxes the balance must be foundBeing distracted by hot button issues  gay marriage abortion entitlement programs and others are all important topics that need to be settled but for any of them to be the constant focus of discussion or a deciding factor in who you vote for is foolish  The gays arent going to destroy America by getting marriedPolicing the world  it is not the job of the US to fix every problem in the world and we should stop trying to because it is bankrupting the nation  That is not to say that I dont care about the people of Syria Libya Haiti or whatever other country seems to be on the brink of collapse but we should be encouraging the UN and other nations to facilitate thisArmtwisting  no other country exerts as must influence unilaterally as the US  Economics is how the US manipulates weaker countries into forming partnerships that are mostly in favor of US business  Also subversive actions by American intelligence has played a large part  Go to Wikipedia and look at the numerous things that the CIA has done in Latin America  The people of these countries know this and American armtwisting is a major reason for a lot of disdain

Enderdejorand,Ive always felt lucky that when I was little I came to live with my dadMy mom didnt have a lot of money is pretty much an alcoholic and has been involved with drugs on and off throughout her life Around my third birthday her sister came down with cancer and she went to Florida to take care of her during her final days My dad didnt believe her sister was sick and he refused to let her take me He assumed that if she left with me hed never see his son again so he immediately went to the courts to petition for custody My dads a lot more stable than my mom Hes always had a job while I was growing up and is relatively well off moneywise Hes always been really willing to help people with his money if he can For example when my halfsiblings from my moms first marriage went to college he helped pay a decent amount of their education costs Hes also helped keep my mom afloat so she can have an apartment But hes never really let me feel like I didnt have to work to get a benefit For instance in high school I wanted to take art classes on the weekends to get formal training on top of my school work For me it was a pretty big cost almost  for a semester of weekend classes I had to work really hard on my studies to justify that type of expense and eventually my dad paid for it I always felt a little guilty that he would splurge on me like that But years later he told me he would have always paid for those classes because he thought I had talent and he wanted me to embrace my talents sort of a donthideyourtalentsunderabasket thingI believe Ive done relatively well for myself but Im always very aware that I could have been raised in a completely different situation People often talk about the privilege that comes from growing up with money and I know that if I had grown up with my mom I wouldnt have had the same opportunities For me college was expected for my halfsiblings college was necessary Thats one big difference among many others that let me know that I was really lucky to grow up the way I did Dont get me wrong My halfsiblings are very successful married and have their own families now They have wonderful lives and it worked out for them But in my mind it worked out inspite their circumstances not because of themTLDR Dad had money mom didnt Lucky to have the resources,0,cdps3ar,1rqcfh,AskReddit,new,2.0,2

Puffsdangerfield,The whole idea of Black Friday is now a farce Rarely does anyone save any real money There is quite a few reasons why If you have camped out for longer than  hours You have probably spent more money in preparation and expenses than you would have saved in the difference between actual and markdown price  Quite a number of items sold on Black Friday are cheap versions Some TVs will be made in a cheaper version just for this special purpose  If you took any amount of time off to shop on Black Friday you have lost pay If you used paid vacation or paid leave you have still lost since that is time you earn  All items sold on Black Friday will be sold at a much smaller price in the off season Look at the cost of shorts in the fall and coats in the spring You also have deals like this for electronics in low buying seasons or when the newest models of anything are about to be rolled out And everyone knows if it is a gaming console you are gambling on the quality of product for the first few months of its roll out Look up the problems with both the XBox One and PS  Same thing as the Windows hype back in the s If you spent money on any object you didnt save anything A TV marked down from  to  didnt save you  dollars you spent  dollars There is also other things like the mob mentality that takes over People are scary in that mode and I avoid it like the plague Besides most of that crap is not needed especially as far as gifts go Its great if you have the money but most dont who the hell needs a waffle maker for Christmas that bad Most of the time it will get used once or twice and then chucked in that place where kitchen gadgets go to die Not worth it ,2,cdpt3b2,1rqchn,AskReddit,new,14.0,12

LifeGoesOnDude,My first ever throwaway account Never told this to anyone including my Dad and brotherTwelve days after I graduated from college I was taking a shower in my childhood home When I shut off the water I could hear my Moms voice on the other side of the wall speaking softly on the phone Instantly  sure she was cheating on my Dad hard to explain how Shed been acting more distant and dressing better latelyNext day asshole me went through her texts on her phone Saw a guys name a couple times but nothing definitive Up to  or so Two days later went through her email in the middle of the night which she always left open on our familys shared computer The sure moment is the one that sticks I cried drank myself into a stupor confronted her then next morning My Dad and brother are oblivious types but wanting to possibly save them from the pain I was in I coached her how to cover her tracks better for a few weeks Still caught her and scolded her multiple timesShe faked her way through marriage counseling until the inevitable divorce a year or so later twoish years ago She was definitely the favorite parent so life sucked for awhile Getting back to normalish now she moved to a more tropical locale with her new boyfriend visited for the first time last week Life goes onEDIT TLDR Caught Mom helped her cover her tracks in hopes of an amicable divorce,0,cdps93j,1rqcqs,AskReddit,new,5.0,5

AllButOne,Growing up my mother was never an affectionate parent In fact she was the opposite She only ever paid attention to my sister and I when we had done something wrong and then she would punish us severely A lot of the time our punishments bordered on abuse she used to physically abuse my older half sister but my father would not allow her to touch his own children like that Needless to say I was not a mamas girl and I think I hated her long before the proverbial shit hit the metaphorical fan  Both of my parents were pretty technologically inept but we had a desktop PC in the house that was for me to play games and do homework etc The summer before my senior year of high school I notice that my mother is spending a lot of time on the computer a lot more than normal I chalked it up to her trying to start her own Ebay store she did a lot of arts and crafts type things It started off being a couple hours a day mostly editing her store and adding new inventory Eventually it escalated to her being on the computer before I woke up in the morning still being on when I got home from school and she would still be sitting there when I would go to bed It got to the point where I had to actually fight her to gain access to the computer for homework She went from barely knowing how to work the damn thing to being on there  or  hours at a time I knew something was upTo make things worse more packages were coming into the house than leaving the house Every day she would come home from the post office with three or four packages from various online stores Victoria Secret being the most prevalent If you went into my parents bedroom there would be stacks actual piles of packages that werent even open They were coming in so fast that she didnt even bother opening them all at the time She just threw them on her dresser and went through them when she had the time On top of that she gave herself a mini makeover started getting her nails done once a week and being overly distant towards her family She completely abandoned her responsibilities as a stayathome mom and my father and sister and I often had to fend for ourselves The house fell into disarray there was never any food in the house and there was just packages all over the place always for her My father is a complacent man didnt mention anything to her that I know of and this continued for a couple monthsNow coming from a singleincome household I knew all this shit she was buying couldnt be good for our financial situation The nail in the coffin was when she purchased a brand new laptop for herself and not for her daughter who was going away to college in less than a year She used her newlypurchased mobility to lock herself away in my parents bedroom for hours at a time chain smoke and generally ignore her family  One night I logged on to her gmail account she had the password saved on the family computer and I found HOURS AND HOURS of emails between her and this guy I went all the way back to the beginning of these conversations to see that it all started out friendly enough Asking about theirs lives and so forth my mother being the sociopath she is created this ideal life when really we lived in a pretty shitty area She talked to him my sister and I which infuriated me I guess he was some sort of computerwhiz and was helping her format her Ebay store which is how they started talking  Things did not stay platonic for long He eventually started asking about her relationship with my father and she told him this horrible sob story about how she was an ignored housewife who never left the house by her own choice how my father wouldnt let her get a job which was a lie it probably would have helped how her children didnt appreciate her why would we she was a lazy slob etc Im sure you can imagine where things went from there It started off with some pretty soft corn cybering and escalated quickly to naughty pictures that would be wear all the Victoria Secret packages came in I was appalled I was infuriated Whitehot RAGE seeped through my veins and I wanted nothing more than to watch my mother get hit by a train A train with lots of spikes and barbed wirethat was on fire I hated herI waited a couple weeks checking every now and again to see if maybe it would stop It didnt Finally things came to a head when he started talking about flying up to NY he was from VA on a business trip and that he booked a hotel in our town and he wanted to spend the weekend with her AND SHE AGREED TO I printed out the message and left a note in my dads wallet that we needed to talk and to not tell momWe get in the car to take me to my senior year orientation and he asks me whats up I show him the messages and start bawling my eyes out I dont know what to do or say He just kind of looks at the messages and starts the car and drives me to school He just keeps saying Things are going to be okay Theyre going to be fine I guess he told her the following night the night before my first day of my senior year She was so furious with me for blowing her cover she wouldnt even look or talk to me The following week I hear my mom telling my sister that shes going on a trip with her friend for the weekend but that shell be back on Monday when she gets home from school I run out the door and wait for the bus in the pouring rain instead of letting my mom drive me She pulls up next to me and I tell her to fuck off My dad slept on the couch for a couple months they were obviously separated My mom became more brazen with her affair obviously not giving a single fuck about the feelings of her family the selfish bitch She would parade around the house while talking to him on the phone she locked herself away in her room most of the time and she would go away on trips with her friend often This continued until about February and my parents were passive aggressively at each others throats for months When she finally moved out it was because this scumbag actually abandoned HIS family to move to NY He was renting an apartment in a town about  minutes from us and she was moving in with him She told my sister that she would come see her on the weekends and that when they got settled they would buy a house in our town and she would live with her my parents arent married and my dad doesnt have as many parental rights so my sister didnt have a choice As she finished her packing she walked up to me and said I know you dont approve You can come visit anytime I completely ignored her and she walked out of the house My dad continued to sleep on the couch My poor father my heart breaks when I think about what this did to him He lost weight he became sickly and depressed He tried so so hard to be strong for us to be stoic and supportive but I knew better One day we were driving somewhere and he just cracked He was down at ground zero on  and he had to hide under a firetruck to avoid the debris He pulled over and started crying and said I wish it would have killed me I wish it just would have fucking killed me I didnt even know what to do how to help him I just held him as he cried like a child I didnt see my mother again until she showed up at my high school graduation I rocked my senior year and got a bunch of awards In the middle of the ceremony all the seniors got four flowers to give to their family members I gave one to my father one to my sister one to my older halfbrother and one to my boyfriends mother who was my maternal figure for almost  years at that point I watched as my mother shoved my younger sister at my father and stormed out That was in  I have since graduated from college moved into my own place started a job and I am seriously considering graduate school within the next couple years Coming from a pretty shaky educational background I have come very far and I feel that I have tried to make the best of the situation My father has gotten remarried to the mother of some of my halfsiblings and she is a completely wonderful woman He is STILL paying off the credit card bills she racked up with her impulse buys and weve been struggling for a couple years but were getting byMy mother My younger sister is  now and still lives with her It sounds like shes doing pretty shitty both healthwise and in her relationship with her nowhusband who looks like a sickly skinny Harleyriding Santa Claus I havent spoken to her in years and have no plans to rekindle our relationship  TLDR My cheating whore mother racked up massive credit card debt and then abandoned her family to marry

seattlestranger,Ill probably get downvoted to hell for saying this but for a few years I would cut the UK foreign aid budgetwe are facing massive spending cuts within the country affecting a lot of people pushing more into needing foid bank and charity aud but they give billions away each year I know when in a position to do so it is good to help people in need I have regular donations set up to  charities but when there are so many people within the country struggling why not be a little selfish and fix our own economy then once it is back on its feet we can put a more concerted effort into helping others After all if you personally are in massive debt but continue to give massive amounts to charity I dont think the bank will be very understandingAlso make checks more thorough on people claiming benefits some people admit they choose to live on benefits as a life choice and many of them are better off than people who work minimum wage jobs Perhaps use a voucher system instead of cash so foid vouchers could only be used for food not going out and getting pissed At one point I had to claim benefits for  months most depressing and shameful time I hated doing it but had no other choice and worked hard to find a jobI would also like to leave the EU not strictly budget related but a large amount of money is sent there so I guess it countsI am in no way an economics type person but a normal person an economist would probably dispute the EU part because of trade agreements or something I dont understand,0,cdpsm4k,1rqdtf,AskReddit,new,2.0,2

chrisgond,Prior to choosing the MD route I had declared as a Computer ScienceEngineering major  But in my Freshman year my Grandpa died of cancer and that had a profound effect on my career choice  My family cared for him until the final days where he needed a skilled facility  During that time I took more of an interest in medicine in general and specifically elder careWith that in mind I switched to a BS in Chemistry and a premed path  I never loved Chemistry like I did computer programming but I stuck with it with my eyes on the MCAT and med school  I volunteered at hospitals and worked the night shift at a nursing home to become immersed in the culture so to speakA potential red flag that I missed happened during my time as a CNA  I despised it  At the time I told myself that it was just the gritty truth of nursing home care especially during the night shift but with  hindsight I just hated the work  I soldiered through it graduated and was accepted into three different schools  Score  Hard parts over right  WrongI was always near the top of my class academically but in med school the competition and material became much more intense  I mean several orders of magnitude of intensity  I struggled and it wasnt for lack of studying  The sheer quantity of material and the pacing blew me away  None of it individually was very difficult but the collective amount of material and the frequency of weeklong testing marathons kicked my assIf I had been truly captivated by medicine I think I could have made it but the subject matter turned out to be not all that interesting to me  I grew to hate it and in the middle of Year  after failing a biochem test that I had busted ass for I was despondentI wasnt failing school mind you  I maintained a C average and there were aspects of it I excelled at  particularly Anatomy but I got to thinking about being average at a career I wasnt thrilled with  I got to thinking about being an average doctor and what that meant  Would a patient want an average or slightly belowaverage doctor  My classmates were all about P  MD In other words pass and you get your degree  Another smaller factor in contributing to my decision to leave was the MD lifestyle  high divorce rates high rate of depression brutal hours and high liability insurance  Wait you thought MDs were all rich  Yeah not so much for a small town family practitioner After dropping out I immediately enrolled in a CompSci program   years later I had my degree and was writing code  But now I had a Chemistry degree and lots of medical terminologyconcepts to boost my credentials and I was offered a job from a medical device manufacturer who wanted to send me to grad school  The  in debt was a bitch but it was just money and we chipped away at itI am infinitely happier nowTLDRI could not deal with the thought of being a belowaverage anything especially a doctor with patients lives hanging in the balance  Ultimately that thought and encouragement from my wife brought me to my senses and I dropped out,0,cdpstsc,1rqekv,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

TheLevitatingBaby,I am about a  minute drive from Miami so I live in the suburbs Florida is a pretty nice place Its always hot and really moist here During the summer its really hot and rains a lot Lots of beaches to go if youre a beach person Florida is great in that aspect I dont think there is anything notable about our food except the sea food is pretty good depending on what fish you getThe winter is great cause the tempature ranges from  for the most part although you most days it should be in the upper s Because of this you will only really need to get one set of clothes besides a jacket and jeans here and there No winter clothes required which is a beautiful thing Its very diverse in Florida especially near Miami Lots of hispanics there As for Miami its really not all that special I think Some places its beautiful some its nasty like all big cities Otherwise it is also really exotic from other cities as it barely represents anything American like somewhere like Boston would The housing down here is also definitely more expensive than a place like Georgia or the Carolinas The reason they are more expensive is due to the fact that we get lots of hurrincanes so the houses are all much stronger and most include things like shutters All in all I like Florida its a fun state I dont have a problem living here,0,cdpsooh,1rqfe5,AskReddit,new,2.0,2

emberspark,For me it was the Thor films and I suppose Avengers I think Loki is a fascinating character and I think he plays on a lot of peoples insecurities He essentially turns into a villain because he finds out that not only was he adopted but stolen from Odins enemies in an effort to one day unite the two opposing groups He finds himself without a true family without a path to the throne that he so desperately wanted and saddled with the knowledge that he only had the family he did because of the possibility that he might be of use to them politically in the future I think theres a lot to his character that people can relate to  feeling out of place having something taken away that you feel you deserve feeling the weight of expectations on you at all times and especially living in the shadow of your siblings triumphs Hes a very relatable character on a lot of levels I think because the things that really push him into being a villain are very human and widespreadLots of villains are like this but Thor is just the last movie I saw so its the first thing that came to mind,0,cdpsyfg,1rqfxd,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

DRDeMello,King Philips WarPeople are generally familiar with the meeting of the Wampanoag nation and the separatist  Pilgrims from England that culminated with the first Thanksgiving in A half century later in  after Plymouth Colony had grown exponentially and southern New England had seem the formation and growth of Massachusetts Bay Colony Connecticut Colony and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantation the Wampanoag went to war against Plymouth  This turned into an allout war of cultures with the European colonies all siding together notable because everyone outside of Rhode Island hated Roger Williams and most of the tribes of the region fighting together the Wampanoag and their traditional enemies the Narragansett along with the Nipmuc and Nauset tribes  Interestingly several Praying Indians gave their loyalty to the colonies and played pivotal roles over the course of the war  Also the Mohegan tribe aligned itself with the United Colonies PC MBC CT and Rhode IslandThe events of the war were incredible  The fighting was done in raids rather than battles the colonists got whipped in the beginning the tide turned in the winter with a massive preemptive strike against the Narragansett who had been neutral but were not trusted there was an attempted alliance with the Mohawk of the Iroquois nation that could have swung the balance of war Plymouth was attacked Providence was burned western Massachusetts was retaken until eventually the outnumbered and outsupplied native coalition ran out of steam  The war ended MetacomKing Philip returned from Iroquois territory to his home at Mount Hope in Pokanoket modern Bristol RI and was shot through the heart by the brother of one of his own men  Amazingly the remaining Wampanoag escaped the raid on Mount Hope by their octogenarian missinge war chief named Anawan  Anawan had known Metacoms father Ousamequin better known as Massasoit which was his title and would have presumably have been alive through the plagues of  the landing of the pilgrims the souring of the relationship between the two cultures and the war itself  Anawan was later captured out in a swamp with the last remaining warriors trying to take back their ancestral lands King PhilipMetacoms body was drawn and quartered and his body parts were hung from a tree  The Praying Indian who shot him got his hand and head as a souvenir he sold his head to Plymouth where it stayed on a pike for over  years untilthe legend goesa Wampanoag climbed up and took it back Anawan was promised safe passage by Benjamin Church the commander of the men he surrendered to but upon his return to Plymouth he was executedThe war was incredible for the historical impact it hadThe war devastated the nations that had inhabited this land  Their cultural influence in the region would not recover  The survivors of the war were either executed or killedNot having a written language much of the native history in the region is now lostand that which we have is filtered through the pen of a colonistIt essentially won southern New England for the European colonists who in a mere  years had arrived and taken complete control of the regionThe modern United States Army Rangers originated during this war  Church organized them amongst the United Colonies and they received training from natives friendly to the colonists  There is a direct lineage to the rangers Church organized to the modern rangersThe fighting was brutal  This was total war that surpassed even William Tecumseh Shermans march through the south  Every man woman and child was fair game and were frequently killed  Towns and cities were targeted fields were plundered and burned and livestock were stolen or slaughtered  It was a war of cultures not a war of armiesThe war galvanized the colonies and their citizens together in a way that was new and unique  Notably absent in the war were the Britishit was American colonists that fought and died togetherThe new spirit of togetherness and selfsufficiency combined with the guerrilla tactics learned through this experience would be revived by the colonists in another major conflict that originated in MassachusettsIn terms of casualties there are some experts who rank this war as the bloodiest that we know of to ever be fought in North America  That is to say as a percentage of population this war possibly killed a bigger portion of the two sides fighting than any other conflictFor such an important and dramatic event Im really surprised nobody has taken on the war in a major audiovisual production  The biggest restraint would be timeto tell the scope of the war the causes the fighting the political ties the long weary terrifying year that it was for both sides the effects etc in a typical two hour film format would be nearly impossible  My own opinion is that youd have to go for a trilogy format which would be an expensive gamble or go with a TV miniseries which until Game of Thrones changed things I wouldve said could never workThere are many moments in this conflict that would translate beautifully to the silver screen thoughThe prelude showing the treaty and Thanksgiving feast as the cultures met and bonded in The arrest and death of Massasoit Wamsutta at the hands of Plymouth didnt even touch on that this is getting long look it up one of the soldiers that arrest him Josiah Winslow later became governor of Plymouth during the warThe meeting at Mount Wachusett where the Wampanoag and Nipmuc decide to make war The violence and brutality of the raids and their emotional impactThe raid on the Narragansett winter fort in the Great Swamp FightThe plea of Metacom to their enemies of the Iroquois ConfederacyThe elderly Roger Williams who was a true friend and ally of the natives watching his city of Providence burn to the ground while the warriors around him spared his life  In a film hed catch glances with a warrior and share a knowing lookThe death of Metacom shot through the heart on Mount Hope by a Praying Indian  You cant make this upin Hollywood theyd call you a sap for overdoing it on the symbolism but this is exactly what happenedThe desecration of native bodies living and dead after the war  Surviving natives bound in chains Metacoms proud body being torn apart a heroic figure who deserved so much better  Then after the credits roll a silhouetted figure climbs the pole to take back Metacoms skull from the pike on which it has been stuckTLDR King Philips War was fascinating and gave New England to the colonists giving them a new American identity in the process whilst destroying the native culture  It would be a sick movie trilogy or epic TV miniseries,1,cdpv168,1rqg4n,AskReddit,new,15.0,14

theroundhead,I think I was in fifth grade at the time I remember having big debates during recess on whether Vader was lying or not to Luke Watching Empire years later its pretty obvious that Vader was telling the truth But at the time it was so unbelievable that we figured it just may be a Vader trick to get Luke to join the Dark Side,2011,cdpvt3h,1rqgfi,AskReddit,new,4576.0,2565
toxlab,My first real date was seeing EmpireI saw the original Star Wars as a kid at a drive in theater I sat on the roof of the car with a blanket and there was a meteor shower happening as the movie swung into gear To say this captured my imagination in a big bad way is an understatement Star Wars had my heart And nearly every cent of my whopping two dollar a week allowanceWhen they started promoting Empire I lost my shit I was going to the first show on opening day no question A girl who lived in my apartment complex seemed interested in going as well I knew nothing about girls and most of them seemed kinda prissy and not interested in cool stuff like Godzilla Star Wars and Marvel comics my holy trilogy This girl would play action figures with me and we would have wild adventures in the tall grass behind the building And she never argued with me about rule number one I am always Boba Fett So were cruising Darth and Boba around the parking lot drowning Chewie in a puddle and discussing what we thought was going to happen She seemed sad I asked her if she was going to see the movie She explained that she didnt have the money I thought maybe I could sweet talk my mom into giving me enough for her ticket and told her so We didnt have much but my mom was an easy touch and always went the extra mile to make us happy I told her to hold onto Chewie put Darth and Boba in my pocket and rocketed homeMy mother and her mother were sitting in the kitchen of our apartment drinking tea and chatting I ran over all vim and energy and explained in my breathless manner that the fate of not only our world but the entire galaxy depended on my friend joining me in a galaxy far far away Mom was sympathetic but unswayed I had already gotten an advance on my weekly allowance and she just couldnt afford to give me more My grandma was captivated Do you like this girl She asked Uh huh She can ride bikes real fast and she plays Star Wars with me and she will play Chewie even though nobody likes Chewie Shes radWell Grandma said You should ask her out on a date You can take her to the movies and then go out for dinner And if she likes you she might give you a kissMy mom objected Grandma was always like myself a creature of fancy She was an artist and a flutterbye settling on one new thing after another My mom had to be much more grounded in reality There was no way we could afford this date Grandma took this as a challenge She would pay drop us off at the theater pick us up afterwards and then take us to a pizza place and chaperone I thought this sounded awesome Grandma explained how to politely ask for a date and what a gentleman on a date did Hold doors defer to your dates choice of pizza topping make sure you brushed your teeth so you didnt have stinky breath etcMy heart was glad I could take my friend to what I was sure was going to be the best film ever made I couldnt find it in me to run and tell her because I had all this new information swimming around in my head I had to be a gentleman Would she still like this new meI found her in the parking lot grinding Chewies head against the asphalt We had decided that Chewie would be cooler if he was pointy I told her that my grandma was going to take us Her face lit up I explained that we would go out on a date Immediately she seemed crestfallen I panicked and went into full sales mode We would go see the movie then grandma would come get us and wed go get pizza Two  unbelievable treats in one How could you lose She seemed shaken She handed me Chewie back and said she had to go home I told her that the movie started at four and wed have to get going soon She didnt answer I didnt know what to thinkA little while later there was a knock on my door My friends older sister was there At thirteen she seemed as grown up to me as any adult While my friend was kind of a tomboy her older sister was the super sassy ultra girly girl and I pretty much avoided her because my stomach felt weird if I looked at her too long She asked about the date and I explained my intentions Movie pizza ride home with grandma At that age I hadnt really learned yet how to be disingenuous Older sister explained that younger sister didnt really understand what a date was I told her that I was a Gentleman and knew how to treat a lady Thanks grandma She thought this was adorable She said her sister would be ready at three I was in the living room watching TV when a story about Empire came on The newsreader was standing in front of our local theater and behind her was a line that stretched around the building Still a few tickets left she said Oh no I hollered for my grandmother and told her we had to go NOW She said to get my date and meet her at the carI rang her bell I was half an hour early and was bouncing up and down in anticipation She answered the doorin a dress I had never seen her in a dress before We gotta go I cried I grabbed her hand and we ran to the car As we sat in the back seat of grandmas LTD I realized that she was wearing her sisters perfume A lot of her sisters perfume Huh I said You smell nice Never seen you in a dress before She looked embarrassed It was my sisters idea Stupid I know No I said You look niceWe got to the theater and grandma pulled up to the end of the line She gave us money for tickets and popcorn and told us where to meet her after the film As we settled in for the hour plus wait the capricious Pacific Northwest weather suddenly changed What had been a crisp day suddenly became a massive storm of huge fat snowflakes Neither one of us had a coat After a few minutes of big wind gusts and snow sticking to our skin we were both miserable But dammit Star Wars We huddled together at the corner of the building waiting for the line to moveWhen the doors opened a great cheer went up I flexed my stinging hands trying to work the money out of my pocket The movie began and we saw ATATs for the first time I was entranced When Lukes snow speeder entangles the legs of the great machine I was mesmerized I leaned forward trying to absorb this movie into my pores I set my hand to the hand rest and realized I had put it on top of hers What should I do Do I yank it away Would that hurt her feelingsSuddenly she shifted her arm so that her hand was holding mine She locked her grip in mine This was perhaps the most amazing thing that had ever happened to me Not quite as amazing as Star Wars but stillAs the film went on I was no longer chilly but suddenly quite warm Sweaty in fact My gaze was locked on the screen but I had a tingling where our hands met and this was an entirely alien sensationThen came that great reveal He told me you killed my father I am your fatherI gasped and looked over She was already looking at me She smiled The chemicals in my brain were doing backflips I had a sense of intoxication I had never known beforeThe rest of the date went swimmingly but I told you this long ass story in answer to your simple question because seeing that film in those circumstances left an indelible mark on my soul So yeah you could say it was pretty remarkableTLDR  year old me loved the shit outta Star WarsEDIT wow this gained traction in a big way Thank you for your kind responses I realize now that Boba Fett wasnt an action figure yet and Ive addressed that within the thread I also posted how the date ended upEDIT  Holy moley I answered as many posts as I could before going to bed at  am Woke up this morning to a message avalanche like Id been accepted into Hogwarts Story submitted to rdefaultgems Reddit gold and hundreds of kudos Im stunned This is by far my most successful post in over a year of Redditing Thanks guys Glad you enjoyed I adressed my Boba Fett slipup in the thread That hasnt stopped a ton of people from asking about it Scroll down a little Or click my user name Either way my mistake doesnt change the story much my love for Fett just clouded my mind like a jedi mind trickAs for the girl I also posted how the date ended up scroll downuser name again A lot of people want to know if we got married or some such I havent really added any more info because Im sure that whatever romantic ideals your mind can conjure up will be way better than boring old reality Id rather it remain a mystery from a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

thornae,This was one of the first films I ever saw in the cinema and definitely the first I saw in the big cityI was under  at the time and didnt actually know that much about the previous film The thing I remember most clearly was being confused as to why people were laughing whenever Chewbacca spoke  it made sense to me hed speak like that he was an alien In hindsight its possible that I was missing the jokesI dont think the reveal made much more of an impression on me than the rest of the film  it was a big fantastic story and all of it was incredibly cool and amazing and wonderful and the bit where the bad guy was the heros father just fit right into all that as a perfect part of the awesome climax  and then the film just kinda stopped with a to be continued feel But I didnt really mind and it was an awesome experienceAnd goddamn I loved those spaceships I spent the next few months building them as best as I could with my limited space Lego collection  by big city I mean Adelaide which make anyone who knows their Australian cities chuckle,39,cdpv77t,1rqgfi,AskReddit,new,254.0,215

homopopsicle,I had to come out twice The first time I came out to my parents at  as bi I literally told them I think Im bi Their response was basically oh thats nice dear as if I was doing it to get attention or be cute Dont get me wrong they were accepting but I also didnt think they took me that seriously They seemed to have no problem with it when I started dating another girl The second time I came out at  as transgender Their reaction was similar but it wasnt until I actually physically started transitioning from female to male until my mom went apeshit She told me I looked like an ugly lesbian with chin hairs and that nobody would want to be in a relationship with me My father took it very well I think he was actually excited to have a son in his life My relationship with my mother has been very strained while my father and I have bonded very well It wasnt until a couple months ago that my mother started using male pronouns even though Ive been passing for years nowugh the public humiliation she put me throughImagine overhearing a mother ask her bearded son how his gynecological exam went in the middle of a crowded Costco Yeah it was bad I think Ive actually had it pretty easy as Ive never been kicked out or told Im going to hell by any of my family but my mom still admits that she hasnt accepted the fact that Im a dude now She rarely looks at my in the eye and doesnt like talking to me on the phone I dont think she likes hearing my deep voiceMy advice is that if your parents are assholes give them time A lot of them turn around If you are under  and dependent on your parents tread carefully If they are manipulative and homophobic they could make your life a living hell ,0,cdpu26w,1rqild,AskReddit,new,8.0,8

Rainstorme,Army officer who commissioned from college here Id highly recommend going the officer route You kind of set yourself behind the power curve on that path by not going through ROTC but it should be possible to still do it through OCS or whatever the other branches call it Recruiters have been able to stop misleading people now that recruitment goals have been dropped drastically but dont trust anything they say that isnt in your contract which means actually read the contract If you have an ROTC program at your school Id go talk to them there theyll definitely help you out and will probably give you advice before you even go to a recruiter If you do try to become an officer make sure you are physically fit because OCS slots are sought after and PT score is usually a major part in deciding who goesAs for branch if you want to do something related to your degree you have to go Air Force or Navy because the Army and Marines will just put you where they need you without regard to what you majored in outside specialized fields like law and medicine It is a lot harder to get into the Navy and Air Force though People tend to get in and not get out like they do in the Army so there isnt as big of a demand for recruitsIf you want to enlist dont expect to do much that would be meaningful work experience in your field but you will have the ability to pick what you do to a larger extent Youll also have to put up with a lot more of the bullshit stuff like cleaning latrines and buffing floors Hopefully an Airman or Sailor will drop by to go over that because I dont really know what their busywork tends to beMy parents were supportive they knew since before I went to college though and being liberal or conservative has little to do with it unless you know your parents are antimilitary Just tell them why you want to join,0,cdpudil,1rqisi,AskReddit,new,4.0,4

Ursusmisanthropicus,I work in tech so web privacy has become one of my big interests over the past few years Im not quite an expert at it but there are some pretty basic ways to make yourself more anonymous than the average Joe surfing the web Tor BrowserhttpswwwtorprojectorgThis is access to the dark web of lore but also gives you the handy trick of being bounced randomly though a worldwide router network to obscure your IP address You can generate new IP addresses or identities whenever you feel like it Tor is great for when you really want to fly under the radar but I would not recommend it as a daily browser since its default privacy settings will block a lot of regular internet functions such as running scripts although this can be adjusted InPrivate or Incognito browsingThis is a more realistic way to go about your daily business while minimizing the amount of information that is connected to your activity In IE and Firefox its called private browsing and in Chrome its called Incognito but more on Google later Browsing inprivate will not create a history you will automatically be logged out of login based accounts after leaving and ads will not be customized based on your activity  Location InformationIn your browser there should be a setting to disable automatic location detection via GPS or IP On phones there should be an option to disable automatic location detection for anything besides emergency calls Disabling your location will mean that you wont get custom map etc results but it will also mean that you are not tracked as easily I believe most social networks namely Facebook have the option of turning off automatic location tagging in posts Cookies and ScriptsGo into your browser of choice and dig into settings or internet options From there go to privacy or something similar and you should be able to adjust the default level that your browser blocks cookies which track your information Keep in mind that if you block ALL cookies many common webbased programs such as Gmail will not function Adrelated TrackingIf you dont like custom ads there are several ways you can minimize their presence Browsers like IE have a safety dropdown under settings that allows you to turn on a basic tracking protection feature DoNotTrackMehttpdownloadcnetcomDoNotTrackMeforFirefoxhtml is a similar option that you can download for free Finally you can opt out of custom ads by going to the consumer optouthttpwwwnetworkadvertisingorgchoices for online ads and disable customization from several dozen companies that are in the business of using your browsing habits to present custom ads HOWEVER keep in mind that do not track functions are actually a misnomer in the sense that they cannot prevent all tracking of activity they just prevent custom ads that have been created in response to the tracked information Avoid APIs and connections between accountsHave you ever been to a website that offers to let you sign in with your FacebookGoogleOther existing account If you do so it would be connecting with an application programming interfacehttpenwikipediaorgwikiApplicationprogramminginterface which lets the two accounts communicate with each other and exchange information You can think of it as a giant pipe connecting two water towers of information Often allowing one account to connect to another counts as giving permission to a hiddenimplied Terms of Service agreement which then allows the two accounts to share and collect information with each other and occasionally automatically post information example Yahoo posting which stories you are reading to your Facebook account The more you can keep your online accounts separate the more private your information will be and the less risk you have of information being shared and aggregated between your accounts to create a comprehensive online persona That being said on mobile phones APIs are much harder to avoid Avoid GoogleThis should speak for itself but is a tough habit to break Google will track nearly anything you do within its ecosystem YouTube Search Mail Google etc etc and is in the business of connecting all of that information to your online persona If you must  even I have a gmail  do your best to log out of your account whenever possible Googles defaults are to keep you loggedin automatically whenever possible making it easier to collect information Some browsers can be configured to limit the amount of information Google collects but they have famously reverseengineered blocking settings breaking the law mind you even in Apples Safari which was often exalted as a relatively closed and secure ecosystem Back to Chrome Ditch it if you can Because Chrome is Googles proprietary browser they can do whatever they want with it and all other settings I mentioned in other browsers do not apply Assume everything you do in Chrome will eventually be tracked and linked in some way back to any existing Google accounts you have Search off the beaten trackGoogle again tracks all search engine queries whether or not you have a Google account proper location IP address etc Google is obviously one of the best search engines in terms of breadth and accuracy but there are other options If you want to search something without Google tracking it use the native search in Tor or  if you want to stay in a regular browser  DuckDuckGohttpsduckduckgocom They claim not to track queries although your search results will likely be much different than they would have been in GoogleThats the best I can do for now but there are definitely other tricks if you want to go above and beyond The majority of internet users dont even do most of what I listed I recommend researching rprivacy if this is something youre

BunsofthePatriots,Every Saturday a mutual friend of mine and my girlfriends comes over my house and we watch Breaking Bad and have a few drinks and wait for my girlfriend to get out of work so she can join Last Saturday I wanted to try Bacardi  so I bought a bottle made dinner and set up so we could just get to watching when she showed up She showed up but looked like she had been crying so I asked what was wrong and she told me she just had a horrible week and would rather just let it go and have fun tonight So we did we drankand drankand drankand kept drinking until neither one of us knew which was was up She ended up crying again and told me about her work day so I put my hand in her back and told her everything would be okay she told me I was sweet Then she reached for the bottle and even though I was drunk I had a feeling that more alcohol would make things worse so I took the bottle from her and and we locked eyes and kissedIt was one of those passionate drunk kisses that feel great Midway through it my logical side spoke up and told me to stop because what I was doing was wrong so I did Immediately after I had forgotten it happened and was confused as to why she was holding my hand I figured she was just drunk and it gave her comfort I woke up with a hangover the next day to texts from the friend saying she was sorry and how upset she was and how big of a piece of shit she felt like I had no idea what it meant until it clickedholy shit did we have sex I started to panic and flat out asked her she said no and told me that we kissed I was kind of relieved but not fully I had to see my girlfriend so I set out on a drive to her house When I got there she had told me the friend called her and confessed everything She blamed the whole thing on herself to keep my relationship from ending I confessed to my girlfriend and apologized profusely and told her it was a drunken mistake Pretty sure I ended up crying like a pussy but understand that I truely felt terrible for that She forgave me and our relationship is fine Im still upset though the friend came to the conclusion that she had begun to develop feelings for me after spending so much time together and decided she was gonna lay low for a while and hope the feelings go away I feel like such a scumbag and before everyone loses their shit I know alcohol is no excuse ,0,cdpua7t,1rqjpa,AskReddit,new,1.0,1

FarahKh,The tepid water and my wrinkled finger tips mark the end of my bubble bath Mommy just checked on me but my patience has doubled since then I call for her to help me out of the tub but she does not respond I try twice more but I hear no returning calls I decide that I do not really need her help I am five and a big girl The slippery acrylic tub and my misplaced feet results in my arm roughly slicing on the sharp faucet A metallic and unknown smell engulfs me All I see is red just like candy apples So much red falling from my arm and coloring the bathwater Unexplainable fear and pain overcomes me I start to cry and within seconds mommy is standing at the door She has always been beautiful but the flour smeared on her face and the stress lines present on her face does not do much for her The sheer horror on her expression scares me further and transforms my cries into screams She appears white as a sheet as we stare at each other motionless The tub water is noticeably darker when I start to feel a painful sensation shooting down my arm In a flash daddy is carrying me while wrapping a soft towel around my arm Suddenly I am dressed and inside a speeding car I look over still screaming and see my father dripping in his wetsuit He looks concerned but is oddly working more on comforting mommy than I Mommy is wearing her special apron and is holding me tightly with a frightening look on her face The vehicle comes to an abrupt stop and I am being quickly carried out into a building It takes me very little time to realize I am in a hospital The pungent sterile stench and cold of the room does not calm me The waiting room is filled with all kinds of people so busy looking I am still crying as daddy carries me into one of the rooms with two doctors trailing behind him There was no warning given before one of the doctors started putting a needle and thread through my skin It reminds me of sewing a dress together I can only feel a light tugging but it does not quiet my cries She finally cuts the thread after what feels like forever She has a grin on her face that makes he seem less callous while she wraps my arm up tight The sight of the second doctor taking out a colorful basket quiets me completely Stickers So many stickers I want them all The first doctor comes around with a jar of lollipops Oh how I love the hospital They are both decorating me with pretty stickers as I enjoy the sweet blue raspberry goodness of my sucker This room no longer feels so cold I am taken by the hand and walked out to the reception area when something purple catches my eye There is the prettiest fluffiest stuffed bunny I have ever seen Before I know it the bunny is in my arms I give my new friend a big hug and a sticker As I leave the hospital beaming the only thought in my head is I should slip more often tldr fell in the tub when I was  ,12,cdpu0fk,1rqk1a,AskReddit,new,61.0,49

redrew,I mentioned this in another comment thread regarding the source of pain in a fractured bone But it definitely fits hereBetween June  and June  I was living with my older brother his SO and her fouryearold Things were going well at first then some stupid shit happened and I ended up losing a really good job hr temptohire internal technical support for a mediumsized company I fell into a pretty deep depression and my cohabitants didnt make things much easier By April  I was contemplating service in the National Guard as a lastditch effort at securing an income and doing something to improve my situation My brother was in favor of the idea for various reasons several of them selfservingHe also didnt take my emotional problems very seriously He would make unsavory comments toward me slights against my intelligence and otherwise make me feel even more unhappy about my current situation He rationalized all of this by reminding me that the drill instructors of the National Guard werent going to coddle me but that wasnt always a valid excuse One day a comment was made that I couldnt let slide I confronted him an argument ensued and he reminded me that if I was really that unhappy living with him I could always leave At that point I wasnt thinking clearly My emotional equilibrium was completely shot and my mental state was volatile I had what could only be described as a complete emotional breakdown Months of anger resentment and selfpity erupted and became misdirected at myself As part of my goal to join the Guard I had taken up an exercise routine that included two pound handweights I had had brushes with selfharm in the past even moments of borderline suicidal tendencies In my emotional distress I felt as though everything I did was a mistake and that no possible course of action could change things for the better I felt like I deserved punishment that pain would make me stronger I took one of the pounds weights and placing my left hand flat on the floor deliberately struck it with one end of the weight I fractured the third metacarpal in my left hand More argument ensued and my brother ended up leaving in order to distance himself from the situation This is probably the wisest choice he had made that day I wasnt sure I had actually broken my hand at that point but I was sure that I had caused a pretty decent bit of damage My hand started to swell and the pain was pretty bad Finally a few hours later I went to the ER had xrays taken and confirmed that I had a commuted fracture which would require surgery to fixate the two pieces in placeI now have two surgical scars on the back of my left hand and a steel pin in the metacarpal Fortunately I did move out of my brothers house shortly after that incident moved back in with our parents and found a suitable job that I enjoy I havent had any further bouts with depression since June and plan to eventually make an appointment with a psychiatrist once I have proper insurance coverage to discuss my past symptoms and hopefully avoid any future problems EDIT I never did join the National Guard In retrospect it was probably a good idea that I didnt considering my emotional problems at the time ,0,cdpxnt0,1rqk1a,AskReddit,new,2.0,2
