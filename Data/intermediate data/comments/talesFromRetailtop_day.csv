Techsupportvictim,They come behind the counter they touch you they threaten yougame over Call for a manager Tell them the score and flat out say if it were me I would be canceling this whole transaction telling this woman to leave and never come back or he police will be called But it is your call I will be waiting for you in the office because we are filling out an incident report right now and then I am leaving to go get my arm looked at for possible injuryAnd then walk away to the office Let the manager finish ringing up crazy or kick her out If he is a good manager he will at least warn her if she ever pulls that kind of crap again its game over fill out the paperwork and let you leave with pay If he gives you any shit report it up the chain to HR labor board etc And keep a detailed accounting of the whole thing with date and time If you have a smart phone with a voice memo record it while it is fresh and write it up later And if an incident report is filled out demand a copy ,73,cdpe3rn,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_day,382,309

ashion,Wow my first response would to all but scream at her get your hands off me NOW or Back off now and immediately call the manager back and leaving the area asap as soon as the manager was thereOnly had one incident myself many years ago working at a skating rink with a less than pleasant person grabbing my arm very tightly when I was moving past them and demanded something from me cant remember what exactly some song or some food we didnt have I remember immediately snapping very loudly Hands off NOW and stared them down with what I was later told the most stone cold face my head manager had ever seen on normally quiet me The person let go of me in shock and I immediately bolted for the DJ booth where Id initially been heading and hid there in both embarrassment and a bit of fright while my head manager charged out and reamed the person a new asshole she was a little thing  or so but she was also quite muscular from being a pro skater and lo be the person who caught her ire she wouldnt think twice about man handling someone out the door if they were bad enough ending up throwing them out when they proved to be unruly I generally dont deal well with random people actively grabbing me at the best of times and tend to snap loudly then run off petrified of myself guess anxiety thing,7,cdpi1ze,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_day,25,18

SayYeah,I had a similar incident at work I work in a cafe attached to a theatre performance not movie We were really busy for preshow drinks Our cafe is pretty relaxed most of the staff are under  we like to have fun and try to treat our customers like we are friendly It is usually not an issue but this one woman I was serving seemed to take exception to my use of slang I cant remember what I was getting for her but I said grab instead of get While I was putting her order into the till she suddenly grabbed my wrist held it for a good few seconds and said THAT is grabbing next time remember that I pretty much just froze and stared at her for a good  seconds before just repeating her total and running off to get the order I HATE being touched and the way she surprised me like that made it x worse WTF makes people think that touching someone like that is ok,4,cdpidyg,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_day,19,15

ElectronicWanderlust,I have a relative who has a similar situation as yours has anxiety issues and triggers when unexpectedunwelcome contact occursShe told me about a customer who tried to come behind the counter and how her manager saw and responded quickly The event nonetheless left her shaking and she had to take her break early due to a panic attack Fortunately she had an understanding managerI told her that if something like that happens again and the customer DOES touch her to scream Scream loud scream with all the panic in her shy anxious soul No words just noise They did not have a right to touch her and this is natures signal that the other person is out of line and send help quicklyA few months go by and I get a call out of the blue My cousin thanked me for the advice saying it was the best shed ever gotten Shes a cashier at a grocery store and occasionally manages those sample kiosks Same customer large rotund woman had the same issue cousin is only allowed to give  samples per person customer wanted moar and grabbed her wrist when cousin said no politelyCousin did as advised According to her sister who also worked there as an asst manager it was the howl of a thousand banshees EVERYONE came running to see this large woman gripping my tiny cousins wrist in an apparent death vice Later cousin said she wasnt actually hurt just scared Customer was ejected immediately and is banned from the store Cousin said that she actually felt better from the scream and the aftermath was not as bad as other occasions She also said she wasnt likely to do it again as she was mortified by everyone coming around Kind of a mixed bag on my end since Im glad she did it and wasnt hurt but also that shes not likely to do it again,1,cdppsum,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_day,5,4
llamadelrey,Hi OP Based off your story and a pervious one I am pretty positive that I used to work at the same craft store you do assuming its a chainFirst off those coupons are the worst things ever I one time had a woman who didnt understand why her coupon for  off a purchase  didnt automatically bring her purchase down to  when she had spent  Holy shit She literally did not understand how subtraction and addition worked and there was no way for me to explain it to her without being condescending which only pissed her off moreSecond off the fact that we could not delete coupons after scanning them nearly made me cry on several occasions ie psycho coupon lady hands me a  off coupon after Ive scanned a stack of  off coupon and it screws up the entire order I would usually just smile and enter it as a special discount it by hand so that they didnt try to murder meThird off if a customer came behind my register I would have called the manager up immediately and told the customer to get out from behind the register even if they hadnt touched me My store was not in the safest area and there had been several stores that were robbed at gunpoint within a couple blocks So they were very big on not letting customers behind the counters because god knows what those nutjobs will doAnyway feel free to message me if you want to talk ie bitch about the store some more,0,cdpolyw,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_day,3,3

etterboce,To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer I agree in theory However even if OP knows who the customer is simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company Its a really terrible thing but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hiredI dont know how I would have reacted I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place but Im not sure In times like that its hard to say how any of us would really have reacted Ive had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years and Ive never reacted completely how I would have expectedEither way Im sorry you had this happen to you OP Nobody has a right to put their hands on you Next time the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation call a manager and fill out an incident report Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary And do not ever serve that customer again Even if management will not ban her let them know that you will not wait on her Make your manager go up to the register every time she comes in,0,cdpt0sl,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_day,2,2
