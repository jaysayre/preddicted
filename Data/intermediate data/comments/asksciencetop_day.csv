cppdev,Combining multiple flash units together is actually already how SSDs are made For example if you buy a  GB SSD chances are it has   GB NAND chips wired together As for why you cant combine thousands of little SSD chips to get very fast speeds the answer is somewhat technical In digital circuits each time you have whats called fan in or multiple wires converging together there is associated with it some input capacitance which is proportional to the number of wires that are converging So if you have  wires from  flash chips converging to one output eg your SATA cable youre going to have a very high input capacitance However the speed at which you can operate a circuit is inversely proportional to the input capacitance TLDR You could connect  SATA chips in parallel but it would end up being much slower than youd expect,0,cdph1pe,1ro8bz,askscience,top_day,2.0,2

TheGrimReefer,If you do this your fish will most likely die Marine fish have evolved to produce very concentrated urine while absorbing most of the water they take While some marine fish may be able to tolerate a freshwater environment called euryhaline fish most will absorb too much water creating a hypotonic solution within the fish effectively killing it My advice to you is to do some research on your particular fish and see if they can tolerate living in a freshwater environment If they can be sure not to place them directly in freshwater because it will shock and kill them,0,cdpef1o,1roeuz,askscience,top_day,4.0,4
patchgrabber,It depends on the fish Some fish are euryhaline meaning they can live in a differing concentration of salt in water Salmon are one such example they are born in freshwater rivers but spend most of their lives in the sea returning to spawn But they have to go through an acclimation period where they slowly lower the concentration of salt in water I wouldnt try this with your aquarium fish though,0,cdpj5ib,1roeuz,askscience,top_day,3.0,3

NotFreeAdvice,The answer has to do with the idea of bubble nucleationSo it turns out that the release of carbonation ie the bubbles is thermodynamcally favorable  This means that the CO would like to exit as bubbles  There is just one problem to get a bubble you must first form a bubble  The start of bubble formation what we call nucleation is not thermodyanmically favorableThe reason is entropic  There is much more ordering at the surface of a bubble than inside the bulk bubble or the bulk water  This presents a barrier to bubble formation that is related to the surface area of the bubbleAt the same time there is a enthalpic reason to form bubbles and this related to the volume of the bubble The end result is this when the bubbles are quite small the effects from the surface area of the bubble dominate the effects from the bulk of the bubble  And the bubble will not form  or forms very slowly  Once a bubble forms then it will grow more easily  So the bottleneck if you will is the initial formation of the bubble  By shaking the beverage you introduce a bunch of gas bubbles into the beverage and this provides sites for bubble growth  and an increase in released carbonation  Essentially you are providing the mean by which to skip the slow nucleation stepHope that makes sense,0,cdppqxy,1rofgc,askscience,top_day,2.0,2

LukeSkyWRx,The two primary material properties that can be manipulated for thermoelectric are thermal and electrical conductivity Ideally for a given material you would want a low thermal conductivity and a high electrical conductivity An easy way to decrease thermal conductivity is reducing the grain size of the material but that also typically hurts electrical conductivity so it depends on which property changes fastestAs to what material is best that depends on the temperature you want to operate at The best material at one temperature will not be the best at a higher or lower temp so your heat source temp plays a big role,0,cdpue22,1roj3s,askscience,top_day,1.0,1
gingerkid,I dont know if that shape has a name  However shapes whose volume formula is unknown can have it calculated by integrating over the volume of the shape  All thats required is knowing equations that describe the boundaries of that shape  Its worth mentioning that this is how the volume equations of shapes youre familiar with are generally derived  The following may be a bit confusing if you dont know calculus  In case you dont the basic principle of integrating a function is that you add the infinitesimally small heights under a curve to get an area or the areas under a curve to get a volumeIll use the xy plane for the cross section with the flat surface along x and z for the length dimension of the shape and assume that the rate of flattening is linear and that it tapers to a point  The easiest way to integrate it it seems to me is to break it up into triangles in the yz plane and integrate along zIll use r as the radius at the unsquished end and L as the length  Ill also put the center of the unsquished crosssection at the origin  Now on the xy plane a y coordinate along the boundary can be expressed as ysqrtr  x   If the squishing of the shape is linear the yz sections will be triangles with height   sqrtr  x  and length L  The area of each will be L  sqrtr  x   A brief sanity check shows that the areas are  at xr where the height tapers from zero to zeroBy integrating these areas along x the volume can be determined  The integral in question is the integral of L  sqrtr  x  with respect to x as x goes from r to r which is equal to VThis integral isnt terribly easy to solve but theres a way around actually doing it out  By inspection sqrtr  x is just the y coordinate of a circle  The integral of this from r to r should just be the area of a semicircle pi  r   And plugging the definite integral into wolframalpha it isPlugging that back in and cancelling the  V    L  pi  r or half the area of a cylinder  And intuitively that makes senseeach crosssection of it is a triangle with the same base and height as full rectangle  And that shape made of rectangles is a cylinder  So the volume will be half thatAn important practical note is that squishing a reallife cylinder will result in something significantly different because just squishing the end wont produce a constant taper throughout the cylindertldr it can be determined by summing all the arbitrarily thin crosssectional volumes of the shape each of which is an area times an arbitrarily small increment in the direction were slicing  By doing out this calculus the area is A    L  pi  r  or half the volume of a cylinder  This makes sense when you think about how a cylinder and this shape differ,36,cdpdfg9,1rokpj,askscience,top_day,176.0,140

anon,I am thinking that if the flattening is happening linearly in one dimension then the area of the cross section each proportion r of the way from the squished end to the ordinary end has r times the area of the ordinary endMeaning the cross section halfway up has half the area and soon As always the volume is the height times the average cross sectional area Here since the area goes linearly it is the same as the height times the area when it is cut at the half way pointSo the squishing cuts the volume in halfYou can see an example if you do it to other shapes like a xx cube  Then you get what looks from the side like a triangle of area  thickened up to have thickness  So the volume is  x   ,1,cdpejjk,1rokpj,askscience,top_day,3.0,2

YouDoNotWantToKnow,O      Orient your axis at the center of the circle at the bottom of the cylinder The circle is radius r and let it exist in the xy plane so cylinder extends into the z plane Let the line at the other end of the shape the squish point also be described by y zh where h is the height of the cylinderNow look at the yz plane in slices for x in rr For any given x in this range the yz plane contains a triangle That triangle has a height of h and a base of sqrtr  x Now you have a simple calculus integralIntegrate sqrtr  x   h for x from  to r and multiply that by  and to make that simpler theres a  in the integral so just pull that out and divide it out right awayTheres probably a more elegant way of going from here but to brute force it you can look up or derive using trig substitution that the indefinite integral of A  x is I  xAx  A tanxAxLooks messy but just plug in the integration points A  r btw so the definite integral from  to r is Ir  I I is easy there are xs in both numerators so I  Ir causes the first time to drop out but the second term inside the inverse tangent goes to infinity tan of infinity is piSo the integral comes out to just Api dont forget the height constant we left out earlier and that Ar the final solution isV  hpirDoes that make sense Its half the volume of a full cylinder So that is the right direction less Is it correct Well do you think we could form the same shape out of the volume we took out Think about each slice we made at the beginning Initially they would have been rectangles instead of triangles right What part of each rectangle is missing The area of the triangle is bh The area of the rectangle is bh So the missing area is bh  bh  bh Half the rectangle So its pretty clear this makes sense and is the correct resultAnd now I read the other top reply and it has a similar derivation and the same solution Sweet,0,cdpfd5k,1rokpj,askscience,top_day,3.0,3

yogurtsurprise,gtwhy dont your teeth heal on your own like other bones in your bodyThe crown of teeth the part that is visible are made of two primary materials enamel on the outer surface and dentin which makes up most of the tooth structure with pulp in the centre which contains blood vessels lymph and nerves When the crown forming there are made of two major cells types Ameloblasts and odontoblasts First the dentin in formed by the odontoblasts at the centre of the tooth and dentin is formed outwards The ameloblasts start from the DEJ dentinoenamel junction where enamel and dentin meet and move towards the outside of the crown They are lost during tooth eruption when the tooth comes through the gums The tooth is unable to heal since it cannot produce enamel after eruption because there are no cells to make new enamelDentin on the other hand can and does form after the tooth is already in the mouth secondary dentin forms after the tooth is in the mouth and more dentin is made towards the centre of the tooth tertiary dentin is made in response to inflammation of the pulp often due to cavities So in one sense the tooth is healing However it doesnt heal like bones since often a tooth fractures in the middle of the tooth and the odontoblasts cannot move through already formed dentin to make new tooth structure on top of old tooth structure and as the ameloblasts are gone no new enamel can be produced While Im not as familiar with bone healing bone is a vascularized blood containing cellular tissue Osteoblasts which synthesis new bone and osteoclasts which eat old bone are always working even when there is no damage So when the bone is broken these cells can work to remodel and repair the bone I hope this helps answer your question,29,cdpf0fv,1ronxr,askscience,top_day,164.0,135

ElDentistador,So far all the other comments are spot on  The cells that form the enamel and dentin in teeth are ameleoblasts and odontoblasts respectively  The ameleoblasts work from the DEJ out while the odontoblasts work from the DEJ in  The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are mostly at the edge of the pulp only extending processes through tubules within the dentin and your ameleoblasts are long gone once they finish forming the enamel This leaves enamel and dentin without any significant intrinsic method of healing and your immune system has no access to these two tissues either as they are avascularBy the time your immune system gets to see the infection the bacteria have breached the pulp chamber Much like the brain pulpal tissue  cannot handle inflammation well since its completely encased by hard tissue  Your own inflammatory response increases the intrapulpal pressure dramatically and it hurts  The pulpal tissue will necrose and the bacteria now have an easy path through the canals to the periapical tissues which can lead to more serious infections like cellulitis and osteomyelitis  There have actually been cases where odontogenic infections have led to fatalities which should never happen  The most famous case is Deamonte Driver ,1,cdpgs6c,1ronxr,askscience,top_day,13.0,12
mkav,Also the teeth have an outer layer called the pellicle The pellicle is where plaque formation first starts and eventually can become calculus A question I thought of when first beginning cariology study of cavities was why dont antibiotics stop caries And the answer is because bacteria in plaque and calculus form a biofilm This biofilm forms a protective layer and also has channels between adjacent biofilms These channels allow the transfer of genes which can cause some minor resistance in these strains Enamel is formed by ameloblasts which deposit enamel in an inside to outside direction After the enamel is deposited the ameloblasts either die off or can form a cuticle layer Dentin however is formed by odontoblasts and can be deposited through a lifetime in an inward direction So in a way teeth can heal to a small degree because if there is insult or resorption of dentin possibly due to inflammation or trauma the tooth can lay down tertiary dentin in order to repair it as long as it is on the pulpal side ,0,cdph1sv,1ronxr,askscience,top_day,7.0,7

NAGLT,Well changing electric and magnetic fields produce electromagnetic waves Light is also an electromagnetic wave and can be used to vaporise solid Also you almost never strip out all electrons from the more charged nuclei but stripping few electrons out of outer shell is usually enough to break bonds between atoms When you shine light at a material and it is absorbed most of its energy first goes into electrons and then redistributed to the nuclei The kinetic energy of nuclei manifests itself as a heat and acts the same To put a lot of energy in a form of light into a solid you can use laser If youre using a laser that shines continuously you can melt and then vaporise some part of a molten metal Depending on the reflectance thickness and focusing few Watts of laser power may be enough for cutting However when you use a nonpulsed laser even  kW lasers will still leave some parts molten as the absorbed heat has time to diffuse around the spot you shine at There is a way to vaporise metal with minimal melting however Going straight from solid to a vapour is called ablation and it can be achieved with a very short laser pulses It is currently possible to generate pulses on the order of picoseconds  s and less The energy you put into the pulse is absorbed so quickly that the thermal diffusion into surrounding area cannot move it away fast enough One of the values Ive found was done with a  fs  s laser pulsehttplinkspringercomarticleFs The flux required to ablate copper was  Jcm which means a peak irradiance of  TWcm The peak electric field strength is  GVm Gigavolts per meter Thats a lot as making an electric spark go through the air requires  times weaker field So if you want to vaporise material from a solid state youre looking at very strong electric fields However that wont strip all electrons only the least bound ones on the outer shell Removing all the electrons gets harder the further you go along the periodic table Unfortunately I cant give you any numbers for those,0,cdpjek4,1rpaf7,askscience,top_day,1.0,1

DanielSank,This excellent question is at the root of many other questions that show up on raskscienceThere are aspects of this question that nobody really understands yet However we understand a lot more than popular science and even some physicists will lead you to believe This will be a somewhat long post but possibly worth your time to readBefore I say anything else I want to say that your statementgt How does it know it was observed By its interaction with surrounding particles of courseis absolutely essential I hope to explain why belowStructure of physical theoryAny theory of physics has two parts  The first part is a representation of the natural system under consideration For example if you are making a theory of balls rolling down hills you represent each ball with three numbers xyz indicating the balls position in space You may also have Vx Vy Vz representing its velocity in all three directions  The second part is some way of predicting how this representation changes as time goes by  For the case of rolling balls this could just be Newtons laws of motionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiNewtonslawsofmotionIn classical physics these two parts were all we needed to go happily about our scientific lives However theres actually a crucially important third part  We have to have a prescription for how the representation put forth in part  relates to our personalhumancognitive observations of the natural system In other words what does a group of numbers xyz have to do with my observation of the systemIn the case of rolling balls this is pretty simple I might use Newtons laws to compute that my ball should be at position meter  meters  meters at time minutesand we all just know that this means that we should see a ball at the specified location and time This works just fine and indeed in classical mechanics the link between part  and  is usually pretty straightforward Note that we never mentioned anything about what we meant by see a ball because in classical physics we implicitly assume that it doesnt matter In quantum mechanics it does matter and Ill now try to explain whyQuantum mechanicsThe first two parts of quantum mechanics are   We represent the natural world with a wave functionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiWavefunction or state vectorhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumstate  The wave function evolves according to Schrodingers equationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiSchrCBdingerequation or Heisenbergs equationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenbergpictureThese two together are just as good as xyz coordinates and Newtons laws The place where everyone gets confused is in what the wave function means in terms of what we observe in experiments To answer this question you hear people say things like when you make a measurement the wave function collapses into a definite position chosen at random and thats what you see The crucial thing to understand is that this statement modifies part  It says that Schrodingers equation determines the evolution until some vaguely defined observation happens at which time Schrodingers equation stops being correct the state collapses probabilistically and then Schrodingers equation goes back into effect This breaks the theorys selfconsistency Suppose I make a measurement and say that the atoms state collapsed Now suppose that me and my experiment are in a box which is actually the experiment of some greater alien For the theory to be true for the alien there cant be any state collapse until he does the observation Thus we see that state collapse as stated above cant workThe issue is that as stated above state collapse modifies part  of the theory whereas we should have been looking for a part  type statement It turns out that if we leave part  alone and make an extra statement like this  When a humans brain collects information about a physical system that information will be randomly distributed according to the square of the wave function and that system will henceforth appear to have collapsed in accordance with the result of the humans informationthen we have a selfconsistent theory I emphasize that it is both falsifiable and selfconsistent and therefore must be admissible as a theory of Nature That said its not very satisfying because of this bizarrely anthropocentric rule  which seems much more weird than the sort of obvious equivalent rule  in classical physics DecoherenceAmazingly we can almost get the quantum rule  to be as obvious as the classical one The trick is to really consider what happens when we make measurements In fact whenever you measure something you are connecting that thing to many extra physical elements If I measure the position of an atom with a CCD camera I am coupling the wave function of the atom to an enormous number of electrons etc in the cameras inner workings Certainly I do not know the wave functions of all those electrons This is the crux of the entire story It turns out that if you actually compute what happens to the wave function of the atom in the case that it couples to a bunch of extra stuff whose wave functions you dont know then from your perspective the wave function of the atom becomes a classical probability distribution I emphasize that this comes about entirely from Schrodingers equation and nothing else From the perspective in which the wave functions of the electrons are known the atoms wave function does not collapse Therefore collapse can be understood as an apparent phenomenon predicted by pure quantum mechanics that shows up with only part of the information in a systems wave function is available This is always the applicable case for humans because our measurement apparatuses contain many uncontrollable degrees of freedomWhen the wave function appears to have collapsed for one observer it may not appear that way for another one who has more informationThis is really interesting because it gets us really really close to being able to explain rule  via rule  We know that when only some information of a system is available that information appears probabilistic What we havent explained is why humans see only one of those possible results Nobody knows the answer to thatAnswer to the original questionSo how does a particle know when it has definite position It doesnt It never does Definite position is just an apparent property of things that comes up when we dont have complete information about the systemConclusionWe have a selfconsistent theory of quantum mechanics using wave functions and Schrodingers equation Part of the theory is the statement that when humans have access to the prabability distributions furnished by partial access to a complete system wave function they perceive one particular value for some reason that we dont know For the physicists out there Id say more generally equations of motion are constraints on how the representation at one point in spacetime is related to the representation at other points in spacetime However I challenge anyone to state a truly selfconsistent theory of physics without such a ruleEDIT For down voters If you could express what you think is unscientific wrong or irrelevant

DanielSank,Since my other post was so longgt If none of the particles around it have definite positions either how does any particle in the universe know for sure that it was observedThey dont Particles dont do anything special when theyre observed We can propose a selfconsistent theory of quantum mechanics in which the wave functions dont actually collapse and take on a definite position The appearance of definite position only happens for in cases where only subsets of the systems information is available which happens to be the case relevant when humans are involved From the perspective of someone with fuller information about the system the collapse that you see may not happenThe falsifiability of this theory described more fully in my other post is definitely open for discussion Id love to have that discussion with anyone else whos interested,0,cdppng9,1rpid6,askscience,top_day,5.0,5

FromAshesRize,The answer is sort of You can not create an extremely small flame from a source such as a traditional candle But there is a way to create micro flames  This is called microcombustion and they are flames smaller than the width of a millimeter  They are typically made in small hard ceramic combustors such as alumina oxide and they burn at temperatures of up to  C The combustors have small channels through which the fuel flows and the flame burns They are typically fueled by hydrocarbons and oxygen Methane butane propane etcThe two inlet flows of the fuels meet and combine at some point and then you have your combustible gas The point at which the two flows meet exhibits turbulent flow and this is the limiting factor at ignition for the combustor due to wall conditions and fluid dynamics not worth explaining here Turbulent flow tends towards extinction for a flame Typically a large candle type flame will be seen at the end of the exhaust channelAs the combustor ramps up to its max temp steady state the walls of the exhaust channel heat up and begin to provide the thermal energy necessary for the gases within the channel to ignite You will hear loud pops as ignition events begin to occur within the channel As the temperature of the wall increases due to the heat seen from the exhaust flame the ignition events begin occurring closer to the mixing points of the  fuelsFinally at steady state the walls of the combustor at the mixing point of the fuels is so hot that the gases ignite immediately upon mixing Due to the turbulent nature of the flow they go out almost immediately  They are also almost immediately replaced by fresh uncombusted fuel which them ignites This cycle repeats itself many times per second and you end up with a sustained micro flame The ratio of gases determines how many times per second ignition occurs and you can actually say that the flame has a frequency Ie You can hear the flame buzz while it is litSo in short yes micro flames are possible just not from a candleTldrTeeny candles dont work Burn hydrocarbons in a ceramic combustor for super hot buzzing micro flames Science is awesome,106,cdplrw5,1rpive,askscience,top_day,596.0,490

MrQuiver,The water level stays the same As soon as something is floating on a liquid it will displace a volume of that liquid equal to the weight of itself and everything in it This means it raises the water level by the same amount as if one had added an amount of liquid equal to its weightThe ice is inside the boat so the water level has already raised up to account for an amount of liquid water equal to the weight of the ice When the ice is dumped overboard it is still floating in the water so nothing changes When the ice melts it turns into an amount of water equal to its own weight obviously no mass can be lost in the melting process So no change to the water level,1,cdpod85,1rpwbu,askscience,top_day,6.0,5
ndem,When the block goes into the water the level will go upWhen the block melts it will go down but should still be above the original level because you did add materialYou can test this with a glass of water and an ice cubeThis is assuming the block has a large enough size to impart a noticeable difference and the water that was frozen was the same as that which is in the pool,13,cdpobyf,1rpwbu,askscience,top_day,2.0,-11
erathdroid,Half of your genes will come from your father half will come from your mother What actually happens is a bit more complex than that but this is close enough for this discussion This means that any single parentchild combination will have half of the same genesWhen it comes to siblings from the same parents you can have as many as  of the same inherited genes or as much as  of the same inherited genesFor example say for one particular allele the father has type Aa and the mother has type Bb This means that the child can have one of four allele combinations AB Ab Ba and ab Its entirely possible for one child to inherit the combination AB and the other inherit ab This would be a case of zero shared genes for that particular traitHowever in the real world due to the large number of genes that are inherited siblings will share close to  of the same inheritable genes making them in general as genetically similar to each other as they are to their parents,4,cdpp17m,1rpxrq,askscience,top_day,33.0,29
Xinlitik,You are  related to mom and dadthis is basically static although de novo changes and certain recombination events do account for a small deviation Your nonidentical siblings are theoretically  related to you but since the genome is so huge its going to be close to  That is you could somehow get the exact  of dads genome that your brother did not get but the chance is extremely low just like how flipping a coin  times is probably not going to give you  heads,1,cdpq1t9,1rpxrq,askscience,top_day,5.0,4
OnceReturned,In the average oversimplified model case you will share  of your variable genes with both your siblings and your parents making you equally similar to both though the  that you share with each is not likely to be the same However you could think about the question with an eye towards probabilities and find that the two cases are not quite as similar as they seem  Specifically if the question is Are you more likely to find a sibling pair that is lt  identical than you are to find a parentchild pair that is lt  identical  the answer is yes  Heres whyThe rule that were using to figure this out is that each parent contributes  of their genes to their children  Because the genome is large there are many many different combinations of contributions from each parent that satisfy this rule of thumb of each parent having provided   ranging from the same  from each parent in each sibling making the siblings identical to the opposite  from each parent to each sibling making the siblings have  of their variable genes in common  In the case of your own child no matter which  of your variables genes you contribute to their genome you share  of variable genes with them  Therefore as long as the rule of thumb of  parental contribution holds true you are guaranteed to be  similar to your offspring  While under the same circumstances you may be anywhere from  similar to your siblings  In other words there is far more variability in the similarity between siblings than there is between parents and their children though all that variability centers around the same point that the parentchild pairs exhibit consistently,0,cdpsa4f,1rpxrq,askscience,top_day,2.0,2
LietKynes,On average youre slightly more related to your parents Since the creation of your siblings involved an entirely separate meiosis and fertilization process they have had an additional opportunity for random mutation to occur Meaning they have twice as many mutations different from you than your parents would Also taking into account sex chromosome differences in males in females theres other variables involved Practically speaking though you share approx  DNA with your parents AND your siblingsTo simplify it  you are guaranteed to get  of your DNA from either parent You may have less in common with your sibling depending on mutations and gendersince the X chromosome complicates things,0,cdq3vfp,1rpxrq,askscience,top_day,1.0,1
GProteins,They developed them separately Current knowledge is that birds evolved from small dinosaurs who had normal toothed jaws This theoretically happened around the mesozoic erahttpenwikipediaorgwikiMesozoic which started around  million years agoSquids and octopi on the other hand are evolved from earlier forms of mollusks which separated themselves out from other life forms in the some time during the cambrian erahttpwwwjakobvinthercomMolluscevolutionhtml which ended about  million years ago,0,cdppwko,1rpxux,askscience,top_day,30.0,30
LietKynes,They developed seperately which would be an example of analogous structures This means they have similar appearance and function but developed independently A common example involved the octopus is their eye compared to the mammalian eye We know because of the organization of its layers that the octopus eye developed independently from the mammalian eye However they share similar appearance and functionAnother example would be comparing an insects wings to a birds wings  they look similar are both used for flying but have different structures and evolved separately,0,cdq3rnj,1rpxux,askscience,top_day,2.0,2
OnceReturned,A comprehensive answer to that question would have many components but in animals there are a few dominant factorsDNA  Cell division is not perfect and DNA damage occurs naturally due to environmental factors and normal cellular processes  Genomic robustness and DNA repair capacity is a huge factor in lifespan determination  DNA damage is generally considered the leading cause of aging  Species with more robust genomes and better DNA repair mechanisms tend to have greater lifespansPhysical fragility  There are many potentially fatal events which individuals have some probability of experiencing in any given time period  These include things like harsh environmental conditions ie a bad winter infectious diseases and encounters with predators  Every organism has some set of such events which are likely to be fatal and which occur with some probably such that the more time passes the more likely the organism is to have been exposed to such an event  The more sensitive an organism is to these things the shorter its lifespan is expected to be  For example small animals are particularly susceptible to predation so the odds that they have a fatal encounter with a predator in any time period are higher than the those same odds for larger animals that are higher on the food chain  Biological wear and tear  Tissue and organs get worn out through use  Small animals generally have higher metabolisms which amounts to something similar to more friction or wear and tear on all of their systems ie more heartbeats per minute  So they dont typically live as long as typical larger creatures with slower metabolisms Generally larger animals live longer  Dogs are something of an exception  Its not exactly clear why large dogs dont live as long but it likely has something to do with the fact that domesticated dogs are highly inbred  This means they have genetic risk factors that are much less common in wild animals  This manifests in a variety of ways  For example large dogs are more likely to get cancer and this is likely because they simply grow more cells throughout their lives,0,cdptcay,1rqeob,askscience,top_day,2.0,2
RetraRoyale,According to General Relativity as I understand it and in particular Machs PrinciplehttpenwikipediaorgwikiMachsprinciple A rotating universe would be indistinguishable from a nonrotating one in which you yourself were spinning That is if the universe were spinning it would emit gravitational waves in just the right way that made you think you were spinning and the universe wasntAs for everything else youve said its not very clear what youre talking about because our description of viscosity and friction dont really work for General Relativity so youre inappropriately generalizing those concepts,3,cdpykkm,1rqeus,askscience,top_day,19.0,16
