gameinator,Every dollar the government takes in tax dollars could have been spent by someone else and thus would have helped the economy just as much as the government spending itEvery service provided by the government could just as easily be provided by the free market and many still are offered at a higher quality than government can provide private schools vs public schools apartments vs section  housing UPS vs the Postal ServiceThe difference between money spent by the government and money spent by the consumer is that the government faces little to no consequences if they waste money or spend it poorly  If the government provides only a very basic lowquality and overpriced service it still gets government dollars and politicians can make a big deal about minor and inconsequential improvements  If a private producer provided the same lowquality and overpriced service theyd soon go out of business and be replaced in the marked by someone providing a higher quality service for a lower price,4,cdm8uj3,1rdp01,politics,new,9,5

students,A sampling of the over  bills blocked by the GOP senate or not moved on by the Teapublican house since Obama took officeHR   Paycheck Fairness Act  While the Lily Ledbetter Act was a good start this bill would have mandated pay fairness and prohibited pay discrimination based on sex In other words while Lilys Bill made it easier for women to sue this would have created fair workplace system with regard to pay In other words Republicans voted in favor of paying women less money for the same job HR   Wounded Veteran Job Security Act  This bill would actually provide job security for veterans who are receiving medical treatment for injuries suffered while fighting in defense of their country It would prohibit employers from terminating employees who miss work while receiving treatment for a servicerelated disability Guess that answers that question they dont care about the troops either This isnt the only bill they have blocked having to do with the troops eitherHR   Radioactive Import Deterrence Act  This one has to make you scratch your head Basically this bill would prohibit the issuance of licenses to import of lowlevel nuclear material and waste to this country It specifically exempts nuclear waste belonging to the United States and it allows the president to make exceptions where necessaryHR   Veterans Retraining Act  This bill would provide for assistance to help veterans who are currently unemployed with their expenses while retraining for the current job marketHR   Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program Reauthorization  Once again you have to wonder what do Republicans have against those who have served our country This bill would reauthorize programs in support of homeless veterans to assist them with job training counseling and placement services through the Department of Veterans Affairs through  HR  Water Quality Investment Act  This bill would not only invest needed funds into improving water quality in areas where its needed but it would also create jobs for those who work in that industry HR   Disabled Veterans Home Improvement and Structural Alteration Grant Increase Act of   Heres another bill in support of those who have fought for their country passed by House Democrats and blocked from becoming law by Republicans Clearly Republicans hate the troops because there is no other reason to be against this bill This would increase the amount paid by the VA to disabled veterans for necessary home structural improvements from  to  for those who are more than  disabled and from  to  who are less than  disabled,35,cdmoocr,1rewyp,politics,new,46,11

kosherpoultry,No one seems to have actually read this article  It spends considerable time discussing how the word profit can be misleading due to the unusual accounting methods required by federal budgetary rules  Without going into detail about those methods about which I am hardly an expert let me explain why it is mathematically impossible for the government to have earned B in profit from student loans in one yearThe total amount of student debt outstanding in this country according to the article is T  Assuming the average interest rate on this debt is  which is almost certainly too high given how many old loans carry a lower rate but which is a conservative estimate for the purposes of my argument the total interest earned on the debt is B  However the governments year borrowing cost is currently  which translates to a cost of B for a gross profit of B B  B  This amount which is already less than the B noted in the article does not take into account several important factors  First the government does not hold the entire T pool of loans  It liquidates approximately half of the loans generated each year by issuing assetbacked securities ABS through Sallie Mae  The government captures a portion of the gross spread value the amount calculated above through the sale of these securities but the portion captured is always be smaller than the full amount Otherwise no one would purchase the securitiesSecond the gross figure does not account for defaults  The lifetime default rate on student loans is expected to be a shocking  and the  year cohort default rate the actual year default rate for loans that entered repayment in  was   httpwwwifapedgoveannouncementsattachmentsDefaultRatespdf  A conservative slapdash combination of these figures suggests that annual defaults on the entire pool are roughly  translating to an annual loss of B bringing us down to a total profit of B  However this figure does not account for the discounts on sales of the ABSs or losses due to late payments timing really matters when you finance using ABSsSome of you are now crying But student loans are not dischargeable in bankrupcty so defaults dont cost the governemnt anything  This couldnt be farther from the truth  Just because the obligations arent discharged doesnt mean the government gets paid  If the borrower is bankrupt the government isnt going to see its loan repaid even if the legal obligation survivesThird and most difficult to quantify is the embedded cost of the subsidized rate  If the marketthirdparties provided rates lower than the governments then students would be flocking to borrow from the other parties  They are not  If I recall correctly more than  of student loan value is initiated by the government  This means that the government must be providing belowmarket rates and terms to most borrowers even at the high rates that they currently offer and is assuming an uncompensated riskcost that is not accounted for in this analysis  A certain amount of this ends up being captured through default rates but given that the defaultrelated figureds above are based largely on actual results the true degree of uncertainty is unknownIn the end these articles are designed to inflame and give people a scapegoat for the state of their personal finances  I take them with a massive grain of saltedit cohesion  ,43,cdmmepa,1rexe3,politics,new,171,128

KerfluffleKazaam,Its amazing to me that people take these kind of articles at face value without any sort of context and these loan misconceptionsYes students can default on student loans its called not paying lots of loans simply go unpaidThe reason the government took on student loans is because private lenders didnt want to do it anymore especially after the crash so the government took on all the risk and little reward I doubt these profit numbers are actually profit when compared to the amount of unpaid loans that occur every year I mean I get wanting to enrich higher education by investing in our students and taking some of the financial burden off students but it confuses me when people in the comment sections set up the government as this racketscam trying to trick students when the reality is that they will work with you in almost any situation to make a plan that works for you Truly confuses me Their flexibility and locked in interest rates go well beyond what any private  lender would offer you especially if you didnt have the makings of a good credit score as of yet ,0,cdmkv9u,1rexe3,politics,new,5,5

BeneficiaryOtheDoubt,Im dont think we should or can overturn of roe v wade but in examining the economic justificationsa st trimester abortion costs about  on average  Is that too much for a low income person too pay if it will save them in the long run  Would they rather accept the pregnancy as they wont be footing the hospiral bill anyways  Does universal insurance address this as theyll now be paying for their hospital bill and have to rake those costs into consideration  Id rather not factor in abortion as a health risk if its such a controversial moral issueContraception and educational outreach should be adequate I think  And even if it isnt hopefully it will spur us to increase the capability and efficiency of the our social safety net  When half the population thinks its tantamount to murder we shouldnt make it hard for them to make the choice to not subsidize it  Currently few plans in the exchanges are offered that dont cover elective abortions so the remaining plans force those consumers to pick plans that are otherwise inferior for their needsTo make a more concise point  Quality education a stronger safety net that enables parents to provide that and universal health coverage including contraceptives should be adequate in addressing  the issue of unwanted pregnancies  I dont think we should force anyone to subsidize elective abortionsEdit I am in favor of roe v wade  Not sure what I was trying to do with the wording there,6,cdnadjx,1rfeng,politics,new,2,-4
Selcopa,Its always interesting to see the abortion topic come up on reddit who usually worships the late Christopher Hitchens everyone seems to forget that he was pretty strongly pro life Its also interesting to see how usually reddit is very proscience they tend to ignore the advancements in knowledge with regard to this topicMorally its really hard to argue that a pro choice slant is the morally superior side the science has taught us too much about the process of life so much that a prolife oriented position seems to be morally superiorIm not suggesting that we go balls deep and ban every single instance of abortion but it seems morally we would want to have a pro life slant to our laws and processes to protect our future generation of the speciesThere is no perfect answer to this problem and its a mockery for people to suggest that your position on the issue can be boiled down to a catch phrase like Im Pro Choice or Pro Life its far more complicated than that and dont denigrate it by making it so shorthanded We as humans should be doing as much as we can to protect the lives of our future generations improving sex ed and condom access to prevent as many unwanted pregnancies as possible having as much charity and assistance for children in poverty as possibleI can tell you the Michigan Right to Life does this including setting up daycares and helping single mothers finish their college degrees And as a last resort having the abortion optionIm all for womens rights and them having a choice but we also need to be protecting the life of the child who didnt chose this either however as I said this problem should be being addressed before someone is getting pregnant in the first placeAlso anyone who compares the US abortion laws to Haiti or the Dominican should be ridiculed and shunned thats ridiculously blown out of proportion and is a byproduct of the notorious circle jerk of the liberal slanted reddit here and no intelligent person should respect a post like that,5,cdmsysp,1rfeng,politics,new,2,-3

RantsAtClouds,There are a number of reasons why Iran hasnt achieved nuclear fruition First and foremost is international pressure They paused their program from  in the wake of US military action in Iraq It was restarted again when it became obvious that the US was not willing to risk another major venture into the Middle East quagmire This upset the Israelis because they had constantly said that Iran was the true danger in the Middle East and not Iraq despite Saddams bankrolling of Palestinian terrorism Because of the fact that military action was not possible at that time the Israelis and the Americans used far more covert means to stop Irans acquisition of nuclear weaponry This took the form of the funding of opposition groups in Iran and training them how to use weapons including exiles They would take them over to Kurdistan and teach them a number of different tricks of the trade When it was believed that this was taking too long the Israelis began to take a far more handson approach They began to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists This began in  and has continued to this day That being said assassinations in Iran are often blamed on Israel and sometimes may be the work merely of opposition groups Whilst all of this was going on the NSA or CIA but most likely the NSA was working with an Israeli army unit called  This army unit specialises in SIGINT and attracts the brightest computer minds that Israel has to offer a huge amount of hitech startups in Israel have been formed by ex soldiers Over the course of a period of several years they developed a piece of malware called Stuxnet Stuxnet was one of the most complex pieces of malicious code ever assembled It also had a huge number of safeguards It would only activate if it was on a machine that had the specific operating system connected to specific hardware and was part of a specific network One computer security expert stated that The attackers took great care to make sure that only their designated targets were hitIt was a marksmans jobhttpwwwnytimescomworldmiddleeaststuxnethtmlramprefgeneralampsrcmeamppagewantedallamp All of this had the hallmarks of a professional statesponsored attack The worm was designed to spin centrifuges incredibly quickly whilst showing normal operations to the person who was looking over it However what OP and several commentators is implying is that conservatives have simply brought out Iran as a way to scare people into military action Theres some truth to that However theres also quite a bit of truth to the fact that Iran is heading towards nuclear weapons Iran has often said one thing and done another It has deceived the IAEA and openly acquired materials whose only use could be nuclear weaponryhttpwwwisisonlineorguploadsisisreportsdocumentsIAEAIranNovpdfAlong with this Irans continued sponsorship of proxy terror forces their relationship with AQ KhanhttpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticleARhtml and their role in the Syrian nuclear program along with North Korea means that the immediate neighbours Israel and Saudi Arabia are becoming nervous at this deal They believe that with the sanctions lifted Iran will simply go ahead and continue working towards nuclear weaponry TLDR Theres truth that Iran is one more year away from nuclear weapons Covert actions in the form of assassinations and cyberwar have delayed the effort by several years Irans nuclear weapons program is far more likely to be an actual nuclear weapons program than Saddams ,7,cdna52j,1rgebz,politics,new,12,5

OctopusPirate,Probably going to get buried but as a liberal who doesnt want to attack Iran I have to speak out Theyre right even though theyre misleading the public and scaremongeringIran is a year away from a bomb quite likely less now and has been for years  Japan is also a year to five away from a bomb and has been for decades  And were okay with bothWhat being a year away means is that if the Supreme Leader gives the final goahead and he has not and Iran raced full speed for a bomb they could have one in a year  Iran is currently building up stockpiles of  enriched uranium and other materials that could potentially be used for a weapon the process is not linear and it takes much less time for the final enrichment steps  Based on their stockpiles and available facilities we know how long it would take them to reach those points of no return  If Iran maintained current stockpiles and added no new facilities they will always be one year or so away from building a bombIf they increase stockpiles or capacity this time will be reduced  If they have more centrifuges and material available then they could reduce the breakout time to a month or weeks  And they could maintain that posture no bomb but have the ability to produce one if desired within a month  Our media would then say Iran is a month away from a bomb for a few years and they would be rightSo yeah  Even though they are scaremongering it isnt contradictory to say they are a year away from a bomb for years on end  Its a statement of how quickly Iran could produce a bomb if they chose to race for one at full speed  Not a timer of how long until they actually build one from today,2,cdnduwh,1rgebz,politics,new,2,0

JoshTheGoat,As someone thats actually attended a BLM Lease Sale  this is good news If youre not aware of the process heres how it basically works The BLM as the federal government owns lots of land  Someone oil company mining company etc submits a request to lease a tract of land from the government  BLM submits the tract of land for a public auction posts notices of all of the upcoming tracts so other people can either prepare for the auction or submit a protest  Protests are typically for concerns regarding conservation issues  BLM evaluates protests before the auction and will pull some properties based on whether or not they agree with the protest to conduct studies on the property Im not really sure what they use to make this determination  Auction takes place and companies pay a one time bonus per acre for the property Active oil and gas plays were selling for  per acre when I went  Auction winner receives the lease for the property and pays a royalty in production Protests are a good thing but in areas that have been delayed production due to frivolous protests its only costing Americans Were paying more people at the BLM to review these protests and were delayed in production which increases gas prices over time Happy to answer questions as time permits ,8,cdnkv7a,1rhof1,politics,new,25,17

fernandopoo,I dont think this is a good example Taking a militaristic attitude towards Iran and refusing to compromise has been American policy for decades which is strange when you think about the fact that America created the problem by meddling in Iran and helping overthrow their government If this deal holds then Obama deserves credit for breaking out of that box and it could actually help American interests in that region  this article makes a good casehttpgeopoliticsmadesuperwordpresscomiransdealonestepclosertototalamericandominationandincidentallyonestepclosertopeace But its hardly surprising that conservatives would have a problem with it,7,cdnql7k,1rhsoj,politics,new,12,5

hope for the poor both black and white through the poverty program There were experiments hopes new beginnings Then came the buildup in Vietnam and I watched this program broken and eviscerated as if it were some idle political plaything on a society gone mad on war And I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as suchgt As I have walked among the desperate rejected and angry young men I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action But they asked and rightly so What about Vietnam They asked if our own nation wasnt using massive doses of violence to solve its problems to bring about the changes it wanted Their questions hit home and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos

SomethingImpromptu,The military harbors rapists like the Catholic church has harbored pedophiles Why should a priest who fucks a child or a soldier who rapes one or more of their fellow soldiers be protected by keeping it within the organizations in question That strategy has previously resulted only in the leadership of both institutions attempting to cover it up rather than punishing the motherfuckers If you rape another human being whether they are an alterboy or a US marine or anyone else you should go to trial and see jail time Being a member of an archaic and powerful organization should never be enough to protect you from justice I really hope that this reform makes a difference because I feel for the many many women who put themselves in harms way and are injured not by a roadside bomb or an insurgent but by the people who are labelled their comrades The idea that so many of these poor women have slipped through the cracks because a few primarily old powerful white men didnt want to recognize what was happening right under their noses and who were too proud or too hardened to go after the bastards sickens me They seem to think there is some shame in going after these rapists that its bad press for their institution or that it turns public opinion against soldiers Well news flash Prosecuting rapists doesnt sully the hands of the military Fostering rape by complicity by avoiding doing the obvious right thing makes you look a whole hell of a lot worse than simply confronting this very real very consequential issue head on,14,cdnhmc0,1ri13x,politics,new,22,8

balancedattack,I was reading an article on forbes the other day about how most people who become billionaires often come from a family of millionaires  I think there is something to be said for that  In college I volunteered at a high school where the kids had the mindset of Im going to be poor the rest of my life so nothing really matters  Its really sad and in almost every case comes from the mindset of the parent  Why better yourself if youre going to stay in the situation youre in  Its all about accessibility whether to a solid education money whatever and for the poor its just not there  So many people go from nothing to something that we really dont understand just how freaking incredible hard it is to do it  Thats why sports are so appealing as a way out  Its a level playing field like no other  In high school I went to a private school I learned that the same freshman book we were using for math was the same book the high school seniors were using at the local public high school  Think about thatno matter how hard they study theyre getting a freshman level high school education at over simplistic but you get the idea  Its sad but these are the opportunities the poor has  I hope we can figure out a way to raise the opportunity level of the poor without decreasing opportunities for the middle and wealthy class,2,cdo0sxx,1rj8ty,politics,new,12,10

Foresight,Ive always doubted how effective this would be as blackmail or a form of attack How would you release the data Surely any report on the viewing habits of the target of this kind of attack would raise big questions about how the information was obtained I would imagine as long as its nothing illegal the average person would be far more concerned with the side of the story where NSA spied on someones personal computer usage rather than what that person was into Besides as a victim you could always deny it and it would be very hard for someone to provide proof without damning themselves of what most would likely consider a much worse action In this story they were going after radical Muslims How would this even work as a plan to discredit The targets could just tell their followers that the NSA was fabricating everything how could you trust information from an organization thats effectively admitting to spying on people by the nature of releasing such information and the target could play up distrust of the US Hell why would the NSA even go through the hassle of collecting such information in the first place it would be easier to fabricate it and would have the exact same effect The target should just deny it and then the followers decide whether they believe the target or the NSA it doesnt really matter if the information is true or not,5,cdo4wzs,1rjtxe,politics,new,6,1

funchy,The whole premise of the article is based on what I think are very flawed opinions of welfare and food stamps Author writes Many welfare recipients are required to undergo drug testsIf employed professionals are able to fulfil their duties at work while also maintaining a recreational drug habit why should welfare recipients be treated differentlyIn many professions workers are tested for drugs doctors nurses any type of commercial driver equipment operator etc Any job where the employee handles or sells controlled pharmaceuticals eg pharmacist any job where worker controls equipment or vehicle that may harm others Security jobs  Jobs where applicant handles lots of cash Even working somewhere as mundane as home depot requires drug testing  In fact in the last year welfare recipients in Utah were found to test positive for illegal drugs at rates less than the national average This is more likely explained in one of two waysIt motived some people to give up recreational drugs  This is a win because if the person is in such dire straights to qualify for welfare they cant afford the luxury of recreational drugs    This is more money for them to spend  on essentials a win for their familyOr because people knew about the tests  those who preferred to use drugs made a choice of the drug recreation over government help  Perhaps they didnt need government help that much to begin withPerhaps the best example of the demeaning nature of the current welfare system  is SNAPAlcohol tobacco pet food and vitamins are only some of the products that those on food stamps cannot buy because the powers that be have determined that they know what is the best lifestyle for food stamp recipientsNo its not that a bureaucrat in some office somewhere is making more judgements on a person asking for government help  The author needs to look up what SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition  The program is designed to supplement the familys food   Alcohol and smokes are not a food   Food is a necessity  Beer and plastic cups and dog treats are not   How can you fault a food program when it was only meant for foodIf this is based on libertarianism what I admit I am confused on why wed push for higher taxation in order to make welfare and nutrition programs available to those who may not need it,3,cdomay5,1rkxmr,politics,new,5,2

FatMansRevenge,Im thoroughly irritated by the recall process in Colorado in generalIm part of Evie Hudaks district and the fact is that she needed only  petition signatures to initiate a recall vote while in her election she received over  votes in her favor  Her primary competitor also received more than  votes sourcehttpdatadenverpostcomelectionresultsstatesenateSo all a political opponent needs to do is successfully get the signatures of half of the people that voted for them on a petition and then force a lower turnout less representative election to go forth  The Daily Show did a segment on ithttpwwwthedailyshowcomwatchmonnovembernotsoangryvoters which is a pretty solid representation of what actually happened out hereNow with that said there were certainly some issues with Senator Hudak and some issues with how the gun control issues were debated and enacted  The other posters on this subject mentioned how the gun control bills were quickly moved through the legislature without giving a voice to everyone specifically those opposed to the bills  The outside influences on the subject turned it into a nationwide political move by our governor with him likely to try and make a move onto the national scene within the next few years  Finally the levels of control that were implemented in such a short order were very controversial and probably crossed the line in a state that tends to lean towards libertarian ideals on these types of subjectsThe other major problem is the perception of rural vs urban Colorado is growing  Colorado has a little over  million people in it  The Denver metro area has about  million people in it and while a few of the districts are comfortably right or major swing districts Senator Hudaks being one of them the Denver area tends to lean left while the rural areas are almost always very comfortably right  This creates a scenario where the conservative minority in the rural areas feel like theyre being governed by a bunch of people that dont care about their concerns and their ideals  The split is really troubling,12,cdoghxh,1rky3z,politics,new,8,-4

Drs,There is a huge misconception that the US budget is similar to a household budget a misconception that is pushed by people who want austerity But the US budget is actually nothing like a household budget and its scary how many people think it is Thats not to say we shouldnt try and cut back where we can but more importantly we should be looking for ways to invest in the future like education and infrastructure spending We used to build big infrastructure projects in times like this that not only spurred growth now but paid off for decades TVA Hoover Damn LA aqueduct highways subways but we do nothing like that now Then you look at education and it starts to get scary When we passed NAFTA everyone knew wed lose tons of jobs especially in manufacturing since one day it was not profitable to build factories in Mexico where you could pay workers a fraction of what they were paying workers then NAFTA passed and the next day it was enourmous lay profitable to build in Mexico We got some good things out of NAFTA but the whole key was wed be transitioning to a new economy which meant new skills were needed for millions so we were going to build up education spending to meet those needs that never happened Instead now to get those skills you either have to already be rich or willing to go a hundred thousand or so in debt That has to change On top of that we need to keep up about  growth to say the economy is doing good when was the last time we had  growth that wasnt really just a bubble Our complete lack on infrastructure spending is more concerning to pass to future generations than debt since at least that infrastructure can be used to spur growth and the same for education,25,cdp95g9,1rnia3,politics,new,64,39

harbison,Austrian economists claim you cant spend your way out of debt  Actually you can  Its call investment  You cant not spend your way to prosperity  Thats the only truthTo make this easy for the simpletons to understand lets use the household analogy  Say your household is  in debt  In order to get out if this debt you stop paying your car payment stop paying your bills you dont any investment in stocks or anything of significant return and you bury your cash in the backyard  How the hell are you ever supposed to pay down the debt Especially considering you lost your job because you no longer have a vehicle This is what Austrians want to do with our economys he debtNow as for spending your way out of debt lets use the same household example  You current have  in debt you net  a month but youre spending   You make ends meet by using credit borrowing money which is further increasing your debt  Common knowledge says that if you spend more on crap and junk you will never get out if debt  However if you were to borrow a loan of  to make an investment for simplicity say a paper route  Its costs you  of borrowed money to start this paper route but the original  investment enabled you to start this business that nets you  a week profit  After a short time that  is paid off and you are now making an extra  a month because YOU ORIGINALLY SPENT A BORROWED   THIS IS WHATS KNOWN AS INVESTMENTInvestment starts as SPENDING  Good investments generate returns eventually greater than the originally money spent  IT IS BY THIS CONCEPT THAT ALL BUSINESSES ORIGINATE  This is how you spend your way out if debt  ,7,cdp4l3s,1rnia3,politics,new,14,7

RedShirtedAss, But its a smart way to grow the economy because when people have more money in their pockets they spend it Where does this money come from Thin air No it comes from the companies that employ them  So a company has x amount of dollars budgeted towards minimum wage employees  Now that amount increases due to minimum wage increases  Which means they get less hours  Which means they will be exactly at the same place they were before or maybe a little bit better  ,9,cdp5tui,1rnjjb,politics,new,13,4
,Multiple studies have conclusively shown that minimum wage increases do not lead to higher prices Profit margins are more than high enough to cover small increases in wages Wages that are recouped through increased economic activityMinimum wage threads are always flooded with anecdotal evident and simplistic wageprice observations that are not supported by data The conservative wisdom about minimum wage is presented as being equally valid to the statistical studies that definitively show minimum wages increases do not create inflation Theres no reason as to why the current arguments against minimum wage increases should even be considered valid as they arent reflected in reality Arguments against minimum wage increases have more to do with protecting high profit margins than they do keep prices low Corporations will charge as much as they can regardless of what wages are to maximize profits keeping wages low is just another way to maximize profits ,10,cdp9z42,1rnjjb,politics,new,11,1

btruff,This article repeatedly interchanges the word denier with skeptic A denier will argue even in the face of overwhelming evidence They should be ridiculed A skeptic is open to an idea but not convinced I twice heard Dr Stephen Schneider Professor of Environmental Biology and Global Change at Stanford speak on this subject and each time he said skeptics are OK Skepticism is key to science and discovery There is plenty to be skeptical about still Models from ten years ago  predicted results that have not materialized I would have to wonder about anyone who says skepticism is absolutely wrong and Global Warming now Climate Change is absolutely for sure correct and decided,114,cdpd4cl,1ro8nt,politics,new,353,239
aradil,My biggest problem with this conversation is that no one ever mentions whether or not they are talking about anthropogenic climate change or not Presumably thats what this conversation is about There is a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is taking place and that climate change is largely related to the greenhouse effect which I was taught about in grade  in the mid s But in these conversations with conservatives its never mentioned I have spoken with folks who believe that there is a current change in climate including overall warming of the planet but arent convinced we have enough evidence to determine the cause  There are many of possible alternate explanations solar cycles natural atmospheric changes volcanoes etc The article discusses in the first paragraph a Democrat who has made statements about Republicans and others whogt say that the planet is not warming or if it is the warming isnt caused by human activityYet the study discussed in the article something that isnt mentioned until the summary of the article may have some problemsgt That term can also include people who acknowledge that climate change is occurring but dont believe its caused by humans Whitehouse is making a leap by suggesting that the League survey is a gauge of how all deniers are regarded by younger RepublicansSo what this means is that we as a group discussing this topic including the OP of this thread need to be clear what we are talking about And what we are talking about is anthropogenic climate changeOn the other hand I believe that whether or not climate change is occurring through anthropogenic means and is causing harm and suffering to fellow humans it is our responsibility to study research and act in any manner we can to prevent or at least mitigate it,16,cdpecip,1ro8nt,politics,new,64,48

arguingwithmymonkey,I have been reading a lot of articles about Blackstone  Just because they have deep pockets doesnt mean they know what they are doingThe idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous  They cant maintain those properties properly  Each house has its own set of unique issues because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves  The people who cooked up this plan should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes  Oversight would be easier the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently  For all we know the reason they didnt go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual propertiesRemember the part in Upton Sinclairs book The Jungle where the family rents to own a property that is in fact just badly built with a cess pool underneath  This is what is happening againAll they are creating are slums in neighborhoods destroying the true market value of properties and denying regular folk the opportunity to own a home,25,cdpkf6e,1rpgir,politics,new,65,40

ctjwa,Its not surprising that this article takes an antiinvestor stance and is chock full of misleading information  Its a slow day at work today so I thought Id write a few bullet points as I was reading through it Blackstone isnt owned by any of those banks listed  The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstones common stock ticker BX  The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund you own a portion of those BX shares which gets aggregated in that list  Not so evil The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter and safer  There are no more zero money down purchases  If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans then you cant also blame them for now not giving these loans  The besuited businessmen paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close  These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks or at large auctions  Not so evil  After buying the houses they are hiring property management companies contractors and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible within  days  Thats literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most  Blackstone isnt speculating on housing prices looking to quickly flip them or creating another housing bubble  The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties  These are all houses that already exist and they are simply fixing them back up and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way  Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now  They dont have  savings to put down they are probably living check to check  But their family and kids are used to living in a house in a neighborhood  They dont want to move into a  bedroom apartment building  Now Blackstone comes in and offers the opportunity to stay in a house with the same schools etc  This isnt predatory  People are paying rent but now they have the option to do so while living in a house  Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone they are in no hurry to flip them for profit because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them  The new boilers new roof and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability  Most leases are  years so there isnt constant turnover and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect    Eventually the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work See the recent IPO of SilverBaySBY  The company will continue to own and operate the homes pay income to shareholders and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do  The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multifamily apartment real estate investing  Not so evilUltimately this is actually making it easier for lower income people to live in homes  While renting they can continue to save and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budgetHopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what Blackstone and other institutional investors are doing rather than just shake their fists and yell Damn Wall Street Republicans and Obama  There was a lot of anecdotal malarkey at the end of the article which is where I stopped reading  ,8,cdpmyaf,1rpgir,politics,new,25,17

easwaran,Im a bit confused by this article Normally I like what I read in Mother Jones but this article doesnt really explain the systemic risk of rentbacked securities With both mortgagebacked securities and rentbacked securities if the foreclosure rate or vacancy rate go up in a coordinated way higher than the investors planned then supposedly safer tranches of the investment can get hit Lets assume that the investors are just as bad at evaluating the risks of these products this time as they were last time If the investment goes bad that means that some of the investors get to claim the collateral from the owner which means that title of the home transfers to a new company How does that evict anyone As I understand in most jurisdictions just because your landlord has sold the house doesnt mean that you have to move out and in fact the new owner normally has to allow you to stay as long as the existing lease lastsAs far as I can tell what these companies are doing is allowing ordinary people to keep living in houses even when ownership is out of reach or not desired The article seems to start from the premise that owning a home is a good or important thing but it seems to me that this is actually the attitude that led to past trouble more than securitization,0,cdpxvv1,1rpgir,politics,new,1,1
