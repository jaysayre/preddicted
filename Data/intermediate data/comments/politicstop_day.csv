frostyhumperdink,As a former resident Ill put in my two cents that Mitch will win his primary I personally dont care for him but hes brought in federal money where it counts for votes such as poverty areas of both Eastern and Western KY Keep in mind this is a state that reelected a Senator who once said he didnt read newspapers and was genuinely an absent public servant His fight with Grimes will be messier though The Governors implementation of ACA and the exchange has been a boon for the state and Grimes will ride that success I dont like Mitch but hes a really good politician and hell play up the fact that he was the one at the table with Reid to broker a deal Allinall its a sad state of affairs because KY needs someone who will be on the cutting edge in Congress The mainstays of coal and tobacco have run dry and they need new solutions to unfortunately old and maybe chronic problems of education healthcare energy industry and labor,0,cdpapwn,1rod5i,politics,top_day,2,2

ctjwa,Its not surprising that this article takes an antiinvestor stance and is chock full of misleading information  Its a slow day at work today so I thought Id write a few bullet points as I was reading through it Blackstone isnt owned by any of those banks listed  The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstones common stock ticker BX  The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund you own a portion of those BX shares which gets aggregated in that list  Not so evil The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter and safer  There are no more zero money down purchases  If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans then you cant also blame them for now not giving these loans  The besuited businessmen paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close  These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks or at large auctions  Not so evil  After buying the houses they are hiring property management companies contractors and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible within  days  Thats literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most  Blackstone isnt speculating on housing prices looking to quickly flip them or creating another housing bubble  The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties  These are all houses that already exist and they are simply fixing them back up and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way  Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now  They dont have  savings to put down they are probably living check to check  But their family and kids are used to living in a house in a neighborhood  They dont want to move into a  bedroom apartment building  Now Blackstone comes in and offers the opportunity to stay in a house with the same schools etc  This isnt predatory  People are paying rent but now they have the option to do so while living in a house  Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone they are in no hurry to flip them for profit because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them  The new boilers new roof and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability  Most leases are  years so there isnt constant turnover and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect    Eventually the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work See the recent IPO of SilverBaySBY  The company will continue to own and operate the homes pay income to shareholders and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do  The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multifamily apartment real estate investing  Not so evilUltimately this is actually making it easier for lower income people to live in homes  While renting they can continue to save and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budgetHopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what Blackstone and other institutional investors are doing rather than just shake their fists and yell Damn Wall Street Republicans and Obama  There was a lot of anecdotal malarkey at the end of the article which is where I stopped reading  ,8,cdpmyaf,1rpgir,politics,top_day,25,17

easwaran,Im a bit confused by this article Normally I like what I read in Mother Jones but this article doesnt really explain the systemic risk of rentbacked securities With both mortgagebacked securities and rentbacked securities if the foreclosure rate or vacancy rate go up in a coordinated way higher than the investors planned then supposedly safer tranches of the investment can get hit Lets assume that the investors are just as bad at evaluating the risks of these products this time as they were last time If the investment goes bad that means that some of the investors get to claim the collateral from the owner which means that title of the home transfers to a new company How does that evict anyone As I understand in most jurisdictions just because your landlord has sold the house doesnt mean that you have to move out and in fact the new owner normally has to allow you to stay as long as the existing lease lastsAs far as I can tell what these companies are doing is allowing ordinary people to keep living in houses even when ownership is out of reach or not desired The article seems to start from the premise that owning a home is a good or important thing but it seems to me that this is actually the attitude that led to past trouble more than securitization,0,cdpxvv1,1rpgir,politics,top_day,1,1
JZN,They should get a guy like Barney Frank to swear up and down that lenders are rock solid and that no trouble could ever come from a housing crash He could insist that anyone with a paper route income should own a home Then the fed could back the lenders  so that they are more  pressured to give faulty loans that no sane mortgage lender would ever approve otherwise That way they can bail them out  and theres zero risk on the lenders side  But what the hell I just made all that up Its just a greedy get richer quicker scheme cooked up by greedy CEOs who would throw your nana under a bus for a buck if they could get away with it amiright or what,4,cdpl5j7,1rpgir,politics,top_day,5,1
DnWeava,this has been going on for years  I used to work in code enforcement  in one of  the worst inner cities  in the US   everyone knows about how suburban  sprawl  and  white  flight  had  major  impacts  on inner  cities  but  something I  never  see  get talked  about  is  black  flight   we  are currently  seeing blacks  leaving  the  inner cities in record numbers for suburbs  for  the  lower  crime  rates and  better  schools this is leaving the  problem of when the  banks  have  been foreclosing  on tons  of inner city  homes  during  the  housing crisis  is that  there  was no demand  for  these  houses   Ive  seen houses sell  for kk USD   these banks  are seeing  that  many of these houses  can only  be sold  for k so they  are betting  that if they hold onto  these properties  for a  few  years  that  the  market  will recover  abd  they  will be able  to sell  the  houses  for k  for  example  to a  potential  homeowner  or flipper  who  will  still  need  to drop s  of  thousands  into  these  to make  them livable after  they  have sat vavant  for  years   the  copper  thieves  dont  take  long  to  figure  out  when a  house  is vacant  so most  inner  city  homes  owned  by  out  of  state  banks  are stripped of wiring ac coils pipes etc  that  can  be  sold as scrap because  these  banks  arent  investing  in any  security  my city  saw the  problem of the out  of town banks owning  these  properties  which  is they  are sitting unlivable killing land values even more  on  top  of  the  black  flight  that is already  wrecking  values  in these  areas  and they  have  quit  selling  homes taken  for  back  taxes  to out  of  area  owners   they  are  now  selling to locals who will renovate  the  properties and  they  are spending  more  on  demolishing  homes  because a vacant  lot  is better  than a  house  filed with crackheads   another  issue  that doesnt  get  talked about  is that  the inner  cities  are  becoming a  much  older  population  because of the black  flight  issue  so  when these older  home owners die  they  are leaving  nearly worthless  homes  to  their  kids  who have  left  for  the burbs  and  I  have  seen many  leave  the  house  to get  taken  back  by  the  bank  or  for  back  taxes   the  issue  is  very  complicated  but  unless  cities  can make  these  areas  more  desirable  then  the  problem isnt  going  to get  better,1,cdpml9w,1rpgir,politics,top_day,2,1

Rednblu,The whole Obama experience is a case study for training the next generation of PresidentsSummary items from the case study of the Obama experience include the following The purpose of the President is to get the people to do real work on their own problems When the people face their most important problems they will blame the President  That is their human nature you have to accept it have compassion with it and allow it to heckle you without repressioneven from your allies in front of the realtime news cameras The President must be able to maintain calm while the people rave against her I use the genderneutral pronoun here in the peoples attempt to avoid the disturbing upsetting and frightening work that they avoid doing on their important problemsthreatening and tough problems such as affordable healthcare fairness and public factfinding on fairness keeping the rogue nations contained while teaching everyone fairness     The President has to expect the people to Disapprove with vehemence against her genderneutral again when they as the moral children that they are become manipulated by the Presidents power and rulebending to have to face their own problems  You have to see Spielbergs Lincoln to see how the Disapproval with vehemence works repeatedly and expectedly and naturally Since the purpose of the President is to get the people to do real work on their own problems the reelection of the President becomes critical in getting the people to face individually their own overall set of problems  You have to see the Congressional voting in Spielbergs Lincoln to get itthe individual experience of being on the spot and having to decide Yes or No Accordingly American democracy would be greatly improved right now if Mr Obama as presidential candidate for  could force the people for a third time to face their own personal universe of problems and VoteUp or down The outcome of Mr Obamas third election would not matter  What matters for the success of democracy is getting the people to individually face as much as they are capable their own personal universe of problems and VoteUp or downI keep feeding into the Republican network when I can the following suggestions If you want to recall the Affordable Care Act then pass a Constitutional amendment to allow just Mr Obama and no President after him to run for a third term  The people if you are right will defeat Mr Obama and thereby empower you Republicans to dismantle what you think is an inefficient and ineffective approach to healthcare You Republicans have very effectively tagged all of the healthcare problem on Mr Obama  If you allow a successor Democrat to run in the next election you will have wasted all of your capital of having tagged all of the healthcare problem onto Mr Obamagt  Your best Republican shot at repealing all of the evil that you see is to put Mr Obama out there for a third time for the voters to express their Disapproval with vehemence  Look at it is an altar call God will do the rest  Have faith Hence you Republicans should propose and pass a Constitutional amendment to allow Mr Obama to run for a third time  Just think of all the wonderful coke money disinformation with which you can hook and turn those millennials that you need toward you for the continued prosperity of the Republican cause,2,cdpoop6,1rpvy7,politics,top_day,2,0

FractalPrism,FTAOfficers also have absolute power to order an individual to stay in the car or get out of the car he said If an individual disobeys an officers commands you have another violationAbsolute power is too muchPerhaps the officer was being retarded demanding paperwork but refusing to let the man retrieve it due to COP EGO,0,cdpv9cr,1rqasm,politics,top_day,1,1
Maxtrt,Getting out of your car during a traffic stop is a very dumb thing to do Refusing to get back into your car when ordered to do so is even dumber Hes a judge and he knows that getting out of the car is going to be considered threatening to police officers I think that the cops did the right thing by temporarily restraining him for his and their own safety  The only reason why he wasnt arrested and charged with a crime is because he was a judge  Im all about limiting police powers but I also think they have a right to protect themselves from someone who is being unruly and jeopardizing their safety,0,cdpyt4a,1rqasm,politics,top_day,1,1

leangoatbutter,If I got out of the car during a traffic stop I would most certainly be cuffed most likely detained and probably charged with disorderly conduct To be frank this does not seem like excessive force The facts probably meet somewhere closer towards the middle and as a judge he should have known that getting out of his car was foolish Also yeah if the cop sees a pill bottle hes gonna ask about drugs Thats part of his job Yes police do abuse their power It happens But the large majority of them are just out there to make sure people are safe,0,cdpz1cx,1rqasm,politics,top_day,1,1

caknucklesandwich,He refused the officers orders to stay and then get back in his car likely due to him believing hes above the law I can just hear him saying do you know who I am It sounds like they were justified in cuffing him for disobeying their orders The fact he was pulled over for the seatbelt is irrelevant and the article spins the officers actions as excessive based on why he originally got pulled over and not the way he acted afterwards,21,cdpsfiu,1rqasm,politics,top_day,15,-6

FortHouston,It is very doubtful that this complainer is the first person targeted with an audit due to criticisms of Obama CaresAlso this mans insurance claims are shady  Accordingly it is fair to discern that he may be shady about the reason he earned that auditFrom another sitegtHe later reveals that his old plan cost him about  and the one his insurance guy offered would cost him  a month with a  deductible However the most expensive Obamacare plan offered to individuals over  on the exchange for South Carolina is  a month for the most expensive Gold plan and Bronze plans in the state start at  a month Kelly didnt ask him but Mr Elliott might qualify for federal subsidies as well For example if he makes  a year that Bronze plan would be  mo less than what he was paying beforegtHe also said Now with Obamacare the man that Ive got looked into it they are not going to pay for pharmaceuticals or medical devicesgtBut under Obamacare both of those categories are mandated as essential health benefitsEither Mr Elliotts insurance man is giving him a bum steer or something is being lost in translation Ive tried to get in touch with Mr Elliott but have thus far been unsuccessfulhttpwwwmediaitecomtvfoxnewscancerpatientbillelliottdoesnthavetodie,2,cdprtqz,1rqbdd,politics,top_day,7,5
