CritterTeacher,I live near Dallas so it was a really big deal down here What was fascinating was that on Friday they played  hours of their original news coverage from that day It was so crazy to see how things had changed but there were things that were still the same as with modern disasters There was a lot of scrambling conflicting reports interviewing anyone they could find repeating previous coverage etc To be honest I think if it happened today the timeline for when news comes out that day would be very similar because of the difficulty of finding the whole story out of a chaotic situation,43,cdowwpt,1rmn5e,AskReddit,hot,223.0,180

kiley,People would mourn just the same as they did the original year  It would be on the news a whole lot more and the pictures of an assassinated president would be everywhere after one or two days  People would first conspire who did it  What would possibly be the same is that even with all the evidence in the world pinning it on one person this person will defend themselves or say it was someone else  No matter this person would have a target on their heads  They may not be killed right away like the original  And this time not only the shooter would be killed but several more would either be injured during the confrontation  Back then people didnt protect the guilty as much as today because our laws have changed  Plus audience would be in awe and think the president is still alive living a secluded life after an attempt on his life  It would kind of be like Tupac or that comedian guy Andy  Conspiracy only makes the heart grow colder,13,cdorxas,1rmn5e,AskReddit,hot,31.0,18

bito,Both of us were pretty religious so it was common in our circles to get married young partially because marriage meant sex and who wanted to wait for that We get married and my young  year old virgin self is more than excited Im finally gonna do it Well sparing the juicy details it just would not go in No mater how slow no matter how much lube penetration was like a brick wall For my beautiful wife it was like knives We expected pain being Virgins but not having sex the whole honeymoon I felt that A My wife needs to suck it up and get over it and it will get better  Or B something is wrong but I have no idea what Needless to say it was very awkward having friends joking high five me for the sex or pretend to everyone that our honeymoon was  sunny sexy and satisfying I tried to be a perfect husband never showing or directing my  frustration toward my wife Marriage is not abut sex but without it the bond sufferers immensely It was difficult to feel unattached to my wife after such a short time The fact that we could not have sex sent her into a depression Herself taking the blame for our suffering After a few months I decided to see if there are others like us the gynecologists we costed were incompetent telling her to just relax and to have more foreplay I became the master of foreplay during that year but like a dog who preformed tricks with no treat it became difficult Through my research I stumbled upon a condition called Vaginismus Basically its a physiological reaction where penetration or the anticipation of it causes the muscles of the vagina  to contract It is a common side effect among victims if sexual assault but also with what Im reading victims of über religious childhoods where sex is taboo My wife had been raised that sex before marriage was evil This training had physiologically manifested in vaginismus Long story short we soon started counseling physical therapy to allow her the ability to control her muscles better and bought dilators to incrementally allow her to take larger sizes Long story short this process took about  months In that time of a sexless marriage suffered but it allowed a challenge that forged a solid and life long bond in our relationship We are still immensely in love and now enjoy and very active sex life I cannot stress how important communication is in a relationship especially regarding sex We may have been young and stupid to get married so fast but Id do it again in a heart beat Love you babe TLDr got married young couldnt have sex All better  Now has the sex Edit thanks for the Gold Edit  httpyoutubelQlIhraqLo this is our anthem now ,4531,cdowobb,1rmw4j,AskReddit,hot,7418.0,2887

scnavi,He was abusive and controlling and just overall fucking insane  Like throwing a hissy fit in the grocery store because I wouldnt  buy him stuff to make iced tea insane  Now I look back and I should have seen the warning signs but you never think your husband is going to choke slam you on the kitchen floor for a disagreement over a chicken recipe  He also slept with one of my friends although I never confronted either of them about it because I didnt even give a shit and was ready to end my life at that point  Then he left me and it was fucking awesome It was the nicest thing hes ever done for me Edit Im just going explain the chicken and iced tea thing better since Im getting a lot of questions about it  I was making bacon and feta stuffed chicken for his mothers birthday and I was doing it wrong So he choke slammed me I wouldnt mind buying stuff to make iced tea but he got in his mind that he was going to make these incredible iced tea concoctions with gourmet tea bags and he wanted about  worth of tea bags  I suggested he just get the normal stuff and he flipped out  I was the only one working so we didnt have the money for it  But he flipped so hard I bought it for him and he tried making these tea creations ended up hating them and throwing them all out  Its just one of those examples that stuck out to me  We had a similar situation happen when he needed a chiminea and he broke the damn thing making a fire and getting drunk with his friends within the week  ,2369,cdovhhj,1rmw4j,AskReddit,hot,4935.0,2566

teehee,He is a completely different person around his very religious family He down talks about me to his family to make himself look better He hired his friend to ask my friends about any dirt they had on me He lies a lot He has anger issues has never been physically abusive just very angry Since his mother cleaned up after him he does not do it himself even now He is super self conscious He cries easily He hates me asking questions about his religion and gets pissed when I do He talks waaaaaay to much He acts dumb when he is confronted about things He spends money we dont have on things we dont need He snores newly developed He puts cigarette butts in his pocket and never empties them when laundry is done leaving a wonderful smell that makes the clothes need to be rewashed again He does not see the weirdness in having a conversation with anyone and everyone anywhere about things that do not need to be said to strangers like I really dont think this random person standing behind us in Walmart gives a flying fuck about how you were raised and how many cm dilated I am when I was pregnant Damn Why didnt I wait a bit longer Edit First I want to thank you all for the kind words and criticism I was initially trying to answer each comment but there are quite a lot to answer and more flooding in So I will try to address the repetitive questions  This was not my intention to have this blow up and get sympathy from anyone I seriously thought I was just listing things that I did not like about him that I found out about after we got married like the question asked Never did I think this was in any way really abusive relationship this marriage does not compare to the other things I had been through  just very bad personality traits  He is active duty military and Southern Baptist His name is not Jeremy  He is a somewhat hard worker He just isnt motivated much and constantly needs reassuring words and confidence boosters to get him to give everything his all He has become a great dad he was not at first he will admit that himself to people if the conversation comes up He was jealous of all the attention my daughter was getting with the cosleeping breastfeeding and colic baby Also I had some pretty bad anxiety that my child was going to die if I did not have someone watching her while I slept so I rarely slept but he often slept  hours a day Which I thought was fine because he couldnt do much anyways Or at least I thought so at the time anyways He is not allowed to spank hit or use any type of physical discipline with her This took a lot of talking about to get him to understand that the Bible is bullshit when it says spare the rod spoil the child I will not stand for biblical raising of our child She will not be going to church or be learning about religion unless she asks about it I do not want her to be scared into religion This is where his family and I have our issues  I do not have a separate account to put money in right now because I am not working right now Im getting a job next month And that is if his schedule allows me too if not I will be saving the extra money from my school loans before I was using the extra to help pay off his debt I thought I was being helpful  I am stupid for getting married so quickly and not seeing the red flags None of them were visible to me before We were great friends for over a year before we started dating and he seemed like the perfect man but then again I didnt have to great of men to compare them to other than my adoptive father  I am not staying with him to mooch off him I have been attempting every possibility to make this work Counseling therapy medication praying books etc I also am like his live in maid cook nanny masseuse laundry detail dog babysitter and handyman The only reason I started school and started looking for a career and to save up in case this marriage ended is because my best friend pointed out that I didnt seem happy She has known me and watched me through the years before meeting him and after pointing out things I do now that I didnt before She also went through a situation where she has two kids and her husband cheated on her and she had to leave him She had no way to provide but she had some family to help her She got through it I do have some that could help me but being it is on my biological fathers side I dont know how that would really go over As my biological father was not allowed to be a part of my life until I turned  after he gave up his rights when I was  I didnt see him but  times my whole life prior when asked to talk to him and find out more about him when I got older my mother kept reminding me that he wanted nothing to do with me and I can talk to him if I want when I turn  Plus my adoptive father is amazing but has done what you all have described not to do and thats stay with someone just for the kids Even though the situation is so shitty and I hate seeing my dad so miserable if my dad had not stuck around we would probably be in to popping pills and hanging out with drug dealing meth head family members like my mother I am not bringing my daughter around that as that environment is worse than mine I think  This isnt a newly developed thing me going to school and attempting to work Between moving across country three deployments my side of the family emergencies pregnancy and all the shit in between I have a been going through school I started a year before I was pregnant but took breaks during his deployments or during the summer Though once I got pregnant I made sure stayed in and kept at it I am being smart and preparing for the worse but hoping for the best and if things were to get better then I would have a career to help him pay off his debt or extra money to save for my daughter for school If anything were to happen I have several friends places I could go to here on base or all my family lives within a couple hours of here I have no issues with temporary help but nothing that would be for long term until I finish school  Everything I have listed I have confronted him about during or after the fact His acting different around family I tell him I find it to be unfair because I have to watch what I say in fear that his parents flip out on him for something I wasnt supposed to say He said I dont understand how his family is I seen him get the look for saying damn but have never gotten more than silence after I swear on accident My family we swear like sailors except my youngest sibling though he does let them slip around me when he plays GTA V but I dont care His talking down about me in front of his family to make him look better I think is this persona he tries to keep up he wants his family to be proud of him and think hes amazing and this innocent person I have confronted him about it after having our daughter he apologized and said he didnt realize he was doing it and havent been around him family again since then to see if it has indeed changed His asking dirt about me is Im guessing because he has been cheated on by past girlfriends I think thats what he had said when I confronted him on this His angry ways I think are from his parents tough love and whoopings as a child His parents never taught him how to cope with his anger or show him the right way too His excessive talking to strangers just makes me feel uncomfortable I am quiet and I keep to myself A friendly hello or nod or talking about how old my daughter is is perfectly fine But conversing about personal stuff to individuals while Im standing right there just makes me feel uncomfortable I have told him this He still does this Maybe its because he was raised in the south and I in the north Or because he has a loving relationship with a wide range of people from his church and I have been more of a stay out of my bubble kind of person His self consciousness seems to be because he was made fun of for being chubby when he was little by his cousins His crying is usually when confronted about something and he knows he was wrong and I always console him instead of stay angry at him Though he did cry once when our cat scratched him that I dont know So its not that I have not discussed these things with him and he isnt aware about them His lying has always been an issue and has not changed The only thing I feel is left is couples counseling to see if that works He is even aware of why Im going to school because if anything were to happen then I can provide He doesnt like the fact that that is my reasoning but maybe that will make him work harder to be a better human being knowing I can leave if he does anything that crosses the line The cigarette thing Just is frustrating I dont mind doing laundry Im happy to do it But to have to redo laundry because you can not empty your pockets in the garbage or throw them in an ash tray before you throw your stuff in the wash seems so simple to me Through it all I love this man for certain reasons that have kept me around but there are things that needs maturing and growing As I have things I need to change as well I am not perfect I know certain qualities he does not like about me such as being so forgiving this usually leads to problems for me especially with my mother I do not like doing the dishes I hate it but will do them eventually I like to shower with the lights off he hates it because he thinks I cant see I love skim milk he loves whole I buy skim instead I buy healthy shit to eat to help him lose weight without actually saying anything so he can feel better about himself he wants hot pockets microwave dinners and energy drinks on tap So even though this thread was meant to just be a part of the conversation I am thankful for all the advice and insight I have read everyone of your comments and am so grateful to have people help me with advice life stories and be TRUTHFUL with me I appreciate it more than you know Im sorry I didnt respond to each of your comments but the people that have sent individual messages to me I will reply to those Thank you for taking the time out of your day to share your thoughts and feelings with a complete stranger Im

paninius,He is about as empathic as a goldfish Last Monday I received the news an acquaintance of mine was murdered by her exboyfriend and her body was found by her young daughter the little girl I used to babysit His response What do you want me to say I dont know these people and I dont careI dont know why I even try EDIT To clarify He has met this woman in the past seen her a couple of times The last four of five years we hadnt kept contact I didnt expect him to cry or be overly emotional But he just sat there and stared at me blanklyIt kinda freaked me out EDIT  Ok I didnt expect this post to get this many responses and cause the controversy it  did Ive seen responses ranging from perfectly normal reaction to hes a sociopath RUN To make things even more clear I wasnt being hysterical or crying but I was upset and shocked about what had happened Whether or not my emotions were justified I feel he should have at least cared how I feel I didnt call SO any names or curse at him for his lack of response Im pretty sure SO isnt invested in a serious murder plot against me at the moment Go easy on me people Im a Reddit virgin  I sorta expected this post to get buriedEDIT  All rightThe reason I called the deceased woman an acquaintance is because technically she was more of a family friend than my personal friend someone I saw quite frequently when I still lived at home Shed come around for birthdays holidays and sometimes just for a quick cup of joe When I moved out of my parents house I didnt keep contact with her but my parents did Hence SO has seen said woman several times when we were first dating and a  perhaps two or three times after we moved in together I dont consider myself to be a dramaqueen however Im well aware that this will hardly convince anyone in here I dont plan on getting a divorce but I will admit that his lack of empathy or perhaps my overly emotional side is a thing that remains the biggest obstacle in our marriage I learned my lesson today dont talk about your personal life on the internet Thanks to all those that meant well in their advice and answers PS this became a much longer answer I anticipated in the beginning ,393,cdovg22,1rmw4j,AskReddit,hot,1529.0,1136

NuclearShadow,I didnt realize how greedy selfish and crazy my exwife was until I married her I guess it was always really there but I never really noticed  Anything from petty little things like  not saving anything for me  like junk food I rarely touched such and it would have likely always been hers anyways but she would devour junk food so fast because she didnt want to shareHer big spending sprees always were things just for her   Even after our son was born she would waste so much money on things we didnt need and junk she didnt even really want or use   Sometimes she would know that our son needed something  diapers baby food formula  and so on   She would come back  with everything but what our son needed  time and time again   She simply does not like spending money for any reason on others  Causing me to have to go out and get it  everytimeShe even neglected our son to the point where if she tried to put on a show and hold him in public or infront of friends or family our son would start screaming and want to go to me   She is a terrible mother that never played fed or changed him when he was baby and toddlerand now she has custody   Just recently she got into a car accident where my son should have been in a booster seat but wasnt and hit his head and had a minor injury   She doesnt care about him but rather just sees him as another possession that she most certainly doesnt want me to haveNaturally her selfish behavior has caused her to grow very obese now  when we were still married I remember one time she ate a entire  half gallon of icecream and then screamed from the top of her lungs at me blaming me for letting her eat it    She takes responsibility for nothing   she lies to the government about everything too and was recently in trouble with the IRS    but she also commits other types of welfare fraud such as selling food stamps  and lying about how much she makes to qualify for such programsIf I knew she was like this before I married her I would have neverI think she may very well be the only person on this planet that I can say that I actually hate   Not for her actions against me but because of how she is to our son,86,cdowp1a,1rmw4j,AskReddit,hot,406.0,320

MangusKhan,I am the youngest by far in my family and I only have older sisters My dads brother was a very successful and wealthy lawyer He got into heavy drug use and basically over the course of two years he was kicked out of the house and became insane He would call my dad on his birthday to tell him how much of a shitty brother he was my dad is an amazing man and this really hurt him Eventually he threatened the entire family I remember going to visit my grandma when something scary had happened the day before when we got there I could see that somebody had tried to ax their way into her house Im not sure why he didnt make it all the way into her house maybe she called the cops and he ran Either way she was okay My parents tried to soften the story a little bit for me because I was so young but I knew that my uncle was out there and wanted to kill us Skip to when I was  my dad got a corporate consulting job and was always leaving town for a week at a time on business trips He had a lot of guns and taught me how to use them clean them respect them etc I did a lot of shooting which was awesome He kept a couple of guns in my room he said it was because he didnt have room for them all in his closet He told me not to tell anybody they were there so I kept quiet about it I didnt think much of it He would talk a lot about if somebody came to the house and I thought I had to use a gun that I should worry about protecting the girls and not worry about getting into trouble not to hesitate while threatening while letting somebody get close etcEventually my uncle had killed himself The next day my dad took the guns out of my room Thats when I realized he had them there for me to protect the family at  years old This isnt something to talk about to the rest of the family EDIT   Thank you all for all of the replies I actually had no idea my post would get this much attention Honestly at the time it didnt seem like that big of a deal having guns in my room I grew up with them Ive always respected them and knew we had them mostly for play we would go to the range a lot but I also knew they were for protection My dad never specifically told me that I had a couple of them in my room because of my uncle And to answer some of your questions I do not know why he didnt get them to one of my sisters I honestly dont Perhaps its because I was never one to react in a fucked up situation I watched man jump off of the Golden Gate bridge when I was even younger than this we were walking across on a field trip with about  kids my mother was with us and instead of crying or freaking out like the other kids we were with I watched the mans body float in the water and I just remember thinking to myself and wondering what makes somebody want to kill themselves My mom didnt try to make me look away her and I eventually started doing our best to make my friends and the other kids feel better A short while later at home my dad pulled me aside and asked me about it and honestly I was never shaken up over it There are quite a few moments in my life where something fucked up happened and I kept my cool I honestly think my dads it is what it is and you do what you gotta do attitude rubbed off on me and maybe this is why he gave me the gunsOn another note I hope reddit is having a great Thanksgivikkah Today is Thanksgiving and the first day of Hanukkah which wont happen for another  years or so Cheers,7288,cdp09et,1rnbkc,AskReddit,hot,10365.0,3077

heynowhatsup,My family has a public image that is a pretty big sham Everyone thinks were a big happy family and everyone acts like it in a public sense In a certain corner of the internet my family is pretty well known so its a pretty public thingIn reality my childhood was pretty fucked up My Dad was verballyemotionally abusive and had severe anger issues He once whipped my brother with a belt because he was peeing too loud at night I would always get yelled at because I was typing too loud when I used the computer stuff like that He told my brother when he was  and me when I was  that he was too old for hugs I cannot remember the last time that my father told me that he loved me When I was  I was being sexually harassed at work My parents grounded me for  years The only thing they mentioned about my being sexually harassed was a snide comment from my mother implying that I was asking for it For those two years the slightest thing that happened was my fault in my fathers eyes And I got yelled at for it And honestly hes done that to every one of my siblings and the only time it was presented as an issue was when he did it to my mother He would accuse her of doing trivial things to mess with him Say leaving a door open and get really mad about it She would talk to em about it for hours every day and not saying anything to him about it and would say things like Im just hoping someone notices and says something to him about it This was all normal growing up My parents never expressed any other emotion other than my mother being submissive to whatever my father wanted and my father being angry A close family friend told me a story once about how admirable it was that my parents waited to get married instead of just getting married when my mom got pregnant with my brother and about the religious small village they lived in My brother was born when my mother was  and my parents met when she was  My mother lived in a city and my Dad lived in a village about an hour awayI found out when I was  that my brother and I have different birth fathers How I found out was my mother mentioned that her and my father had met  years ago and I stated But my brother is  She laughed in my face and said You didnt know No because NO ONE HAD EVER MENTIONED ITMy mother now complains that none of her children talk to her when something is wrong I said to her that its because they do not feel like they can talk to her because she is very dismissive My appendix ruptured a few years ago It got to the point that I blacked out for  hours because I was in so much pain from eating a half of a banana I told her I was going to go to the hospital and her response was If thats what you feel like you need to do and you cant mention anything even remotely involving feelings to my father because he will totally shut the conversation down Her response I thought our family was normal  My mother constantly and this was much worse when I was growing up complains about my younger sister to me because she will not actually ask my younger sister if something is wrong or talk to her about any issues she has She does this because she know Ill get pissed off enough to actually say something to my sister I told her that if she wanted to repair the relationship she has with my sister which is severely damaged she would have to start talking to her about her feelings Her response was But thats hard My parents both did not have good home lives growing up so they view mine and my siblings lives as Well you had it far better than we did growing up It hurts because I do know my parents love me and all my siblings but how we were raised was not normal Talking about feelings is now so difficult for me that I cannot do so without bursting into tears because it is that stressful for me I also have a very difficult time even putting my emotions into words because it was not something I was taught to do growing up I was taught that I am only allowed to feel the way my parents want me toAnd honestly everyone just sees us a great happy family Everyone has a pretty good sense of humour so were always joking my Moms super fun and everyone thinks shes great Not that she isnt but emotionally it isnt a good time If you say to her You havent called me in a year her response will be Well you didnt call me either every time If you point out something that needs to change she will always shift the blameEveryone things the family is picture perfect normal this and that But its really not I keep encouraging my parents to go to therapy because they really need it but they keep putting it off because they see no immediate issue Everyone comments about how well behaved smart funny great etc etc etc myself and my siblings are but like emotions are importantEdit And if my parents read this they would send me a stern email stating that I should talk to them directly instead of posting passive aggressive comments about them to the internet If I tried to tell them all of this they would dismiss me and tell me that I had a far better life growing up than I did Well two wrongs dont make a rightEdit  Theres also a history of schizophrenia on my fathers side of the family that no one talks about My Dad swears his father is schizophrenic and I have an uncle who has been diagnosed with it and a cousin who was diagnosed when he was  We do not speak to anyone from my fathers side of the family,171,cdp0llp,1rnbkc,AskReddit,hot,769.0,598

FlyingPurpleUnicorn,One of the biggest secrets is my younger brother Even early in his life my mom knew something was wrong with him He showed no remorse when he did something wrong and he only cared about himself When he turned about nine maybe he started abusing me and my mom It started with terrible emotional abuse that would cause everyone in the house to be miserable It got worse as he got older and he started becoming physically abusive We had dogs and one dog in particular I absolutely adored He would torture the dogs especially the one I loved He choked my dog in front of my face until I had to kick him so he let him go which broke my toe He would destroy any possession of mine I showed affection toward He would even hit or kick my mom and I in public He preferred kicking in the shins or punching in the stomach mostly because its easy to hide bruises in those places The abuse got so bad that I had to move into my aunts house for a while During that time my mom had him Baker Acted The absurd thing is he was able to manipulate them he was very good at that into think there was nothing wrong with him except a case of depression I was absolutely furious that these people couldnt see past the lies of a fourteen year old He was released and came home and I had to move back in to the house because of ridiculous shit despite not wanting to AT ALL Things went downhill from there and after a few months my mom was able to get him into a camp for troubled boys in a different state which I was overjoyed about After only three months there he had promised to stay a year as long as they payed him yes paid him he began getting violent and the camp said he couldnt stay there anymore this was a camp for troubled boys and yet they couldnt handle a troubled boy I told my mom I would not live with him anymore and if he came back I would move to Ohio to live with my other aunt My mom didnt want to live with him anymore either even if he was her son and told the camp he could not come home She had to stop taking their calls eventually because they were harassing her at work She got a message that they had put him into the foster care system She still emails with him sometimes All he does is ask her for money Weve talked to mental health professionals and theyve said he sounds like a narcissist with sociopathic tendencies Hes sixteen now and its a constant fear of mine that when he ages out of the system hes going to come and kill me and my momMy family refuses to talk about this When he was younger and we went to family gatherings he would act so bad he would make my mom cry No one would say anything except to make a comment to my mother about how terribly behaved he was which was obviously enormously helpful As he got older and I would have to run to my aunts house crying still no one would talk about it He even tried to kill me once holding me up against a wall and strangling me and would regularly threaten me with knives and his BB gun I asked if I should call the police and everyone said no it wasnt necessary it would be too dramatic When I moved into my aunts house I was severely depressed had generalized anxiety disorder OCD PTSD and a fear of men and was selfharming I was also seeing a therapist that believed she could see ghosts and was weening me off of my antidepressants without consulting my psychiatrist My aunt and uncles solution to this was that I needed to power through it and after a week of staying there told me I needed to get a job or I couldnt live there I was obviously not mentally stable enough to have a job so I was forced to move back into the house where I was being abused I have still not been able to forgive them for that When my mother decided that my brother couldnt come home EVERYONE in the family called my mom and asked her if that was really necessary and the right thing to do  The only people who were really helpful during that time were my aunt and uncle in Ohio who would talk with my mom on the phone about him and who offered me a place to stay when I needed it even if it was  or  states awayNow that hes gone everyone still talks about him like hes fine They ask hows Tyler even though it makes me visibly upset I think Ill always resent them for this and it makes me really sad,99,cdp141d,1rnbkc,AskReddit,hot,350.0,251

hqvlbw,My family is in the Chinese restaurant businessWe always encourage our customers to go back and eat more because we want our customers to be satisfied Its extremely difficult to make a profit in the restaurant business and with a buffet its pretty much impossible Where we make money is not from restricting the total amount of food any one person eats but by getting more customers in the door Part of that is making sure our customers are happy so they will come back again and again and bring their friendsThe average human stomach can only hold a certain amount of food A box purse or table however can hold MUCH more food We dont mind people filling their stomachs with food We do have a problem with people stealing food by trying to eat their fill and taking additional food home without paying for it or wasting food by piling their plates high and then leaving mounds of uneaten or partiallyeaten food on the table The deal is you pay one price to fill your stomach and thats it You do not get to take extra food home or waste food by leaving it on the table There isnt very much we can do about people who are disgusting pigs howeverA bigger problem than the total amount of food is the high value items like shrimp and other seafood and meat Some people who are very greedy and selfish like to pick out all the shrimp and other expensive ingredients We lose money on people like that They also tend to give us a hard time by complaining a lotThere are a lot of nice loyal customers but there are also a lot of assholes in this world Working in a restaurant you learn a lot about how greedy and selfish people are on the inside no matter how fancy they might be dressed or what kind of car they driveEdit There are a lot of people being defensive about picking through a buffet for choice morsels Is that your prerogative as the customer Yes please feel free to choose and eat what you like The point of a buffet is choice But there is such a thing as common courtesy and not being a greedy asshole who ruins everyone elses meal and deliberately tries to take advantage of a family business that works very hard just to get byMany people have a very selfish spoiled and entitled attitude when it comes to food I wish people just took a moment to think about how much effort went into their meal Plants and animals all over the world are harvested and slaughtered cleaned processed frozen refrigerated and put on planes barges and trucks They travel thousands of miles to get to the restaurant where hours and hours of manual labor are required to turn those ingredients into food When that food is put on a buffet it immediately starts to dry out andor turn cold Within a matter of minutes its less than ideal and people dont want it anymore even when its perfectly edible Customers complain that the food is old and start verbally abusing the restaurant workers demanding they bring out fresh food An insane amount of food is wasted every day because of peoples greed Operating a buffet is a gamble You put all your chips on the table and hope that you get something backOh and happy Thanksgiving If you had to cook a bunch of food on a deadline for a big demanding crowd today I hope you think about the people who have to do it every day,849,cdp6xyc,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,2609.0,1760

adyvee,Whenever my dad gets Chinese takeout at a buffet he shapes the food to conform to the styrofoam container and packs it all in and then also gets a separate small cup of beef and broccoli The cashierhostess always gives him an odd look when they see how heavy the container is We cook our own rice at home and just get the good stuff from the restaurant By doing that then for about  we can feed  people a family of four and then  more meals for whomever the next dayEdit wow some people got really worked up about this People take huge piles of food when dining in at a buffet stuff themselves into a coma and then waste what they cant eat off their plate Or as some people have mentioned they go just to eat only crab legs If a family wants to gorge on a huge meal with multiple trips into the line minus items like crab legs or steak then  bucks a person makes sense and the restaurant has already accounted for that Yet they can still get as much of the crab and steak that they want The square takeout container filled up but still easily shut could hold about as much of the typical fare lo mein sesame chicken mixed veggies  eggrolls that two adults dining in might get Not including the cup of beef and broccoli which was maybe another  I think No crab steak or desserts for us Since we just shared we each got a reasonablyportioned meal with a little variety and usually had leftovers for the next day None of it went to waste The tip jar at the front still got the  that would normally be given to the waiter,147,cdp69fl,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,596.0,449
samacerothstein,Casino executive here did an AMAhttpwwwredditcomrIAmAcommentsghoiamacasinoexecutiveama awhile backLots of good answers here but its really a function of what you eat not necessarily amount because food costs vary  lb of king crabs legs obviously costing a lot more than a pound of white rice A great strategy from a previous place of employment that Ive seen that works wonders in terms of making the buffet a lot of money is to have a high end signature item like snow crab but also make and emphasize really really goodhomemade high margin items like mashed potatoes soups salads and even fried chicken People get enamored and full with the homemade stuff so dont eat as much of the signature ie expensive itemIn that buffet we would average  pounds of snow crab per head where the average among our competitors was in the  pound range which is obviously very meaningful when snow crab runs pound ,79,cdp24gq,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,365.0,286

Philosopherknight,It seems like you are comparing this to the food you would buy at a grocery store But keep in mind a buffet is a restaurant Also keep in mind that you cant compare grocery store costs with those of a restaurant You also have to consider the amount of time it would take you to prepare the food yourself also consider the service other stuff you would need spices sauces oils etcBasically this is an uneven comparison The better method would be to compare a buffet with another restaurant of comparable class and style to the buffet Ie high end buffet with comparably high end restaurant or viceversaSo where I live a buffet dinner costs approx x that of a restaurant meal So I would need to eat over  meals worth of food at a traditional restaurant to get my moneys worth ,42,cdp6hto,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,158.0,116

ArcadeNational,I work in management for CiCis Pizza and have for about  years Ive worked with the company for  years Now the buffet in Columbus OH costs   with tax just for the buffet wo a drink which includes pizza pasta salad bread sticks amp dessert As a manager we look at a rack of  pizzas as  in sales It divides out to  dollars per entire pizza in sales of customers coming in So each slice is  If you just use simple arithmetic you come up with the number of  slices youll need to make it worth your while In an ideal situation the patron would get a smallmedium salad  or  slices of pizza and maybe  or  pieces of dessert depending on the size of the salad they chose That ideal patron would be eating a proper serving sized meal and would easily make their moneys worth by just eating the proper serving size since the higher cost of the desserts and the salad would equate out not having those other slices of pizza This unfortunately is NOT what people tend to do The vast majority of patrons who enter the restaurant tend to eat far more than what a proper serving size would suggest and easily get their moneys worth in their first run through the buffetAs others are mentioning we dont have a primary focus on making sure people minimize their food consumption while in the restaurant we make our bulk from the sheer amount of patrons that enter the restaurant and pay for a buffet and a drink The drink costs  so thats where we make some of the money also I would actually say its a horrible idea to tell somebody they cannot eat a certain amount of one or any food at an allyoucaneat buffet which all buffets are unless you pay for only certain portions of the buffet eg only buying a salad for  instead of the entire buffet and even then you can have as much as you can eat of the salad but only the salad bc thats what you paid forBuffets are actually great for value if you find the right ones Since I happen to be in the buffet business I get to see many other buffets and I realize that they are all drastically different from one another For instance Chinese or Asian buffets are great if they keep their food properly timed and replacethrow away the old food regardless of whether or not the food is running low There is a time limit for how long you should keep up crab legs and many places are lackadaisical in their upkeep with this time limit which can lead to stiff hard mushy soft crab meat depending on what their parameters were set to and how well they cooked it to begin with Restaurants that take pride in keeping their businesses clean stocked and fresh are the places to look out for because youll easily get your moneys worth by eating there CiCis for instance you can feed a family of   adults and  kids ages  for  which is a bargain since the food isnt of bad quality no Micheals Stake House quality but its better than pizza huts frozen dough Source used to work at pizza hut and its better than McDonalds pink goo chicken nuggets you can eat as much of it as you want and if you want you can eat a healthier portioned serving size This value isnt just for CiCis Pizza There are other buffets out there that are pretty great you just have to find the right onesI hope this has been some help,22,cdpa2v2,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,67.0,45
Ntrobunny,Finally something relevant to me I manage at a locally owned buffet in Winnipeg Manitoba and am in frequent contact with the financial aspects of the food Im by no means the accountant but I see the sales food cost etcWhen an average customer comes in to the restaurant i work at they pay  for dinner Of this about  goes to food costWhat is food cost Food cost is not only the money spent on food eaten but also the money spent on food that has been burntexpired or wasted when customers come in and take more than they eat The question you ask is a hard one to answer because im not sure if you want the amount necessary to eat your moneys worth of bulk food or if you want to eat enough for us to not make a profit Out main item is roast beef which is about lb if you want your moneys worth of roast youre looking at  pounds of raw meat or about  cookedAt this rate it seems like youre set to lose money until you consider the other costs involved Labour cost on a slow day can be above  due to the high cost involved in running and operating this style of business Our homemade soups and menu have our cooks there  hours before we even start serving With the cost of cleaning maintenance Water rent etc it quickly becomes clear how little we actually make per personIm going to ballpark it here but id estimate we make around  profit out of the cost charged to each person That being said you can get your moneys worth by simply eating  worth of food or   pounds of cooked roast beef It all depends on how you look at itSorry if I fail at grammar Im really tired today but i thought id try and fully answer youAnd by the way people going straight for the meat may end up filling you with more expensive food but is your moneys worth really considered by how much you cost us or how good your dining experience is Many of my favorite dishes at our buffet are low on meat or vegetarian even You dont need to hurt the business youre dining at to get your moneys worthTldr ask for a  pound hunk of raw meat and you should be good,6,cdp25df,1rneak,AskReddit,hot,50.0,44

serg,The thing people dont really understand about being a defense attorney is that its usually not some zero sumall or nothing situation Our job is to limit our clients liability to what the prosecution can actually prove rather than getting them off completely And if the prosecution has filed charges generally that means they are pretty comfortable that they have the evidence to support a conviction ,49,cdp5eua,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,324.0,275
CaisLaochach,Im a lawyer though not a criminal one but fuck it Im pissedThe purpose of a lawyer in criminal proceedings isnt really soley to prosecute or defend Instead in criminal proceedings the idea is that you need to ensure that the justice system functions fairly and efficientlyFor the prosecution this is relatively simple Prosecution barristers are required to bring to a jurys attention everything relevant that happened If thats enough to convict brilliant The job of a defense barrister is more to do with ensuring that the conduct of the authorities is acceptable In essence if you know a client is guilty you dont put forward positive defences instead you make sure that the prosecution can make their case fairly and within the confines of the laws of evidence Thus if confessions were obtained by illegal means or exhibits were tampered with you flag that Your job is to ensure the police or whatever are doing their jobs within the law And if that means a guilty client gets off then youve done your job And it means the investigating authorities will need to do theirs in the future,61,cdp96k5,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,307.0,246
FeeSimple,I had a client who sexually assaulted several boys in a prestigious Anglican boarding school where he was the boarding master  I wasnt a lawyer yet at the time but I worked on the defence case as a law clerk  The accused was acquitted of some charges but died of brain cancer just before the remaining cases went to trial  I initially felt neutral or indifferent about my firm acting for him but this one time I had to transcribe some police interview tapes and I listened to the accused say that he knew what he did was wrong but he didnt think his conduct was particularly serious or sinister  I also became very emotional when I drafted the Deed of Release for the settlement of one of the civil suits against himI was sexually assaulted myself for several years as a child and I resented the fact that I never brought the offender to justice or received criminal compensation for all my medical bills  Working on that defence case prompted me to make a formal complaint to the police about my own sexual assault  However I never carried through with it as I spiralled into severe depression after the police told me I had to wear a hidden microphone and approach the offender to elicit a confession from him before they could arrest and charge himI think much of my emotions was a projection of what happened to me personally  If I hadnt been a victim myself I would have been largely indifferent to acting for paedophiles  Like many others have said in this thread professionalism usually prevails  However a friend of mine is a Judges Associate in the District Court  He told me about a case where the parents of a yearold girl sexually abused her to the point where the front hole and the back hole tore and became just one big gaping hole  I am glad I dont practice criminal law,10,cdpahei,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,57.0,47
BackAlleyRockstar,Not a lawyer but it served on a multiple homicide jury and I talked to some of the defense attorneys after One said theyre psychopaths and it was hard for me not to cryregarding some intense testimony We had convicted on most charges and there was no awkwardness talking to them other than Id seen them most days for months and never spoken directly to themA friend who is a defense attorney has said its scary how easy it is to get his clients offThey are often doing a job Its an important part of the American justice system They are making sure their clients are competently and fairly represented,23,cdp5dn9,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,70.0,47
juicius,Im a criminal defense attorney Over last  years Ive handled some cases that involved extraordinarily heinous allegations But Ive never felt that I wanted to see them convicted Closest I got was being able to sleep soundly after a client got  years in prison because first off I worked my butt off and did everything I could have done and number two he did in fact committed the crimes I think I could rest easily if only the former was trueIn American justice system you have to understand that its a machine The prosecution the defense the judge we are all cogs in the machine Some may look bigger and more important but in the end the every part must work or nothing works And its a machine that is designed to spit out justice But if one part does not do its job then the product can be tainted Whatever results would not be justice because the machine designed for justice had malfunctionedMaybe the prosecution cheated Maybe the judge was biased Maybe the defense was lazy and incompetent Whatever and whoever the fault you do not get justice if that happens Of course I have limited power over the prosecution or the judge The only thing I can control is my own performance And my job is to vigorously defend the accused And thats exactly what I do trusting that the prosecution and the judge would do their job with exact same vigor and passion as I I keep an eye on them and I object and preserve the record if I feel theyre not doing their job but like I said my emphasis is doing the job Im tasked with to the best of my abilitySo if everyone does their job then whatever results is by definition justice Now its a bit idealized view of the process The machine is capable of errors even when all parts work correctly But the best guarantee of doing justice still lies with everyone doing their job to the best of their ability If you demur and fail to present the best defense then you have sabotaged the process and even if the accused is convicted for the crime he actually committed it still fell short of justice,6,cdpde8l,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,41.0,35

threalseymourskinner,Im a soon to be admitted lawyer so obviously I havent represented anybody although I have been lightly involved in a couple of cases involving pedophilesMy view is that the pressure of defending scumbags can only be handled up to a point Lawyers are no different then laypeople and are painfully aware of the impact they can have on the victims However they do what they do because they recognize that a fair society needs them This knowledge often isnt enough and many develop deep personal problems For instance recently in NZ our top criminal lawyer committed suicide He was a driven by his duty but compromised by the realities of his clients  This contributed to making him a deeply unhappy man So while its easy to point the finger at defence lawyers and label them as uncaring boogey men the truth is that they do care After all if they really were cunts then theyd be in commercial law ,0,cdptw8q,1rnwd0,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

cavalierhat,When I first started high school I chose to go to the same school as my primary school friends After starting though they decided that I wasnt cool anymore although I was still allowed to hang out with them I was mostly just teased and pushed around for the first few months but I didnt do anything about it because I was going through an insecure period where I believed everything they said about me Anyway a couple of months in we started hanging out with older druggie kids the ones that took meth and were always completely fucked out of their minds They scared me although I tried to stay cool The teasing continued mainly because I was getting good grades and getting along with my teaches Also teased for being ugly frequently which really sucked coming from older guys The clincher came when one of the druggies set off a few flares in the woods encircling our school They all thought it was hilarious but were immedietly busted by the Principal and a few of them got hauled in for questioning Im still not exactly sure how it started but someone got it into their head that I mustve told even though I had been with them the whole time This guy kept shouting that I was a grass and soon everyone was screaming at me Then the shoving started and they cornered me into a doorway I was being thrown around and punched my hair yanked at my glasses were taken away Random people started to join in and I ended up being mobbed by about  people I managed to get away and I ran to the nearest teachers office My English teacher was in there with  others and they pulled me in and locked me inside the building What scared the shit out of me though was that the building had glass doors so I could see everyone still screaming at the door trying to batter through it The teachers were just as scared as me and they had to call the police to calm everyone downAfter that the core mob got a talking to whilst I got sent to the school therapist and told to just avoid them Right because thats easy I had to catch a bus with most of them every day I was so depressed at this point and constantly being harassed everywhere I went that my parents pulled me out of school and I transferred to another one Luckily things went well for me there I learnt to defend myself and took it upon myself to stand up for anyone I saw being bullied I developed a bit of an anger problem and got into a lot of fights with random people being mean to younger kids but I made a lot of friends and it all settled down It still scares me though having had that many people attack me all at once for no real reason,10,cdp8scc,1rnzzb,AskReddit,hot,43.0,33

giegerwasright,When I was about  I asked my dad what it was like to be bald Hed been bald for as long as I could remember and I eventually figured out that meant that there was a pretty decent chance Id lose my hair eventually myself Of course it felt like a million years awayGieger its not so bad You are what you are What am I gonna do Get upset about it Ill tell you what though I can never trust a guy with a piece or implants Right off the bat hes lying to you Never trust anyone who puts that much effort into making you think theyre something they arentMy dad was an abusive drunk But he had semiregular moments of zen I think this was one of them A few years later my hairline started receding It was rough I was still young barely  but this one feature made me distinctively old While appearances are superficial blah blah blah its a pain in the ass to be winnowed down to like three options The crown The cueball The combover That seems to be it I guess a twin fin is an option but that makes staying employed difficult And all the looks except the cueball if youre Vin Diesel are rather ridiculous So Youre resigned No matter what a rather significant portion of your appearance is ultimately always going to be somewhat ridiculous and somewhat of a concession on your own part I actually bought Rogaine used it once and then tossed the rest outI have a lot of shit to do Obsessing over my hairline is only going to take time away from that So my dads advice has always returned to me when I got a little weepy bitch about it All that money for a pale immitation just doesnt seem to be worth the effort ,0,cdpbd2g,1ro2e2,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

OnlyMySofaPullsOut,When I was in college I was in a fraternity and we did a metric fuckton of drugs pretty much all day every day One friday night before a party I saw the joyous sight of a solid  zips of coke splayed out on our glass coffee table So me being an  ball a day user on my worst day at that time decided to chop out a fat gram finger thick line and get all up and fucked before we started drinkingI could feel my throat water in anticipation I rolled up a Jackson and had at itI remember it being much sticker and chalkier than cokeand it felt like the antithesis of cocaine And I could just feel shit sequentially booting downmy pupils let in a supernova full of light and then started to slowly dimRight then my buddy Kevin walked into the room I managed to muster What the fuck is this shit man As he looked at me with a mix of shock and horror Thats flip Fuck That was pretty much the last thing I remember as my windows on the world dissolved to pinholes and faded to black Flip being slang for china white heroin cut with  crystaline fentanyl aka  the same any way you flip it and its easy as fuck to flipI woke up kind of in a hypersweating mess about  minutes later after mL of Naloxone was pumped into me and every epipen in the house was emptied into my system Didnt feel right for about two days afterThe narcan had to be passed around as several brothers in the room began to pass out from the ambient fentanyl dust in the air Apparently this was set to be cut up amp portioned out in a vacuum in the chem lab after hours We basically had to wet down what was on the table and vent every window in the room to keep everyone from going limp Greatly truncated my drug consumption after that point You could call it a much needed moment of clarity Probably a good idea I have stopped all hard dabbling since only about  guys out of the  that were in my fraternity are still alive I graduated in ,1,cdpfxzn,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,5.0,4

Y,I have never not enjoyed a drug experience Im a lucky person no doubt The most physically trying was probably last weekend howeverFour of my friends and I were partying with these girls who only drank My friend and I are the only two interested in drugs and during the morning he called asking if I wanted coke in case the party got off the hook Obviously I did We had to sneak it because these were religious girls They walked in on us twice and we had to slam the door in their face so they didnt see lines of coke chilling on the bathroom counter Well these girls had no interest in us so we knew we werent getting any We stayed up until  am railing coke while everyone else was asleep I had a great night regardless of being celibate I am excited for my next time with coke this was my third time doing it but first time really feeling high off it But god damn was I tired,0,cdpcshf,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

eyeforgot,Ive had a few bad onesShrooms  Decided to dose when I found a clear stream  Got lost in the woods at night while tripping and being chased by gremlins and goblinsLSD Took a crap while tripping and throught I had shit my heart out as it was beating in the toilet  Took  years debating on whether or not to shove the heart back up my ass but before I did I finally realized that if it was my heart then I would already be dead  My beating heart then morphed back into a turd and I learned from that to ALWAYS take a dump before dosingKetamine  Drove about  hours while in the khole  I remember having an overhead perspective of driving home like in a video game  Dont know how the hell I didnt wreck or die on my way back  That ended me driving on anythingLSD x Broke my toe and smashed my face up while tripping  Acid amplifies pain so damn muchShrooms x  Brother got the shrooms and made the tea  I took first dose well first  doses as I drank a really potent batch  About  mins later my brother finds a few death caps in the bags and I go into a severe death trip  Trip that waves come crashing in I get buried in sand and dig myself out lived near the beach  I was stuck in a pseudo hell with my brother for umpteen years  Finally left and went to a friends house as my brother was being an asshole  Came back to the house the next day and my brother was gone and the stove burners were left on high  Was surprised the apt didnt catch on fire  This one was the one that caused me to say fuck drugs and stay soberThese were all in my early to mid s and im in my late s now and havent touched anything other than alcohol since  I still will not drive drunk as I learned my lesson,1,cdpdhvk,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,3.0,2

oneymck,Amsterdam  Two of my friends and I decided to purchase a few boxes of truffles to enjoy a lovely day in Vondelpark We ended up buying boxes of different types of truffles Mexicana Atlantis all to split evenly Anyway after eating g of the truffles washing it down with sprite which had turned brown due to the backwash of truffles All three of us sat for the first  mins had been smoking since that morning and had had nothing to eat After  mins of sitting We all decided to go back into Dam centre  something I wasnt too keen on why because its busy as shit and I didnt want to be tripping and avoiding cyclists every  seconds As soon as we started to walk a pain started occuring in my gums a stingy sizzling pain that made it feel like the pours in my mouth were bubbling also feeling as if my mouth was being pulled down from the inside As well as this my stomach was sore and I thought that this was going to be one of those eats truffles vomits waste of money story After another  mins of walking we got on a tram to find a cheap Turkish kebab place this is when everything went downhill There were no seats on the tram so I was left standing I felt uncomfortable on the tram and felt as if I needed to get off although I couldnt move my body and I felt nauseous The next thing I see is a big bright shinning sun and a clear blue sky until one of my friends comes into my POV and starts shaking me I then realised I had fainted and was lying face up on the tram floor shaking I got up off the tram shaking and drinking water having no idea of where we were and also having no idea of the visuals I just saw I dont think it can get any worse than giving the dutch another excuse to hate those tourists that come over and give drugs a bad name however fuck me truffles are shit I spent the next hour in a restaurant starring at a bowl of spaghetti I had ordered having no idea how I was going to eat it  ,0,cdpknew,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

bluepineapples,To preface I still smoke weed However I stopped for quite a long time because of a few experiences I had that shook me It wasnt anything too exciting but it was far from ordinary Normally when I smoke I relax open my mind up and have a lot of fun conversations even if theyre a little silly in the end But one evening I smoked up with my normal circle of four friends and it wasnt at all the same feeling The only way I can describe it wasempty I dont know how to describe to you this feeling of emptiness Its like not knowing who you are Instead you only know what you are supposed to do and you do only that You might know little things like your name and birthday but everything else is gone You wont know what is supposed to make you happy or sad Everything becomes a confusing experience that you wont know how to react to or if youre even supposed to react You wont know what you want to do or what you like so in the end you probably wont do anything at all  Its like never really waking up in the morning Instead that moment when you open your eyes but you dont yet have a reason to get up stays forever You havent yet accepted your surroundings You dont know if you just woke up in the middle of a jungle with a broken leg or if you are in a queen sized bed with unwashed sheets You dont know yet You havent thought at all yet You dont know what youre going to do today Youve just opened your eyesIts sort of like watching a movie Sometimes you are involved in the plot and the characters You might fall in love with a few of them empathize with a few of them You might genuinely laugh and genuinely cry and genuinely smile And yet in the end you still realize that youre just watching a movie and you have no part in what is happening Youre still just sitting there disconnected and apart from it all eating popcorn and gazing into the screen like an idiot with nothing better to do Its like when you have a conversation with someone but the talking has stopped You realize that things are about to get uncomfortable if you dont start talking again You are afraid of the potential silence but you havent reached a point where taking action is a sure idea Instead you stare afraid but unsure waiting until you can be sure That is what empty feels like I wouldnt talk to any of my friends I just watched the world pass me in a very melancholy way The worst part was that there was just nothing I could really do about it Even when I sobered up the lingering feeling of apathy was still there for quite some time It happened multiple times to the point where I stopped smoking all together because it was just not worth itI dont know if that really fits your idea of worst but there it is I smoke now and I do just fine and have great times The fear that those might come back is there though somewhere in the back of my headTldr Weed randomly made me feel incredibly emotionally numb and alone to the point where I couldnt function,0,cdpm9l5,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1
raditaz,The worst experience I had with drugs was when I gave them to someone elseA few weeks ago I was coming down off of an acid trip I mentioned it to one of my friends and she asked me if I could pick some up for her Of course being a good friend I agreed picked her up two hits same number I took and gave them to her while explaining the basics of psychedelics  you should be in a good mindset if your thinking turns sour then start concentrating on something else its just a drug itll wear off etc I also offered her a place to stay in case her roommate would freak out about her taking acid since my roommate was gone for the weekendSo she takes the two hits and we head up to my room I live in a dorm At first everythings going normally I put on some trance music dim the lights and shes laying in bed raving about how awesome it is once it kicked in Pretty standard Strangely though she started to not answer me when I talked to her just curled up in a ball staring at me with wide eyes and this creepy smile I excused myself for  minutes to go vape some bud with a friend I was still coming down and this pushed me back up a little I wanted to relate to how she was feeling and when I got back she was still in the same state I kept asking her what kind of music she wanted to listen to if she wanted to go outside etc and every once in awhile shed just say she wants to lay there Alright whatever shes feeling That went on for about the first  hours of the tripThen things started to turn to shit She started talking Very loudly She was actually yelling at me how hard she was tripping how I fucked her up forever how Ive damaged her but she was kind of laughing about it so I wasnt really sure how to take it But the whole time I was stressing the fact please PLEASE be quiet in here if people know youre tripping it wont be good I was shushing her and she would just laugh and keep yelling about how Ive got her tripping balls  About this time I started to realize how profoundly stupid it was to give someone acid for their first time in a dorm I had just taken acid for the first time in my friends apartment and I had an amazing time I took the same amount she did and I was socializing and listening to music and just having a blast So after this I figured I could give the same amount to her and shed be fine too There wasnt any room for scary visuals or anything because all that happened was some warping around and things looked like they were painted with watercolors My state of mind while completely different and surprising to me could still be handled If someone had asked me to be quiet I wouldve totally understood what they were saying so I was really fucking confused as to why she was acting like thisIn the middle of my pleading with her to quiet down I looked her in the eye and she SHRIEKS this bloodcurdling scream Honestly I was helpless I didnt know what to do but to keep stressing how quiet she needs to be right now This bitch is going to fucking get the cops called She started yelling louder YOUVE GOT ME TRIPPING BALLS YOUVE DAMAGED ME Etc etc she actually started accusing me of hurting her and hitting her at the top of her voice accompanied by occasional screams and whimpers She actually made it sound like I was trying to rape her which wasnt really a good way to avoid negative attention People were starting to peek their heads out their doors my friend from next door stopped by just to see what the fuck was going on I was trying to console her but she was flipping the fuck out I tried a few times taking her out of the room to get outside and away from people but whenever we got to the elevator she wouldnt get in like shed sit down and I couldnt drag her up into the elevator or push her in or anything Im freaking out now Im stuck with her and if someone called the police or something wed both be fucked So of course as we got back to my room my RA was waiting outside wanting to know what the hell was going on I told him that she was just freaking out but then I glanced at her hesitated and Im like yeah shes on drugs She took acid Look I said its going to be over soon we dont need to call the cops or anything Theres no need for that He helpfully let me know that the standard procedure was to call the police in situations like these He gave me a choice of either get her to shut up or get her out of here Throughout all of this shes saying unhelpful shit like YOUVE GOT ME TRIPPING BALLS shes not scared or anything shes just kind being a loud annoyance and I couldnt see her quieting down anytime in the near future So I said to my RA look man could you bring her back to her room then You dont need to call the cops the peak is about over she just needs somewhere to ride it out for half an hour or so He agrees calls the RA on duty explains whats up and that dude takes her down to the elevators and thats the last that I saw of her that nightBut the night wasnt over My friend who checked in earlier bursts into my room about  minutes later and says dude look out the window Of course out the window there are half a dozen cop cars and ambulances What the hell who called the police  minutes later there were three of them knocking on my door wanting answers They let me know that her roommate gave them my name saying she chilled at my room a lot Fantastic They clearly knew she took acid so I gave them the whole story minus me giving it to her saying I gave her a place to stay she started flipping out and screaming and an RA took her away Two of them were like okay okay and the other one was like yeahhhh This isnt adding up You mind if I take a look at your phone I gulped my phone My phone had her asking me to pick her up some acid and texts between me and my friend who I got it from They could probably bust all of us But if I said no theyd get pissed off and they probably had enough evidence or whatever to seize it from me I let them see just the texts between me and her and the cop was like yeah thats what I thought You know we could probably bust you for providing drugs to her but to be honest I dont really feel like doing that I let him search around my room a bit but obviously there was nothing to find They eventually gave me an ultimatum that either they could turn me over to student services and the school would deal with me or I could bust my friend who was also a student I told them yeah Im not comfortable with that and they said well ok then I think were done here They left and I never heard any word from the schoolIt was a pretty sobering experience Never had it been more obvious to me that drugs affect everyone differently Lesson learnedTLDR  got acid for a friend she flipped the fuck out cops were called they said theyd let the school deal with

thelesone,Im a light weight I smoke some stuff and drank some beer I remember vividly that at first it kind of did nothing and I wondered what the big deal was with pot and beerBut the next thing I remembered I woke up next to my girlfriend in our bed but the thing is when we had been smokin it was at a friends house Heres where it gets good I got really drunk and high at the same time and started laughing a lot apparently this is what I was told and then I complained that I had to pee but couldnt really get up so my girlfriend and her friend lead me to the toilet and they had to pull my pants down and sit me on the toilet I did manage to wipe myself though I guess After that I guess my girlfriend decided it was time to take me home not wanting me to do something I would regret or have me out when I was not really aware of what I was doing So it took her and her friend to walk me the whole block home After we got home my girlfriend decided I needed a shower She got me to sit on the toilet and handed me some water and advil but I couldnt drink the waterSo she got me undressed and turned around for a minute to turn the shower on when I ran outside completely naked screaming She turned around and tried to chase me but stopped at the door where I stood on her porch completely naked and saying I wanted to go visit her parents who live next door She coaxed me back inside though not before some college kid apparently saw me Once I was inside she got in the shower with me and washed me up including my hair got me out dried me off and carried me up the stairs and tucked me in She then studied for a test I was a bitch and she was an angel  worst experience ever Thank God she was there,1,cdpcmvl,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,1.0,0

KhazemiDuIkana,Never had a truly bad experience I once smoked a very huge blunt of chronic that was not only far danker than I was prepared for but also gave  me a weird unweedlike feeling trip ended up being OK in the end but one of my friends god damn The local legend of recklessness his bestest friend in the school he was transferred to for half of last year introduced him to smoking nutmeg after they smoked spice He had the worst trip ever and was actually clinically dead for half a minute,1,cdpdawd,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,2.0,1
lsdpoo,A couple of days ago I took two doses of CNBOMe I think around  micrograms with a few friends I had to take a shit when it was beginning to take effect and ended up peaking while dropping a deuce It was definitely an amazing experience Shitting while on a hallucinogen is very difficult but your bowels will experience true nirvana The bad part of this trip was the come down I had tripped on i the week before and the come down wasnt really that unpleasant but on twice dosage of c We did twice the amount that would be equal to the first dosage of i Say  micrograms of i  micrograms of c We did  micrograms of c shit got crazy I became incredibly paranoid about everything and everyone around me I managed to control myself and not blow a fucking gasket in front of anybody but when I made it home I started to develop a migraine Well you could call it a migraine Id prefer to call it  something repeatedly shanking my temples and forehead It lasted until I finally passed out hours later In that time my thought process changed from snorting a line of Ketamine to kill the pain didnt have any so no dice on that calling one of my friends to try to mooch one of their safety pills of them it was in the early hours of the morning they were probably awake but I didnt really want to mooch a Xanax off my friends as my paranoia also made me terrified to ask anything of anyone to calling my aunt who lives like a thousand miles away to calling my friend down the hall who probably wasnt there to calling the police to calling the fire department because they help people to calling an ambulance which made the most sense at this point to finally making some soup and not eating it because the microwave was annoying the fuck out of me Overall it was a very fun time but the comedown was my worst experience with drugs so farI do not do drugs very often and am not what you would call intelligent or good at grammar or literate,1,cdphv9k,1roooi,AskReddit,hot,1.0,0

dogscatsandahedgeh,I was dating a wonderful sweet guy and things were getting serious His parents seemed to be happy around me and were always smiling and courteous to me One night we were coming home from a couples night out just hanging out with friends at their house We were driving on some back roads and came to a blinking traffic light A pickup truck came out of nowhere ran the light and broadsided us The driver rolled his truck and was crushed by it We rolled our car and the roof on the passenger side collapsed I was driving and broke my jaw and tore two abdominal arteries and my intestine shattered my tibfib and broke my finger and thumb My boyfriend wasnt so lucky The right side of his head was crushed and he was comatose for two weeks We were both in the same hospital so I went to visit him at his room when he was waking up His parents acted very strange when I went to see him I got put into a rehab center to get back to walking and he got put into a head injury center Thats where the cruelty came in His parents would not let me see him or talk with him Month after month went by I would talk with his brother to find out how he was but could never see him or speak with him His mother asked me to testify for him for the lawsuit they were bringing against the bar The guy who hit us was drunk and he had  previous drunk driving tickets So they were suing the bar and they wanted me to testify about the accident but I couldnt remember what happened since I had had a concussion He couldnt remember either because his short term memory was gone And he couldnt remember me either He had lost all of the past year and I was in that year so he had no memory of me Perhaps if I had been able to see him after he woke up or been able to speak to him it might have stirred something but Ill never know Eventually they let me see him but we were just friends He was apologetic about it but he just couldnt feel what he used to and that was that A psychologist told me that they needed someone to blame for the accident and since I was driving they blamed me I was the only one they could blame since the other driver the drunk one was dead So I never saw him much after that and I just had to get over it all on my own We still talk about once a year I dont ever speak to his parents though I hope I never will again,0,cdpfgab,1rowu8,AskReddit,hot,9.0,9

mrchososo,From family experience of a coma post accident not medically induced my understanding that the idea of a coma as most of us think of it is wrong  It is not like it is binary ie you are in a coma or not  Rather there is a continuum that people are on and that can vary whilst they are in the coma ie get deeper or shallowerThis is best reflected by the Glasgow Coma ScalehttpswwwheadwayorgukglasgowcomascaleaspxThe other thing to consider about a patient gaining consciousness  and mentioned in some comments here  is the amount of drugs in the patient their other injuries which may make them incapacitated and simply being in ITU  ITU is a scary place if youre waking up confused in pain and cant move  There are a lot of machines making odd noises youve almost certainly got wires and tubes going into and coming out of you  And for a while your field of vision will be limited to what is immediately above your head or perhaps a bit more of the ceiling if you can move your neck  Your nurses may well be wearing masks and almost certainly everyone is wearing scrubs and aprons  I heard a story that one patient had a phobia of bananas after a time in ICU  Turned out it was because all they could see were the yellow aprons and they werent able to process what they were  their brain decided that it was walking bananas  Sounds amusing but indicative of real mental strain of ICUMy family member had very slim chances of survival let alone coming out of the coma but thank goodness they did  Im convinced that constant family presence talking to him and simply holding his hand helped I wish you all the best,3,cdpjzgp,1rowy0,AskReddit,hot,13.0,10

SpidersBreakfast,Im the middle of three so I have had some of the best and worst experiences but as I matured the relationship between the three of us remains strong When I was younger my older brother didnt really want to invite me to hang out with him and his friends and generally was the focus of my parents attention until my sister was born I strived to be the older and wiser sibling and try to share as much knowledge as I could with her even while I was still developing As we grew older my brother eventually moved to a different city while I was still around to look after my sister and show her how to prepare herself for high school as well as sharing some of my experiences so she knows not to make the same mistakes She is now an honours student I couldnt be more proud My brother comes back to visit time and again and hes working on strengthening his relationship with my sister as he can still provide guidance through her teenage years I moved to a different country so I wont be able to see her do a lot of her work but she shows it to me from time to time Siblings from a young age can be regarded as someone who steals the spotlight from you and spurring competition but it is really about learning from each other in a way that friends cant really do a bond that lasts a lifetime,0,cdph51s,1rp5cn,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2
Peevesie,A sibling is like the best friend you have been forced to have Like your parents put two people in a room for around  years and said Now be friends After about  years you cant wait to get away but miss each other when away You inexplicably defend and love this person in public about everything you may or may not like about them But in personal life you have plotted about a million ways of slowly torturously killing them Plus there are the day to the day things Its all the small things and nitpicky things about the other person which seem designed to make your life hell If you say anything you are raking up a fight So as long as it peaceful its ok if the block the bathroom and make you late for school and then brandy about that they are always on time COz he only has to bathe and put clothes and leave You have to do it after him and then plait your hair coz you are a girl and the stupid school rules need your hair plaited And your lateness is family legend that you will hear even when you are marriedBut he is also the guy who will threaten someone who he thinks is wrong for you and be all protective and come to your college past midnight to pick you up so that you dont have to take public transport at the creepy time despite having an early term paper the next day He would make the best food for you when your parents are awaylike restaurant quality teach you how not to die of starvation and messiness and then tell you helped to your parents He is the guy you have to tell everytime he is being inappropriate to other people call out when he is unfunny hypocritical insensitive and hateful and pray to the lord he doesnt end up on the streets when he is being irresponsibleI am a younger sister and have an elder brother though honestly I feel like the elder and mature one almost  of the time  And we lived in the same house till he was  and I  Now he moved to another citythank god and I live with my parents as its dreadfully close to my workplace and I am saving money for my masters degree,0,cdpj2dl,1rp5cn,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

singlesinyourarea,The Radiolab podcasts and shows from WNYC an NPR station They cover almost any topic imaginable from human understanding of regret to epidemiology to the history of sewage treatment to the mathematical amp life importance of loops They do all of this in an incredibly artistic and in depth way interweaving several story lines either anecdotal or factual always told by either experts or primary witnesses into whichever theme they are addressing in each show I say its artistic because they truly have an incredible mastery of intermingling sounds whether that be the spoken word or contextually relevant noises bird chirps and forest sounds for a show about birding general hospital noise in doctor interviews or incredible onomatopoeic pairings for all words like click and pop as well as editing segments together Their podcasts flow exactly like the human mind would while trying to grasp these varied topics the edits cutting away from experts for explanation as soon as things get confusing My takeaway each time is what seems like an experiential knowledge of each topic due to the depth and context provided and it never feels like someone just crammed a textbook into my head because it always sounds just like a very interesting story  Although not strictly a podcast most of the old episodes and podcasts can all be found online sorry for no link on phone ,0,cdpi23z,1rp841,AskReddit,hot,3.0,3

justkitten,Anime And all the things that came with it Id be voraciously eating up anything new that caught my eye and if I latched on to an anime Id go crazy looking for info  and trust me theres no shortage of stuff to dig up and read Official interviews online and offline Every single forum thread and blog post on the show Even subtle comments on animators blogs picked up from an unrelated ch thread It got to the point that I was structuring my life around realtime broadcasts so that as soon as it finished I could furiously refresh nicovideo to grab the latest unnamed LQ stream and load it in the minutes before it would get removedI did get some good things out of it I got a lot better at reading and writing Japanese communicating with other fans I learned a lot more about online culture in that time than I ever have since and I got a lot better at digital art too I had so much energyBut eventually life moved on and shit happened and I found myself wanting to run away from it all for a while so I latched on to some other interest Watched less and less anime eventually sticking only to ones I really absolutely wanted to watch until even they started to seem a bit silly The turning point was when I didnt visit my main forum haunt for a whole month as I had moved to another country The desire just never came back and when I moved into a house that had a low bandwidth cap I just stopped altogether On the other hand it ended up being a symptom of depression anhedonia so it was a bit shitty still even after getting better Ive never regained the interestIm kind of glad I did that because now its even easier to get completely caught up  staff twitter feeds legal streaming more direct marketing to Western audiences Its not like anime is bad per se far from it But I had been taking it too far and really blinkered myself,0,cdpj1cu,1rp8su,AskReddit,hot,10.0,10

ChesterHiggenbothum,I met my first love in college  She went to a different school in a different state but we made it work  We would visit each other call each other and talk online as much as possible  On breaks one of us would drive down and spend the break with the other person  We did that for three and a half years   It was the best relationship I ever had  We talked so much it felt like we knew everything about each otherDuring the summer before my senior year while I was spending the summer with her I proposed  She said yes which made me very happy obviously  We spent senior year planning our future together  I was going to go to law school in California she already had a job loned up writing for a magazine  We were planning the wedding  It was going to be an amazing lifeMy birthday is in April a month before graduation  I wanted her to visit me because Well it was my birthday  She said she was busy it was a long drive she wouldnt be able to stay long  Driving from North Carolina to Ohio is tough but she knew it was important to me so it was pretty easy to convince her She got into a car accident and died  It was late at night so Im not sure what happened  She might have fallen asleep or hit a wet patch  She was alone in the car and didnt hit anybody else but two people died that night  For all intents and purposes my life ended with hersIve been kinda drifting ever since it happened  Working part time jobs not really forming any relationships moving around a lot  I never went to law school  Ive been working on short stories and a novel  She wanted to be a writer so I guess I feel its my responsibility to write the stuff she never had a chance to write  I doubt I do her justiceI would do anything to have her back  I havent met anybody else that even compares even after a few years  People tell me that I need to get out there and meet new people that there are plenty of fish in the sea  But the ocean is empty without her  I would give up everything else for a life with her  No matter where I am or what Im doing or who Im with or what I have Id pick her    TLDR  This is the one story that I wont summarize  Edit  I know people hate this but thanks to everybody who gave me gold replied with kind words or shared stories of their own  I wasnt expecting so much response I dont have enough time to reply to everybody right now but Ive been reading all the comments  Ill try to reply to everybody eventually    And thank you to everybody who offered advice  Its nice to know that so many people care  Im working on building a new life and becoming a person that she would be proud of  Its taking time and Ill always miss her but I know that I can find happiness in the future    ,6793,cdpjpb9,1rpdk1,AskReddit,hot,9759.0,2966

QueenOfDumplings,Apologise with every fibre of my soul and attempt to explain only if it would help him heal I broke him I never meant to And every day Im sorry for my actions and hope that he has found true love and happiness Edit Thanks everyone for the advice and for sharing your own stories To give a bit more information This was nearly  years ago We were  at the time I was messed up and intent on throwing myself at a wall while he was a hard worker studious and serious I loved him and knew that one day I wanted to settle down with him but I also knew that I had to walk a long path of painful self discovery before I was ready for what he was offering I could have stayed with him but by doing so would have done more hurt in the long run It took me years to understand the level of damage I caused but there are three major things stopping me from contacting him to apologise  He doesnt want to know me He has blocked me on Facebook and has seen me on the street and changed directions to avoid me His name is very very common and therefore impossible to Googlestalk so I cant even post a letter to him While I dont believe in carrying unnecessary pain I fear that my desire to apologise is only to assuage my own guilt If I knew absolutely that he wanted or needed to hear it I would do everything I could to say it But for all I know he could be ok now and Id merely open old wounds Ive thought about this for a long time and I would give ten years of my life to see him to explain to tell him that Ive never found his equal that my love for him has never diminished But I am reconciled to living with this heaviness in my soul This burden is my own creation and I will continue to carry it for as long as I have to,250,cdpj3o0,1rpdk1,AskReddit,hot,1121.0,871

punkwalrus,Not an ex per se but everyone thought she was  She was my best friend in high school but we had a platonic relationship  Anyway our lives split apart after some shitty drama and we grew in different directions  I got married had a kid wrote a book and started to become famous in the scifi convention circuit  She got married to an abusive drug addict and became an alcoholic I didnt know this at the time  At the time I was with a burgeoning comedy group  It had been maybe  years since we last saw one anotherI was at a large science fiction convention  My wife came up to me and said Hey you know Mary is hereMary who  Mary is not her real name but her name was really commonYour old best friend Mary  The group had heard about Mary and how our friendship ended  Most assumed she had a crush on me and thats what led to the end of our friendship  I disagreed but whatever  The end of our friendship was superdramatic and so they just had to meet this personKeep in mind this is a comedy group made of collegeaged peopleIf I had to do it all over again I would have denied it was her  Instead I was stupid and insensitive and we stalked her for a good  minutes  She got this sense we were doing so and double backed on us  She did not look good  She was going through this alcoholic I am channeling the Joker phase in her life again I was not aware at the time  But all I saw with this former friend of mine in a ridiculous jacket a teeshirt showing the Joker and bad stage makeup  She kind of looked like a Comiccon nerd and a JuggaloOne of our directors said a little too loudly YOU used to date THAT  And an entire group of comedic professionals just pointed and nearly collapsed in laughterI immediately regretted this moment  One because she was my best friend and deserved better treatment than a group of strangers pointing at her and laughing  Two some of the insults the writers had were funny enough for me to not laugh which I hated every fiber of my being for doing  Three I had a punkgoth past of my own they didnt know about and I felt insulted  And Mary  Just stood there  She must have been in immense anger embarrassment and pain and all she probably wanted to do was attend this scifi convention in peaceI felt bad the rest of the weekend and weeks afterwards cringing at the memory  Some six years later I found her on Usenet and apologized  She thanked me and told me what she had been going through at the time  I still regret being part of what was essential juniorhigh behavior  I am better than that,0,cdpmp2z,1rpfta,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

muchtoomuchtoomuch,I am not a pilot myself But I once met a sweaty guy in an Indian restaurant in Panama who claimed that he used to be one After a few decent drinks he told me the following storyMany years ago he was the captain of a transpacific flight from Honolulu to Kuala Lumpur The plane was packed with people and the air was thick and sweaty Smoking was still allowed in those days The takeoff and everything thereafter had gone well enough but something apparently did not feel quite right to him After they had reached cruising altitude he handed over control of the plane to his copilot and then left the cockpit to make the rounds and greet the passengers and to reassure himself that everything was proper and the way it was supposed to The passengers were the usual bunch for this route There were sticky guys in tacky Hawaiian shirts stressed families with rummaging kids sleeping old people slightly frightened looking young people and about the usual amount of men in suits not really doing anything But this sight did not calm the pilot The people looked wrong and they terrified him They all seemed to him to be empty shells imitators He just knew And because he knew he was in danger He halfexpected them all to fall quiet and stare at him blankly at any moment And indeed out of the corner of his eye he saw them drop their facade He saw the faces of laughing people fall blank the eyes of sleeping people open and those of children pierce him sharply reading his thoughts He was sure Of course as soon as he looked at them straight on they had their masks back up and looked and acted perfectly normal But no matter he rushed back towards the cockpit nearly stumbling He entered slammed the door shut and without a word took over control of the aircraft and began to figure out the best way to crash the plane into the ocean without his crew being able to interfere at least before it was too late to stop himIn the end he did not do it obviously The thought of dying in close proximity to these things terrified him too much He brought the plane safely to Kuala Lumpur disappeared into the city and got drunker than hed ever been The passengers never knew,3,cdpl8b6,1rpkzy,AskReddit,hot,8.0,5

Truggles,The Collector Hands down one of the best movies Ive seen ever The dark music suspense and the way they manipulate the saturation to emphasize certain scenes The movie had a touch of goth with its music selection which made it even better since death and sadness and all those negative emotions have a niche in goth Id recommend it if youre into horror suspense The sequel didnt live up to the expectations I had however ,0,cdpkd5q,1rpl3f,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

copiestopresponse,Mine is a little unorthodoxI worked at a corn stand It was an old Chevy pickup with a large overhang built onto the back that got loaded up with corn and I sat by it and sold it all day for  an hour which was pretty awesome for someone still in high school The selling part wasnt all that bad I typically just brought a book and read between customers and it taught me how to be really fast at returning changeThe shitty part was GETTING the corn We didnt actually grow it in the area where we were selling it so I had to drive two hours to get the corn and I had to drive my boss rickety old pickup truck that should have never passed inspection That or an old Chrysler minivan that had no suspension left at allThe first time I went down I went down with someone more experienced than me We had to pick up  bushels of corn I dont know if youve ever seen a bushel of corn but its a lot of fucking corn and we had to stuff  of them into two small vehicles It was WAY more corn than we should have been carrying and was blatantly illegalMe being an idiot didnt just say no fuck this and go home I actually did the job So I filled a van with something like  to  bushels of corn and had to make the two hour trip back north in a van so full of corn that it was nearly bottomed out I couldnt see out the back I couldnt see out of the passengers side I had corn in my lap and I was holding up corn with my right arm so it wouldnt fall over on top of meNow this would have been fine on a back road But I had to drive this monstrosity on a four lane highway through tollbooths during rush hour traffic and I wasnt really sure on the correct route to go So I was following my fellow employee in the pickup when they get pulled over in front of me by the police due to the CLEARLY illegal amounts of weight they are carrying We had talked before hand and the strategy for if this happened was Just keep going cause youll get a ticket tooSo heres young naive me with a van full of corn on a four lane highway trying to somehow not kill myself In order to stop I would need at least a thousand feet as there was literally TONS of corn in the van And I had to switch and merge lanes by blind hope as I couldnt actually see where the hell anything was with all the corn I had in the vanI spent the next twoandahalf hours in blind terror the whole time The van was slow as shit and any bumps I hit at all would cause a horrific grinding noise followed by sparks shooting out the back I could see from the drivers side mirror onlyThe worst part I was dumb enough to do this for FOUR MONTHS I dont know how I never got a ticket after all the illegal shit I did to get fucking CORN to where it needed to goTLDR Was an illegal corn hauler,3,cdplwpa,1rpn7n,AskReddit,hot,3.0,0

GateKeeperKeyMaster,I called  on my parents and it was the best decision for our family that I ever made My parents would often fight My dad had a terrible temper and my mom was an alcoholic Nothing physical ever happened but the verbal abuse between these two was insane My mom would drink become incredibly irrational which would trigger my dads temper and the yelling would start When I was about  I had enough It was almost midnight and they were screaming at each other through the hallways I asked them to stop and they would for a few minutes and then my mom would slur something at my dad and the fighting would escalate again Well I decided if they werent going to listen to me then I would call someone who would and I dialed  The police arrived made sure I was okay then pulled my parents aside The officer that spoke with them was incredible He asked them if they knew what kind of impact this was having on me that I was willing to call the police My parents broke down in tears and apologized profusely The officer calmed them down spoke with them a bit more made sure I was okay and then left They came into my room hugged me and apologized My mom stopped drinking any form of hard liquor from then on She absolutely refuses to have the stuff in the house My dad has since learned to better control his temper but he does let it get to the best of him from time to time Instead of blowing up he leaves the situation calms down and returns in a better frame of mind My parents used to talk about divorce quite often when I was that age but the topic has never been brought up since that night Were closer than ever and I am incredibly glad I did what I didEDIT Typo,4985,cdplts9,1rport,AskReddit,hot,8058.0,3073

brocolicookies,Not my favorite thing to talk about but here it goesJune th  I got a call from my girlfriend at about midnight I was asleep at the time but my dogs had woken me up to go outside at about  I see a missed call from her and a voice mail  I checked it and all she said was you should come over you should come over  I called her back it was weird because it was her work phone and not her personal number  After a few failed attempts I finally got ahold of her  She was a mess emotionally floored  The only things I remember her saying was im tired and I just cant do it anymore im too tired  Finally the conversation came to a point where I had to ask if she was going to hurt herself or someone else between screams and heavy breathing she refused to answer it  I finally gave her an ultimatum and said I have to call the police if you dont answer me  She then said the last things I would ever hear from her Im sorry brocolicookies I love you more than anything but I just cant do this anymore  She then hung up and never answered again  I knew she had some issues with suicide in her past but she had not had any episodes for quite a long time  I then called  and heres where the story went from sad to excruciating  I live in a town thats a bit behind the times I talked to the  operator and told them everything and that police needed to be there asap I told them she owned a gunShe was a small woman and the town was known for assaults  They then began to tell me that they couldnt find the address well actually they couldnt find the street on their map  They then began to tell me that she lived in another town and they were sending the state police out there  I begged and pleaded with them to meet me somewhere and I could show them where she lived  The operator refuted what I said and hung up  I then called the state police because they said that they sent state troopers out there  I finally got through to someone and had to explain where the street was  After about  hours after my initial call to  the police finally figured out where the street was  I ended up having to be on the phone with the trooper and explain to him how to get there  Youd think that it ends here but no  I finally hung up and paced back and forth sat at my computer and ended up falling asleep on my desk for about  hours  The officer went in the house and found her cut up and barely breathing in her bath tub note I did inform the officer that she owned a gun  He went outside of the house to call for an ambulance  After he goes back in she had the gun to her chest  After about  hours of negotiation she chose to end her life on the morning of june th   I ended up driving over there at about  because I couldnt get ahold of anybody  I was then pulled aside for questioning and finally heard the words We were unable to help her  The whole ordeal was one of the most painful things I have had to go through and I feel like I handled it poorly  Not a day goes by wishing that I just went over not a single day  tldr  Girlfriend was suicidal called  and they couldnt find the street she lived on  hours later they found her barely alive but forgot there was a gun in the house  Went outside to call for an ambulance  She grabbed the gun when they called  She ended up dying later after negotiations failed Thank you for the gold and thank you for all the supportive commentspms  I hope this can bring people to take part in raising awareness of suicide prevention   ,328,cdplz5k,1rport,AskReddit,hot,1613.0,1285

Studentem,This happened in the NetherlandsOn a cold January night I was waiting at the buss stop and saw a very drunk old man making his way along the canal walking next to his bike It looked funny until all of a sudden the man was gone Next thing I saw was a nearby guy dropping his bag and running down the bank so I made my way over there fearing the man was lying in the water This was late at night in early January which meant he wouldnt last long Turned out he rolled down the bank and had fallen into the water He was too drunk to swim or even properly notice what was going on and just moving his arms around a bit His clothes were completely soaked and he was also quite fat all of which pulled him down and his drunk movements only caused the top of his bald head to pop above the water every now and then By now there were  of us and one guy managed to grab a hold of the old man With all our might we tried pulling him out of the water along the steep bank of the canal old fat men in soaked winter clothes weigh quite a bit After me slipping which almost caused the five of us to fall into the canal we managed to drag him all the way up back to the road At this point I figured itd be best if this guy went to the hospital though he was determined to go home though fortunately too drunk for that So thats when I called  which is the Dutch equivalent of  and the guy was picked up by an ambulance after being laughed at by the police who also showed up they were clearly bored and happy to have something to do on their nightly patrol Such is life in Holland ,90,cdpm6rh,1rport,AskReddit,hot,569.0,479

McDoogleSnatch,America comedy has been on the decline for decades  Perhaps a defining catalyst was American Pie a film that aimed to get laughs not by demonstrating wit or cleverness but by shocking gratuity  At this point the downward slope of American comedy had finally found its core audience  dumb male teenagersBritish comedy on the other hand is still for adults  It prides itself on knowledge of the world an appreciation of the absurd and the simple pleasures of a pun  A panel show like IQ or Nine out of Ten Cats would never work in America because its subject matter is too refined  Monty Python is the gold standard of all things funny and American comedy has given up any attempt to meet or exceed that standard  The Brits however are still holding true to it,3,cdpm0sv,1rpp7t,AskReddit,hot,1.0,-2

ramonycajones,Disclaimer I like video games I play video games I can play them all day My biggest thing though is that I like stories and video games are usually incredibly inefficient at communicating stories compared to movies or books You can spend a hundred hours on an RPG to get a story that couldve taken maybe  or  hours in movie form Thats the main reason I think theyre a waste of timeMeanwhile a lot of games are not about story and are just about fun I like that angle mostly when it comes to playing CoD or Super Smash Bros with friends or whatever but if I play by myself then I feel like I havent gained anything at the end of it I managed to be mildly amused for  hours but I havent learned anything storywise and I havent built up any social connections At least if I wasted my time watching movies or TV Id learn about pop culture writing whatever whereas replaying a game doesnt give you any new information Thats my thing Im not gonna judge anyone on playing tons of video games because its not like I use my time efficiently anyway but I do feel for myself that when I play video games Im committing to wasting that timeEdit Also OP try to come at this with a little less bias People who assume and Why do you believe implies that no one could think video games are a waste of time if they knew what they were talking about The phrasing of the question is as if youre asking about people who think aliens rule the Earth ,0,cdplux9,1rppcd,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

EpsilonSigma,Not knowing about death I remember vividly the day I lost my innocence Before that day I was careless and without responsibility as is any other child My only grandparent I knew died when I was  from lung cancer That day when my mother picked me up from my babysitters she turns to me to let me know that nana passed away I just put my head down to show I was sad but on the inside I didnt really care I just wanted to get home and watch tv I loved my grandmother of course but I didnt really understand what had happened but one day I did I was laying in bed trying to go to sleep at around  years old Our house is next to some train tracks so you can always hear when one goes by Its about  Im laying there and a train goes by Not much out of the ordinary so I just ignore it Trains go by all the time But there was something about this one time Was it the darkness The silence The fact that my mind was empty and had room to wander Whatever the case a thought manifested A simple thoughtWhat if that train just derailed and crashed into our house killing meIt didnt have a huge impact at first but as the minutes went by I thought more and more about it If that train derailed right now and crashed into this house Id die I wouldnt come back Everything would go black and I wouldnt exist anymore The next  minutes consisted of laying in my bed on the verge of tears until I couldnt take it anymore I got up and went to my parents room They were still up watching TV I stood in the doorway with my blanket tears streaming down my face My mother asked my what was wrong and I just broke down I ran over to her and jumped in her arms and cried Hard She my mother asked what was wrong I just looked up at her sobbing harder than I ever had up to that point and said I know Im going to have to die someday and there is nothing I can do about it She realized what had just happened told my father and I just laid there sobbing for a good  more minutes By the end I had calmed down I got up and my mother tucked me back into bedFrom that day on I was a different personTLDR  Laying in bed when a train goes by Realize if it crashed into my house I would die and never come back  minutes of hardcore crying,15,cdpmj31,1rpqi4,AskReddit,hot,73.0,58

YesButNoWaitYes,I havent had Facebook in years Im  I had it all through college back when it was pretty much still just college students and used it for the standard shameful and embarrassing college purposes Good times After college I just got tired of it Its nice to keep up with people I know who live far away but do I really know them anymore if I just see pictures of their new lives and comment on things I should also note that Im not close with my extended family so thats out I also dont like the idea that I should be responsible for knowing someones big news before they tell me because I should read about it online And I dont want to feel like I need to curate this scrapbook style version of my life I have a perfectly happy and active social life without Facebook My friends make fun of me for it but Im not losing touch with important people over it,4,cdponh5,1rptuu,AskReddit,hot,29.0,25

hipechik,Several reasons Resented people uploading and tagging images of me without my permission Realized exclassmates were only friending me to raise friend count or to see my profile page  Started getting bizarre friending requests from people who were tangentially connected to me friend of a friends mothers sisters best friends cousin twice removed Seemed like Facebook was all about people showing off the fact that theyre married and have kids  Realized that if I wasnt careful I could wind up leaving a cyber trail of all my online exploits and comments,1,cdpp8rn,1rptuu,AskReddit,hot,20.0,19

sts,I was years late to the party but I finally gave in thinking it might be useful I had hoped it would be something like reddit except with people I knew Its actually just a lot of vague whining misinformed soapbox rants and pictures of mundane shit Also old bottom of the barrel memes Basically nobody ever posted anything that was interesting to me and nobody seemed to be interested in the stuff I posted Im sure its useful if you want to keep up with when your friends childrens birthdays are and things of that sort But I dont care about the details of peoples lives So it was kind of frustrating to see it used in such a lame way and after too many daily facepalms I decided Id rather not see any of it and go back to my blissful cocooned ignorance about the acquaintances in my life I think I had it for about  months before I said no mastldr  its about people not ideas,3,cdpovjk,1rptuu,AskReddit,hot,20.0,17
magialleaves,I read somewhere that people who spend over an hour on facebook are  more likely to have feelings of depressionIt makes sense i dont need a study to tell me that Its like you look at everyone youve ever been associated with ever and you only see the good stuff You see their best photos you see what amazing things theyve been up to Nobody posts the bad stuff So you constantly feel inadequate I deleted mine about  months ago and my mood is way up Also Reddit is way more interesting than facebook anyway,0,cdpnr38,1rptuu,AskReddit,hot,15.0,15
SirMixesAlot,I strive to add value to my life I want to spend my time on enriching myself with things that interest me  I  believe in self improvement  I realized that facebook did none of these things It became a boring time sink which glorified narcissism and banality I genuinely do not care what you had for dinner with strangers Im not interested in how many parties you went to on Halloween  I prefer not to know how warm your winter coat is Glorifying the minutia of mediocrity washes the real mysteries of life away in a deluge of unoriginality  I do not want to witness the broadcast of your weakness I found that facebook made me dumber It dulled my senses and awareness of the present It made me dislike people I found tolerable to be around in real life due to their soapbox of mental diarrhea  It just reinforced my belief that we are losing our humanity and ability to behave amiably in the presence of others  How long has it been since you were in a room full of people who actually were present in spirit and not with their eyes glued to some device So there are times in life when you should ask yourself if you are going to be part of a problem or part of its solution The conventions and institutions to which we give our time are ultimately our legacy Do you really want to live in a world where the sum of a personality is their newsfeed,11,cdpqct0,1rptuu,AskReddit,hot,25.0,14

MilesGayvis, The main features of Facebook are impersonalThings like wallposts pictures etc are shared en masse between tons of people The fact that its public leaves it very impersonal to me The only other feature left is the chat function which I have on my phone and computer in a lot of different ways If someone wants to talk to me theyll talk to me The rest is noise I already talk to my friends regularly The rest are acquaintancesIm not interested in maintaining surfacelevel relationships with people That feels really shallow and gross I felt uncomfortable talking about myself in front of an invisible audience It felt gross conceited and ultimately kind of empty I wasnt adding anything to the conversation other than how my day went or what I was up to Thats something that even I struggle to care about Ultimately I was giving ad revenue to a company that provided a service I rarely used and didnt like that much That plus their privacy policy made me quitAlthough Ive gotta say I really liked how Facebook let you report things for being unfunny tasteless or memes,0,cdpqa8k,1rptuu,AskReddit,hot,6.0,6

LovetoGoRound,TLDR Was in a long distance relationship and convinced myself that when he came backsex would make magic would happen I noped the hell out of there at the last possible moment A few months before he came back he started to stop communicating with me Our Skypes were him playing video games and answering my conversations attempts with one word answers or nodsSo its okay I thought when we see each other it will be great Then it started to weigh on me I was sending him care packages letters doing stripshower teases textingcallingSkyping him first no effort on his side I talked to him and asked if he could send me a letter He said no He didnt have the money I thought that was weridhe was living with his aunt a few states away Its all good I thought I suppose I understandA little bit more times goes by and I talk to him about it again I told him I wasnt happy He wasnt doing anything for me no texts no calls no letters wouldnt let me get to know his aunt or cousins  By now I had given up on our Skype conversations it was now just two hours of silence everyday and I was feeling like I was single and showing affection to a stranger He told me I was being selfish that I knew how he felt No problem I thought I am being selfish Just waitAbout a month before he came back I was at my wits end I was so done I had his stuff already packed I told him I wasnt happy again I was sorry but wanted it to end He yelled at me through text and Skype for hours He told me if I had a problem I shouldve talked to him about it That I was just giving up on our relationshipnot trying hard enough That I didnt love him He asked who the other guy was he said he knew I was cheating Im overreacting I thought I wasnt trying enough When he comes up it will be magical We agreed to go on a break until he came backDuring that month I felt so relaxed I thought it was just because I was working myself up When he came backI felt nothingAt all I thought It would come back Just wait Then when I was on my back naked I looked up at him He wasnt even wearing a condom He had said he didnt want it the first time and that it didnt matter we were going to be together forever Then it snapped into place in my mind That he wasnt wearing a condom That I didnt want to risk having a kid with him That he wasnt showing any affection until he got to touch me physically That he wouldnt listen to me That I wasnt in love with him anymore etc All the common sense I should have had before was overwhelmingThe crazy ended up showing over the next few days But thats a different story,0,cdppbpj,1rpufd,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

MyAngryAccount,When I woke up one morning to my alarm blaring and not being able to lift my arm to turn it off I thought I was still dreaming and tried very hard to wake up After a few minutes I realized that I was almost completely paralyzed The only thing I could move was my neck and so I was staring at my alarm clock as it blared unable to do anything about itNothing is scarier than waking up one morning and realizing that you may never be able to move again The fear sets in slowly as you start thinking about how long it will take before someone finds you You become your own worst enemy with the constant stream of thoughtsAm I dieingWill I die of dehydration before someone finds meWill I ever be able to move againThis is what goes through your head I lived with roommates but they were out and I knew they would not be back for at least hours from the time I woke up I fought with my body trying to force myself to move for about two hours before I was able to move my arms It was another couple of hours before I could roll myself off my bed and I started inching towards my bedroom door It took about five hours before I was able to pull the phone off my living room table by the cord and call for an ambulanceI started regaining the ability to move and by the night time that day I was back to walking The doctors had no idea what was going on I woke up the next morning in the exact same state After much testing it was determined to be thyrotoxic periodic paralysisIt changed my life because I chose to control my illness through diet and exercise Im now much healthier even though I am going against my doctors recommendation of radiation therapy Ive completely been able to keep my condition in check I did have to stop drinking alcohol though,62,cdpp5li,1rpwpk,AskReddit,hot,292.0,230

Grnbltprimo,I was always way behind the other students in elementary school  In fifth grade we had to take a math aptitude test and the results would determine if we were to be placed in the average advanced or special level the following year  I took the test and just hoped that I wasnt going to be the only one in the special class  The results came back and the teacher announced to the class that three of the  students would be going on to the advanced class  The first unsurprisingly was the smartest girl in the class and the second was the teachers pet  I had pretty much tuned out at this point and had moved on to turning my mechanical pencil into a rocket ship with some folded paper when I heard my name  I was so surprised I thought I was in trouble  Apparently I got the highest score in the class and I would be going in to the advanced class  From that day on I had more confidence in my school work and my grades improved in other subjects as well  I skipped another grade in math by high school and I was even took calculus from the local community college before graduating  I went on to get a degree in electrical engineering and am now an engineer and enjoy the work the I do  I cant help but think that without that aptitude test I probably would have continued school as the below average student that everyone including myself thought I was    ,40,cdpoz05,1rpwpk,AskReddit,hot,197.0,157

eodiv,Ive had several but the most recent happened just two days ago    I was married but ended up separating from my wife due to my own substance abuse issues mainly alcohol At one point during the separation we didnt talk at all for a good  months  During that time I landed a great job was able to buy a brand new car and was really turning things around  Then one day she called me and said she wanted to meet up  So we met at an iHOP for breakfast  It was August and she was wearing a hoodie which I found odd  After we sat down she proceeded to tell me that she wanted to tell me about what she had been doing  It turns out she had started using and became addicted to heroin  One night she overdosed and was found by a neighbor unconscious on the floor  They called   An ambulance and police came and the police searched her apartment finding heroin and paraphernalia After she was released from the hospital she was taken to jail and charged  Her parents who were extremely well off got her a good attorney and she pled out getting only probation and an order to attend outpatient rehab    Needless to say I was upset and disappointed about all of this  We had done other substances together in the past but we had an agreement that cocaine and heroin were the two things we would never do because of how dangerous they are    About two months into her probation and rehab she was tested randomly at rehab Ive been they pick one person at random each session  which occur every other day three times a week  and test them and she pissed dirty for heroin  She was taken back to jail bonded out and went back to court  Her lawyer negotiated a deal to keep her out of jail but requiring her to attend a  day inpatient rehab facility   During all of this she pressured by her parents decided our marriage was irreparable and we got divorced in January of   We still kept in touch though  The rehab seemed to do her good at first but once she really got clean about half way through it she turned into a huge asshole  She would call me or text me and say degrading things  Eventually she stopped and then I never heard from her again    Due to the divorce and my own mental health issues I was struggling worse than ever with substance abuse  I was drinking heavily every day and abusing Adderall and Klonopin  Last June under the influence of a lot of alcohol and Klonopin I lost my balance and fell through a plate glass topped coffee table  The glass shattered and a large piece lodged itself near my shoulder and as I learned at the hospital nicked my caroted artery  I had to call  and was rushed to the hospital where I received  stitches and was told that if the glass had gone in a half an inch further up I possibly would have bled to death  Just the next month last July  I was hospitalized after I began hearing things due to being up for  days straight on Adderall amphetamine psychosis basically and probated for  days  I had to attend a court hearing and basically convince a judge that I was capable of taking care of myself and living on my own  I bullshitted my way through it and was released from the hospital got on medication for bipolar disorder and began seeing a social workercounselor twice a month  I stayed clean for awhile and would text my ex to let her know how I was doing but never got any response  It pissed me off    A few months ago I began drinking again as well as abusing Adderall and Klonopin and smoking weed and I could see myself sinking fast  A couple of weeks ago after talking to my parents I decided I needed help and checked myself into the emergency room attempting to be admitted to the psych ward or referred to a rehab facility  They refused to do either because I was drunk as hell and released me instead after keeping me for about  hours and giving me IV fluids to rehydrate me  When I got home I texted my ex and told her that I was planning on checking myself into a rehab facility Again no response I figured she would have been proud of me for doing the right thing    Two nights ago I found out why she hadnt been responding    I looked her up on Facebook as I knew she had an account but nothing came up for her name  I found that strange  So I Googled her name and the first result was an obituary She died from a heroin overdose in her parents basement in October of last year  Even though we were divorced I never stopped loving her so I pretty much lost it and began crying    After regaining my composure it hit me  While I may not be doing heroin the Adderall and Klonopin abuse could be just as dangerous  I could take too many of one or a lethal combination of the two and die and since I live alone no one would find me for days  As much as I abuse them I have been extremely lucky up until this point even though Ive been put on a  hour hold in the hospital twice the one I mentioned previously and prior to that in  for overdosing on Adderall and flipping out    So I took both pill bottles into the bathroom and flushed the contents of them down the toilet  Today I called my doctor who has been prescribing them to me and admitted what I have been doing and asked him to stop prescribing them to me  I have resolved to never drink or smoke weed ever again and Im researching Narcotics Anonymous meetings that are close to my house and I will start attending them at least once a week    Im absolutely heartbroken over my ex wifes death  She was only  years old had moved back in with her family and seemed like she was on a good road to recovery  Part of me is mad that noone called and told me that she passed  It wouldve been fine if they didnt want me at the funeral but a phone call wouldve been nice  Yes we were divorced but we were together for almost  years  We started dating when she was   I was a huge part of her life  When I told my parents about this yesterday they were shocked that noone called me  Another part of me is upset because she had told me when we met up for breakfast after she ODed that she started doing heroin because I was doing so well at the time and she felt like she deserved to feel good too  In a roundabout way blaming me  Im sure she shared that with her parents who never liked me to begin with so I wonder if they hold even more of a grudge against me in light of her death  I thought for an hour straight earlier today about calling them but after talking to my dad I have decided against it  Im not going to get anything out of it and its only going to upset them and open up the wound Im sure they have and probably still are working extremely hard to heal I do know where she is buried though and this weekend I am going to go buy some flowers and place them on her grave with a little note so that anyone who comes to visit her will know I was there   I dont know what Im going to do to cope with her death but I do know that I will never use drugs or alcohol again  If she couldnt overcome her addiction and died as a result of it I could just as easily suffer the same fate  I realize this is going to be the hardest thing Ive ever done  Im going to need support and I may slip up but  I dont want to die  Despite my drug and alcohol abuse life has been going really well for me lately  The medication I take for Bipolar disorder is working well and its basically in remission  I dont get hyper manic like I used to  I dont always think people are talking bad about me and Im not constantly paranoid  Ive turned into a pretty friendly outgoing normal person  On the surface at least  After being unemployed for over a year Ive landed a great new job that pays well and I enjoy and have started dating a cool intelligent and beautiful girl  In addition to not wanting to die I dont want to risk losing any or all of those things just so I can get high    Drugs and alcohol have cost me a  a year job my aforementioned new car almost all of my friends my marriage and have landed me in the hospital numerous times  Yet I basically flipped fate a big ol middle finger and kept at it  Now that I know drugs have taken the person that I was closer to than anyone ever in my life my eyes have finally been opened Im done  I wish I wouldve known sooner and had this eye opening experience a year ago but despite the sadness Im feeling right now Im filled with the hope of having a happy healthy and substance free future  TLDR  I abuse drugs found out my ex wife died of a heroin overdose threw all my drugs away and have resolved to never use again,3,cdpny7t,1rpwpk,AskReddit,hot,29.0,26

OlivesRose,I started talking to this guy on facebook he was blunt opinionated and from what I could tell a genius He intrigued the fuck out of me on an intellectual level and we started talking Mostly joking and insulting eachother Eventually I got comfortable with him and Id vent to him even though I was sure it only bothered him It didnt One particularly bad day I wasnt really in the mood to talk to anyone and I made it known He told me that he didnt count when I didnt want to talk to anyone and he ended up giving me his phone number so I could text him about it I did I stayed up all night texting him He kind of became the only person I went to to talk about things but at that point we werent interested in eachother romantically He was pursuing a different girl kind of quietly but I ended up catching on after a couple monthsNow I have to take a second to say we were totally opposite people He smoked drank partied and generally didnt give a single fuck And I went to church every Sunday got straight As and had never gotten drunk It sort of bothered me that he was into those things but Im also not the type of person that will tell you how to live And like I said he intrigued the fuck out of meOne night he called me I thought it was on accident because it was late at night and well hed never called me before I answered hesitantly and sure enough he called on purpose We talked for about  hours that night He was so interesting to me and from then on we talked on the phone quite a bit often for hours at a timeAnyway the girl he had been pursuing ended up changing her mind It broke his heart and I remember him telling me that I was the only girl he didnt hate now At the time I didnt know what he meant By this time I cared about him more than he knew This is where it gets scary I almost lost him before anything began He almost ran away he stole a truck and made it to the border of our state and then decided to turn back He later told me he came back because of me He didnt tell me this even happened until a while after it did I remember a little while after he told me he went camping in a part of our state that is essentially wilderness There was no cell service and he didnt answer me for  days By the th day I thought he left It scared the shit out of me We werent even dating at that pointFast forward a little and we started actually hanging out It was kind of an unsaid date the first time we hung out He walked all the way across town to meet me and we hung out at a park Hed comment on how small my hands were just so he could compare hand sizes and almost hold my hands I think he thought I was oblivious I wasnt We continued hanging out and everytime he would walk all the way across town Hed say sweet things to me and we both knew where it was going One day we were sitting on a hill overlooking a feild at just about dusk and he put his arm around me It was the time of year where your not quite used to the colder fall air He was warm and I was shivering Half because of excitement the other half cold I remember it like it was yesterday Then he officially ask me out It was all so perfect Hed call me every night before I fell asleep to say goodnight Actually he still does only now sometimes Im asleep first Wed write eachother letters and he made me music Wed lay on a blanket outside and look at stars and we even danced under the moon Hed sing Frank Sinatra to me when we go on walks One time we met at the beach and it started pouring rain I wanted to wait it out under a gazebo but he insisted we just walk back to his house So we did It was summer and the rain was warm enough to comfortably get soaked We ran the couple blocks back kicking water at eachother and laughing I only wish I would have kissed him to make it more cliche Nonethless that day was wonderful Weve been together a little over a year now and I feel like my life is a romance novel We of course have our fights not everything is perfect But I am incredibly greatful for the memories I have shared with this man He means the world to meTL DR I got carried away Literally and figuratively Edit spelling and a few more details Also Im on mobile and this post doesnt really do it justice ,15,cdppakk,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,61.0,46
GettinHooked,Time for another addition of Super Gayliterally Story TimeI fell in love with my female best friend when I was  years old It was confusing and given the fact that she was extremely religious conservative and by all noticeable signs straight it was pretty much a bummer I never told her I was gay let alone in love with her and it strained our relationship throughout the years As most  year old girls are she become pretty much awful throughout high school Obsessed with social climbing and doing whatever was the status quo We drifted apart and I had to painfully watch her date d bag after d bag for a few years Eventually I came out and had a few relationships in the long attempt to move on and forget about her Toward the end of high school we rekindled our friendship and she apologized for letting peer pressure get the best of her Right before graduation we got drunk and hooked up It was about as amazing as I ever thought it could be But afterward she freaked out and insisted we should talk or see each other especially next yearwe ended up at the same collegeAs much as it hurt I respected her decision and figured it would stick since she was going Greek which is essentially the college version of high school cliques I had accepted this end until she called me one day a few months into freshman year saying she had to see meWe met up and she instantly started sobbing saying she couldnt do this anymore That shed always been in love with me and had tried so hard to just ignore it She had no idea what this meant for her life or sexuality but she knew she couldnt fight it any moreIt was a long long journey and it hasnt ever been easy but were now out to friends and my family Going strong for over a year now I still cant believe it when I wake up next to the love of my life who I thought would never be mine There were a thousand times when all reason and sense told me to give up on it forever but sometimes the heart knows best TLDR After many years my first lesbian crush turned into the happiest relationship of my lifeAlso for the record OP idk if love stories are gonna make you feel better little masochistic but your wish is my command,10,cdprrdx,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,50.0,40

freedomsong,You want a love story Um Okay Lets see Oh yeah Okay so um yeah here we goMet my husband back in high school We were friends He married one of my best friends We had a series of party houses with semiregular room mates Basically lived together including his wifemy bff and othersoff and on for years She cheats They have a crappy divorce I was right there for him I am still best friends with him at the end of it We continue living together with friends for a couple of years One day I am just sitting around looking at him and realize I have a HUGE crush on him Im talking one of those scramble to the journal and freak out moments Since we were best friends I decided that going for it was a terrible idea that would end our friendship and destroy the house dynamics My world is crumbling So I set him up with a girl I know Logical solution IDK Obviously that doesnt work out Then the worst luck ever has to strike He and I wind up going after the same girl Crazy confusing I know That doesnt work out for either of us So I start dating a guy and we hit it off Future hubby finds out and his world comes crashing down now too He starts going after me HARD I soon find myself in a bad break up Presto Future hubby and I start talking about our feelings I was VERY resistant to the idea To the extent that we sat down and had several very long talks about it I never saw myself with someone like him I didnt think he could handle the kind of relationship I needed and I couldnt see our relationship change going well Basically my answer was a cautiously stern NOLittle did I know that he was a man who had finely crafted the Wear them down approach to love and war Through a series wide of romantic gestures like ninja kisses he slowly won me over It was a week or two before I realized we had already transitioned from best friends to boygirlfriend Surprisingly it worked VERY wellI have never been good with relationships Honestly the fact that we were friends for a decade before anything happened was probably the only reason we lasted the first year We dated for a year were engaged for another year and have been married for four years now We were inseparable as friends As in if someone either of us dated wouldnt deal with our close friendship and constant presence in each others lives the relationship was over In hindsight that was probably a BIG clue I cant imagine my life without himI always had a rule that I would never date my best friend Friendship is important and lasting friendships are more precious then you realize when you are younger If it werent for the series of insane events that brought us closer and closer together wenever would have gotten married Today I would highly advise anyone considering letting a possible happy relationship pass them by due to friendship alone to feel it out and give it a try It is not a normal love story I suppose It was chaos from the start It was exactly what we needed Finally saying YES to him was by far the best decision I have ever made I am happy and we have an amazing child together This really could not have turned out any better for us ,4,cdpq94r,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,14.0,10

RosalindSHH,This will probably get buried because its late in the game Im not great at articulating things or writing stories and this is so goddamn long Im sorry Im so sorry But hopefully it might cheer you up Or not WARNING THIS IS REALLY LONG BECAUSE I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BREVITYI was home from University for winter break I had broken up with my SO over a year ago just had the worst sex of my life with the first guy I had a hint of feelings for and was not looking for a relationshipI had never been in love and wasnt sure it existed I didnt think Id fall in love  I had worked my whole life to get into a top university and now I was working to get into a good graduate school  Relationships were too time consumingMy cousinclose friend and I are hanging out during winter break and she suggests we go see a movie at one of those dinnerandamovie movie theaters After much debate I reluctantly settle for the Hobbit It was a great movie but I didnt think I would like it at the timeI walk into the theater and in the enormous loungebar area I see a cutehandsome waiter Completely out of my league   Im pretty socially awkward and have never considered myself attractive but my friends describe it  as ugly duckling syndrome Ugly in high school Less shitty now  I quickly look down when he lifts his head We walk past him and I dont dare make eye contact When I think its safe I turn around to get my last look at him   We make eye contact because we both did a double take at the same time  Oops  Now I know he was checking my ass out How romanticI head into the theater and we sit down for prepreviews  Although my cousin is pushing me to talk about my past quarter Im raving about how hot that guy is to my cousin  There are four people in the whole theater   I see a waiter walk into the theater and squat down to take their order As the waiter gets up I realize its him  Hes coming towards us  Oh shit I should order something I wasnt planning toHe squats down near my legs Focus Focus Hi My name is cant hear over the panic in my head what would you like After fumbling with the menu I order peanut MampMs  He comes back with the order  I want to see him again I push the button he returns so I order a Kit Kat bar   Then I push the button again and order watertwo cups  Ive spent  on overpriced candy  Not good I still have to buy presentsAnd now I have to pee I get up and as I walk out of the theater out of nowhere I hear Can I help youOH MY GOD Oh god Sorry You scared meHe laughs um yeah no Im goodjust DONT TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO PEE RosalindSHH outAt this point I realize my pants only have back pockets into which to place my hands uncomfortably He replies Oh ok Hows the movieIts good its good Yeah silence Say something Anything Youre wearing TWO sets of glasses  What Oh yeah this is so I can watch the Monsters inc movie in D I love those moviesMe too I really like pixarWe banter about pixar and some other stuff for a while and then the desire to pee becomes overwhelming Ok well nice meeting you In the bathroom I decide Ill write my number on the receipt Hell never call Thats going to be so embarrassing  Worth a shot Right Right Something something miss  of the shots you dont take Now Ive been in the bathroom too long and hope I dont run into himAs Im turning the corner back to my theater he is opening the door to deliver the receiptsHey I waveOh hey he replies nervously I thinkAs I get closer I ask him Which one is mine Ill take it nowNo dont worry about it  I got it He repliesThats silly Ill just bring it inside I had given my card beforeNo no really I got itI see my receipt  Theres another piece of paper on top of it with writing on it A careful smile appears on my face as I take the receipts and I read itHey I dont mean to embarrass you but you are cute and you seem like youre worth getting to know  Maybe give me a call sometime Hes red Im beaming And admit Dont worry I was thinking of doing the exact same thing I write my phone number down on his copy Make some awkward comment about tipping being awkward now Give a  tip because my brain isnt working  And run back into the theater to inform my cousinWe text for a bit and settle on a coffee shop for our first date  I cant go for drinks because Im under  I find out later hes  and working that in addition to a normal business job to make extra cashThe start of the first date was horrible  We just sit there and drink tea because neither of us actually drinks coffee Interviewstyle questions are occasionally interspersed between sips The rest is awkward silence  Look Im really bad at this whole sitting and talking thing I just dont know I dont do this I dont know how can we go for a walkHe replies yeah sureThree blocks in I realize that the fleecelined tights I borrowed from my mom are too big They are slipping closer to the ground with every step I take ShitHey I need to stop in that dark spot And I need you to turn around and dont ask questions Ok Im not going to kill you or mug you I swear Just stare at that treeWe do this several times until I finally admit that my tights are coming off We talk back to my car where I take off the tights and leave them behindThen we walk around For miles  hours of walking Its freezing and we dont care   hours later we do care and return to the coffee shop for an hour to warm up We talk about everything We even happened to have watched the same neuroscience TED talks Hes actually really funny and smart  Its  am now and the coffee shop closesHe walks me to my car and we hug goodbye Its awkward but kissing doesnt feel right quite yetOur next date we end up just walking around my neighborhood for  hoursThe next date same thing  hours Just talking and getting to know each other In the following weeks he drives me crazy He seems to be hot and cold and it bothers me like its never bothered me before  My sister asks me if Im in love and I tell her that thats ridiculous because I just met him  I wonder if Im lying to her and myself  I decide not to dwellWe go on four more dates and at the end we decide to keep in touch  As if thats going to happen Were  miles apart  But we do We would end up Skyping for  hours at a time It sounds really long but time just flew by Months later he asked me to be his girlfriendIts been almost a year and were still together Thats not long for some people but Ive never been in a committed relationship for more than  months before  Oh and I love him With all my heart,0,cdpxxga,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,3.0,3

chatttheleaper,Im not doing this to get advice Im doing it because you asked I met her  years ago Actually we have varying opinions on where we first met She says we sat together at one point and I talked to her briefly I say we met staffing a Halloween carnival Shes entirely right about where we first met but she likes to mock me with what I said so I tend to forget At the class where I first met her I thought she was kind of strange Cute but not somebody I thought Id have any interest in Looking back it seems funny that someone whos come to matter so much to me initially seemed like somebody I had no interest in as a friend So later at the carnival I was stuck working a booth with her So I made some small talk and we wound up hitting it off pretty well And then at the end of the night she introduced me to the girl I had sat with at the class Confused So was I Turns out the girl I was working with was the identical twin of the girl from the class So we talked for a bit more before I left At the classes after that wed hang out and times were good I started to fall in love with both of them since they were both great friends and I enjoyed hanging out with both of them As we started to hang out more I only loved them more However our schedules caused us to see each other infrequently After about a year we saw each other less and most of our communication was electronic This worked fine at first but even that slowly stagnated But then this year we started attending the same school They were new to the area and didnt have many friends so they spent a lot of time with me It was around this point I figured out which one of them I wanted to be with However they started to make new friends as well I became obsessive and started to worry every time they talked to a guy who wasnt me I saw them flirting where they werent and I started to become more closed off However I recently managed to shake those fears and Im now back to whatever state am ambiguous platonicism we were formerly in,1,cdpsdlz,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,3.0,2

tecrazey,Well since I still am young this is more of a teenage live story When I was  I started dating finally and instantly fell for someone who I thought was perfect He had a bad past of probation for pot and whatnot and was still in that program He couldnt smoke weed for the first eight months of our relationship so I fell for the person I thought I knew Even though our relationship was mainly sex we could do anything and love each others company We were each others best friends sleep overs every other day But then when probation over he began his old routine of smoking all the time and a lot fell apart I just started smoking with him to enjoy what he liked to Did this for about another year until more And more fell apart We had probably ten mini breakups leading to our big one this summer Then we starting back at it two weeks later Then in the beginning of october we broke up again Now this brings me to this point where I am  started talking to this amazing guy Had so much in common could talk hours about anytjing for hours He called it just hooking up after month of casual dating So that turned me off and I began talking to me ex again Starting having sex casually for a week so i told the other guy I just want to be friends This surprisingly crushed him and he ended up writing me two letters The first one explaining why I shouldnt go back with my ex quoting me things I subconsiously said He made valid reasons but I was still an idiot to fore see it Still talked to my ex up until three days ago The second later he gave me that day made me realize how much I  passing up just to go back to my unwanted past It is very nice knowing that someone really enjoys you as person not just the sex I have decided on just dedicating myself to the new guy and havent talked to my ex Funny part is I know this is the right decision because my ex hasnt even tried contacting me so he still doesnt know I dont want to see him anymore,0,cdpvcs9,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

littlepeachy,I think mines pretty boring but I guess the funny part of it is how insecure I was at the beginning of it I met my current boyfriend last September through mutual friends I thought he was really attractive but didnt do anything about it until he started talking to me more Soon he had asked for my phone number and I was still convinced that there was no way this guy could have feelings for me After that we hung out on campus between classes just silently doing homework beside each other because I was too afraid of messing it up which feels so silly to say now and one day he finally asked me out on a date Even then I was still not  convinced that he was into me We had an awesome first few dates and then just before Halloween he asked me to see The Shining with him at the student movie theatre on campus That night for some reason is my favourite date of all We went for pizza then we went to the beach and held hands for the first time and we made out under the park at the beach for an hour when it was raining This was a big deal because I had a lot of insecurities about being intimate with him from previous relationships going bad but that night was just perfect He asked me to be his girlfriend a few days later He has really helped me become comfortable in my own skin and to be more outspoken and more than anything else hes my best friend in the entire world A little over a year later and were doing pretty well ,0,cdpvk2p,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

masterjack,Back when I was forever alone I joined okcupid I met this really amazing guy who quickly became and remains one of my best friends We were FWB for about a year and one night I was just leaving from work and felt NASTY All I could think about was showering and going to bed He calls me and BEGS me to go to this Indian restaurant with him and some of his friends from uni For whatever reason I actually agreed to go even though I wasnt hungry and when we got there his friends were already eating I sat down across from this guy who was stealing the show telling stories of his childhood to the group Im really not one to be a maneater and had never really found someone super attractive before nor do I ever think about random dudes in an intimate way if I dont know them But with this guy I was instantly interested I started admiring the muscles under the shirt the way he laughed the sound of his voice the way he ate ok sounding creepy here everything I started to think about what kind of lover and boyfriend he would be I really felt that I wanted to get to know him When we left the restaurant I specifically remember being disappointed and literally thinking well I will probably never see this guy again which I have never in my life thought about somebody I have just met About  months later Im at my best friends bday party delicious free food and booze and for some reason Im completely restless and just want to go and hangout with the friend from Okcupid no not for sex just for some professional potatocouching After we meet up this friend from the Indian restaurant calls who is actually more of a friend of the other people that were there and asks my FWB if he wants to hangout but doesnt know Im there We go and theres a full house playing poker and doing shisha but the indian restaurant guy and i spent the entire night in the corner talking The next morning my FWB is scrolling on FB and I see this weird name that I specifically point out because its that weird and he tells me that its the longform name of the indian restaurant guy and encouraged me to add him I did and weve been together ever since We never fight and if we disagree we talk about it but it isnt often We have a great time doing absolutely nothing We can and do talk about everything under the sun Hes absolutely brilliant kind compassionate a critical thinker essential lol and generous The sex is unreal I never thought it possible to be SO attracted to somebody I kind of feel like this was in the cards for us all along ,0,cdpw6wr,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

ObviousBicycle,Are we just talking happy love stories Because surely theres such a thing as unhappy love stories Not unrequited love stories Just shitty love that doesnt work out because youre both too afraid to properly commit Both too afraid to admit how much you adore each other because you have both been hurt in the past and you both have weird issues Weird issues that the other only really knows a fraction about because that one time you got hammered and spoke about it a little before bursting into tears You kiss its there you can feel it Its totally there Theres a connection that youll never forget ever Theres that feeling you get in the pits of your stomach when you think back on it How when you first kissed there was such an urgency in it An urgency that wont ever be repeated with anyone else You wanted each other so much in that moment You knew you loved each other right then and there It wasnt just lust Weve all felt lust before but this was something completely extraordinary Everything completely disappeared around you in those moments Moments you replay over and over again in your headTheres the comfort of them just being there physically but then at the same time being totally unattainable because you cant communicate properly because you dont know how You can feel the frustration at yourself and them growing inside you but you cant do anything about it because that would require changing each other and that would in turn affect everything you love about them already But then you try and do something about it because you want them all you want all of them You start being selfish and you say you dont want half of them any more But that means that youve blown it Youve blown it forever because you tried to change it and even though it wasnt healthy it was still love And love is eternal you cant change the way you love someone You love someone because you love someone And risking it all because its not the normal way of loving someone is foolish But you do it You ruin it You ruin the complete and utter life changing love that you once had that you cant ever brush under the carpet ,0,cdpxsp8,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

SergeantCoodles,Boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now  We met on the same University dorm floor and initially didnt like each other He seemed outspoken and slightly rude and liked to flaunt his knowledge He also had some experience with drinking and drug use which I didnt at that time I was in the middle of a tryingtobreakupwithmyex while my exs best friend was also trying to pursue me I was confused and on top of that was a new freshman attempting to make friends so I had a difficult time adjustingWe had mutual friends on the floor and that brought us infinitely closer He was there to talk me through my relationship issues and just be someone I could message or drop in with I could eventually cut off ties with the ex and the bad situation with his BFF We went deerwatching and stargazing and had random sleep overs and movie nights with other floor members One night we awoke and we were the only ones still up after a night of social drinking and horrible movie watching He asked if I wanted to spend the rest of the AM in his room I was reluctant but obliged Thus began over a month or so of us purely cuddling  spooning and just talking I felt safe Eventually he wanted us to be official It took me a while to come around out of fear of how my other relationships spiralled down but he awaited patiently Now I have no regretsSure we fight a lot and have squabbles about purely nothing Hes annoying and games way too much But he pulled me out of a bad time in my life  I was dealing with family issues and am now having trouble with anxiety and depression Even with meds I can be moody and unstable assigning blame and crying a lotNo matter what though hes stuck through it with me at all times Its a learning pathway for the both of us We grow and learn how to communicate better each and every time Most of all  Im happyId give him a hug but alas were on the verge of a new disagreementHUG PENDING,0,cdpxzx4,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

WhiteCocoa,Sorry in advance for the wall of text whenever I tell this story I have to tell it exactly as I remember it amp it has a happy ending  It all started a little over three years ago I went to my college orientation at SLU in St Louis I remember one of the speakersleaders said Look around you people make life time friends with people starting out at SLU  what they called our orientation I remember I scoffed at that amp thought Yeah right with all these random people here How do they know that Fast forward to that night everyone in our group was playing Scoot Your Boot a game that had the same concept as musical chairs but you had to state something that you could do amp everyone else that could do that would have to run across the room to another empty chair This literally is going to sound cheesy but I saw him across the room from me and I remember thinking that he was really attractive so I was like Im gonna go ahead and run on whatever this next thing is and sit right next to him So I did Annnnd he got up and ran somewhere else haha Fast forward a couple of months we were friends on facebook and I saw him make a status about his nephew wanting to be like him so I liked it He poked me I thought it was an accident haha so I poked him back He sent me a message saying How come I never see you around campus and I told him that I was a commuter so we decided to meet up and hang out I still to this day can remember what he was wearing the first day we hung out but not what I was wearing and where we decided to meet to walk back to his place  The Bean When I saw him he opened his arms for a hug amp we hugged which I wasnt expecting at first because I realized everyone at SLU shook hands So this always stands out to me We walked back to his dorm and watched The Crazies I was instantly comfortable with him which never happens to me Around guys Ive always had my guard up but with him never We were sitting in chairs in front of his TV and my legs were wrapped in his and I remember thinking that this felt right I felt like I was supposed to be there with him The next day we hung out again It honestly was what I was looking forward to all day We ended up watching tv at his place and one of his chairs broke Totally out of character for me I said Well I dont mind just sitting on your lap Again I felt comfortable and right Like I was supposed to be there with him I felt him looking at me so I turned my head and looked down at him and he was smiling Before I could say anything to him he said Whos my pretty girl and I said in a joking manner I mean you could be talking about me Is it me maybe He chuckled at me and pulled me in for a kiss Reddit let me tell you that a kiss had never been so perfect and felt so right I lost track of time I was only concentrated on the two of us In two weeks well be celebrating our third anniversary  Over the course of three years Ive fallen in love with him again and again everyday It not just his looks that attract me to him Its his soul his mannerisms his smell the way he still gives me butterflies like he did on day one I love this man With all I have and all that I am,0,cdq0xhb,1rpyj1,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

Lonewolf,Im an emergency dispatcher for a company that monitors emergency elevator help and pool phones I work the night shift on weekends so I get a lot of weird calls Honestly after a while they all kind of blend together but a few stick out Back when I first started I had a lawyer who was stuck in a public storage elevator call in I ask my questions and Im just about to hang up and begin calling for help when she starts ranting about how shes a big fancy lawyer and is going to sue public storage and my company if shes not freed from the elevator in the next five minutes I had to try hard not to laugh at the absurdity of threatening the only people who can help you I believe she ended up staying in the elevator for another thirty minutes or so Which is actually pretty quick as far as elevator entrapments go Another time we got trolled hard by this one guy Now being a little fucker and misusing the phones isnt uncommon but it usually amounts to some asshole kid calling yelling DICK into the phone and running off This time was different At the time we were acting as the answering service for an elevator company The only thing about that thats relevant is that when someone called in on that line it wouldnt pull up the exact location of the caller So this highly irate gentleman calls in yelling about hows hes stuck in the elevator Im unable to get a location message to play and all the guy will say when asked is a nonexistent address in Manhattan Then he starts calling me a cunt among other colorful things Now the elevator company I was answering for was based in Colorado not New York When i pointed that out hed just repeat the address in Manhattan he listed earlier then rattle off the same string of insults After about five minutes of arguing with him and becoming more and more irritated it dawned on me that everytime he said something hed say it in the exact same tone and rythm Yep It was one of those Soundboard things I wasnt even mad Id been duped by a machine I transferred it to my supervisor and told her my Soundboard theory The best part is that she proceeded to argue with it for another five minutes even though I told her it was a machine Theres probably a recording on YouTube somewhereIve got a few more but Im on my phone and this took forever Also Im actually at work right now Ill post more later Maybe ,1,cdpullf,1rpzgf,AskReddit,hot,15.0,14

Mayanwolfe,One night I woke up running a high fever It was the early hours of the morning and I pretty much felt like death At the time my family was living in a rental house while we waited for our actual house to be finished The rental was an ancient farmhouse with many strangelyshaped rooms and very little furniture and for a family of three it was cavernous At night the emptiness was eerie After waking up drenched in sweat with chills running up and down my body I decided to stagger down the hall to the strange little half bathroom at the top of the stairs The trip down that hallway was the worst fourteen feet of my life I must have been hallucinating because of the fever and lack of sleep and I remember being terrified that aliens were attacking the house in the middle of a thunderstorm There were bright flashes of light all around and strange colorful globes everywhere At that moment I also knew for a fact that there were things in each of the empty rooms down the hall watching me Upon reaching the bathroom I splashed some water on my face stared at my haggard visage in the mirror contemplated my mortality and quickly decided that the narrow space beside the toilet would be a perfectly acceptable place to spend the rest of the night,0,cdpotns,1rq0ws,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

SayVandalay,I had a few girlfriends in high school Two come to mind as being potential ones that at the time I saw as possible long term relationships For reference Ive been with my girlfriend now for around  years who I met in college As far as the high school girlfriends go I think the biggest single difference in my life would be my social circle and where I live I think academicallyprofessionally my path would have been pretty much the same I think I would have went to the same undergrad school and met many of the same friends But I think my connections with old friends back home would have continued and they would have continued to be my main social group One hs girlfriend had a different social group so I imagine I would have gotten to know them as well the other pretty much hung with the same groups I did back then so if it was her then Id still be in those social groups I still talk to them exes and friends but I think the main social group I roll with today would have been acquaintances I lost touch with after college Also I probably would be living in a different neighborhoodOverall though I think I would have still met and known many of the same people but my relationships with them would have evolved differently ,0,cdpowqw,1rq12z,AskReddit,hot,4.0,4

abetterthief,Mainly coworker blunders Had one guy leave the back door of a  door sedan open and back it off of a  post lift Post on the right rear caught the door and bent it forward till it was flush with the passengers front door Little old lady driving it didnt seem too upset about it We of course ended up paying for it to be repaired Had another coworker who removed all the lugnuts off the wheel before lifting the vehicle off the ground He hadnt even set the hoist up just started removing nuts Called me over because he was confused as to why he couldnt get the wheel offI my self have had butthole puckering moments where the lock on one of the posts of a  post lift stays locked but the rest of the lift keeps lowering In essence the vehicle starts tipping towards one direction and will keep doing so unless you lift it back up off the lock  Did this with a BMW  series that rolled until the tire chucks stopped it because I wasnt paying attention  Ive got more if anyone caresEDIT TO ADDI had a coworker who forgot to take the expensive alignment head reflectors off the passengers side of the vehicle after aligning it Drove it around the block and somehow they managed to stay on Luckily as they are atleast  a pieceI had a service manager have one of the techs remove an air pressure regulator off our tire machine because it was too slow to fill up tires Service manager later had his drag racing buddy bring in pure aluminum rims so they could mount some tires for him Machine ended up completely warping the rims beyond use because there was nothing to stop it from continuously putting force on the rim Shop ended up paying out  for a new rimSooo many double gaskets So many I had a  year old alcoholic coworker while he was welding exhaust accidentally weld a hole into a metal gas tank on a s somethingoranotherit was while ago so I cant remember what kind of vehicle Maybe a Maverick Seriously starts dripping gasoline out right next to his arc Only moments away from horrible firey disasterI watched the owner of the previous shop I worked for spray brake cleaner all over the underside while it was in the air to clean up some oil Which is no big deal its what we all do But he did it moments before the tech working on it came back and did not tell him so The tech was going to get the acetylene torch to cut off some exhaust shielding It was too late to tell him before the underside of the car started on fire with a poof Luckily the tech had a water hose in front the the car to spray it down withSomething driver related Had a  Acura Integra brought in for a clunking noise While I was lifting up the vehicle the upper ball joint fell out of its socket Like just fell out so the knuckle was hanging by the lower control arm and the tie rod We tell the driver she cant drive it like this its  going to cause a crash She says she will call a tow truck to come tow it away I set the ball joint back in the socket while im lowering it so that we can atleast roll it out of the shop While we werent paying attention the driver grabbed her keys off of the hang up hook and drove the vehicle away never to be seen again Thats is as dangerous as you can getWe nicknamed a previous coworker chicken sandwich He had just gotten lunch at Wendys and had a unwrapped chicken sandwich in his hand Other coworker comes up behind him with a lighter and brake clean Proceeds to light it and spray said sandwich eating coworker which then lights sandwich eating coworkers ass on fire Takes his sandwich and pats out the flames then proceeds to continue eating it like nothing happened Still have more if anyone is still readingMOARA guy who got canned shortly after I started was fired for accidentally crashing a Landrover into the pillar between our baysl He said he mixed up the brake pedal and the gas pedal This was his second time doing thisOne of my shops fired a guy because we was just a full on dumbass We had an oil gun that had a gallon meter that didnt work This guy used only that gun for  whole day basically guessing about how much oil he was putting in No one noticed until the end of the day  Same guy put the wrong oil filter on a Scion XB which then fell off as he was pulling it out A Chevy Express came back into the shop  days after he was canned for a complaint of  a oil leak Guy did the oil change on that vehicle but didnt tighten down the oil filter enough and it spun off Engine was ok just had to pay for the underbody clean upThe scariest things that I saw pop up where what we called wheel offs or when the tech forgot to properly torque down the lugnuts My friend did this on a Hummer H with s Guy got down the road and his front wheel went rolling past him My friend had completely forgotten to put the lug nuts on that wheel My shop owner ran to his bay grabbed the lug nuts and threw them into the parking lot where the guy picked his H up from after we worked on it Told the guy someone must have been trying to steal his rims He was a shitty owner had I been there I would have called him on that bullshit Friend did a timing belt on a Hyundai Started it to make sure the timing was set right and it ran fine Sadly while doing this the timing belt walked itself off the crank pulley and being an interference engine one of the valves slammed a hole through the piston His shop owner had him put in a used engine with more miles and never told the driver what happened Had a driver complain that his tail lights were not working Explained to him that they do not come on while your daytime running lights are on and that you have to actually turn the headlights on to turn on your tail lights He told us we didnt know what we where talking about and said he was going to bring his car to the dealer Whatever I guess Go embarass yourself elsewhereHad a crazy lady who would sob uncontrollably everytime she brought her Santa Fe to our shop She was know around town as being nutty Kept bringing her truck in

PraxisLD,They tell a story in engineering class about a guy who complained his car would never start when he bought vanilla ice creamAny other flavor and the car started fine but never with vanillaThey car checked out fine they couldnt reproduce the problem etc but the owner kept complainingFinally they sent a tech with the customer to buy ice creamTurns out that all the ice cream was kept in the back of the store except for vanilla which had its own freezer right up front So buying vanilla ice cream was a very quick trip and the car wouldnt start because it was still overheated and vapor locked from the short time it was turned offSince the other ice cream was further back the longer stop gave the car enough time to cool so it would start againOnce they had changed the symptom from vanilla ice cream to car wont start soon after being turned off they were able to find the problem and fix it properlyTLDR Sometimes the customer knows what is wrong but not how to describe it correctly,3,cdpsr8w,1rq14u,AskReddit,hot,18.0,15

ConfusingUsername,I used to consider myself one and I honestly had  relationships going at once all knew the others existed and usually would have sex with  of the women a minimum of  times a day  Apparently they loved the arrangement due to the lack of strings and they trusted that I wasnt going to break that bond  They would even out source said info as well and sometimes I often found myself in new company Oddly enough though I had a testosterone deficiency at the time  After a while my sex drive went from multiple times a day to nothing  No masterbation no thoughts no arousal at all really  I have no idea when or why it happened but I have had no desire at all for  years now and honestly have to concentrate very hard if a situation arises for sex and is just selfish for me to reject the person for whatever reason  Its amazing how completely objective everything became after that as well Also no sperm at all so children are out of the picture   If you ever have any questions  regarding either lifestyle please dont hesitate to ask ,0,cdpovss,1rq1fq,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

Sadomi,This dream came in  parts back when I was There I was sitting with the girl of my dreams Long luscious hair a pure white sundress and a couple of stools next to a bar She stood out form everyone else in the room who was a faceless entity save for a few people I had seen passing by me that previous night We sit down and we start drinking all of my favorite drinks together and Talk about football and video games She was my perfect girlThen the fun started A faceless man ran inside the bar and screamed ZOMBIEEESSS I see my dream girl just sprint past me with a shotgun in here hand At this point i was aware of the dream so i just picked up a revolver off the table and unsheathed my Katana We sprint outside to a pier where there is a huge goddamned zombie spider I did the only sensible thing in that situation I threw the spider a Beer and sat and watched the Zombie Apocalypse take over with my Dream girl just sitting on my lap and broing it up with a  story spiderPart two was in the same dream I woke up and my family was standing over my death bed I felt fine and looked even better My family and friends were crying and Im just like Shit you guys look ugly crying Now some guy in a  piece lime green suit and a pimp hat walked over and started listing off the things I hadnt done yet The only  I remember well were having sex and pull off a heist The pimp doctor told me I had an hour to live  I sit up and haul ass outside and I see my crush from high school She had already heard the news and she jumps on my back piggyback style and we sprint towards a bank We walk in hand the bank teller a note laced with instant heart attack powder The teller starts to have chest pains and then My crush goes over the counter to help her out swiping a key in the meantimeThe safe only had one physical key no keypad or anything  She asks for something in the vault to save the tellers life a Golden Bamboo stick We run into the vault to get the bamboo stick but we lock ourselves inside instead We cry out for help and they cant find the key We snicker to each other and we look at my watch I had  minutes till i passed away so we did what any virgin would do in that situationWe awkwardly tried to make love but ended up just cuddling for  minutes The grim reaper walks up to me from out of nowhere and hands me a joint I didnt smoke at the time in real life so I dont know why that came up all of a sudden Thats when i woke up at  AM  hours before I had to get up for schoolBest dream to this day that involves heists and Zombies and the Grim Reaper passing me a Joint,0,cdpq75c,1rq22s,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

HedyLamarr,As uCumberlady said it depends on where you are going and what you want to see but lets expand on that  Say you are a business person going to a conference at the convention center You can take a cab from the airport and catch a shuttle from the nearest hotel which is barely walking distance to the convention center Really if you go to LA on business but dont have to go beyond the area of your hotel too far you can cabuse a car service  If you are a tourist it is impossible Unless you go to LA for a single destination you have to have a car Yes there is a subway but it doesnt really go where a tourist would want to go Yes there are busses but they are designed for local commuters Want to go to Disneyland one day and check out the crazies on the Venice Beach boardwalk Thats  miles of distance between them Surf in the morning and ski in the afternoon Thats about  to  miles plus a full wetsuit  Yes There are ways to get around LA without a car but they will take up a huge amount of your day to get where you are going,0,cdppbk4,1rq34h,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1
braindeadidiot,Absolutely If youre in LA proper you might be able get around with public transportation but bring lots of cash because its not cheap If youre in any one of the multitude of suburbs then you will definitely need a vehicle or youll spend more time getting to your destination than you will being at your destination For example I live  miles from work I used to have to get up at  in the morning to catch three different buses in order to arrive at work by  and Id still have to walk at least a half mile from the nearest bus stop to work once I got there A car may cost you but itll save you tons of time in the end,0,cdppnp7,1rq34h,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

lazlounderhill,I thought I was actually having a heart attack  Pulse was racing and I couldnt make it slow down and  I felt an overwhelming sense of doom  The most frightening thing aside from the racing heart was that physically I felt as if my innards were being crushed by ribcage as if there wasnt enough room for my organs  it is the strangest and most unpleasant sensation  There was nothing I could do to alleviate the way I was feeling and the terror of that only made it worse  I went to the ER the first time fully expecting to be told that I was in fact having a heart attack or worse  They tested me out  no signs of any heart troubledisease  They ran some other tests including a chest xray  Nothing  Finally they asked me and I quote If I was an anxious person  I answered I guess I am  Needless to say I was extremely embarrassed but actually VERY relieved  The Doctor gave me a PRN script for ativan  I had it filled and have used it  times since then  I dont ever want to experience a full blown attack like that again  It came out of nowhere and I think it was a result of a period of extreme stress and two month long family crisis a year prior to my first attack  Now If I recognize that feeling starting I dont hesitate and I use the freakin ativan because I was hestitant to use it at first and I basically had another full blown attack about a week later  again completely out of nowhere  I started a very vigorous and strict workout regiment after that event because the doctor suggested it  and it has helped  All subsequent attacks have coincided with certain busy times when I couldnt devote an hour or more per day for a vigorous workout so Im certain that exercise is the only thing keeping this thing in check  ,0,cdpq1gu,1rq3gs,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

DrNicolasCage,BackgroundI was in th grade taking a wood working class as one of my electives I was using a band saw to cut out a rough shape for a bread knife handle and someone called my name from across the room Now instead of pulling away like a logical person I just turned my head and kept pushing that wood into the saw anyway I ended up sawing straight into my right ring finger up to the second knuckle I didnt cut it off I just kind of split it into two longways I guess it the best way to describe it ResponseWell I felt a quick jolt of pain and jerked my hand back I looked at it held it up to my face and my forearm was immediately covered in blood At this point I couldnt feel any pain so I walked over to my friend and asked Hey man you got a bandaid haha He looked saw my bloodied arm and freaked out and got the teacher I had to run it under cold water for a few minutes then pressure was applied until I got to the hospital I dont remember any pain until after I was out of the ER but it was just a slow throbbing kind of pain I also started shaking uncontrollably felt like I had a stomach ache and tuned pale as a ghost to quote my mother On the plus side I didnt have to write my french final because I couldnt hold a penTLDR Saw cuts finger no initial pain laugh it off but pain sickness etc later ,0,cdppwq9,1rq48t,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

lumpypotato,My SO is Christian I was raised a Hindu but tend to be less religiousspiritual about itIt can be tough when our beliefs clash but the most important thing is to be mutually supportive  my SO understands that I have my beliefs and respects them I do the same for my SO  this is important in a relationship with differing religious beliefs or lack thereofThis is a struggle for some people because their interpretation of religion is such where they might feel that their spousepartners lack or differences in religious belief might actually be a burden on their own relationship with GodReligion  this is kind of a dangerous thing because it can sometimes become my spousepartner is coming between me and GodYou need to have a long talk and really discuss what is important  make it clear you respect her beliefs I assume you do but you want to be able to believe what you feel is right Remind her that we all have to walk our own paths and that you feel I assume that as long as you live a good and moral life you are doing the right thing overallThere will be many conversations to be had if you are serious about your GF  how to raise kids dealing with church etc I know at least a few couples other than my SO and I who are different in terms of religious upbringing and it can work  but both sides need to be open to compromise Ive seen a Christian participating in a Hindu wedding and a Hindu participating in a Christian wedding  it can be done but it really depends on how that other person perceives thingsThis shouldnt be a fight to convince her that you are right or wrong  just a conversation on how to find a middle ground where you can both live your lives according to your own moral grounds without too much conflict people are different conflict is inevitable good relationships are based on finding mutually beneficial solutions to them,0,cdpq25h,1rq5sg,AskReddit,hot,4.0,4

Pleecu,Anyone with natural dreads that has even a bit of self respect washes them with soap and water just like everyone else We dont roll around in mud or  put weird shit on our head so its just hair most people dont anyway Since its essentially long tangled mats of hair you run soapy water through them and squeeze them out and they rinse clean like once a week or so I dont understand why everyone assumes theyre dirty some are but like i said any self respecting person with dreads takes care of them even going through great lengths to do so special oils shampoos and other junkOn the flip side some people who are impatient or ignorant to natural dreads will put dread wax in their hair to achieve the look with uniformity in size and shape this method is fast and somewhat reversible but the wax will cause the dreads to pick up dirt and other gross stuff over time and holds water causing mildew If you see gross looking dreads theyre probably these type which do not clean easily and in fact attract grossnesstldr Natural dreads can be washed weekly quite easily and are usually clean Waxed dreads cheater dreads on the other hand dont clean easily and attract dust and dirt and other crud They also need a TON of maintainence,1,cdpw2me,1rq5v3,AskReddit,hot,4.0,3

awilditguy,Because it brings out the absolute worst in people Personally and this is just me but the entire winter holiday thing is supposed to be about togetherness appreciating what you have and helping others The only of those three main tenets that is touched upon in this Black Friday garbage is togetherness and even then only in the sense of TOGETHER WE CAN DEMOLISH THIS BARRICADE AND GET TO THE TASTY DEALS WITHIN And you better believe that as soon as that barricade raises or comes down all semblance of cohesion is lost as everyone starts running around grabbing shoving and fighting like fucking retards What it comes down to is that this behavior speaks ill of Americans as a whole A casual observer may believe that we are incapable of acting in a manner resembling civility Having worked in  different types of store over the course of  holiday seasons I am inclined to agree You always roll the dice with customer interaction it comes with the territory But in my experience Black Friday dice are weighted to roll snake eyes The ability to get a TV at half price or what have you seems to bring out the worst in people Not just in their wanton destruction of whatever retail environment they may currently inhabit but their treatment of other people as well Id never heard someone actually call a person a cunt with intent to insult until Black Friday Granted I swear like a sailor and jokingly throw that word around like its and but here you will find that it is the baddest of words for some reason I have seen groups of people break out swinging when told we are out of stock on a high demand item Stealing shit out of other peoples carts No civilized person should be acting this wayGranted not everyone acts this way even among those who are habitual Black Friday shoppers I met quite a lot who were just out didnt like the packed stores or long lines but couldnt afford high price gifts if they didnt get them at a Black Friday sale and really wanted to get them These folks were more often than not courteous and understanding and the ones that werent didnt force it too terribly These folks are exempt from my rant They may go and do whatever they must today with no ill will from me Theres a lot more to my hatred of Black Friday than listed above but those are the main points Its not all bad as an idea butTLDR it attracts all the wrong kinds of people and causes them to behave in a way that I find fucking reprehensible ,0,cdpshrq,1rq6vq,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

fabbricator,Best and worst all in oneWent on a solo motorcycle tour from CA to midwest  Ive done this trip several times  I always get the first leg in in one day so cal to Denver  Its  miles exactly  Now motorcyclists usually make this out to be some sort of superachievement but honestly  miles in a day isnt a big deal at allAnyway I left at am things were going great  Im on my Honda VFR with aftermarket padded seat full custom leather suit  Enjoyed seeing the sun rise when i was passing NevedaBy the time I got to Utah it got real cold  Pulled over and rest for a bit  Have some breakfast which attributed to the worst part of the storyThis is the first time I eat on the first part  Unfortunately I didnt count on suffering food coma worst yet food coma while going at mph on the interstate isnt good  By the time I got closer to colorado I was dozing off on the motorcycle  I am now an hour west of Grand Junction Colorado  I realize I am not gonna be able to make to Denver today  I will get a hotel room in Grand Junction its on the way and only an hour away  Or I can go out of my way and get a room in Moab UtI booked it for Grand JunctionI was now riding half dozing off half awakeBy the time i open my eyes i was already in the center divider of highway   Speedo says MPH  Theres dirt and dried brush ahead  I let go of the throttle hitting the brake while at speed in loose dirt is a bad idea but the bushes came up faster than expected and theres no way I can dodge it  Front wheel of the bike hit the bush twists the handle bar immediately and I flew off the bike  I did a few flips before hitting the ground and a few more flips after hitting the ground  At this point i was afraid the bike was going to catch up with me  Thankfully it stopped about  feet behind menow the good partThe traffic stopped and many people got out of their vehicles to help  I couldnt move so they held up a blank over me to shield me from the sun  It was just after lunch time so the sun is pretty brutalAmbulance came and took me to the hospitalAmazingly after an accident like that all i had was a sprang ankleWhile contemplating what to do next one of the drivers who stopped to help at the accident showed up  He offered me the spare bedroom at him and his wifes house and I took him up on it  Seeing that its already late in the afternoon and i have no transportation bike was towed away it will start but unrideable  He let me stayed overnight at his place and drove me to pick up my motorcycle at the tow yard he had a truck and trailer  Some times strangers will do good things for travelers no string attachedCalled a buddy of mine after picking up the bike and he drove up from so cal to pick up me and the bikeIf there ever was a priceless commercial this would be it    custom leather suit  helmet  leather gloves  bootswalking away from a motorcycle going mph to  mph in  seconds priceless,0,cdpqz82,1rq793,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2
LonelyFrenchFry,It is all apart of American mythology stemming from the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolutionary War Even though England had a parliamentary system of government blaming the woes of the people on a group didnt ignite the same firey passion for independence as did blaming one man The Declaration of Independence put blame for the ill treatment on King George III This myth reinforced the ideology that a single person with too much power leads to great evil and the United States Constitution took measures to prevent tyranny from ever taking root in the new union,0,cdpqj4x,1rq7a1,AskReddit,hot,6.0,6

Jabbawookiee,I was in sixth or seventh grade  I and another friend went over to a friends house for a sleepover  I had never stayed over the other friend hadAnyhow we had dinner kinda early pm and planned to walk to the video store after  That didnt happenDuring dinner the friend whose house it was accused his father of being an alcoholic which was true  Further the friend chose this night to tell his parents that he was leaving to find his biological parents he was adopted  The father turned to us rather calmly and told us to call our parents to be picked up  I think we raced to the phone to get out of thereOf course this was sixth or seventh grade  In retrospect I think my and my friends presence made our friend braver but damn that was awkward,0,cdpr1mf,1rq8q6,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

Amadeus,To preempt some criticism which I welcome my goal is to foster discussion I will state that I am American and have been since birth and my family has a long history in the US  This discussion was prompted by discussions last night with my family  My discussion here will focus on the US however but I am sure people from other countries will agree that things are similar in their own countries  I encourage people to add to what I have or rebut my points  After all I can be wrong too but please keep it civil  You can still disagree without being profane or attacking me personally The things that I think need improvement in the USA culture of consumerism  one of the huge reasons why businesses have grown so large and influential is that we have let them do so  One example is the existence of Black Friday and its encroachment into Thanksgiving  Every year people rush to stores to save a few hundred dollars on Christmas gifts I find the idea of fighting someone for the barebones model of a plasma TV and waiting in line for an hour to buy it to be asinine  No one needs something that badly and all the deaths and serious injuries each year are senseless  I feel sorry for the unfortunate souls that have to work these stores over night and deal with insane customers the next day instead of enjoying the company of their families for ThanksgivingFailure to perform ones civic duty  the social contract that all Americans have with their government is that the power of the government is derived from them not the other way around  A government that does not serve its people is not a legitimate government  Many Americans fail to stay informed about what is going on  I am not saying that you need to follow all the happenings of the world but you should know what your local and state governments are doing in a general sense  Also investigating candidates before voting for them and not just voting along party lines is also your dutyLack of accountability and oversight of government  do you know who your state and federal representatives are in your states legislature and in Congress  Do you know what this person doesdid before becoming a politician  Probably not  A majority of politician are probably good in that that they arent embezzling or conveniently awarding contracts to a relatives company or their own but this happens sometimes  A politician can construct the law so that they andor their family comes out on top  Its hard to do anything after the fact because its legal  The recent fiasco of the healthcare law should be lesson that someone needs to be watching and guiding this processLobbying  this the most deleterious and the result of the previous three points  They are inherently selfinterested  Groups like the NRA AARP Cassidy and Associates and many other have undue influence over governmental affairs  Lobbying has its place but its power has grown unchecked and much of what goes on is obscured so that the laity cannot understand what is going on  People should be allowed to form groups to request their representatives help with an issue but the representative should not be pressured because those groups might not support them in the next election or actively undermine them laterElectionsgerrymandering  in this technologically advanced country elections should all be by popular vote the Electoral College is archaic and is no longer needed  In this way the person who is truly favored by the people is the one in office and not the one whos good a playing the system  The same is true for gerrymandering carving out safe districts so that the same people continually get elected leads to stagnation in the government  Campaign finance needs to be reformed  There is no need to spend tens of millions of dollars on a campaign election campaigns should be funded from taxes and private donations should be banned  The defense that contributing to elections is freedom of speech is weak your First Amendment rights end where someone elses begins and downing out other voices because you can write a bigger check is not respecting others rightsBlindly following  just because your pastor parent church political party news channel or other authority says something does not make it true  You must think for yourself and not let others tell you how to vote  It is your right and no one elses any arguments to the contrary are inherently false  I have had friends in college tell me she votes in line with her parents because they support her financially and her father knows which candidate is best so that he wont hurt financially  This again shows lack of civic duty on her part she should investigate for herself  In the end she may decide to vote the same way her parents do but at least she decided to do it  Another good example is the war in Iraq  At its beginning if you did not support the war you were viewed as unAmerican  The Dixie Chicks are a good illustration of how an essentially brainwashed fan base ended their music career granted the girls should have known but still  I doubt many of the people that hated them knew anything about what was going on in Iraq and to this day still probably dont understand what went onLack of foresight  years of borrowing has left the federal government in disarray and threatens to destabilize the economy  Never should the government been allowed to borrow so much money  Government services should be paid for through taxes if you dont want more taxes then you get fewer services  Borrowing money to pay for these is poor financial planning on the part of politicians they should not be advocating for plans that they then dont want to fund by increasing taxes  As a nation we must choose lots of services and higher taxes or fewer services and lower taxes the balance must be foundBeing distracted by hot button issues  gay marriage abortion entitlement programs and others are all important topics that need to be settled but for any of them to be the constant focus of discussion or a deciding factor in who you vote for is foolish  The gays arent going to destroy America by getting marriedPolicing the world  it is not the job of the US to fix every problem in the world and we should stop trying to because it is bankrupting the nation  That is not to say that I dont care about the people of Syria Libya Haiti or whatever other country seems to be on the brink of collapse but we should be encouraging the UN and other nations to facilitate thisArmtwisting  no other country exerts as must influence unilaterally as the US  Economics is how the US manipulates weaker countries into forming partnerships that are mostly in favor of US business  Also subversive actions by American intelligence has played a large part  Go to Wikipedia and look at the numerous things that the CIA has done in Latin America  The people of these countries know this and American armtwisting is a major reason for a lot of disdain

InfiniteAmbiguity,Ive paired several blue tooth devices with my phone including these same wireless headphones that you mentioned  And Ive never had to clear anything out I just need to make sure that I dont have two devices turned on at the same time or else it weirdly and randomly toggles back and forth between the two paired devices that I left turned on  I just paired each one separately  one at a time  and making sure all devices that werent getting paired were turned off  And none of the subsequent pairings required me to erase any earlier pairings  ,0,cdpsszg,1rqcef,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

Enderdejorand,Ive always felt lucky that when I was little I came to live with my dadMy mom didnt have a lot of money is pretty much an alcoholic and has been involved with drugs on and off throughout her life Around my third birthday her sister came down with cancer and she went to Florida to take care of her during her final days My dad didnt believe her sister was sick and he refused to let her take me He assumed that if she left with me hed never see his son again so he immediately went to the courts to petition for custody My dads a lot more stable than my mom Hes always had a job while I was growing up and is relatively well off moneywise Hes always been really willing to help people with his money if he can For example when my halfsiblings from my moms first marriage went to college he helped pay a decent amount of their education costs Hes also helped keep my mom afloat so she can have an apartment But hes never really let me feel like I didnt have to work to get a benefit For instance in high school I wanted to take art classes on the weekends to get formal training on top of my school work For me it was a pretty big cost almost  for a semester of weekend classes I had to work really hard on my studies to justify that type of expense and eventually my dad paid for it I always felt a little guilty that he would splurge on me like that But years later he told me he would have always paid for those classes because he thought I had talent and he wanted me to embrace my talents sort of a donthideyourtalentsunderabasket thingI believe Ive done relatively well for myself but Im always very aware that I could have been raised in a completely different situation People often talk about the privilege that comes from growing up with money and I know that if I had grown up with my mom I wouldnt have had the same opportunities For me college was expected for my halfsiblings college was necessary Thats one big difference among many others that let me know that I was really lucky to grow up the way I did Dont get me wrong My halfsiblings are very successful married and have their own families now They have wonderful lives and it worked out for them But in my mind it worked out inspite their circumstances not because of themTLDR Dad had money mom didnt Lucky to have the resources,0,cdps3ar,1rqcfh,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

Puffsdangerfield,The whole idea of Black Friday is now a farce Rarely does anyone save any real money There is quite a few reasons why If you have camped out for longer than  hours You have probably spent more money in preparation and expenses than you would have saved in the difference between actual and markdown price  Quite a number of items sold on Black Friday are cheap versions Some TVs will be made in a cheaper version just for this special purpose  If you took any amount of time off to shop on Black Friday you have lost pay If you used paid vacation or paid leave you have still lost since that is time you earn  All items sold on Black Friday will be sold at a much smaller price in the off season Look at the cost of shorts in the fall and coats in the spring You also have deals like this for electronics in low buying seasons or when the newest models of anything are about to be rolled out And everyone knows if it is a gaming console you are gambling on the quality of product for the first few months of its roll out Look up the problems with both the XBox One and PS  Same thing as the Windows hype back in the s If you spent money on any object you didnt save anything A TV marked down from  to  didnt save you  dollars you spent  dollars There is also other things like the mob mentality that takes over People are scary in that mode and I avoid it like the plague Besides most of that crap is not needed especially as far as gifts go Its great if you have the money but most dont who the hell needs a waffle maker for Christmas that bad Most of the time it will get used once or twice and then chucked in that place where kitchen gadgets go to die Not worth it ,2,cdpt3b2,1rqchn,AskReddit,hot,14.0,12

LifeGoesOnDude,My first ever throwaway account Never told this to anyone including my Dad and brotherTwelve days after I graduated from college I was taking a shower in my childhood home When I shut off the water I could hear my Moms voice on the other side of the wall speaking softly on the phone Instantly  sure she was cheating on my Dad hard to explain how Shed been acting more distant and dressing better latelyNext day asshole me went through her texts on her phone Saw a guys name a couple times but nothing definitive Up to  or so Two days later went through her email in the middle of the night which she always left open on our familys shared computer The sure moment is the one that sticks I cried drank myself into a stupor confronted her then next morning My Dad and brother are oblivious types but wanting to possibly save them from the pain I was in I coached her how to cover her tracks better for a few weeks Still caught her and scolded her multiple timesShe faked her way through marriage counseling until the inevitable divorce a year or so later twoish years ago She was definitely the favorite parent so life sucked for awhile Getting back to normalish now she moved to a more tropical locale with her new boyfriend visited for the first time last week Life goes onEDIT TLDR Caught Mom helped her cover her tracks in hopes of an amicable divorce,0,cdps93j,1rqcqs,AskReddit,hot,5.0,5

AllButOne,Growing up my mother was never an affectionate parent In fact she was the opposite She only ever paid attention to my sister and I when we had done something wrong and then she would punish us severely A lot of the time our punishments bordered on abuse she used to physically abuse my older half sister but my father would not allow her to touch his own children like that Needless to say I was not a mamas girl and I think I hated her long before the proverbial shit hit the metaphorical fan  Both of my parents were pretty technologically inept but we had a desktop PC in the house that was for me to play games and do homework etc The summer before my senior year of high school I notice that my mother is spending a lot of time on the computer a lot more than normal I chalked it up to her trying to start her own Ebay store she did a lot of arts and crafts type things It started off being a couple hours a day mostly editing her store and adding new inventory Eventually it escalated to her being on the computer before I woke up in the morning still being on when I got home from school and she would still be sitting there when I would go to bed It got to the point where I had to actually fight her to gain access to the computer for homework She went from barely knowing how to work the damn thing to being on there  or  hours at a time I knew something was upTo make things worse more packages were coming into the house than leaving the house Every day she would come home from the post office with three or four packages from various online stores Victoria Secret being the most prevalent If you went into my parents bedroom there would be stacks actual piles of packages that werent even open They were coming in so fast that she didnt even bother opening them all at the time She just threw them on her dresser and went through them when she had the time On top of that she gave herself a mini makeover started getting her nails done once a week and being overly distant towards her family She completely abandoned her responsibilities as a stayathome mom and my father and sister and I often had to fend for ourselves The house fell into disarray there was never any food in the house and there was just packages all over the place always for her My father is a complacent man didnt mention anything to her that I know of and this continued for a couple monthsNow coming from a singleincome household I knew all this shit she was buying couldnt be good for our financial situation The nail in the coffin was when she purchased a brand new laptop for herself and not for her daughter who was going away to college in less than a year She used her newlypurchased mobility to lock herself away in my parents bedroom for hours at a time chain smoke and generally ignore her family  One night I logged on to her gmail account she had the password saved on the family computer and I found HOURS AND HOURS of emails between her and this guy I went all the way back to the beginning of these conversations to see that it all started out friendly enough Asking about theirs lives and so forth my mother being the sociopath she is created this ideal life when really we lived in a pretty shitty area She talked to him my sister and I which infuriated me I guess he was some sort of computerwhiz and was helping her format her Ebay store which is how they started talking  Things did not stay platonic for long He eventually started asking about her relationship with my father and she told him this horrible sob story about how she was an ignored housewife who never left the house by her own choice how my father wouldnt let her get a job which was a lie it probably would have helped how her children didnt appreciate her why would we she was a lazy slob etc Im sure you can imagine where things went from there It started off with some pretty soft corn cybering and escalated quickly to naughty pictures that would be wear all the Victoria Secret packages came in I was appalled I was infuriated Whitehot RAGE seeped through my veins and I wanted nothing more than to watch my mother get hit by a train A train with lots of spikes and barbed wirethat was on fire I hated herI waited a couple weeks checking every now and again to see if maybe it would stop It didnt Finally things came to a head when he started talking about flying up to NY he was from VA on a business trip and that he booked a hotel in our town and he wanted to spend the weekend with her AND SHE AGREED TO I printed out the message and left a note in my dads wallet that we needed to talk and to not tell momWe get in the car to take me to my senior year orientation and he asks me whats up I show him the messages and start bawling my eyes out I dont know what to do or say He just kind of looks at the messages and starts the car and drives me to school He just keeps saying Things are going to be okay Theyre going to be fine I guess he told her the following night the night before my first day of my senior year She was so furious with me for blowing her cover she wouldnt even look or talk to me The following week I hear my mom telling my sister that shes going on a trip with her friend for the weekend but that shell be back on Monday when she gets home from school I run out the door and wait for the bus in the pouring rain instead of letting my mom drive me She pulls up next to me and I tell her to fuck off My dad slept on the couch for a couple months they were obviously separated My mom became more brazen with her affair obviously not giving a single fuck about the feelings of her family the selfish bitch She would parade around the house while talking to him on the phone she locked herself away in her room most of the time and she would go away on trips with her friend often This continued until about February and my parents were passive aggressively at each others throats for months When she finally moved out it was because this scumbag actually abandoned HIS family to move to NY He was renting an apartment in a town about  minutes from us and she was moving in with him She told my sister that she would come see her on the weekends and that when they got settled they would buy a house in our town and she would live with her my parents arent married and my dad doesnt have as many parental rights so my sister didnt have a choice As she finished her packing she walked up to me and said I know you dont approve You can come visit anytime I completely ignored her and she walked out of the house My dad continued to sleep on the couch My poor father my heart breaks when I think about what this did to him He lost weight he became sickly and depressed He tried so so hard to be strong for us to be stoic and supportive but I knew better One day we were driving somewhere and he just cracked He was down at ground zero on  and he had to hide under a firetruck to avoid the debris He pulled over and started crying and said I wish it would have killed me I wish it just would have fucking killed me I didnt even know what to do how to help him I just held him as he cried like a child I didnt see my mother again until she showed up at my high school graduation I rocked my senior year and got a bunch of awards In the middle of the ceremony all the seniors got four flowers to give to their family members I gave one to my father one to my sister one to my older halfbrother and one to my boyfriends mother who was my maternal figure for almost  years at that point I watched as my mother shoved my younger sister at my father and stormed out That was in  I have since graduated from college moved into my own place started a job and I am seriously considering graduate school within the next couple years Coming from a pretty shaky educational background I have come very far and I feel that I have tried to make the best of the situation My father has gotten remarried to the mother of some of my halfsiblings and she is a completely wonderful woman He is STILL paying off the credit card bills she racked up with her impulse buys and weve been struggling for a couple years but were getting byMy mother My younger sister is  now and still lives with her It sounds like shes doing pretty shitty both healthwise and in her relationship with her nowhusband who looks like a sickly skinny Harleyriding Santa Claus I havent spoken to her in years and have no plans to rekindle our relationship  TLDR My cheating whore mother racked up massive credit card debt and then abandoned her family to marry

chrisgond,Prior to choosing the MD route I had declared as a Computer ScienceEngineering major  But in my Freshman year my Grandpa died of cancer and that had a profound effect on my career choice  My family cared for him until the final days where he needed a skilled facility  During that time I took more of an interest in medicine in general and specifically elder careWith that in mind I switched to a BS in Chemistry and a premed path  I never loved Chemistry like I did computer programming but I stuck with it with my eyes on the MCAT and med school  I volunteered at hospitals and worked the night shift at a nursing home to become immersed in the culture so to speakA potential red flag that I missed happened during my time as a CNA  I despised it  At the time I told myself that it was just the gritty truth of nursing home care especially during the night shift but with  hindsight I just hated the work  I soldiered through it graduated and was accepted into three different schools  Score  Hard parts over right  WrongI was always near the top of my class academically but in med school the competition and material became much more intense  I mean several orders of magnitude of intensity  I struggled and it wasnt for lack of studying  The sheer quantity of material and the pacing blew me away  None of it individually was very difficult but the collective amount of material and the frequency of weeklong testing marathons kicked my assIf I had been truly captivated by medicine I think I could have made it but the subject matter turned out to be not all that interesting to me  I grew to hate it and in the middle of Year  after failing a biochem test that I had busted ass for I was despondentI wasnt failing school mind you  I maintained a C average and there were aspects of it I excelled at  particularly Anatomy but I got to thinking about being average at a career I wasnt thrilled with  I got to thinking about being an average doctor and what that meant  Would a patient want an average or slightly belowaverage doctor  My classmates were all about P  MD In other words pass and you get your degree  Another smaller factor in contributing to my decision to leave was the MD lifestyle  high divorce rates high rate of depression brutal hours and high liability insurance  Wait you thought MDs were all rich  Yeah not so much for a small town family practitioner After dropping out I immediately enrolled in a CompSci program   years later I had my degree and was writing code  But now I had a Chemistry degree and lots of medical terminologyconcepts to boost my credentials and I was offered a job from a medical device manufacturer who wanted to send me to grad school  The  in debt was a bitch but it was just money and we chipped away at itI am infinitely happier nowTLDRI could not deal with the thought of being a belowaverage anything especially a doctor with patients lives hanging in the balance  Ultimately that thought and encouragement from my wife brought me to my senses and I dropped out,0,cdpstsc,1rqekv,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

DRDeMello,King Philips WarPeople are generally familiar with the meeting of the Wampanoag nation and the separatist  Pilgrims from England that culminated with the first Thanksgiving in A half century later in  after Plymouth Colony had grown exponentially and southern New England had seem the formation and growth of Massachusetts Bay Colony Connecticut Colony and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantation the Wampanoag went to war against Plymouth  This turned into an allout war of cultures with the European colonies all siding together notable because everyone outside of Rhode Island hated Roger Williams and most of the tribes of the region fighting together the Wampanoag and their traditional enemies the Narragansett along with the Nipmuc and Nauset tribes  Interestingly several Praying Indians gave their loyalty to the colonies and played pivotal roles over the course of the war  Also the Mohegan tribe aligned itself with the United Colonies PC MBC CT and Rhode IslandThe events of the war were incredible  The fighting was done in raids rather than battles the colonists got whipped in the beginning the tide turned in the winter with a massive preemptive strike against the Narragansett who had been neutral but were not trusted there was an attempted alliance with the Mohawk of the Iroquois nation that could have swung the balance of war Plymouth was attacked Providence was burned western Massachusetts was retaken until eventually the outnumbered and outsupplied native coalition ran out of steam  The war ended MetacomKing Philip returned from Iroquois territory to his home at Mount Hope in Pokanoket modern Bristol RI and was shot through the heart by the brother of one of his own men  Amazingly the remaining Wampanoag escaped the raid on Mount Hope by their octogenarian missinge war chief named Anawan  Anawan had known Metacoms father Ousamequin better known as Massasoit which was his title and would have presumably have been alive through the plagues of  the landing of the pilgrims the souring of the relationship between the two cultures and the war itself  Anawan was later captured out in a swamp with the last remaining warriors trying to take back their ancestral lands King PhilipMetacoms body was drawn and quartered and his body parts were hung from a tree  The Praying Indian who shot him got his hand and head as a souvenir he sold his head to Plymouth where it stayed on a pike for over  years untilthe legend goesa Wampanoag climbed up and took it back Anawan was promised safe passage by Benjamin Church the commander of the men he surrendered to but upon his return to Plymouth he was executedThe war was incredible for the historical impact it hadThe war devastated the nations that had inhabited this land  Their cultural influence in the region would not recover  The survivors of the war were either executed or killedNot having a written language much of the native history in the region is now lostand that which we have is filtered through the pen of a colonistIt essentially won southern New England for the European colonists who in a mere  years had arrived and taken complete control of the regionThe modern United States Army Rangers originated during this war  Church organized them amongst the United Colonies and they received training from natives friendly to the colonists  There is a direct lineage to the rangers Church organized to the modern rangersThe fighting was brutal  This was total war that surpassed even William Tecumseh Shermans march through the south  Every man woman and child was fair game and were frequently killed  Towns and cities were targeted fields were plundered and burned and livestock were stolen or slaughtered  It was a war of cultures not a war of armiesThe war galvanized the colonies and their citizens together in a way that was new and unique  Notably absent in the war were the Britishit was American colonists that fought and died togetherThe new spirit of togetherness and selfsufficiency combined with the guerrilla tactics learned through this experience would be revived by the colonists in another major conflict that originated in MassachusettsIn terms of casualties there are some experts who rank this war as the bloodiest that we know of to ever be fought in North America  That is to say as a percentage of population this war possibly killed a bigger portion of the two sides fighting than any other conflictFor such an important and dramatic event Im really surprised nobody has taken on the war in a major audiovisual production  The biggest restraint would be timeto tell the scope of the war the causes the fighting the political ties the long weary terrifying year that it was for both sides the effects etc in a typical two hour film format would be nearly impossible  My own opinion is that youd have to go for a trilogy format which would be an expensive gamble or go with a TV miniseries which until Game of Thrones changed things I wouldve said could never workThere are many moments in this conflict that would translate beautifully to the silver screen thoughThe prelude showing the treaty and Thanksgiving feast as the cultures met and bonded in The arrest and death of Massasoit Wamsutta at the hands of Plymouth didnt even touch on that this is getting long look it up one of the soldiers that arrest him Josiah Winslow later became governor of Plymouth during the warThe meeting at Mount Wachusett where the Wampanoag and Nipmuc decide to make war The violence and brutality of the raids and their emotional impactThe raid on the Narragansett winter fort in the Great Swamp FightThe plea of Metacom to their enemies of the Iroquois ConfederacyThe elderly Roger Williams who was a true friend and ally of the natives watching his city of Providence burn to the ground while the warriors around him spared his life  In a film hed catch glances with a warrior and share a knowing lookThe death of Metacom shot through the heart on Mount Hope by a Praying Indian  You cant make this upin Hollywood theyd call you a sap for overdoing it on the symbolism but this is exactly what happenedThe desecration of native bodies living and dead after the war  Surviving natives bound in chains Metacoms proud body being torn apart a heroic figure who deserved so much better  Then after the credits roll a silhouetted figure climbs the pole to take back Metacoms skull from the pike on which it has been stuckTLDR King Philips War was fascinating and gave New England to the colonists giving them a new American identity in the process whilst destroying the native culture  It would be a sick movie trilogy or epic TV miniseries,1,cdpv168,1rqg4n,AskReddit,hot,15.0,14

YellowOrbitz,Edit I just remembered another one Also I apologize for my bad writing Im on my phone I was with my boyfriend and his older brother in the basement when my boyfriend got a boner However we were under a blanket not including his brother when it happened so it wasnt a big deal Well my boyfriend pulled his pants down to free his boner under the blanket and forgot about it So hes talking with his brother and they get into some playful argument when his brother rips the blanket off my boyfriend My immediate reflex was to hide his junk so I immediately grab it His brother was laughing his ass off and it took my boyfriend a second to remember he pulled his pants down a little It was so weird staring into his brothers eye while holding my boyfriends boner Also Well one day I was crying and talking with my boyfriend when he got a boner We had sex and I actually felt better Another time we were at the mall and I had gotten a new dress We had already had sex so I thought it would be okay to change into the new dress I had gotten Nope instant boner Ill admit I felt very complimented We couldnt leave because we were going to see the movie at the mall and it was too far from the house to get there and back We had sex in the car We missed the movie I dont think it was awkward for me as much as him because he didnt know how Id react I mean Ive never turned down sex from him but I guess he thought Id say no It was really cute too because hed give me the guilty face like he did something wrong Oh and every time we were with his family and he got a boner I know that was definitely weird ,2,cdpt6k6,1rqgeh,AskReddit,hot,3.0,1

toxlab,My first real date was seeing EmpireI saw the original Star Wars as a kid at a drive in theater I sat on the roof of the car with a blanket and there was a meteor shower happening as the movie swung into gear To say this captured my imagination in a big bad way is an understatement Star Wars had my heart And nearly every cent of my whopping two dollar a week allowanceWhen they started promoting Empire I lost my shit I was going to the first show on opening day no question A girl who lived in my apartment complex seemed interested in going as well I knew nothing about girls and most of them seemed kinda prissy and not interested in cool stuff like Godzilla Star Wars and Marvel comics my holy trilogy This girl would play action figures with me and we would have wild adventures in the tall grass behind the building And she never argued with me about rule number one I am always Boba Fett So were cruising Darth and Boba around the parking lot drowning Chewie in a puddle and discussing what we thought was going to happen She seemed sad I asked her if she was going to see the movie She explained that she didnt have the money I thought maybe I could sweet talk my mom into giving me enough for her ticket and told her so We didnt have much but my mom was an easy touch and always went the extra mile to make us happy I told her to hold onto Chewie put Darth and Boba in my pocket and rocketed homeMy mother and her mother were sitting in the kitchen of our apartment drinking tea and chatting I ran over all vim and energy and explained in my breathless manner that the fate of not only our world but the entire galaxy depended on my friend joining me in a galaxy far far away Mom was sympathetic but unswayed I had already gotten an advance on my weekly allowance and she just couldnt afford to give me more My grandma was captivated Do you like this girl She asked Uh huh She can ride bikes real fast and she plays Star Wars with me and she will play Chewie even though nobody likes Chewie Shes radWell Grandma said You should ask her out on a date You can take her to the movies and then go out for dinner And if she likes you she might give you a kissMy mom objected Grandma was always like myself a creature of fancy She was an artist and a flutterbye settling on one new thing after another My mom had to be much more grounded in reality There was no way we could afford this date Grandma took this as a challenge She would pay drop us off at the theater pick us up afterwards and then take us to a pizza place and chaperone I thought this sounded awesome Grandma explained how to politely ask for a date and what a gentleman on a date did Hold doors defer to your dates choice of pizza topping make sure you brushed your teeth so you didnt have stinky breath etcMy heart was glad I could take my friend to what I was sure was going to be the best film ever made I couldnt find it in me to run and tell her because I had all this new information swimming around in my head I had to be a gentleman Would she still like this new meI found her in the parking lot grinding Chewies head against the asphalt We had decided that Chewie would be cooler if he was pointy I told her that my grandma was going to take us Her face lit up I explained that we would go out on a date Immediately she seemed crestfallen I panicked and went into full sales mode We would go see the movie then grandma would come get us and wed go get pizza Two  unbelievable treats in one How could you lose She seemed shaken She handed me Chewie back and said she had to go home I told her that the movie started at four and wed have to get going soon She didnt answer I didnt know what to thinkA little while later there was a knock on my door My friends older sister was there At thirteen she seemed as grown up to me as any adult While my friend was kind of a tomboy her older sister was the super sassy ultra girly girl and I pretty much avoided her because my stomach felt weird if I looked at her too long She asked about the date and I explained my intentions Movie pizza ride home with grandma At that age I hadnt really learned yet how to be disingenuous Older sister explained that younger sister didnt really understand what a date was I told her that I was a Gentleman and knew how to treat a lady Thanks grandma She thought this was adorable She said her sister would be ready at three I was in the living room watching TV when a story about Empire came on The newsreader was standing in front of our local theater and behind her was a line that stretched around the building Still a few tickets left she said Oh no I hollered for my grandmother and told her we had to go NOW She said to get my date and meet her at the carI rang her bell I was half an hour early and was bouncing up and down in anticipation She answered the doorin a dress I had never seen her in a dress before We gotta go I cried I grabbed her hand and we ran to the car As we sat in the back seat of grandmas LTD I realized that she was wearing her sisters perfume A lot of her sisters perfume Huh I said You smell nice Never seen you in a dress before She looked embarrassed It was my sisters idea Stupid I know No I said You look niceWe got to the theater and grandma pulled up to the end of the line She gave us money for tickets and popcorn and told us where to meet her after the film As we settled in for the hour plus wait the capricious Pacific Northwest weather suddenly changed What had been a crisp day suddenly became a massive storm of huge fat snowflakes Neither one of us had a coat After a few minutes of big wind gusts and snow sticking to our skin we were both miserable But dammit Star Wars We huddled together at the corner of the building waiting for the line to moveWhen the doors opened a great cheer went up I flexed my stinging hands trying to work the money out of my pocket The movie began and we saw ATATs for the first time I was entranced When Lukes snow speeder entangles the legs of the great machine I was mesmerized I leaned forward trying to absorb this movie into my pores I set my hand to the hand rest and realized I had put it on top of hers What should I do Do I yank it away Would that hurt her feelingsSuddenly she shifted her arm so that her hand was holding mine She locked her grip in mine This was perhaps the most amazing thing that had ever happened to me Not quite as amazing as Star Wars but stillAs the film went on I was no longer chilly but suddenly quite warm Sweaty in fact My gaze was locked on the screen but I had a tingling where our hands met and this was an entirely alien sensationThen came that great reveal He told me you killed my father I am your fatherI gasped and looked over She was already looking at me She smiled The chemicals in my brain were doing backflips I had a sense of intoxication I had never known beforeThe rest of the date went swimmingly but I told you this long ass story in answer to your simple question because seeing that film in those circumstances left an indelible mark on my soul So yeah you could say it was pretty remarkableTLDR  year old me loved the shit outta Star WarsEDIT wow this gained traction in a big way Thank you for your kind responses I realize now that Boba Fett wasnt an action figure yet and Ive addressed that within the thread I also posted how the date ended upEDIT  Holy moley I answered as many posts as I could before going to bed at  am Woke up this morning to a message avalanche like Id been accepted into Hogwarts Story submitted to rdefaultgems Reddit gold and hundreds of kudos Im stunned This is by far my most successful post in over a year of Redditing Thanks guys Glad you enjoyed I adressed my Boba Fett slipup in the thread That hasnt stopped a ton of people from asking about it Scroll down a little Or click my user name Either way my mistake doesnt change the story much my love for Fett just clouded my mind like a jedi mind trickAs for the girl I also posted how the date ended up scroll downuser name again A lot of people want to know if we got married or some such I havent really added any more info because Im sure that whatever romantic ideals your mind can conjure up will be way better than boring old reality Id rather it remain a mystery from a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

thornae,This was one of the first films I ever saw in the cinema and definitely the first I saw in the big cityI was under  at the time and didnt actually know that much about the previous film The thing I remember most clearly was being confused as to why people were laughing whenever Chewbacca spoke  it made sense to me hed speak like that he was an alien In hindsight its possible that I was missing the jokesI dont think the reveal made much more of an impression on me than the rest of the film  it was a big fantastic story and all of it was incredibly cool and amazing and wonderful and the bit where the bad guy was the heros father just fit right into all that as a perfect part of the awesome climax  and then the film just kinda stopped with a to be continued feel But I didnt really mind and it was an awesome experienceAnd goddamn I loved those spaceships I spent the next few months building them as best as I could with my limited space Lego collection  by big city I mean Adelaide which make anyone who knows their Australian cities chuckle,39,cdpv77t,1rqgfi,AskReddit,hot,255.0,216

Rainstorme,Army officer who commissioned from college here Id highly recommend going the officer route You kind of set yourself behind the power curve on that path by not going through ROTC but it should be possible to still do it through OCS or whatever the other branches call it Recruiters have been able to stop misleading people now that recruitment goals have been dropped drastically but dont trust anything they say that isnt in your contract which means actually read the contract If you have an ROTC program at your school Id go talk to them there theyll definitely help you out and will probably give you advice before you even go to a recruiter If you do try to become an officer make sure you are physically fit because OCS slots are sought after and PT score is usually a major part in deciding who goesAs for branch if you want to do something related to your degree you have to go Air Force or Navy because the Army and Marines will just put you where they need you without regard to what you majored in outside specialized fields like law and medicine It is a lot harder to get into the Navy and Air Force though People tend to get in and not get out like they do in the Army so there isnt as big of a demand for recruitsIf you want to enlist dont expect to do much that would be meaningful work experience in your field but you will have the ability to pick what you do to a larger extent Youll also have to put up with a lot more of the bullshit stuff like cleaning latrines and buffing floors Hopefully an Airman or Sailor will drop by to go over that because I dont really know what their busywork tends to beMy parents were supportive they knew since before I went to college though and being liberal or conservative has little to do with it unless you know your parents are antimilitary Just tell them why you want to join,0,cdpudil,1rqisi,AskReddit,hot,4.0,4

countessdracula,dont believe everything a recruiter tells you  my ex bf is in the navy he joined to serve and he told me a lot about life in the navy  maybe i can give you a slightly different perspective  i also suggest you go the officer route  you get paid much better for your time  the only thing you have to do is to figure out how to survive emotionally and physically and not let any of it get to you  people get separated out due to emotional issues in the navy quite a bit  also going out on a ship is lonely business when youre out on the open water  the ex would exercise  hours a day because there was really nothing bettermore fun to do and if you didnt do that you would be literally at work  hours a day  he was pretty miserable for the most part  being a female in the military you would be in the minority  most of the time there arent issues and the men around are respectful but sometimes there will be problems  whenever the ship docks in port most people run off the ship in a hurry to drink and party and impulsive drunk people dont make the best decisions  his own ships CO was convicted of sexual assault he was drunk  so just keep that in the back of your mind  if youre in a relationship its really friggin hard to keep that relationship afloat when youre gone for months on end  we spent  years long distance due to him being in the navy and it sucked  ,0,cdpxtoc,1rqisi,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

Ursusmisanthropicus,I work in tech so web privacy has become one of my big interests over the past few years Im not quite an expert at it but there are some pretty basic ways to make yourself more anonymous than the average Joe surfing the web Tor BrowserhttpswwwtorprojectorgThis is access to the dark web of lore but also gives you the handy trick of being bounced randomly though a worldwide router network to obscure your IP address You can generate new IP addresses or identities whenever you feel like it Tor is great for when you really want to fly under the radar but I would not recommend it as a daily browser since its default privacy settings will block a lot of regular internet functions such as running scripts although this can be adjusted InPrivate or Incognito browsingThis is a more realistic way to go about your daily business while minimizing the amount of information that is connected to your activity In IE and Firefox its called private browsing and in Chrome its called Incognito but more on Google later Browsing inprivate will not create a history you will automatically be logged out of login based accounts after leaving and ads will not be customized based on your activity  Location InformationIn your browser there should be a setting to disable automatic location detection via GPS or IP On phones there should be an option to disable automatic location detection for anything besides emergency calls Disabling your location will mean that you wont get custom map etc results but it will also mean that you are not tracked as easily I believe most social networks namely Facebook have the option of turning off automatic location tagging in posts Cookies and ScriptsGo into your browser of choice and dig into settings or internet options From there go to privacy or something similar and you should be able to adjust the default level that your browser blocks cookies which track your information Keep in mind that if you block ALL cookies many common webbased programs such as Gmail will not function Adrelated TrackingIf you dont like custom ads there are several ways you can minimize their presence Browsers like IE have a safety dropdown under settings that allows you to turn on a basic tracking protection feature DoNotTrackMehttpdownloadcnetcomDoNotTrackMeforFirefoxhtml is a similar option that you can download for free Finally you can opt out of custom ads by going to the consumer optouthttpwwwnetworkadvertisingorgchoices for online ads and disable customization from several dozen companies that are in the business of using your browsing habits to present custom ads HOWEVER keep in mind that do not track functions are actually a misnomer in the sense that they cannot prevent all tracking of activity they just prevent custom ads that have been created in response to the tracked information Avoid APIs and connections between accountsHave you ever been to a website that offers to let you sign in with your FacebookGoogleOther existing account If you do so it would be connecting with an application programming interfacehttpenwikipediaorgwikiApplicationprogramminginterface which lets the two accounts communicate with each other and exchange information You can think of it as a giant pipe connecting two water towers of information Often allowing one account to connect to another counts as giving permission to a hiddenimplied Terms of Service agreement which then allows the two accounts to share and collect information with each other and occasionally automatically post information example Yahoo posting which stories you are reading to your Facebook account The more you can keep your online accounts separate the more private your information will be and the less risk you have of information being shared and aggregated between your accounts to create a comprehensive online persona That being said on mobile phones APIs are much harder to avoid Avoid GoogleThis should speak for itself but is a tough habit to break Google will track nearly anything you do within its ecosystem YouTube Search Mail Google etc etc and is in the business of connecting all of that information to your online persona If you must  even I have a gmail  do your best to log out of your account whenever possible Googles defaults are to keep you loggedin automatically whenever possible making it easier to collect information Some browsers can be configured to limit the amount of information Google collects but they have famously reverseengineered blocking settings breaking the law mind you even in Apples Safari which was often exalted as a relatively closed and secure ecosystem Back to Chrome Ditch it if you can Because Chrome is Googles proprietary browser they can do whatever they want with it and all other settings I mentioned in other browsers do not apply Assume everything you do in Chrome will eventually be tracked and linked in some way back to any existing Google accounts you have Search off the beaten trackGoogle again tracks all search engine queries whether or not you have a Google account proper location IP address etc Google is obviously one of the best search engines in terms of breadth and accuracy but there are other options If you want to search something without Google tracking it use the native search in Tor or  if you want to stay in a regular browser  DuckDuckGohttpsduckduckgocom They claim not to track queries although your search results will likely be much different than they would have been in GoogleThats the best I can do for now but there are definitely other tricks if you want to go above and beyond The majority of internet users dont even do most of what I listed I recommend researching rprivacy if this is something youre

MrA,My daughter loves Buster Keaton Try One Week for example its only  minutes and is mindblowingly dangerous As for features The General is good Also The Kid with Charlie Chaplin in it and the first twenty minutes of Modern Times my daughter liked then had to leave for unrelated reasons Also Lloyds Safety Last is a good one for children  it has a fairly barebones story thats pretty easy to followIf theyre in to scifi maybe and I say maybe The Cabinet of Dr Caligari or Metropolis though you will have to sit with them as if you wouldnt anyway to help answer any questionsOf course have them watch A Trip To The Moon  its only fifteen minutes and is literally one of the most important films of all time My daughter had me put it on at least a dozen times I usually liked to watch it completely silent she preferred it with Daft Punks original soundtrack for the recent restorationThe Crowd is a nice movie with a warmth to it and Wings is simply spectacular though kind of a lot happens in the first twenty minutes you might have to help them with IE Mary loves Jack Jack loves Sylvia Sylvia loves David Then WWI interrupts their little love triangle and the story expands pretty quickly where you get the little scenes with Schwimpf and the introduction of the enemys flying squadron Its a really nice family feature but will require slightly higher than normal concentration You also might need to read aloud some of the longer intertitles,0,cdpug6o,1rqj5v,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

BunsofthePatriots,Every Saturday a mutual friend of mine and my girlfriends comes over my house and we watch Breaking Bad and have a few drinks and wait for my girlfriend to get out of work so she can join Last Saturday I wanted to try Bacardi  so I bought a bottle made dinner and set up so we could just get to watching when she showed up She showed up but looked like she had been crying so I asked what was wrong and she told me she just had a horrible week and would rather just let it go and have fun tonight So we did we drankand drankand drankand kept drinking until neither one of us knew which was was up She ended up crying again and told me about her work day so I put my hand in her back and told her everything would be okay she told me I was sweet Then she reached for the bottle and even though I was drunk I had a feeling that more alcohol would make things worse so I took the bottle from her and and we locked eyes and kissedIt was one of those passionate drunk kisses that feel great Midway through it my logical side spoke up and told me to stop because what I was doing was wrong so I did Immediately after I had forgotten it happened and was confused as to why she was holding my hand I figured she was just drunk and it gave her comfort I woke up with a hangover the next day to texts from the friend saying she was sorry and how upset she was and how big of a piece of shit she felt like I had no idea what it meant until it clickedholy shit did we have sex I started to panic and flat out asked her she said no and told me that we kissed I was kind of relieved but not fully I had to see my girlfriend so I set out on a drive to her house When I got there she had told me the friend called her and confessed everything She blamed the whole thing on herself to keep my relationship from ending I confessed to my girlfriend and apologized profusely and told her it was a drunken mistake Pretty sure I ended up crying like a pussy but understand that I truely felt terrible for that She forgave me and our relationship is fine Im still upset though the friend came to the conclusion that she had begun to develop feelings for me after spending so much time together and decided she was gonna lay low for a while and hope the feelings go away I feel like such a scumbag and before everyone loses their shit I know alcohol is no excuse ,0,cdpua7t,1rqjpa,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1

redrew,I mentioned this in another comment thread regarding the source of pain in a fractured bone But it definitely fits hereBetween June  and June  I was living with my older brother his SO and her fouryearold Things were going well at first then some stupid shit happened and I ended up losing a really good job hr temptohire internal technical support for a mediumsized company I fell into a pretty deep depression and my cohabitants didnt make things much easier By April  I was contemplating service in the National Guard as a lastditch effort at securing an income and doing something to improve my situation My brother was in favor of the idea for various reasons several of them selfservingHe also didnt take my emotional problems very seriously He would make unsavory comments toward me slights against my intelligence and otherwise make me feel even more unhappy about my current situation He rationalized all of this by reminding me that the drill instructors of the National Guard werent going to coddle me but that wasnt always a valid excuse One day a comment was made that I couldnt let slide I confronted him an argument ensued and he reminded me that if I was really that unhappy living with him I could always leave At that point I wasnt thinking clearly My emotional equilibrium was completely shot and my mental state was volatile I had what could only be described as a complete emotional breakdown Months of anger resentment and selfpity erupted and became misdirected at myself As part of my goal to join the Guard I had taken up an exercise routine that included two pound handweights I had had brushes with selfharm in the past even moments of borderline suicidal tendencies In my emotional distress I felt as though everything I did was a mistake and that no possible course of action could change things for the better I felt like I deserved punishment that pain would make me stronger I took one of the pounds weights and placing my left hand flat on the floor deliberately struck it with one end of the weight I fractured the third metacarpal in my left hand More argument ensued and my brother ended up leaving in order to distance himself from the situation This is probably the wisest choice he had made that day I wasnt sure I had actually broken my hand at that point but I was sure that I had caused a pretty decent bit of damage My hand started to swell and the pain was pretty bad Finally a few hours later I went to the ER had xrays taken and confirmed that I had a commuted fracture which would require surgery to fixate the two pieces in placeI now have two surgical scars on the back of my left hand and a steel pin in the metacarpal Fortunately I did move out of my brothers house shortly after that incident moved back in with our parents and found a suitable job that I enjoy I havent had any further bouts with depression since June and plan to eventually make an appointment with a psychiatrist once I have proper insurance coverage to discuss my past symptoms and hopefully avoid any future problems EDIT I never did join the National Guard In retrospect it was probably a good idea that I didnt considering my emotional problems at the time ,0,cdpxnt0,1rqk1a,AskReddit,hot,2.0,2

PhedreRachelle,Way back in the day me and some friends used to watch videos of this festival all the time We loved the music and we were obsessed with the festival Finally we got old enough that we could travel on our own and actually afford to do so And we started planning to go to this festival This whole time leading up to the festival we had a theme song that really captured the whole concept of the trip for us We looved it We would watch the video from when it got played the last year over and over We would play it on the big speakers over and over Finally it comes time for the trip We get on the plane We get off the plane We get on a train to our hostel We spend some time in the town near to the festival And finally it is timeWe get on this train we go and get in line And then just as I hand my ticket to the ticket checker guy I hear it Our song The one we didnt think wed even get to hear  hour festival with  stages there was no chance right It was playing on the main stage So we walkdanced our way from the gate to the dance floor It was the most EPIC moment It was like we had our own theme song for this start of the thing we all love so much It felt like it went it slow motion and like the whole festival had just been waiting for us SO GOODThat whole trip was amazing We also went to the eiffel tower on a rainy day and the clouds cleared exactly when we got to the top and the sunset was beginning We ran in to the same people in  different countries and those people happened to be from the same city as us Never met them before didnt plan to run in to them so much Just happened And tons more but yah that was a magical journey ,0,cdpuq9f,1rqkrx,AskReddit,hot,1.0,1
