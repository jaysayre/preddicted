Farnswirth,Heat engines require a heat differential to function by definition  However what uJimmyGroove said was correct as well and is merely another way of stating the first law which is  The change in total internal energy in a system in this case an engine is equal to the heat in minus the heat out minus the work done by the engine  This is one of the most fundamental principles of thermodynamics the first lawhttpenwikipediaorgwikiFirstlawofthermodynamicsFor instance you could have a very energetic system with no heat differential eg a cold car with a full tank of gasoline  In this case the heat inside the system the car would be at thermal equilibrium with the outside air because you havent started the engine yet  In this case there would be no heat differential in the beginning  The net reaction for the car as a system would be a conversion of internal energy the chemical energy of the gasoline into work  Its all a question of how you define your system  So to answer your question  a heat engine requires a heat differential by definition because thats how a heat engine works  But depending on how you define your engine thermodynamic system  you dont necessarily need a heat differential for work to be produced  But the energy must come from somewhere and it must have somewhere to goEdit Another good example of a system that does not require a heat differential to do work is a fuel cell which directly converts chemical energy into electrical energy with no heat differential  Obviously this isnt a heat engine but you could definite it as an engine and it is used as such in some vehicles ,1,cdkwnan,1r90aa,askscience,top_week,8.0,7
JimmyGroove,You only get a net flow of heat from areas of high temperature to low so a heat engine could only work off ambient heat if the ambient temperature was different from that of the engine or can be manipulated into being different the most commonly used way being to change the pressure of a gas,0,cdkt7bu,1r90aa,askscience,top_week,3.0,3

Jonex,Not really answering your question  as its already answered  but an interesting additionYou can extract ambient heat energy without having a heat differential  if you add more energy than you extract This is used in earth heating systems where energy is taken from the ground at a few degres to add to the indoor heating at around  degreesTo to this you need an heat pump powered by for instance elecricity There are physical limitations of efficiancy But its a popular way to increase the efficiancy of electricaly powered heatingIm a bit tired so not an awesome explanation someone who has done their thermodynamics more recently can hopefully expand and clear things up a bit,0,cdl4g2a,1r90aa,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

bohrexciton,Thats actually a tricky question The most direct explanation is that ice is slippery because it behaves as being wet ie that there is liquid water between the bulk of the ice and an object gliding on the surface However what causes ice to be wet with respect to objects moving on it is still under debate There was a Physics Today articlehttpscitationaiporgcontentaipmagazinephysicstodayarticle that came out a few years ago that neatly describes possible explanations To briefly summarize them they are as follows Pressure melting Due to the fact that ice at least the common form is less dense than water applying pressure reduces the melting point of the ice To apply this example to say a skater the idea is that a skate bay locally increase the pressure to a sufficient extent that the ice can melt making it slippery locally and the water then refreezes after the skate passes This is the most common explanation that has been invoked historically but the problem is that its not clear whether this additional pressure can be enough to melt the ice Frictional heating When objects move across a surface there is virtually always some friction which results in local heating Again this heat may be enough to melt the ice  This explanation however cant really explain why ice is slippery even for stationary objects immediately before moving  Ice may be intrinsically wet In describing solids we often tend to ignore surfaces to a first approximation because this simplifies the description but surfaces can behave very differently from the bulk In the case of ice its been speculated that the different local environment of the first few layers of water molecules may result in this molecules being less strongly bound to the bulk than is the case for molecules within the body of this crystal Because of this these surface layers may behave as being liquid which would then cause the ice to be slippery under all circumstances ,1,cdl7ngd,1ra493,askscience,top_week,8.0,7

lowrads,The way a substance or in this case a fluid behaves is due to intermolecular forces  Water molecules tend to like stick together under a certain range of conditions which is why only a tiny portion of them volatilizes and goes zinging off at room temperature and pressureSand becomes silt and then becomes clay  Clay has interesting properties owing to its crystalline structure  If you poured some of each of those differentiated silicates into water the sand would settle out first followed by the clay  The middle group silt would actually stay in suspension for longerThe reason for this is charged surfaces  The silicate materials form in sheets  The sheet as a whole tend to have a charge especially as components of the repeating structure are often displaced by differently charged metal ions  Consequently the tiny fragments of sheets tend to stick together due to opposing charges  Ordinarily the charges are too weak between larger particles  The surface area to mass ratio isnt favorable  As the surface area ratio shifts surface charge starts to be more significant whether as an aggregate or a solution  Additionally as the material is ground down the rate of disintegration slows down exponentially  You would think this was odd or inverted given that surface area ratio seems to approach infinity as particle size becomes vanishingly small  The force of mass available for collisions changes in a nonlinear fashion with the diameter of the particle  ,1,cdlavot,1raftj,askscience,top_week,4.0,3

SirJohannvonRocktown,Assuming the particles that make up the substance are sphere the short answer is it depends on the mass volume and number of particles in the substance So how do you determine if its valid to disregard the discrete particles that make up the fluid and model a substance as if its infinitely divisible This is referred to as the continuum approximation and there are mathematical ways to determine if its a valid assumptionThe whole idea behind this is that we can average the random thermal motion of the molecules if the number of molecules are large and close enough Theres a lot that goes into this but heres the gistIf we have a fluid and we take a small enough volume of that fluid say Vl for lower bound well notice that at that volume of the substance the statistical average or any property is meaningless because there is an insufficient number of particles contained in that substance at any given time see httppillarschepittedufilescoursefiguresdensityoscillategifsimilarly there is an upper bound Vu due to non trivial spatial variation in the fluid properties In other words the density will increase nonlinearlyAssuming Vl ltlt Vu we can define the continuum limit of the mass density at a point in a fluid is defined asrho  lim as V gt Vl mVlThis is a good place to say that the density of a fluid can also be modeled asrho  mnwere m is the mass of the molecule and n is the number of molecules for a given volumeThe interesting thing here is that its pretty much meaningless until you look at its geometric context Are these particles inside of a pipe flowing past a wing or doing something elseThe reason this is important is because fluids might or might not behave differently when a property or two are changed For example it might be turbulent or laminar It might be very efficient on imparting and transferring energy to its surroundings or it might act as a damping mechanism This is getting way too long so Ill just try to finish up hereSince we cant know how a particles behaves at all times and under all conditions we have to determine whether the statistical mean is significant or not A dust particle  miles above the earth cant be treated as if its in a fluid where as a baseball in a wind tunnel can,2,cdl8n5d,1raftj,askscience,top_week,4.0,2

onyablock,People can become immunocompromised through various ways including pregnancy viral infection steroid treatment etc etcThe reason it is important when considering vaccinations is that being immunocompromised can increase your risk of obtaining the infection to which youre being immunized against if the vaccine is live virus or being vaccinated can be pointless as no immunity will actually be gained from the vaccineThe effects of an immune deficiency on vaccines varies greatly depending on the vaccine and its application regiment For example it could be recommended that you receive multiple booster shoots or dont receive the vaccine at all if you are immunocompromised In the case of the flu shot obtaining the killedvirus vaccine wont allow you to actually contract the flu however the chances of you generating good and long lasting immunity to the flu is reduced if you are immunocompromised Obtaining the live attenuated vaccine would not be recommended for immunocompromised patients as there is potential for infection hence why the box is thereI hope that makes senseSource th year immunology student,2,cdlcf5d,1rawff,askscience,top_week,17.0,15
tthershey,Live vaccines are generally contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients because these patients will not be able to mount a sufficient immune response to the vaccine  Consequently the live vaccine could induce an infectionInactivated or component vaccines wont put immunosuppressed patients at risk but the patients might not gain much protection from the vaccine  This is because immunosuppressed patients wont be able to generate antibodies to help fight off future infectionsImmunosuppressed patients most certainly need to get vaccinated because they are at greater risk for getting serious complications from infections  Its important for health care providers to know a patients immune state in order to deliver the right kind of vaccine,0,cdlk7wj,1rawff,askscience,top_week,3.0,3
Chandley,Therere three reasons why you need to be immunocompetent when vaccinated  It is rare nowadays for a vaccination to be live amp pose a direct threat some of them may revert to being harmful for example attenuated vaccines commonly have a harmful gene removed before they are given to the host so they can be dealt with by the immune system without any significant risk In some cases the process may not be perfect and so some live unattenuated virus may get into the vaccines so although in theory the virus should not be able to establish itself and replicate it sometimes can and is therefore much more hazardous to immunocompromised patients The same is true for killed virus vaccines  in theory all of the virus should be dead but whatever process they use to kill the virus eg exposure to UV light may be ineffective so again live virus may end up being present in the vaccine and lead to an active viral infection If a patient is immunocompromised there is a possibility that the body will not be able to respond effectively and generate the necessary memory lymphocytes for the vaccine to be effective This would mean that should the person then encounter a live version of the virus the vaccine would not have provided them with any protection at all as the memory cells were not generated at the initial vaccination so are not available to respond Although the vaccine you received was killed the form you filled out was probably written by some legal team at some point in history when they were using a different type of vaccine so theyre basically just covering their own backs and if may be expensive for them to change the documentationI would imagine it is likely a combination of the above  reasonsHope this was helpfulSource Veterinary SurgeonAnatomical Pathologist,2,cdlcbxz,1rawff,askscience,top_week,3.0,1
Urgullibl,The point of a vaccine is to stimulate your immune system into producing antibodies against whatever it is youre being vaccinated against If your immune system is suppressed there is no point in vaccinating as the reaction would not result in protection from infectionIn case of the flu vaccine were talking about a dead vaccine ie there are no attenuated whole viruses in it hence there is no risk of getting the flu from it In case of vaccines containing whole attenuated viruses an immunosuppressed patient might get sick from such a vaccine,1,cdlk4zy,1rawff,askscience,top_week,2.0,1

invariance,No It is simply inconclusive because there exist series which diverge and series which converge for which the ratio test gives  For the series an  n the sum diverges For the series an  n the sum convergesThe ratios are not  in magnitude except in the limit Note also that both ratios converge to  from below A refined version of the ratio test will tell you that if anan gt  for sufficiently large n so the ratios converge to  from above the series will diverge The proof for this follows from what you have already said So in fact the only inconclusive case is if the limit of the ratios converges to  from belowSo the short answer is that if the limit of the ratios converges to  from below the test is inconclusive because there are examples which converge and examples which diverge ,2,cdlud5b,1rawis,askscience,top_week,7.0,5
iCookBaconShirtless,The issue is not which direction that the limit is approached as you conjecture  While approaching  from above assures divergence approaching from below does not assure convergence  A simple example is the harmonic seriesThey key to understanding the ratio test is to more precisely understand this statement that you made  gt I understand what happens when the limit is smaller than  every element of the series is smaller than the previous by a factor L hence the series tend to stabilize and convergeThe fact that every element of the sequence is smaller than the previous by a factor of L at least in an asymptotic sense implies that the sequence converges to zero exponentially fast  Basically it looks like a geometric series at large n  This exponential convergence of terms is enough to ensure that the series converges but its strictly stronger than what is needed  Plenty of series have terms that converge more slowly than exponentially but still converge as a series  Any pseries with pgt for example eg n tldr Ratio test determines exponential convergence of terms which is more than is needed for convergence of series,0,cdlv91r,1rawis,askscience,top_week,4.0,4
wgunther,In order to understand the ratio test you have to understand the proof The proof is if the ratio anan goes to Llt then eventually the of consecutive terms is less than epsilon for some small but positive epsilon and therefore the series is smaller than the geometric series aepsilonn for some suitable a Thus it converges by direct comparison If Lgt then you can do the same thing but with epsilon The problem is this proof doesnt work if L The ratio test will only work when the sequence of the summand of the series converges faster than something geometric whose series converges or slower than something geometric whose series diverges In the case when L one can not compare the series to a geometric series that converges or diverges ,0,cdmmc8x,1rawis,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

miczajkj,In fact this is something that can happen but not for electrons You may know that there are three generations of quarks and leptons while our universe consists mostly from the first generation up and downquarks  electrons and electronneutrinos But there are certain natural processes that produce particles from higher generation for example the cosmic radiation in the earths athmosphere The electron equivalent in the second generation is the muon  and if you construct muonatoms your question gets importantLike the others already mentioned orbiting electrons or muons dont really orbit the nukleus their position gets described by a probability density those densities are the absolute squares of the particles wave function If you calculate those wave functions you find that the probability density of the ground state has its maximum at the classical Bohr radius that can be calculated by using a semiclassical force approach for muonic hydrogenium Let the CoulombForce ℏαcr equal the centripetal force pmr Also keep in mind the the uncertainty principle pr  ℏ It followsℏαcr  ℏ mr r  ℏαmcNow because the mass of the muon is  times bigger than the mass of the electron therefore its Bohr Radius is  times smaller and if you also consider the finite circumference of the proton it is possible that the muon may have finite probability to be found inside of the nukleus especially if you talk about heavier nuklei The main consequence is a displacement of the energy niveaus This fact was used to find the much used formular   fm  A for the radius of the nukleus depending on the Mass number Another consequence is the increased probability of decays like the Kcapture where a muon from the Kshell reacts with a protonµ  p gt n  νµ,0,cdlsooe,1rb1wp,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

JohnSmith,Theres sort of two features going on here the macro and microscopic so Ill detail them bothThe light first passes through the pupil and lens which focus it in particular on a small patch of the retina known as the fovea This is where the concentration of cone cells those which detect colour is highest You also have a lot of rod cells just detect light generally more sensitive in dark settings here but theyre more common as you move away from the fovea Collectively rod and cone cells are photoreceptors These photoreceptors are hooked up to bipolar cells horizontal cells and ganglion cells which together do some initial processing of the image before it passes down the optic nerve to the brain Interestingly because the horizontal bipolar and ganglion cells are actually between the retina and the pupil the optic nerve has to travel through the retina which creates a blind spot in each eye about degrees offcentre which your brain lies to you to fill inOn the microscopic level photons travel through the eye to the retina where some encounter either rod or cone cells In rod cells there is a stack of plates which are coated in an enzyme called rhodopsin When a photon is absorbed by rhodopsin it changes conformation and can activate another protein known as transducin Transducin is what is known as a GProtein when activated it in turn activates another protein in turn which then changes cGMP a small second messenger into cGMP This leads to a closure of Na channels This hyperpolarises makes more negative the cell Neurons only release neurotransmitter when they depolarise so this reduces the release of neurotransmitter Im not familiar with the exact pathway in cone cells it is photopsin rather than rhodopsin which absorbs the photon but otherwise I believe it to be generally similar This whole process actually takes quite a while about ms from memory between when the photon hits and when your photoreceptors sodium channels close This is because of the protein cascade which occurs it takes time However it does greatly increase your sensitivity to light A single rhodopsin can activate  transducins which will in turn do  cGMPs each This will close  sodium channels stopping  ions and hyperpolarising the cell by almost a mV That is to say your eyes are actually very sensitive to lightIntriguingly photoreceptors are actually inhibitory neurons they release a neurotransmitter which hyperpolarises other neurons As such when a photon is absorbed their rate of firing decreases which increases the firing rate of bipolar cells The rest of the neural pathways are way over my head but it involves receptor fields and the other accessory neuronsEdit Source Im a nd year physiology student  L Sherwood Human Physiology From Cells to Systems th EdnAlso Ive left out a protein or two in the signalling pathway but in terms of answering the question I think its sufficient,0,cdlu2z4,1rc9cl,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

Ruiner,This is a cool question with a complicated answer simply because there is no framework in which you can actually sit down and calculate an answer for this questionThe reason why know that photons travel at c is because they are massless Well but a photon is not really a particle in the classical sense like a billiard ball A photon is actually a quantized excitation of the electromagnetic field its like a ripple that propagates in the EM fieldWhen we say that a field excitation is massless it means that if you remove all the interactions the propagation is described by a wave equation in which the flux is conserved  this is something that you dont understand now but you will once you learn further mathematics And once the field excitation obeys this wave equation you can immediately derive the speed of propagation  which in this case is cIf you add a mass then the speed of propagation chances with the energy that you put in But what happens if you add interactions The answer is this classically you could in principle try to compute it and for sure the interaction would change the speed of propagation But quantum mechanically its impossible to say exactly what happens during an interaction since the framework we have for calculating processes can only give us perturbative answers ie you start with states that are noninteracting and you treat interactions as a perturbation on top of these And all the answers we get are those relating the in with the out states they never tell us anything about the intermediate states of the theory  when the interaction is switched on,209,cdlyfi3,1rccq1,askscience,top_week,1149.0,940

bloonail,A photon can be modeled in the classical sense somewhat like a kink in the electric field that has become detached from its source as the source retreated So a rotating electric charge can emit photons because the electric field cannot collapse back on the moving charge as the charge recedes That portion of the field that is withheld from collapsing by relativity is released as a photon However more accurately the electromagnetic field is maintained by photons It only exists through them as a mediating particle The field measured at any point in an electromagnetic field is measured in photons In the situation of a static nonmoving charge the photons are in a r relationship through radio waves to their point of origin but those photons do spread out infinitely at the speed of light from that pointThe kink idea is an unsatisfying s modelhttpmeetcommediafpdf but it hints to some degree how the photon is released at the speed of light It is by nature at the speed of light at least in this model because it is energy that has separated away due to kinda getting lost in space and unable to retreat back onto its charge It is lost because the electric field is expanding at the speed of light Its a weak model Its useful mostly for showing how high energy photons are created by sudden acceleration changes It explains antennas at a very basic level The photons exist as a field at all times they become higher energy photons through accelerationsI like the notion that all photons are the same It is really only our reference frame that changes their energyAs for the question of whether they accelerate Its sort of related to the permittivity and permeability of free space These can be complex numbers or tensors and as they compose the speed of light the speed of light varies The speed of light in some crystals httpwwwsciencedailycomreleaseshtm is different for different directions and all are different from what it is in free spaceHowever in no sense do they accelerate to light speed in the way a Mercedes might accelerate on the autobahn like I know Theyre at the speed of light in that medium always Their acceleration is more akin to their changing wavelengths They gain energy by becoming associated with a reference frame that is different So for example gamma rays hitting us from gamma ray bursts in the old style classical viewpoint somewhere that gamma ray was a radio wave emitted from something that is going very close to the speed of light relative to us Its not an accurate description  but the truer descriptions are moderately dense tensor calculus and quantum theory,9,cdm4wev,1rccq1,askscience,top_week,12.0,3

cromonolith,The only thing stopping this from being intuitive to you is what bigger means Youre used to judging the sizes of things by counting each of them and comparing the numbers That is if I gave you two bunches of apples you might count and see that there are  apples in the first bunch and  in the second and conclude that the second bunch is bigger Thats fine but its not a good way of measuring the size of infinite collections So heres a better way of comparing the size of two collections make a pairing between the collections and the one that has stuff left over is bigger As an example lets say we had a huge auditorium and a huge crowd of people who want to see a show there Whats the best way to see if we have the same number of seats as people You can count the seats and the people but thats dumb The smart thing to do is to tell everyone to sit down As long as no one sits down stupidly two people in the same chair then you can easily check If there are empty seats left over there are more seats than people If there are people left standing there are more people than seats What does this have to do with infinities Well this kind of pairing like pairing people with seats is a function If no two people sit in the same seat the function is called injective or onetoone If no seats are left unoccupied the function is called surjective or onto If a function is both injective and surjective one person to a seat and all the seats are filled the function is called bijective Bijective functions are what we use to compare the sizes of all sets including infinite ones Two sets are defined to be the same size if there exists a bijective function between them So for example the set of all natural numbers N       is the same size as the set of even numbers N       because as you can check multiplication by two is a bijective function from the former to the latter That is the function f where fn  n hits every even number and never sends two numbers to the same even number On the other hand you might want to compare the set of natural numbers as above to the set R of real numbers the whole number line This isnt obvious but theres a relatively straightforward proofhttpwwwmathpagescomhomekmathhtm that no matter how you try its impossible to make a bijective function from N to R so they cant have the same size Since N is actually a subset of R we say the size of N is smaller than the size of R ,1,cdlzcjv,1rcjr9,askscience,top_week,18.0,17
rlee,There are several notions of size when it comes to infinity  The most common is cardinality which in lay terms asks whether one infinity can be fit or more formally mapped into anotherFor example if you have a list of the positive integers there is a way to place a rational number next to each positive integer in the list in such a way that each rational number is next to some positive integer and vice versa  We would formally call this a bijection between the positive integers and the rational numbers and it would demonstrate that the two are the same cardinalityCantors diagonal argumenthttpenwikipediaorgwikiCantorsdiagonalargument shows that any attempt to match up the positive integers with the real numbers will necessarily miss at least one real number  Thus the of real numbers wont fit into the poisitive integers and thus have a larger cardinality than the positive integers and are a bigger infinity,1,cdlznix,1rcjr9,askscience,top_week,2.0,1
protocol,Heres another way of thinking about it Any natural number can be represented by a finite amount of information For example you can write it down in base  as a finite string of s and sHowever a real number has an infinite string of digits past the decimal point so theres no guarantee that any particular real number can be expressed using a finite amount of information And in fact most real numbers cannot be uniquely identified by any finite amount of informationSo intuitively its the difference between finitely many versus infinitely many degrees of freedom Since specifying a single real number can involve an infinite number of choices of digit there are vastly more real numbers than natural numbersThis is just a vague intuition though You can make it precise using information theoryhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiInformationtheory but thats rather technical Instead heres how to see very quickly that some infinite sets are larger than others  in particular that given any set finite or infinite theres another set thats largerBy definition two sets have the same cardinalityhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCardinality basically size if they can be put into onetoone correspondencehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBijection with each other  that is if you can pair up elements of the sets so that each element of one set is paired up with a unique element of the other setTheorem CantorhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCantorstheorem Let S be any set and let PS be the set of all subsets of ShttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPowerset Then S and PS do not have the same cardinalityProof Let f be any function from S to PS that is for each element x in S we assign a unique element fx in PS Since each fx is a subset of S we can ask whether x is an element of fx In particular let T be the set of all elements x of S such that x is not an element of fxNow we can ask is there some element y in S such that fy  T Suppose there was then we can ask whether y is an element of T If it is then y is an element of fy so by the definition of T y is not an element of fy  a contradiction If it isnt then y is not an element of fy so by the definition of T y is an element of fy  again a contradiction Therefore its impossible for such an element y to exist So no element of S is paired up with TThus any attempt to pair up elements of S and elements of PS fails which means that S and PS dont have the same cardinality But we can embed S inside PS by sending each element x in S to the singleton sethttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSingletonmathematics x a subset of PS So in fact S is strictly smaller than PSNotice that theres no mention of whether S is finite or infinite If S is finite with n elements then PS has n elements So the proof is valid regardless meaning that its true for infinite sets tooFor instance if we denote the set of natural numbers by N then PN is strictly bigger than N Actually it turns out to be the same size as the set of real numbers And the set PPN is bigger than that and so on,1,cdlzsre,1rcjr9,askscience,top_week,2.0,1
shiningPate,First this effect only occurs in a vacuum In air the gas molecules rapidly absorb the emitted electrons Basically the reason xrays are emitted is because of the static electricity generated by separating the tape film from the surface below it As the tape is pulled away an electrical field is formed at the point of separation As the roll rotates away the film separates from the layer below it reducing the strength of the field between the point that just separated and the point at which it was previously touching Meanwhile a new point has just separated from the roll and higher strength field is formed at that point The result is an electrical field at a gradient intensity in the wedge between the roll and film At the point of separation the field strength is so high electrons are ripped away from the film material The film material was also electrically charged as part of the manufacturing process to get it to roll up smoothly Electrons emitted into the gradient electrical field will begin accelerating along the gradient Accelerating electrons emit xrays,0,cdm2gu7,1rcmj7,askscience,top_week,3.0,3

KerSan,Energy is a consequence of a symmetry in the laws of physics This is a deep point so let me try to explainIt is first worth explaining probably the most important concept in physics momentum Early on in your education you are told that it is simply mass times velocity This turns out not to be true generally because momentum is really what is called the generator of translationsConsider a point particle that has a definite position in space That position is actually an arbitrary label since it refers to your chosen coordinate system rather than some actual property of the universe You could just as easily switch coordinate systems by say moving the origin of your coordinates somewhere else This action of shifting coordinates is called translationNow let us suppose that the particle is moving relative to you the observer No matter which coordinates you chose you will notice that the position of the particle is changing over time If you want to predict where you will see the particle next you need to translate the last known coordinates of the particle by some amount That translation is determined by the momentum of the particle Keep in mind that the momentum is not changed when you translate your coordinate system The momentum is in a technical sense dual to positionWhat does this have to do with energy Well energy happens to be the generator of translations in time This is because energy is defined to be that quantity which remains invariant under translations in time much as momentum is that quantity which is invariant under translations in position Your coordinates for time are just as arbitrary as your coordinates for position because your choice of starting time is your choice and not some property of the universeEnergy therefore tells you something about how quickly the properties of an object change over time The more energy the faster changes can happen I could write essays explaining this further but I dont want to lose youWork is the addition or subtraction of energy from a system That energy can be added in a variety of ways but it is common in early physics education to think in terms of force rather than energy Energy is actually more fundamental than force so Ill explain the force times displacement rule by first explaining force in terms of energyForce is the derivative of potential energy with respect to position If you think of the potential energy of a particle as a function of the position of the particle for instance gravitational potential varies linearly in the height of the object then force experience by the particle at a given position is the slope of the potential function at that position In other words force is the negative change in potential energy ie the work divided by displacement in an infinitesimal sense Multiply both sides by displacement and you have the relation work  force  displacementHope that helps,2,cdlzluj,1rcojz,askscience,top_week,7.0,5

ofeykk,I am going to attempt to translate as best as I can your problem into a mathematical question I suspect you are making a bunch of assumptions here which I will try to make more formalFirst with the view of simplifying as much as possible yet retaining the crux of the original problem you can make the following assumptions removing each would yield a slightly different problem to solve Look for curves not in space but in space Simplify curvature of earth to be flat  seek planar curves Simplify sun to be on this flat plane as a point Simplify yourself to be a point on the sought curve  degrees view is equivalent to dividing the plane by the tangent to the curve at your location point Choose an orientation for the curve This helps fix what it means for a point to be in your field of view or equivalently to be in the correct half space of the tangent to the point you on the curve Parametrize looping around the curve to be traveling along the unit interval   with the end points  and  identified  essentially a fancy way of saying that the end points of the interval are glued Assume that the sun is fixed relative to the time taken to loop around the curve once Finally is the curve sought smooth or not  A circle is a smooth curve whereas a triangle isnt one I believe its easier at least for me to imagine smooth curves Also will exclude wild curves like space filling curves simply because I am not comfortable dealing with those Now the question is to find a curve that maximizes the view of the sun when you loop around onceIt appears to me that solution would depend on whether you would wish to make a further assumption about whether your plane is unbounded or not If the plane is unbounded the answer is simple  any straight line not through the point representing the sun would doIf the domain on which the curve is sought is compact or technically if its closure is compact  think finite if you wish like a square plot or a circular plot of land  then it depends on where the sun is located relative to this domain Some examples that come off the top of my mind are as follows Circular region with the sun in the center Take any diameter and take a tube around the diameter This tubular region would have a boundary curve composed of two straight lines chords of the circle with a small part of the circulars plots boundary two of these actually You can make this tubular region as small as you please and would provide you with a curve for which the sun is visible for as long as you please In other words give me a number for which you wish the sun to be visible say  and I can give you a width of this tubular region for which it would be realized Make it  and Ill give you a different number for the width and so on A circle with the sun not in the center Use the same idea as in example  Drop a radius from the center of the circular plot to the boundary that passes through the sun Measure the distance say r from the sun to the boundary of the circle Draw a smaller circle within the larger circular plot with radius r and centered at the sun Repeat example  A square with the sun at the intersection of the diagonals Repeat example  with the a circle of length equal to the distance from the sun to any one of the vertices of the square A square with the sun not at the intersection of the diagonals Easier to say that one should fall back to example  but rather simply draw a circle centered at the sun with a radius equal to the shortest distance from the sun to the boundary of the squareCan go on but would stop here I have to say that I did this as a fun Sunday morning exercise and tried to reason mathematically which may or may not have been what you were looking for  I enjoyed it though  ,0,cdlztop,1rctma,askscience,top_week,4.0,4

UnquietTinkerer,If the solid object is a parked car then the two collisions are essentially the same  In the headon case the two cars end up at rest at higher speeds they might disintegrate and send debris flying everywhere but mph is slow enough that the cars could just crumple  In the other case the mph car would hit the parked car and the combined wreckage would continue moving at approximately mph down the road until friction or some other force stopped it  In both cases the change in momentum for the passengers and the total kinetic energy released in the collision would be identicalIf the solid object is something like a brick wall then it could stop the car abruptly resulting in a much greater change in momentum and release of kinetic energy  This would be much more damaging to the car and its passengers  I dont see the profit in this comparison though  A more interesting question is whether its whether its better to hit a car headon both traveling at mph vs a solid wall  In both cases the you would end up stopping abruptly but hitting the wall releases less kinetic energy and so would be less damaging,0,cdmijd2,1rd53a,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

tthershey,gt Dr Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the US is already extremely low and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States  In fact  of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year and the number rises to well over  in two yearsWhile it is true that the chances of getting cervical cancer are low the vaccine does prevent a cancer which is amazing   Very few cancers have the potential of being eradicated like this  Not all strains of HPV are covered by the vaccine and not all strains of HPV cause cancer  So on the plus side those scary statistics about how prevalent HPV infections are can be misleading because the actual incidence of cervical cancer is low even among those who get infected with HPVAnogenital warts are mostly caused by HPV  and   This lesion is usually benign not cancerous  Most cervical cancer is caused by HPV  and  but there are some other less common strains of HPV that can also cause cervical cancer  Gardasil protects against HPV  and  which prevents  of cervical cancersgt All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged  and above despite them currently being marketed for yearoldsNot true heres an example httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedgt So far  girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasil alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions  At the time of writing  girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines  The reported side effects include Guillian Barré Syndrome paralysis lasting for years or permanently  sometimes eventually causing suffocation lupus seizures blood clots and brain inflammationI would have to see the source for this claim to make any specific comments but in general I can say vaccines are tested very vigorously for their safety  It has to be expected that some people will suffer health consequences after receiving a vaccine  Many of these people might have suffered those consequences whether or not they had received the vaccine because they had some preexisting conditions and some might have rare diseases that make them more susceptible to complications  But serious complications from the vaccine are raregt Studies have proven there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent but it is marketed to do that nonetheless  In fact there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer  From the manufacturers own admissions the vaccine only works on  strains out of  for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteoriteThis is simply not true  The vaccine has been proven to prevent HPV  and  which prevents  of cervical cancers  The CDC is a reputable source for information on this httpwwwcdcgovSTDHPVSome more info key genes in HPV  and  are E E and E  E and E when activated disrupt cellular defense mechanisms that kill off cells that might become cancerous  E and E are normally repressed by E  HPV infects cells by integrating the viral DNA into the host cell human DNA  HPV can insert itself into the human DNA in many different positions and where it inserts itself is as far as we know random  If HPV inserts itself in a way that disrupts the E gene then E and E are free to disrupt the host cells defense mechanisms leading to cancerSo if you get an HPV infection you might get a strain that doesnt cause cancer  Or you might get a strain that does cause cancer but the HPV inserts itself in a way that does not result in cancer  But you could be one of the unlucky people who gets HPV  or  that integrates in such a way that causes the cancer  So yes getting cervical cancer from HPV is rare but you dont know if you are going to be one of the unlucky ones or not,7,cdm2tjm,1rd56j,askscience,top_week,44.0,37

ultimatety,The answer to this is actually more complicated than you would think  It all boils down to the fact that the surface layer of the ice underneath the object is partially melted  However the reason for how this top layer melts is somewhat of a scientific controversy  People used to believe that the pressure exerted causes the ice to melt however this appears to be false  The two current theories are that  The friction of the moving object causes the top layer of the ice to meltor  The top layer of water molecules are unable to bind correctly to the layers underneath and thus stay in a quasi waterlike stateTLDR There is a little bit of liquid water on top of that ice and liquid on top of something smooth makes it slippery,3,cdm1crb,1rd6cm,askscience,top_week,19.0,16

GlowInTheDarkDonkey,My understanding as a uh oh layman is that a person on a swing is basically taking advantage of angular momentum in the same way a figure skater tightening their limbs in a spin makes them spin fasterA shortening of the total length of the swinging body on the upward swing means gravity is being applied to a total body that has less distance to travel is a shorter swingarm and then on the downward swing the thrusting of legs outwards allows gravity to work on a longer swinging body which again is then shortened on the upward movementSome of the angular momentum of the legs themselves also adds to the total forces being shifted aroundWhen someone is standing on a swing seat youll notice they put all of their mass to the seat on the downswing and then they stand on the upswing  This similarly means gravity is pulling a longer swingarm in terms of average mass distribution towards the outermost edge of the arm on the downward stroke compared to the upward strokeIm curious if someone in a whitecoat finds this answer agreeable or not,6,cdmdqxr,1re182,askscience,top_week,5.0,-1

masiakasaurus,StringOfLights hit the most important points but Id like to stress that every animal is a different case and the more you look into a particular species youll see different or additional reasons for the size they had While an old source  Björn Kurténs Pleistocene Mammals of Europe and I guess its companion New World book Pleistocene Mammals of North America by the same author though I have not read it makes a good recap on ice age mammals Lets see some of the animals you citedFirst of all mammoths There were different species of mammoths and they have been cursed with being described as gigantic in popular literature but they were really not that big The biggest species was the Eurasian steppe mammoth Mammuthus trogontherii followed by Mammuthus columbi its North American descendant whose males topped at  meters  feet tall The biggest African elephants are about  meters tall or a little more M trogontherii and M columbi didnt live in the tundra however but in temperate grasslands to the south Whats more M trogontherii wasnt an ice animal proper as it was common during the Cromerian or GunzMindel interglatial  years ago a warm period between glatiations M trogontheriis Eurasian descendant the more famous woolly mammoth M primigenius was adapted to the glatial steppetundra and thrived during the cold periods It was a smaller animal than its ancestor no bigger than modern elephants Kurtén gives a height at the shoulder for the Late Pleistocene mammoths who lived through one of the coldest periods of the Pleistocene as  feet or less There is no doubt however that the woolly mammoth was the biggest animal of the tundra but it wasnt the giant mountain it is made out to be in popular imagination and it is plausible that its decrease in size from its predecessor is a result of living in a poorer environment with less foodDire wolves despite popular image as well were no bigger than grey wolves either This confusion stems from the fact that dire wolf jaws and teeth were larger and more adapted to bonecrushing than grey wolves making them ecologically analogous to Old World hyenas Indeed while hyenas inhabited Eurasia and Africa during the Pleistocene and coexisted with wolves they never reached America so the direwolves occupied their niche here and in fact coexisted with grey wolves who looked after different prey than them The grey wolf of Late Pleistocene Europe is slightly bigger than modern European wolves but then again modern wolves in North America are also on average larger than EuropesGiant Sloths are rather weird as they have no living equivalents and Im not as familiar with them but once again the biggest ones ever dont come from colder areas Wikipedia yes I know has Eremotherium Georgia Texas Mexico and Megatherium subtropical South America as  meters long The ones that lived in colder areas were smaller Mylodon Patagonia and Megalonyx Central America to Alaska and Yukon peak both at  meters half the lenght of the othersCave Bears were not particularly related to brown bears if anything they were closer to black bears and coexisted briefly with brown bears who originated in Asia cave bears are exclusive to Europe Cave bears were mainly vegetarians and didnt live in tundra either but in temperate forests and became extinct as the continent became colder about  years ago almost like the neanderthals I dont have size data right now but from what I recall they arent that big compared to brown or polar bears someone correct me if Im wrong please and once again this seems to be a confusion born of the fact that they are more robust and massive looking Brown bears in cold periods of the Pleistocene are on average bigger than brown bears in warm periods including modern brown bears howeverCave lions were indeed on average bigger than modern lions but still the same species While cave lions lived in the Pleistocene in Eurasia and Alaska modern looking lions who are not descendants of the former according to DNA were in Africa and probably the Middle East The American cave lion was bigger than both but its taxonomy is in discussion and could have been a whole different beast altogether hehe more related to the jaguar Like mammoths and unlike wolves and bears however Eurasian cave lions are biggest in the Cromerian and become their smallest in colder periods especially near the end of the Pleistocene Some European lions get so small that it has even been suggested that the cave lion became extinct before it is commonly assumed to and was replaced by modern lions from the Middle East belonging to or closely related to the modern Indian subspecies one of the smallest living lions by the way On the issue of cats leopards which lived in Europe through the Pleistocene and cheetahs are also bigger in warm periods and get smaller in colder periods while lynxes and wildcats do the opposite Im not sure why I have to say though that the European wildcat of Late Pleistocene Europe is similar in size to the modern wildcats of southern Spain which are bigger than other wildcats in the continent yet are more southernly distributed than them Confusing ehAurochs were like cave bears temperate animals that didnt live in the tundrasteppe where they were replaced by bison and are most common in interglatials Wild aurochs dont seem to have been any smaller than they were in the Pleistocene Julius Caesar said that aurochs were the size of elephants Mind you this is the extinct North African Elephant which was smaller than an Asian elephant and closer in size to a very big horse but it gives an idea of how massive they were compared to its living descendant domestic cattle Thats a key as to why they became smaller domestication Humans selected the smaller better manageable aurochs and this is why the species decreased in size with no relation to climate Had cattle not been domesticated or aurochs not been hunted to extinction just like we have wolves and dogs living side by side today wed have aurochs bulls of  meters at the shoulders The biggest living bovine the gaur Bos gaurus of southeast Asia not a descendant of the aurochs can surpass  metershttpwwwultimateungulatecomartiodactylabosfrontalishtmlSo it seems that in a lot of cases your hunch is actually right and lack of food and other factors

drzowie,A superadiabatic gradient is what drives convection  the free energy that gets converted to mechanical flow comes from the positive difference between the gradient and the adiabatic lapse rate  Convection will happen at some level with any nonzero excess in the lapse rate above the adiabatic rate since the material is a fluidIn practice the actual lapse rate doesnt get driven exactly to the adiabatic rate but its pretty darned close  The actual offset is driven by the balance between heat flux and effective turbulent viscosity in the fluid  Since stellar plasmas arent known for their high viscosity and the scales are large the offset turns out to miniscule negligible by orders of magnitude in nearly all cases  so you can treat the adiabatic lapse rate as a strict limit and be good to goLets apply your example of  superadiabaticity to the Sun   The convection zone spans about  orders of magnitude or about  scale heights in densityhttpsolarphysicslivingreviewsorgopenpubNolrspampamppagearticlesehtml  If the lapse rate differs from adiabatic by  part in  that corresponds to a temperature differential factor of exx compared to ex across the whole convection zone  so if you assumed the lapse rate was exactly adiabatic but it was really x times the adiabatic rate and you knew the photospheric temperature exactly your calculation of the temperature at the base of the convection zone would be off by a factor or x  Other effects like convective overshoot and dynamo action enter at the  level so the superadiabaticity is negligible,0,cdmo4bd,1reh81,askscience,top_week,1.0,1
LoyalSol,There isnt really one universal answer since different materials will react differently with acidsbases but a large majority of them dissolve because of either oxidation like in the case of metals or through catalyzed reactions the acidbase speeds up a reaction that normally would occur slowlyOxidation is pretty straight forward  The metals have electrons taken away by the acid and once that happens they form stable ions which can be freely dissolved into solution  In catalytic reactions the acidbase comes in and binds to a functional group on a molecule usually organic molecules and stabilizes the molecule in a way that it can undergo further reactions  httpwwworganicchemistryorgnamedreactionsfischeresterificationshtmThats an example of the forward reaction but the reverse reaction is similar    In large scale a organic molecules such as proteins each peptide in the chain is linked together by an functional ground amide group for proteins OCN and the acidbase will attack these links causes the chain to break apart  Which is why they are generally detrimental to biological organisms ,0,cdmm2e5,1rehln,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

DimensionalNet,The answer is probably not Directions like up and down are relative to gravity so without gravity you cant have a rising action Also I dont think you can have heat without at least a tiny amount of gravity since a temperature gradient requires a material medium which will then have mass  If this mass is continuous throughout with a high enough density to interact the hottest stuff will probably rise compared to the cooler matter and form a spherical gradient assuming theres enough gravity to hold it together at all  This particulate matter will probably behave like a fluid and that combined with enough gravity for observable effects gives you at least a gas giant or quite possibly a star  At this point you have to deal with much more variability than temperatureBack to the original question consider why there is a rising effect with heat A hotter form of the same substance is going to be lower density and then has a higher probability to diffuse upward compared to the more dense form since theres less mass per unit of volume  The heavier cold air sinks compared to the hot air but without gravity theres no weight difference so the fluid would diffuse into each other and likely average out to the same temperature,9,cdmo9dv,1rf2b3,askscience,top_week,11.0,2

JSArrakis,Some things need to be defined here first The thing you are defining as heat is the convection of atomic excitement from the air molecules around you to the molecules that make up your skinbody Everything has gravity There is no such thing as a zerogravity environment It is a misnomer and a buzz word that the media likes to propagate There are gravitational environments that are diminished or strengthened based on your location of adjacency and current escape velocity in relation to the object in question For example when you see astronauts in space that seem to appear weightless this is just a scientific trick that scientists devised by means of calculating the speed a person or a ship needs to be to be able to move both sideways and down at a speed that allows the personship to fall sideways around the object This constant freefall around the object or orbit allows the person to seem weightless If you slowed down your sideways velocity youd start falling toward the earth if you increased it youd reach an escape velocity and no longer be in orbit If you stopped your lateral velocity entirely youd fall like a rock The same goes for the sun and all other bodies within the solarsystem If there was no Earth and you suddenly stopped orbiting the sun youd fall like a rock toward the sun If the Earth was still there and you and the earth both stopped lateral velocity first youd fall toward the earth because of its closer proximity and then the earth would fall toward the sun Every piece of matter in the universe has some level of gravitational pull If it has mass even very very small mass it has gravity and pulls on all the things around it  Im going to assume youre talking about heat in the form of convection in gassesThe answer Barring there are no outside influences both gravitational and not and in a vacuum the gas will form a sphere due to all of the gas molecules acting upon each other The within the sphere the more excited molecules the hottest will travel toward the surface while the least excited molecules will sink toward the middle Consequently the friction of the molecules interacting each other in the core of the gas bubble will heat them while the molecules that rose to the surface will see less interaction and cause them to reduce their excitement and become cool again which will make a circular flow within the gas sphere This same mechanic is what causes wind and high and low pressure systems in weather here on earthEdit formatting,2,cdmw6gb,1rf2b3,askscience,top_week,4.0,2

callmecooper,No heat would not rise Heat rises through a process called Free Convection The classical example of free convection is a heated wire in completely still air Heat rises from the wire in a sort of wake just like a boat through water but instead this wake consists of heated air flowing through cooler airThe reason that free convection results in hot air rising is because of the density difference between hot and cool air Hot air is less dense than cool air so gravity pulls more on the cool air than hot air and the hot air floats to the top of the cool air In space the gravity that pulls more on cool air would not be present so the heat would slowly expand from the surface in all directions away from the source of heat This obviously has practical implications in that the heat collects around the source and can cause the source to overheat Therefore it is necessary to mechanically push the air across the source of heat in order to generate the type of air flow that would normally be present when there were gravitational forces at workGravitational forces are always at work in orbit but can be assumed negligible due to the control volume being in constant freefallconstant accelerationdue to the frame of referenceEDIT Source  Purdue University BSME ,0,cdn0nh7,1rf2b3,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

DasMime,gtI recall reading something along the lines of observing the orbit of any natural satellite of the object but a more detailed explanation would be nice If you can see a natural satellite of the object and you can reasonably assume the satellite to have much much lower mass than the planet then you can use mechanics to work out the hosts mass In this case Ill also assume a circular orbit but you can also work out the mass from noncircular orbitsThe force of the planets gravity on the moon is F  G mp mm  r where G is the gravitational constant r is the orbital radius and the ms are the masses of planet and moon In the case of  circular motion the force on the moon is equal to F  mm v  r where v is the orbital velocity of the moon Set these forces equal to each other and you getG mp mm  r  mm v  rCanceling out common factors you getmp   v r  G So if you know the distance of the planet and it has a moon which for Solar System objects can be readily obtained via parallax methods then you can directly calculate the planets mass Calculating the mass of a body without natural satellites is a bit more work Prior to the Space Age Venus and Mercurys masses were not well constrained because the best way to measure mass is to measure its gravitational effect on other objects Venus also exerts a gravitational influence on other planets such as the Earth and so if you have sufficiently accurate position measurements of both bodies and if you know Earths mass then you can calculate Venuss mass but this is still not an ideal methodOur best measurements of Venus mass come primarily from spacecraft like the Mariners   amp  American and Venera Soviet probes sent to Venus From analyzing their trajectorieshttpadsabsharvardedufullAJSRAsome of them were flybys some were orbiters eg Soviet Venera  amp  American Magellan and ESA Venus Express and some have landed on the surfaceyou can determine Venus mass to a high level of accuracy but in the end this is essentially the same method as the first measuring the planets tug on nearby objects Finally you can make guesses at the composition of Venus and since its radius is easily measured with a telescope you can get an estimate of its mass This is much less accurate of course since it depend entirely on the accuracy of your guess about the composition true for all Solar System planetmoon pairs except the dwarf planet Pluto and its moon Charon which is about  of Plutos mass,0,cdmyrqu,1rfuon,askscience,top_week,3.0,3

PeeSherman,First lets explain the science behind a note A note is just a name given to a particular frequency of air vibrations which is what gives that note its tone For example an A in the middle of the piano in standard tuning is nothing more than a vibration at  Hz meaning when that key is pressed on the piano a hammer strikes a string that naturally vibrates  times a second which makes the air around it vibrate at  times a second  a vibration that propagates through the air to your earUsing that same A as an example on the piano  keys to the right there is another A this one an octave higher It is an octave higher because that string naturally vibrates at twice the frequency  Hz   times a second which vibrates the air around it at  Hz which is the vibration that reaches your earTo summarize an octave is a relationship between two sound frequencies or rates of vibration in which the relationship is  A  Hz tone is the octave up from a  Hz toneInterestingly  is the simplest geometric mathematical relationship giving us the most innately stableconsonant musical tone relationship  the octave Deriving further  relationship between frequencies gives us the perfect fifth the second most innately stable tone relationship Flipping the relationship  gives us the perfect fourth which is a perfect fifth in the opposite direction  gives us the rd and th and so on The tritone an extremely dissonant interval that the Catholic Church actually banned at one point in time calling it the devils interval has a very ugly mathematical relationship that I cannot recall at the moment And this is why I am an engineering student who loves music,5,cdmv2r3,1rfwje,askscience,top_week,43.0,38
drzowie,It all boils down to a mathematical concept called Fourier transformation  This guy named Fourier figured out how to turn any series of values like the pressure in air at subsequent points in time into a collection of pitches  That turns out to be extremely useful for many things  One of the cool things about Fourier transformation is that any repeating waveform is just the sum of several pure tones at integer multiples of the base frequency  A flute makes a pureish tone but a horn making the same note sounds quite different  The difference is that the horn sound has the main tone mixed in with overtones at integer harmonics x the base frequency x x etc   Its worth repeating  any complex waveform a pitch with timbre is just the sum of pure pitches at integer multiples of a base frequencySo your auditory system has adapted to treat multiple frequencies separated by an integer factor as parts of the same complex tone  Thats good since its usually true  if you have a bunch of random noises around you most of them wont happen to share any integer harmonics  two notes that are exactly an integer multiple apart are almost certainly part of the same toneThere are some exceptions to that rule  In particular some devilish fellow might be playing a chord on a musical instrument  Chords are auditory puns  For example a C major chord is middleC middleE and middleG  Those notes happen to have the frequency ratio       Multiply all those numbers by  and you get the sequence   all the notes in the C chord happen to be multiples of another note with a much lower tone  Whoah In this case the lower tone happens to be C two octaves down  Your auditory system identifies the chord as part of a single complex sound at the much lower pitch  even if that pitch doesnt actually exist in the musicThats the basic theory of chords and pitches mixing  The pitch scale is a logarithmic scale  each step up or down the scale multiplies frequency by a certain amount  Going up or down an octave multiplies or divides by   The reason that notes an octave apart sound like the same note is that they are so closely harmonically related  practically every sound around you contains a base pitch and its second harmonic  If you listen carefully you can also get that same sameness from a note and the fifthinterval an octave up  A fifth interval is a ratio of  in frequency so a fifth and an octave gives you a ratio of   Since its an integer ratio not a fraction the two notes say Cbelowmiddle and middleG have a little of the sameness that you normally associate with octaves only  But octaves have so much of that same sound that we give notes an octave apart the same nameNow  why are octaves octaves and why are there exactly  halfsteps in an octave  Thats because of something called the circle of fifths which musicians frequently mutter about and which you can google for more information if youre not one  The easiest way to construct a scale is by starting with a base note somewhere say A but any frequency will do and then constructing third harmonics of it  Each time you go up in frequency a factor of  you get a nice harmony the octaveandafifth  Then you fold the new note downward by octaves until it is within a factor of  of the original frequency and start over  If you do that  times youll create  separate notes and arrive almost back where you started   higher in pitch than the original note  Thats really discordant if you play it next to the original note but if you tweak each of your derived notes ever so slightly you can sort of smooth things out so that all the frequencies work right to form new chords with one another  Youl find that you created exactly  notes and defined the halfstep scale  But you had to fudge the frequencies because you had to sweep the discord under the sonic rug somewhere  This is reasonable not just for aesthetic reasons but because if you didnt know the math you might think youd just screwed up the tripling step a tiny bit each time  When people say the Western scale is based on a lie this is the lie they mean the circle of fifths cannot work perfectly because no matter how many times you multiply your original frequency by  you will never arrive at a power of   but you can fudge it if youre close enough Through the ages there have been several different temperaments used in which people tweaked the notes of the  tone circle of fifths in various different ways to try to make particular chords sound particularly good  at the expense of other chords  These days we use an equaltempered scale where each half step is exactly a factor of  above the previous one  If youre playing a bendable instrument like the flute the trombone the violin or the human voice and you are a good musician you will unconsciously tune each note slightly higher or lower depending on the chordal context of your particular note to harmonize better with the rest of the orchestra  You cant bend the notes on a piano which is why pianos have multiple strings singing each note  it fuzzes out the resonance of each note so its harder for your ears to pick out the harmonic discrepancies  There are three strings so you cant hear the slightlydetuned strings beating as you could if there were just two  The bass bridge usually has two strings per note but by the time you get down there the resonances are so cruddy that you cant really hear the beating anywayThe  primary notes AG you can get by stepping once forward on the circle of fifths and and once backward to get three notes separated by fifth intervals for example Fbelowmiddle middleC and middleG  If you create major chords for each of those three notes and fold all those new notes into a single octave youll find that there are  unique pitches which are the pitches of the major scale  Thats why we call it an octave  oct for   Since going down a fifth and folding into the main octave is the same as going up a fourth interval you can immediately see why IVVI and similar chord progressions are so common in Western music  theyre the very basis of our musical scaleIncidentally not everyone agrees on that scale  The equaltempered Western scale can generate harmonic sequences up to  of the original if you play a C chord with the low G and two lower Cs you are playing the       and  harmonics of the lowest C  But any higher harmonics fall between the notes  Middleeastern and Indian music uses higher harmonics and therefore has lots of quarterstep or smaller intervals that sound strange to our ears  The German tradition calls that  harmonic of C by its own special name  H as the next note after G a fact Johann Sebastian Bach exploited by working his own name BACH into a counterpoint line in his last great

neverdonebefore,There is a bit more to it than that  In FWD cars the front wheels are doing both the steering and applying the engine torque to the road  And RWD the rear wheels are only applying that torque to the road  Essentially your fwd cars are pulling while rwd are pushing  As you drive down a straight road you are applying longitudinal force to the road to propel you forward  As you enter a curve in the road you add a rotational component to your travel  The center of mass of the vehicle has to move laterally through the curve while the vehicle itself has to rotate about that center of mass in order to be pointed straight as you exit the curve  With a fwd vehicle the direction of the force applied to the road by the tires changes as you turn your steering wheel and the back wheels will follow in that path Fwd vehicles have a tendency to understeer  An object in motion wants to stay in motion the inertia of the car in the longitudinal direction makes it want to keep going straight  The tires want to follow the path on which they are pointed  If the lateral acceleration into the curve cannot overcome the forward inertia the car will understeer or take a path with a larger radius than the curve  In a rwd vehicle the the tendency is to oversteer or turn at a smaller radius than the curve  This is because the force on the road by the rear wheels is along the path of the vehicles inertia  The front wheels will want to follow their path around the curve but the rear wheels will want to keep going straight  This means it is easier to rotate about the center of mass  This is how fish tailing and drifting and spin outs occur,1,cdn5t9m,1rgew2,askscience,top_week,8.0,7

generalelectrix,This is a very vague questionFor digital signals yes this does matter  Digital audio signals require significantly higher bandwidth and run at higher frequencies than the audio content they encode so transmission line effects become important  If the characteristic impedance of the cable you use to transmit a digital signal is not matched to the source and destination you can get partial reflections or standing waves on the cable which can definitely cause errors in the reconstructed signal at the destination  This becomes more important with longer cablesFor analog signals the frequency is low enough that the characteristic impedance isnt really important  So long as the conductors youre using are lowresistance copper is great coat hangers should work just as well as fancy cable  Shielding in cables is important for linelevel interconnects to prevent the cables from picking up noise from the environment though this usually isnt too big of a problem in a home environmentThe only real exception to this is for speaker cables carrying postamplifier level signals for electrostatic speakers as the load they present to the driving amplifier is largely capacative  Then the details of the impedance of the cable driving the speaker become a bit more importantIm a physics PhD in quantum electronics with a minor hifi addictionEdit I give an indepth and accurate answer and get a ton of downvotes  SCIENCE,19,cdn89ly,1rgzbv,askscience,top_week,5.0,-14

ThePsuedoMonkey,Clothes dryers function by evaporating the water in the clothes and the rate of evaporation of a liquid is directly related to its vapor pressure  The vapor pressure of water is an exponential function of temperaturehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiVaporpressureBoilingpointofwater roughly kPa at room temperature and kPa when it boils  An electrical heating element in a dryer will create heat by electrical resistance and Ohms LawhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiResistorPowerdissipation states that the power dissipated by a resistor is the product of its resistance and the voltage that is applied to itIf the amount of water in the clothes were sufficiently small this would mean that it would be more efficient to dry them at high heat in an enclosed space do not do this it is fire hazard  However there is likelyhttpwwwverbercommarkoutdoorsgearclothingwaterabsorptionhtml a significant amount of water remaining in the clothes and based on the room temperature vapor pressure each kilogram of water will need  liters of completely dry air in order to fully evaporate in which could become a corrosion or electrical hazard when it condenses after the dryer coolsBecause of this air is vented through the dryer to expel the watersaturated air  This additional air that must be heated and there is no guarantee that all of it will be watersaturated by the time it is expelled but the act of venting air can also help promote evaporation  The amount of energy lost due to venting is proportional to the dryers temperature and the flow rate of the air and the amount of energy lost due to thermal radiation is also proportional to the dryers temperature difference with the ambient air due to the first law of thermodynamics  Reducing the temperature setting would reduce both of theses losses for any given moment though the drying period would significantly increase due to the associated drop in vapor pressure  However without a better understanding of the effects of ambient humidity on evaporation or of the efficiency of the electronic components at low output I am reluctant to say for certain,18,cdnb7zo,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,84.0,66
BigWiggly,There are a lot of factors brought up by ThePsuedoMonkeys comment and I recommend reading through his comment as wellIm going to go with a bit of gut instinct and tell you no I will proceed by first explaining relative humidity followed by how the dryer is working and finally returning to the answer of your questionFor water to evaporate the air its in contact with needs to be able to hold it The airs ability to hold it is measured as its Relative Humidity RH As heat is added to the air its relative humidity decreases and it can hold more waterAdditionally the lower the RH of the air is the more quickly the water is able to evaporate As water vapour saturates the air the RH goes up and it becomes more and more difficult for that volume of air to pick up more water Imagine its arms are full and the more full they get the more stuff they drop each time they bend over to pick up something new Eventually it drops water just as fast as it picks it upDryers work by taking air from the outside ambient air raising its temperature and circulating it through the dryer before sending it back out through the lint screen The dryer would work albeit rather slowly without heating the air Ambient air is usually not at  RH so it can still hold more water Lets say you put your clothes in for  minutes At high heat thats enough to dry them to your liking At no heat tumble only they may still feel damp Lets rule that out as not an option because youve got somewhere to be in an hour and your favourite pants just got out of the washerBy heating the air the RH of the inlet air to the dryer is lowered as its temperature rises giving it the ability to hold more water I guess it has bigger arms This means that for every volume of air that goes through the dryer more water comes out with it Additionally this helps to speed up the last bits of drying where there isnt much water left Warmer air will also heat the clothes giving the water some extra energy to boost themselves into the vapour state so it can be carried off Without heat the last bits of water are simply too cold to evaporate quickly enoughTo address the energy efficiencyHeating requires a lot of energy Any heating process is a fairly inefficient process Resistor heating elements are good at what they do but nobody ever claims for them to be efficient Moving air on the other hand is relatively easy to do as long as you clean your lint screen Its much more efficient to pump a volume of fluid air than it is to heat that same volumeIn the first stages of drying there is so much water on the clothes that regardless of how warm the air is it will saturate with water Theres simply an excess of water This may make you say So lets heat it even more and itll take more out with each chunk of air right Yes you are right Instead though we know its cheaper to move air than it is to heat it so lets be patient and let the moving air do its work In fact dryers would be more efficient if they increased the air flowrate in the early stages of the drying cycle and decreased the heating requirementsAs mentioned earlier in the last stages of drying when there isnt much water warmer air is able to force water out of its little microscopic nooks and crannies by giving it more energy At this point air circulation isnt as important because there isnt enough water in the clothes to saturate the air thats in there anyways Now air circulation is only to prevent overheating that could cause a fire hazard Still every bit of air that gets heated and then vented too soon is a waste of energySo now that weve covered what is good at the early and late stages of drying we can make general statements on what the most efficient dryer would do Start out on low heat with high circulation followed by a steady increase of heat until finishing while the air flowrate is decreased proportionally to the temperature but always above a minimum flowrate to prevent overheatingSince I dont know about any of these fancy dryers on the market and most people are tempted to use the timed dry options rather than an autodry option which uses an RH or moisture sensor to determine when to stop drying I will say that it is most efficient to stick to the least amount of heat necessary to get your clothes to a satisfactory level of dryness because heating is the most inefficient process in your dryerAs a good compromise between length of cycle and heating required use medium heat Ive noticed that medium heat often doesnt take noticeably longer than a high heat cycle and does the job well enoughAlternatively if youre looking to be the most efficient you could dry on low and manually increase the temperature every  minutes or soIf youre a dryer manufacturer and reading this consider making the autodry cycle adjust airflow and temperature based on the RH leaving the dryer based on the sensor already in the installation ,2,cdne9bx,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,13.0,11
RabidRabbt,This all depends on what you mean by efficient  Since I can just hang my clothes up and watch them dry although it takes some time the application of any extra heat that I then shunt outdoors is clearly wastefulIf by efficient you mean in terms of the product your time waiting and cost of drying economic efficiency thats a slightly more interesting question  There are two things to consider first that the energy required to vaporize the water in your clothes from room temperature is essentially a constant  Secondly the rate of energy transfer is related to the temperature difference between the air and the clothes by an exponential function  Now if you keep running hot air over your clothes at a constant rate relying on the efficiency of energy transfer we can now figure out the function form of our economic efficiency  Assuming you charge an hourly rate the opportunity cost to you is simply your rate R times the amount of time time that it takes to dry your clothes  The cost to you on your electric bill is the time it takes to dry your clothes multiplied by your power companys rate P and the rate of energy usage E  Since resistive heating is  were going to make the approximation that E proportional to the amount you heated your clothing up  The only thing left is how much time it takes as a function of temperature exponentialSo youre left withcost  R  expE  P  Ewhere time is expESince this function goes to zero very fast the short answer is that yes higher temperatures are good for your wallet  Please note that I did leave out a massive fudge factor namely that the amount of waste heat is also going to increase in this model since I did not actually bother to take the integral of the exponential however the point remains ,0,cdnh7l7,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

c,I would say the high heat would be more efficient Drying clothes is just a phase change from liquid to gas The total energy required to evaporate the water would be the same regardless of the setting The energy required would just depend on the initial temperature of the clothes the amount of water in the clothes the specific heat of water  kJkg K and the heat of vaporization for water  kJkg Lets say we have m kg of water in our clothes close to room temp ToK We need to heat the water to TbK the boiling point of water at STP since we are in an open system to the atmosphere We need  kJKgK x m x TbTo KJ to raise the temp up to boiling point of water Now we need  kJkg x m kJ to vaporize the water In total  kJ or  kWh of energy is needed to evaporate the waterIf you assume that the dryer for both cycles is able to heat the water to the boiling point and the  rate of heat absorption to be the same for both cycles the only thing that matters is the duration of which the motors run to spin the drum and blower Therefore the high heat setting would be more efficientWhat really would save energy reducing the amount of water in your clothes A high speed spin cycle or a centrifugal dryer thats extracts a higher percentage of the water out would save much more energy than selecting a heat setting ,2,cdnev36,1rh9np,askscience,top_week,2.0,0

PastryBlender,As with most things in quantum mechanics you cant really know exactly what spin is nor imagine it in your head There are ways to represent it in classical terms like the vector model httphyperphysicsphyastrgsueduhbasequantumvecmodhtml however I myself dont really like this model and take spin to just exist as whatever numerical value it is in my headSpin is essentially the magnetic property of a particle or collection of particles its made up of spin angular momentum component and a magnetic moment component Magnetic Moment  Gyromagnetic Ratio x Spin Angular Momentum The spin angular momentum value is derived from quantum mechanics and the Gyromagnetic ratio is specific for each particleatom As the name implies the magnetic moment is a moment and if you want help imagining it think of it as the moment at which the particleoverall atom is actually spinning and is usually the quantity used for calculations to do with how much things affectchange spin The spin angular momentum component of this is limited quantum mechanically to a specific number of orientations depending on the amount of nuclear particles in question This means that the magnetic properties can have a quantised number of states for an atom and this is proven in the SternGerlach experiment This experiment fired nuclei of something spin  I think so with  allowed spin orientations through a magnetic field and onto a detector Only two spots were detected implying that the field only had nuclei of two sets of magnetic properties pass through it with one spot above the altitude at which the nuclei were fired horizontally and one below indicating a positive and negative spin both nuclei were displaced by the same amount but in different directions If you put nuclei in a magnetic field and fire electromagnetic waves at them their overall spin will change when certain frequencies are used This is the basis of NMR chemistry and the frequency Larmor frequency that causes these transitions depends on the magnetic moment of the species in question the Gyromagnetic ratio and the strength if the applied magnetic field Many complicated extra effects arise from doing NMR and it can be used to figure out the chemical structure of many chemicals using quantitative methods in both organic and inorganic chemistry Even now the field is continuously being improved as the sample quantities required to carry out NMR are too high because of sensitivity issues caused by radio waves used in NMR being of low energy compared to waves used in other methods of spectroscopy these low sample qualities mean that biologists studying cells always wine about not being able to NMR the little things they find etc Sorry if its long I got a bit carried away haha,0,cdnibzj,1rhpj0,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

santa,BA in Astrophysics here  Your question involves how galaxies and star systems are formed and why they typically stay in the same plane  Since it seems like no one has answered yet Ill try and help you out  To answer Im going to do a little background first on galaxies then on stars and then Ill explain why there should not be as much matter above and below the plane of the Milky Way and our Solar System  Youre correct in assuming that space is infinite but from the sound of it you are implicitly also assuming that it is isotropic on any level  Essentially the reason flat diagrams are bewildering is because youre thinking of space as completely evenly spread out with stars planets and other matter like Hydrogen clouds and black holes and white dwarfs etc roughly taking up the same spacial distance away from one another  Space isnt like a D grid however especially on smaller scales  Astronomers recognize that on a very very very large scalehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbbEarthsLocationintheUniverseJPEGjpg above the scale of the local superclusters of galaxies even the isotropy of the universe can be assumed as true  As you can see in the picture this is not true on the scale of our Milky Way Galaxy  Isotropy means that no matter where you look everything appears similar and theres no distinguishing point of reference  In the image we can see that matter is pretty much equally spread out only on the observable universe levelThat being said now we should consider how galaxies form  There are four basic different structures to galaxies spiral elliptical lenticular and irregular  These were proposed as a sort of evolution by Edwin Hubble and called the Hubble SequencehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHubblesequence  First the Hubble Sequence doesnt take into account irregular galaxies which formed as you can assume from there name in a very strange way mostly in the beginning stages of the universe where matter interactions were really hectic  Im going to put irregular galaxies aside because they arent really what were focusing on here but theres not much more to say about them anyway  Whats left are spiral elliptical and lenticular galaxies  They have different characteristics and form in different conditions  Long story short your question only involved star formation and spiral galaxies so Im going to get into that specifically  Spoiler there is a more equal spacing of stars and matter in elliptical galaxies because they formed from galaxies merging together and are shaped you guessed it like an ellipseFinally  Onto the good stuff  Star formation and spiral galaxieshttpenwikipediaorgwikiSpiralgalaxyOriginofthespiralstructure  Our Milky Way and Solar System  Both are surprisingly similar actually so lets get down to it  First off spiral galaxies are classified by two things whether they have a bar in the middle of them or not  This is shown in the Hubble sequence as the fork separating SBa from Sa  As you can imagine spiral galaxies are shaped in a spiral way with a group of stars in the middle surrounding the center  Much like a sprinkler that is shooting water and spinning for a long time the water or arms in this case appear to be curved due to the rotation of the center  The spinning of the center is very important and will play a part in answering your questionStar formation will actually explain both processes so Im going to jump out of galaxies for a minute  Imagine a cloud of Hydrogen and other dust just floating around in space  If the conditions are right maybe perhaps in the spiral arm of a galaxy where lots of new stars are formed the cloud might be heated up and have the right pressure to start clumping Hydrogen molecules together  Obviously we know that the more mass something has the more gravitational pull it has  Even you and I have a slight gravitational pull  The Hydrogen and other dust starts clumping together at a certain point as more and more matter is pulled toward it  As more matter is pulled in the center of the cloud where its being pulled starts to rotate from being hit with particles  Fast forward to lots of matter pulled in and gravity of the matter causing immense amounts of pressure down on itself and you have a cloud with a protostarhttpenwikipediaorgwikiProtostar  Fast forward some more  More and more matter is being gravitationally pulled into the protostar and more matter on top means more pressure at the core from matter pushing down on it  It also means more rotation done by the protostar  In the cloud matter starts to orbit around the protostar because it is too far from the protostar to be pulled in and the spinning of the protostar has caused the matter to achieve a tangential velocity creating an orbit  Now were at the point of the cloud looking like a rough haze of particles around a really hot ball  As the particles in the cloud orbit they too clump together to form planets asteroids comets meteoroids etc  Heres where we get to the crux of your question  Why do the planets form on a similar plane of the star system  The reason is actually because of the spinning protostar  The protostars spin causes the particles of dust and Hydrogen in the cloud to orbit in a specific direction  Thats all well and good so now everything is orbiting around in the same direction as the protostar is spinning  Back to another analogy  If you have a rubber ball and you decide you want to spin it while throwing it in the air straight up what should happen  If you spin it like a pizza the rubber balls top and bottom actually sinks into the middle part because of the spinning acting upon the particles in the rest of the ball  The top and bottom contract in to the middle plane of the ball where you spun it  Same concept but on a much larger scale  Spin the protostar fast enough and the particles in the upper and lower parts of the system not on the same plane as the spin want to sink down into the plane forming a sort of CDlike shape with the protostar in the middle and everything else orbiting the same way  Eventually the star gets big enough hot enough and has enough pressure to start Hydrogen fusion in the corehttpenwikipediaorgwikiStarformation when it explodes with energy and blows off a lot of the remaining dust and cloud in the system leaving planets comets asteroids and moons behind  The planets are still orbiting the star in the same rotational way also rotating themselves and their moons as well  The system looks like a CD and there is little matter above or below the CD plane because of the rotation of the star enacting a force to push and pull everything into the plane itself  You can actually apply the same principal to the formation of a spiral galaxy although the formation is a little different  I hope this answers your question  Let me know if it doesnt and Ill try and clear it up a little better  TLDR The starsupermassive black hole in the center pushes and pulls matter as the systemspiral galaxy is forming into a disk  It pulls the matter into the disk by spinning and applying a force into the plane that acts on the matter  When the matter is in the disk the rotationforce around the still spinning starsupermassive black hole doesnt allow it to leave  Thats why theres not as much stuff above and below the plane of the systemspiral galaxy,34,cdnfpuh,1rhu7r,askscience,top_week,203.0,169

severoon,I thought you might find this interesting httpcuriousastrocornelleduquestionphpnumber  which basically explains why accretion discs are flatThe basic idea is if you release a bunch of particles of matter in empty space and theyre all stationary relative to each other theyll just fall directly toward the center of mass of the whole system and crunch into a sphere But this never happens Things are always moving aroundNow you can imagine that if everything is moving directly toward that center of mass of the whole system theyll all just accelerate and crunch even harder But once again this never happens Things in the universe that get caught up in a system never happen to be flying directly toward the center of mass of the systemOk so theyre coming in from all directions If its going fast enough a particle wont get captured by that system its path will bend but it will ultimately fly on through But if its not going fast enough to escape and it gets trapped then it will start a spiraling orbit toward the center of mass of the systemNow we have a bunch of stuff randomly spiraling in toward the center of mass This still isnt a disc though so why do we only see discs Shouldnt it be a big swirling spherical mass Seems like it shouldBut if you think a little more and give this system a long long time to settle down into a stable situation youll see that it isnt the case This is because every system has a net angular momentum In other words from all these random things falling in you can add up the linear momentum and that will tell you how the system as a whole is flying through space in a straight line About that point though everything is also rotating and thats the angular momentumOver time all these different things will collide with each other and all the momentum that is moving perpendicular to the accretion disc plane will start to cancel Furthermore the gravitational effect of all that mass in that accretion disc plane tends to pull things into it From there this matter all starts to compress together into local chunks and you get planets You may get a bunch of matter that happens to not settle down before it gets close together and collapses into a local chunk and you have Neptune the planet in our system that doesnt fall in our accretion disc or some theories say it formed and get ejected from some other place and got captured by our sunAlong comes a meteor and nails a planet hard enough to spew a bit of its molten core into orbit around it and you have the rings of Saturn,1,cdnsbp7,1rhu7r,askscience,top_week,3.0,2

chrisbaird,To get to the core of your question which no seems to have addressed yetMany materials cloth paper cement have a microscopic structure which provides multiple reflecting surfaces For instance a solid chunk of ice is mostly transparent but snow is white They are both made out of the same substance but the microscopic structures in the snow flake and not in the ice provide multiple surfaces for light to reflect off of Optical reflection takes place at the interface between one material and another material with different optical properties such as at the surface separating air and ice Creating a microscopic structure scratching up a surface weaving a fabric injecting air bubbles introduces more reflecting surfaces so the incident light has a higher chance of getting reflected rather than transmitted A solid pure chunk of salt is transparent put a pile of table salt granules is white because of all the reflecting surfacesWhich brings us to your question If we get rid of the microscopic structure we can make white material clear again Melt pure white sand down and let it harden as a solid piece of glass or quartz and it will be transparent Melt snow flakes into a homogenous pot of water and it becomes transparent again Another way to optically get rid of microscopic structures is to add water Water behaves optically similar to many materials such as cloth ice glass or snow Pour water on a material with microscopic structures and the water will fill most of the cracks scratches pores holes and bubbles that used to be filled with air Once this happens the material now acts optically like a homogenous slab of material without microstucturing The many reflecting surfaces go away and you are left with a mostly transparent material just by adding water The index of refraction of water does not exactly match that of cloth or paper or cement etc so the effect is not complete The material only becomes more transparent upon getting wet but it not completely transparentAs others have mentioned if there is no light source behind the material a material that has suddenly become more transparent will look darker,7,cdnix8z,1rhuln,askscience,top_week,34.0,27

nomamsir,The direction of the torque vector is only significant once an arbitrary convention ie the right hand rule has been chosen  Really I think it make more sense to think of toques and angular momenta as defined by a plane plus a direction of circulation than it does a vector However theres a nice property in three dimensions that each plane has exactly one direction perpendicular to it and we can define a directionmagnitude of circulation by specifying a given vector along the direction of that normalFrom this point of view the direction in or out is just a stand in for the direction of circulation of the plane In some ways the plane picture is better however most of the math you would have developed is better at using vectors and since this one to one correspondence between the two exists we can jump back and forth between the twothat was a bit rushed by I hope its clearAs for the second question radians are dimensionless so the units of metersradian are the same as the units of meters  Radians are the ratio between the arclength distance around the circumference and the radius ratios of two things with the same units are dimensionless ,0,cdngftu,1rhwdb,askscience,top_week,15.0,15

ColinDavies,The information you need for torque is the plane in which it acts or equivalently the normal vector to that plane and whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise  But clockwise with respect to what reference  Using the cross product builds in the point of reference automatically  Instead of having to describe where you are standing and what you mean by clockwise that information is incorporated into the direction of the vector  You just have to choose a convention to say whether clockwise corresponds to the normal or antinormal direction and apply that convention consistently all the time hence the right hand rule  Theres nothing going into or out of the page the direction is just a sort of translation of clockwise or not into positive or negative so you can use it in an equation,0,cdngock,1rhwdb,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

drzowie,Torque isnt actually a vector it just looks like one  As a cross product its an antisymmetric tensor a linear combination of two vectors which in three dimensions just happens to have three componentsThe direction of the torque vector is the direction of the axis around which the torque is being applied  Its very important for example that when you step on the gas in your car the torque vector applied to the wheels goes off to the left of the car and that the brakes apply torque that goes off to the right unless youre reversing  The reason torque and rotational pseudovectors in general are confusing is that you have to combine them with a vector to get another vector  For example if ahead is Z and left is X then the displacement from the contact patch of the tire to the axle is in the Y direction  Since the tire spins around the X axis the motion is in the third direction Z  The axis has the nice property that its perpendicular to both of the important directions in the systemIncidentally in D cross products are pseudoscalars since theres only one way to rotate  and in D cross products have six components so theres no clean way to represent them other than as the full antisymmetric tensor  Just draw a x matrix and demand that it be antisymmetric  There are  elements in the diagonal they have to be   That leaves  elements but the symmetry relationship reduces them to  independent numbers,0,cdnypcj,1rhwdb,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

gredders,What makes a neutron stick to a protonNeutrons and protons collectively known as nucleons when discussing their role in nuclear physics are bound in the nucleus by the strong nuclear force This interaction is a powerful attractive force which acts over a range of only a few femtometres which is roughly the diameter of a nucleon Beyond that the force quickly drops to zero What determines the number of neutrons and protonsAs you increase the number of protons in a nucleus you increase the repulsive electrostatic Coulomb force due to their positive charge Now this Coulomb force is weaker than the nuclear force but it also acts over a long range That means that as the size of the nucleus increases the strong force saturates while the coulomb repulsion just keeps getting bigger and causes the nucleus to become unstableAdding neutrons however contributes to the strong force but does not increase the coulomb repulsion since the have neutral charge therefore heavier nuclei typically need more neutrons than protons for it to remain stable See on this plot of proton number vs neutron number how the line of stable nuclei tends to bend round to the neutronrich side of the charthttpnuclearpowertrainingtpubcomhvimghvjpgHowever it is obvious that this isnt the whole story since too many neutrons makes a nucleus unstable too This is due to the Pauli exclusion principle which forbids two particles from occupying the same quantum state Protons and neutrons differ by their isospin quantum number and can therefore share the same energy state without violating the exclusion principle Two neutrons or two protons are indistinguishable from each other and cannot share the same energy state Therefore when you add only one kind of nucleon to a nucleus they are forced to stack up more quickly than adding both neutrons and protons which is to say they have to occupy increasingly higher energy states In this case it isnt long until one of the nucleons is forced to occupy a state of higher energy than the binding energy of the nucleus and it cannot form a bound system In reality the situation is more complex than this and is very difficult to model The best so far is the nuclear shell modelhttphyperphysicsphyastrgsueduhbasenuclearshellhtml Nuclear structure is an active area of research and one in which I am doing a PhD and we do not have a complete picture of what goes on inside the nucleus at this point ,3,cdnrwhp,1rivmw,askscience,top_week,8.0,5

expandedthots,You should think of schizophrenia as the typical psychotic disorder as any other psychotic disorder is going to have a similar spectrum of symptoms as schizophrenia bipolar with psychosis psychotic disorder now etc So the dopamine hypothesis says that some disruption in dopamine processing leads to dysfunctional signaling between multiple locations in the brain The benefits of this that it does serve to decrease positive symptoms hallucinations delusions and newer atypicals also are somewhat active in reducing negative symptoms lack of speech not caring about anything no energy to do anything The downside of this is that it disrupts dopamine signaling globally across the brain and causes movement problems when the drug reaches high enough concentrations in these areas Look at tardive dyskinesia for a picture into how debilitating these problems can be Now there are other theories about whats truly occurring in psychotic brains Some people argue that dopamine antagonists are merely acting as symptomatic relief meaning it isnt really targeting the mechanism of whats going wrong just acting at a downstream site where the symptoms can be limited Id argue this could be true because of the success of a specific atypical clozapine in treating treatment resistant schizophrenia Clozapine is an antagonist of basically every receptor in your brain Some people such as Herbert Meltzer argue that its actually an effect of clozapine on serotonin receptors that increases its efficacy over other antipsychotics He has substantial evidence to back this up but it again becomes a matter of mere receptor pharmacology Id suggest looking into the phospholipid theory of schizophrenia It discusses how the neuronal composition of susceptible brains has a different composition of phosphoplipids which can have significant downstream effects as far as inflammation and disrupted immune signaling and oxidative stress handling Its probably a piece to the puzzle along with the receptor pharmacology The reason I support it is because clozapine is the only antipsychotic that interacts truly with this systemhttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlesPMC,0,cdpllb0,1rj9sv,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

Platypuskeeper,Well theres no consensus on what atomic radius means in the first place Atoms have a diffuse cloud of electrons around them and its fairly arbitrary where you consider the end of to be Eg the Bohr radius is the most probable radius for the electrons note not the same thing as the most probable location Another possible definition but seldom used would be the radius that encloses a certain percent of the electron density Or you could take half the bond distance when two identical atoms have a single bond the covalent radius Then theres the ionic radius which exists in two different definitions by Shannon and Pauling Or you could use the effective radius as determined from their interactions in the gas phase read the van der Waals gas law which is the vdW radiusNow since noble gases dont bond you cant really use ionic or covalent radii Van der Waals radii work well because noble gases have close to idealgas behavior but the vdW radii for anything is substantially larger than other measures so you cant make a comparison that way But the most concrete measure here would probably be the Bohr radius as its more directly related to the electron density And from that perspective adding electrons does increase repulsion but it doesnt do so by an extra amount when you complete the shell The effect of electronelectron repulsion on the radius is actually pretty small This is illustrated pretty well by comparing hydrogen to helium Hydrogen has a Bohr radius of  Bohr Since helium has twice the charge it would have exactly half of that  if the electrons didnt repel each other at all The actual radial densityhttpwwwrscorgejCPbkbkfgif upper curve has its peak only a slight above that In fact its hard to tell the difference in the radial density distribution between reality and the situation where they dont repel at allhttpwikichemeddlorgmediawikiimagesHandHeorbitalsgif leftmost curve squashed a bit by a different horizontal scaleThis is not as dramatic for heavier elements where the relative increase in nuclear charge isnt as large but it still tends to outweigh the increased ee repulsion By just about any measure related to the electron density the noble gases will have a radius somewhat smaller than the preceding halogenThe exception to this and perhaps the reason why some people think the radius is bigger is the van der Waals radius which for noble gases is indeed larger than for the preceding halogen But this goes to how the vdW radius is defined by the effective interactions its more a result of noble gases having much less mutual attraction than any other atoms ,0,cdo18bs,1rji79,askscience,top_week,4.0,4

antonfire,One somewhat reasonable answer or at least a relevant comment is that a lot of these constants have have some interpretations as probabilities and they are probabilities of events that are not all that unlikely For example e is roughly the probability that a random permutation of the set   n will not fix an element pi is roughly the probability that two random numbers in the set   n are relatively prime phi is the probability that the sum of a random number in the set  and its square is less than  I suspect you can relate Feigenbaums constants to some event relating to periods of a dynamical system as well,4,cdolwdp,1rlfdu,askscience,top_week,13.0,9

bigbad,I may not really be qualified to answer this but it seems like the people who are more so are being purposely obtuse about the word close  I think a simple answer might be that many of the important constants are the most basic possible part of a pattern a common piece of a certain type of equation  That is to say they are as small as it is possible to make them because it makes more sense to multiply them to reach larger values as needed than to divide a larger number for smaller ones  Like the OP Im sure that Im not phrasing this in an ideal way,0,cdokvz9,1rlfdu,askscience,top_week,3.0,3

Benginieur,Tensile strength in engineering is onedirectional and means there is no bending influence It depends on the material and is proportional to the area of the cable So a group of thin cables twisted together will be weaker because there will be small gaps between them that dont add to the tensile strengthNow for cutting foam the force from pressing the wire against it will result in a change in force distribution inside the cable with compression on the side of the foam and tension on the other side of the cable with a neutral fibre in the center httptoolboxesflexiblelearningnetaudemositesseriescontentbcgbcastructmembersbeamspagehtmA single strand will be more stiff as the diameter factors in heavily Try bending a ruler along both axis and youll see the effect Same area but very different flexibility So in my opinion the reason to use many twisted cables would be if the bending of the single strand would plastically deform it near the edge where forces are strongest and thus destroy it over time Thin twisted cables should distribute the forces more evenly but they wont be stronger in general with the same diameter,0,cdp7q90,1rmpm7,askscience,top_week,4.0,4

walexj,If you consider a bundle of untwisted small diameter wires which together form the same overall diameter of a single wire of the exact same material theyre strength will be equivalent The reason that things like suspension bridges and other cables with tensile loads are made of several strands is due to the likelihood of failure A single wire design with a safety factor of  may have a material defect that can propogate through the material and cause a catastrophic failure The multiwire cable of the same overall diameter may have a single strand with a material failure that causes the single strand to fail but then you still have  other strands to take the load Because your safety factor was  your cable is still safe by a factor of around Things get a little more complicated when you twist or braid the wires as that introduces things like bending stress But overall theyre pretty close to being similarly strong and can handle the same tensile stresses The difference is that multiwire cables are tougher and more reliable Theyre also way easier to manufacture as well so winwin,0,cdpq4ey,1rmpm7,askscience,top_week,1.0,1

rohrspatz,In broad terms heart performance is controlled by contrastingopposing input from the sympathetic fight or flight and parasympathetic rest and digest nerves Sympathetic input increases the heart rate and makes the heart muscles contract more strongly while parasympathetic input decreases the heart rate If sympathetic signaling is too strongintense or if its even moderately strong in someone with certain kinds of heart disease it can cause the heart muscles to work so hard that they consume oxygen faster than it can be replenished through the coronary arteriesNormally this effect is observed due to physical activity  exercise increases sympathetic stimulation of the heart But from what I can see about mental stress ischemia the effect is pretty much exactly analogous to physical stress ischemia Strong emotions also tend to increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and if the person has some kind of predisposition apparently mental stress ischemia is the resultHowever there really are just these two ends of the scale The neurons of the brain interact in much more complex ways to differentiate dozens of emotions but the signals that get sent into the rest of the body feed into relatively few pathways  the nerves that control various parts of the body typically only release one of a few activating or inhibitory signals that have specific physiological effects Ever noticed that happy anticipation and fearful anticipation have a lot of the same physical signs even though you can clearly tell the difference between the two emotions Thats whyI seriously doubt that different emotions have different effects on heart function except possibly to the extent that certain emotions could activate sympathetic signaling more strongly or weakly than others But Id also bet that that effect is hugely variable among different people and given our current understanding of the precise neurological signaling mechanisms that result in precise emotional states ie basically none at all its probably not a good topic to study,0,cdp3ng7,1rn5n6,askscience,top_week,2.0,2
DrJA,It depends There are some plants that you can grow under h light condition and theyll just be fine whereas others will get stressed and not so happy In the polar circle there are enough plant species growing and they seem to be doing fine with h periods of light during the summers there  they will most certainly be photosynthesizing all day although probably not at a constant rateIn principle theres nothing against perpetual photosynthesis  the enzymes that do this whole process will need to be turnedover obviously but that is normally an ongoing processThe only thing that is probably an influence in this is the ability to deal with reactive oxygen species or ROS ROS are generated in the photosynthesis process and need to be cleanedup by certain enzymes I guess this normally happens in the dark so these ROS can be cleanedup Continues photosynthesis will probably require that ROS scavenging is increased which plants should have the plasticity for depending a bit on the speciesHope this made things a little clear,0,cdpa4az,1rn6m6,askscience,top_week,3.0,3

ApolloFelix,Pyrex today is made of tempered glass Pyrex used to be a low thermal expansion borosilicate glass according to Wikipedia Now glass subjected to a fast change in temperature breaks because glass is a thermal insulator If you cool a surface of the glass quickly you induce a large variation of temperature along the inside of the glass which for a dish can be pretty large The cool side will shrink but the hot side wont This will cause stress inside the glass dish which can be enough to break the glass Since original Pyrex had a low thermal expansion it would induce lower stresses and not break Tempered glass is a resistant glass that is already stressed in a way to make it more resistant It also breaks into very small pieces when shattered However it still expands or contracts enough to break when subjected to sudden large temperature changes,0,cdp7hco,1rn7aa,askscience,top_week,8.0,8

FieryPianos,As was mentioned before Pyrex is currently made of tempered glass Tempered glass is manufactured in high temperatures in which the glass suffers compression forces on its surface and traction forces in its interior It is then cooled very quickly so as to mantain those forces and also keep its glass transition temperature the temperature above which a glass starts behaving a lot like a liquid very high The result of these forces is that superficial fissures on tempered glass rarely ever spread and cause it to break making it incredibly resistant Before the change to tempered glass Pyrex was made of borossilicate glass The reason for the resistance of that material is that the boric oxyde that is added occupies empty spaces in the glass and helps keep the silicate aluminum oxyde and sodium oxyde tight together It is also created at very high temperatures again to keep its glass transition temperature high,0,cdpitsv,1rn7aa,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

SingleMonad,gt so if they are experiencing acceleration Yes if  They are not  Thats the reason they do not radiateMore broadly classical radiation such as the kind generate by an accelerating charge is proportional to the square of the acceleration  The expectation value of the electrons position is constant this is a feature of all energy eigenstates and the reason they are also called stationary states  Related to this is the fact that an atom in its ground state has no classical dipole moment and no way to generate one in a transition to a lower state of energy because no lower state exists  It seems odd since there is generally a nonzero probability to find the electron throughout the atom  But no classical acceleration is at work ie the second derivative of the expectation value of position is zeroYou might wonder whats different about an atom in say just for concreteness its first excited state  You know that decays and emits radiation  What is different about it  The answer is subtle and beautiful  the atom in its excited state is not in an eigenstate of the coulomb Hamiltonian from the nucleus  Its in an eigenstate of the total Hamiltonian of the system  The total Hamiltonian includes the electromagnetic field  The true energy eigenstates are superpositions of atomic states  That excited state I mentioned is really a super position of mostly the excited state plus a little bit of the ground state  This superposition state does possess a dipole moment and hence radiates when the atom falls down to the ground stateYour question is what kept the pressure on to find a better atomic theory than the Bohr modelEdit itsits stuff,0,cdp5h3u,1rng96,askscience,top_week,6.0,6

RelativisticMechanic,TLDRIt depends on just what you mean but the usual definition of black hole temperature comes from Hawking radiation in which case if we express our mass in multiples of solar masses so the sun would have M   a star ten times as massive would have M   the temperature isT  M KelvinSo for example a black hole the mass of the sun would have a temperature of approximately  Kelvin One that was ten times as massive would have one tenth the temperatureComment ProperWhen dealing with curved spacetimes you have to be careful with the definition of things like temperature When dealing with black holes in particular you also have to be careful about how you interpret questions that you expect naïvely to depend on the behavior of stuff inside the event horizonOne of the difficulties here is that we cant speak to the microscopic behavior of matter inside of the black hole We do not have a consistent model for describing quantum systems in such spacetime regions and any proper microscopic description is going to require a quantum theory Thus we cant really talk about temperature in the sense of motion of particlesHowever we can apply quantum field theory in a blackhole spacetime provided roughly that we stay away from the singularity and our field doesnt carry too much energy In particular if were interested in describing events outside of the event horizon we can use these techniques as a good first approximation We can also apply quantum statistical mechanicsthermodynamics to this process When you do this you find that if an observer falling across the event horizon sees themselves in a vacuum an observer far from the black hole must see a flow of thermal radiation coming from the black hole This radiation has the same spectrum as a blackbody source of some definite temperature so we can associate it with a temperature It turns out that for a black hole of mass M the temperature T associated with this radiation isT  ħc  πGkBMwhere ħ is the reduced Plancks constant c is the speed of light G is Newtons gravitational constant and kB is Boltzmanns constant That factor is just a constant that we can evaluate and it comes out to roughlyT   kg K  M  M Kelvinwhere the second form comes about by expressing M as a multiple of the solar mass,18,cdp2hll,1rngpn,askscience,top_week,157.0,139

NotFreeAdvice,The answer has to do with the idea of bubble nucleationSo it turns out that the release of carbonation ie the bubbles is thermodynamcally favorable  This means that the CO would like to exit as bubbles  There is just one problem to get a bubble you must first form a bubble  The start of bubble formation what we call nucleation is not thermodyanmically favorableThe reason is entropic  There is much more ordering at the surface of a bubble than inside the bulk bubble or the bulk water  This presents a barrier to bubble formation that is related to the surface area of the bubbleAt the same time there is a enthalpic reason to form bubbles and this related to the volume of the bubble The end result is this when the bubbles are quite small the effects from the surface area of the bubble dominate the effects from the bulk of the bubble  And the bubble will not form  or forms very slowly  Once a bubble forms then it will grow more easily  So the bottleneck if you will is the initial formation of the bubble  By shaking the beverage you introduce a bunch of gas bubbles into the beverage and this provides sites for bubble growth  and an increase in released carbonation  Essentially you are providing the mean by which to skip the slow nucleation stepHope that makes sense,0,cdppqxy,1rofgc,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

anon,I am thinking that if the flattening is happening linearly in one dimension then the area of the cross section each proportion r of the way from the squished end to the ordinary end has r times the area of the ordinary endMeaning the cross section halfway up has half the area and soon As always the volume is the height times the average cross sectional area Here since the area goes linearly it is the same as the height times the area when it is cut at the half way pointSo the squishing cuts the volume in halfYou can see an example if you do it to other shapes like a xx cube  Then you get what looks from the side like a triangle of area  thickened up to have thickness  So the volume is  x   ,1,cdpejjk,1rokpj,askscience,top_week,3.0,2

YouDoNotWantToKnow,O      Orient your axis at the center of the circle at the bottom of the cylinder The circle is radius r and let it exist in the xy plane so cylinder extends into the z plane Let the line at the other end of the shape the squish point also be described by y zh where h is the height of the cylinderNow look at the yz plane in slices for x in rr For any given x in this range the yz plane contains a triangle That triangle has a height of h and a base of sqrtr  x Now you have a simple calculus integralIntegrate sqrtr  x   h for x from  to r and multiply that by  and to make that simpler theres a  in the integral so just pull that out and divide it out right awayTheres probably a more elegant way of going from here but to brute force it you can look up or derive using trig substitution that the indefinite integral of A  x is I  xAx  A tanxAxLooks messy but just plug in the integration points A  r btw so the definite integral from  to r is Ir  I I is easy there are xs in both numerators so I  Ir causes the first time to drop out but the second term inside the inverse tangent goes to infinity tan of infinity is piSo the integral comes out to just Api dont forget the height constant we left out earlier and that Ar the final solution isV  hpirDoes that make sense Its half the volume of a full cylinder So that is the right direction less Is it correct Well do you think we could form the same shape out of the volume we took out Think about each slice we made at the beginning Initially they would have been rectangles instead of triangles right What part of each rectangle is missing The area of the triangle is bh The area of the rectangle is bh So the missing area is bh  bh  bh Half the rectangle So its pretty clear this makes sense and is the correct resultAnd now I read the other top reply and it has a similar derivation and the same solution Sweet,0,cdpfd5k,1rokpj,askscience,top_week,3.0,3

yogurtsurprise,gtwhy dont your teeth heal on your own like other bones in your bodyThe crown of teeth the part that is visible are made of two primary materials enamel on the outer surface and dentin which makes up most of the tooth structure with pulp in the centre which contains blood vessels lymph and nerves When the crown forming there are made of two major cells types Ameloblasts and odontoblasts First the dentin in formed by the odontoblasts at the centre of the tooth and dentin is formed outwards The ameloblasts start from the DEJ dentinoenamel junction where enamel and dentin meet and move towards the outside of the crown They are lost during tooth eruption when the tooth comes through the gums The tooth is unable to heal since it cannot produce enamel after eruption because there are no cells to make new enamelDentin on the other hand can and does form after the tooth is already in the mouth secondary dentin forms after the tooth is in the mouth and more dentin is made towards the centre of the tooth tertiary dentin is made in response to inflammation of the pulp often due to cavities So in one sense the tooth is healing However it doesnt heal like bones since often a tooth fractures in the middle of the tooth and the odontoblasts cannot move through already formed dentin to make new tooth structure on top of old tooth structure and as the ameloblasts are gone no new enamel can be produced While Im not as familiar with bone healing bone is a vascularized blood containing cellular tissue Osteoblasts which synthesis new bone and osteoclasts which eat old bone are always working even when there is no damage So when the bone is broken these cells can work to remodel and repair the bone I hope this helps answer your question,29,cdpf0fv,1ronxr,askscience,top_week,164.0,135

ElDentistador,So far all the other comments are spot on  The cells that form the enamel and dentin in teeth are ameleoblasts and odontoblasts respectively  The ameleoblasts work from the DEJ out while the odontoblasts work from the DEJ in  The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are mostly at the edge of the pulp only extending processes through tubules within the dentin and your ameleoblasts are long gone once they finish forming the enamel This leaves enamel and dentin without any significant intrinsic method of healing and your immune system has no access to these two tissues either as they are avascularBy the time your immune system gets to see the infection the bacteria have breached the pulp chamber Much like the brain pulpal tissue  cannot handle inflammation well since its completely encased by hard tissue  Your own inflammatory response increases the intrapulpal pressure dramatically and it hurts  The pulpal tissue will necrose and the bacteria now have an easy path through the canals to the periapical tissues which can lead to more serious infections like cellulitis and osteomyelitis  There have actually been cases where odontogenic infections have led to fatalities which should never happen  The most famous case is Deamonte Driver ,1,cdpgs6c,1ronxr,askscience,top_week,13.0,12
mkav,Also the teeth have an outer layer called the pellicle The pellicle is where plaque formation first starts and eventually can become calculus A question I thought of when first beginning cariology study of cavities was why dont antibiotics stop caries And the answer is because bacteria in plaque and calculus form a biofilm This biofilm forms a protective layer and also has channels between adjacent biofilms These channels allow the transfer of genes which can cause some minor resistance in these strains Enamel is formed by ameloblasts which deposit enamel in an inside to outside direction After the enamel is deposited the ameloblasts either die off or can form a cuticle layer Dentin however is formed by odontoblasts and can be deposited through a lifetime in an inward direction So in a way teeth can heal to a small degree because if there is insult or resorption of dentin possibly due to inflammation or trauma the tooth can lay down tertiary dentin in order to repair it as long as it is on the pulpal side ,0,cdph1sv,1ronxr,askscience,top_week,7.0,7

MrQuiver,The light we observe from it has been traveling towards us for  years We are observing it right now as it was  years ago We do not have to send it anything to observe it nor to determine its composition We are passively receiving the light that has been radiating out from it This light contains the information that tells us of its compositionThere is no difference between this and how you observe say an airplane in the sky above you You do not have to travel to the plane to observe it You just have to observe the light that is arriving at your eyes from the plane The only difference in your example is that the thing you are observing is much further away such that the light that is arriving at your eyes was emitted a long time ago,0,cdplcfr,1rpf7x,askscience,top_week,4.0,4
DanielSank,This excellent question is at the root of many other questions that show up on raskscienceThere are aspects of this question that nobody really understands yet However we understand a lot more than popular science and even some physicists will lead you to believe This will be a somewhat long post but possibly worth your time to readBefore I say anything else I want to say that your statementgt How does it know it was observed By its interaction with surrounding particles of courseis absolutely essential I hope to explain why belowStructure of physical theoryAny theory of physics has two parts  The first part is a representation of the natural system under consideration For example if you are making a theory of balls rolling down hills you represent each ball with three numbers xyz indicating the balls position in space You may also have Vx Vy Vz representing its velocity in all three directions  The second part is some way of predicting how this representation changes as time goes by  For the case of rolling balls this could just be Newtons laws of motionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiNewtonslawsofmotionIn classical physics these two parts were all we needed to go happily about our scientific lives However theres actually a crucially important third part  We have to have a prescription for how the representation put forth in part  relates to our personalhumancognitive observations of the natural system In other words what does a group of numbers xyz have to do with my observation of the systemIn the case of rolling balls this is pretty simple I might use Newtons laws to compute that my ball should be at position meter  meters  meters at time minutesand we all just know that this means that we should see a ball at the specified location and time This works just fine and indeed in classical mechanics the link between part  and  is usually pretty straightforward Note that we never mentioned anything about what we meant by see a ball because in classical physics we implicitly assume that it doesnt matter In quantum mechanics it does matter and Ill now try to explain whyQuantum mechanicsThe first two parts of quantum mechanics are   We represent the natural world with a wave functionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiWavefunction or state vectorhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumstate  The wave function evolves according to Schrodingers equationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiSchrCBdingerequation or Heisenbergs equationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenbergpictureThese two together are just as good as xyz coordinates and Newtons laws The place where everyone gets confused is in what the wave function means in terms of what we observe in experiments To answer this question you hear people say things like when you make a measurement the wave function collapses into a definite position chosen at random and thats what you see The crucial thing to understand is that this statement modifies part  It says that Schrodingers equation determines the evolution until some vaguely defined observation happens at which time Schrodingers equation stops being correct the state collapses probabilistically and then Schrodingers equation goes back into effect This breaks the theorys selfconsistency Suppose I make a measurement and say that the atoms state collapsed Now suppose that me and my experiment are in a box which is actually the experiment of some greater alien For the theory to be true for the alien there cant be any state collapse until he does the observation Thus we see that state collapse as stated above cant workThe issue is that as stated above state collapse modifies part  of the theory whereas we should have been looking for a part  type statement It turns out that if we leave part  alone and make an extra statement like this  When a humans brain collects information about a physical system that information will be randomly distributed according to the square of the wave function and that system will henceforth appear to have collapsed in accordance with the result of the humans informationthen we have a selfconsistent theory I emphasize that it is both falsifiable and selfconsistent and therefore must be admissible as a theory of Nature That said its not very satisfying because of this bizarrely anthropocentric rule  which seems much more weird than the sort of obvious equivalent rule  in classical physics DecoherenceAmazingly we can almost get the quantum rule  to be as obvious as the classical one The trick is to really consider what happens when we make measurements In fact whenever you measure something you are connecting that thing to many extra physical elements If I measure the position of an atom with a CCD camera I am coupling the wave function of the atom to an enormous number of electrons etc in the cameras inner workings Certainly I do not know the wave functions of all those electrons This is the crux of the entire story It turns out that if you actually compute what happens to the wave function of the atom in the case that it couples to a bunch of extra stuff whose wave functions you dont know then from your perspective the wave function of the atom becomes a classical probability distribution I emphasize that this comes about entirely from Schrodingers equation and nothing else From the perspective in which the wave functions of the electrons are known the atoms wave function does not collapse Therefore collapse can be understood as an apparent phenomenon predicted by pure quantum mechanics that shows up with only part of the information in a systems wave function is available This is always the applicable case for humans because our measurement apparatuses contain many uncontrollable degrees of freedomWhen the wave function appears to have collapsed for one observer it may not appear that way for another one who has more informationThis is really interesting because it gets us really really close to being able to explain rule  via rule  We know that when only some information of a system is available that information appears probabilistic What we havent explained is why humans see only one of those possible results Nobody knows the answer to thatAnswer to the original questionSo how does a particle know when it has definite position It doesnt It never does Definite position is just an apparent property of things that comes up when we dont have complete information about the systemConclusionWe have a selfconsistent theory of quantum mechanics using wave functions and Schrodingers equation Part of the theory is the statement that when humans have access to the prabability distributions furnished by partial access to a complete system wave function they perceive one particular value for some reason that we dont know For the physicists out there Id say more generally equations of motion are constraints on how the representation at one point in spacetime is related to the representation at other points in spacetime However I challenge anyone to state a truly selfconsistent theory of physics without such a ruleEDIT For down voters If you could express what you think is unscientific wrong or irrelevant

DanielSank,Since my other post was so longgt If none of the particles around it have definite positions either how does any particle in the universe know for sure that it was observedThey dont Particles dont do anything special when theyre observed We can propose a selfconsistent theory of quantum mechanics in which the wave functions dont actually collapse and take on a definite position The appearance of definite position only happens for in cases where only subsets of the systems information is available which happens to be the case relevant when humans are involved From the perspective of someone with fuller information about the system the collapse that you see may not happenThe falsifiability of this theory described more fully in my other post is definitely open for discussion Id love to have that discussion with anyone else whos interested,0,cdppng9,1rpid6,askscience,top_week,5.0,5

FromAshesRize,The answer is sort of You can not create an extremely small flame from a source such as a traditional candle But there is a way to create micro flames  This is called microcombustion and they are flames smaller than the width of a millimeter  They are typically made in small hard ceramic combustors such as alumina oxide and they burn at temperatures of up to  C The combustors have small channels through which the fuel flows and the flame burns They are typically fueled by hydrocarbons and oxygen Methane butane propane etcThe two inlet flows of the fuels meet and combine at some point and then you have your combustible gas The point at which the two flows meet exhibits turbulent flow and this is the limiting factor at ignition for the combustor due to wall conditions and fluid dynamics not worth explaining here Turbulent flow tends towards extinction for a flame Typically a large candle type flame will be seen at the end of the exhaust channelAs the combustor ramps up to its max temp steady state the walls of the exhaust channel heat up and begin to provide the thermal energy necessary for the gases within the channel to ignite You will hear loud pops as ignition events begin to occur within the channel As the temperature of the wall increases due to the heat seen from the exhaust flame the ignition events begin occurring closer to the mixing points of the  fuelsFinally at steady state the walls of the combustor at the mixing point of the fuels is so hot that the gases ignite immediately upon mixing Due to the turbulent nature of the flow they go out almost immediately  They are also almost immediately replaced by fresh uncombusted fuel which them ignites This cycle repeats itself many times per second and you end up with a sustained micro flame The ratio of gases determines how many times per second ignition occurs and you can actually say that the flame has a frequency Ie You can hear the flame buzz while it is litSo in short yes micro flames are possible just not from a candleTldrTeeny candles dont work Burn hydrocarbons in a ceramic combustor for super hot buzzing micro flames Science is awesome,106,cdplrw5,1rpive,askscience,top_week,596.0,490

OnceReturned,A comprehensive answer to that question would have many components but in animals there are a few dominant factorsDNA  Cell division is not perfect and DNA damage occurs naturally due to environmental factors and normal cellular processes  Genomic robustness and DNA repair capacity is a huge factor in lifespan determination  DNA damage is generally considered the leading cause of aging  Species with more robust genomes and better DNA repair mechanisms tend to have greater lifespansPhysical fragility  There are many potentially fatal events which individuals have some probability of experiencing in any given time period  These include things like harsh environmental conditions ie a bad winter infectious diseases and encounters with predators  Every organism has some set of such events which are likely to be fatal and which occur with some probably such that the more time passes the more likely the organism is to have been exposed to such an event  The more sensitive an organism is to these things the shorter its lifespan is expected to be  For example small animals are particularly susceptible to predation so the odds that they have a fatal encounter with a predator in any time period are higher than the those same odds for larger animals that are higher on the food chain  Biological wear and tear  Tissue and organs get worn out through use  Small animals generally have higher metabolisms which amounts to something similar to more friction or wear and tear on all of their systems ie more heartbeats per minute  So they dont typically live as long as typical larger creatures with slower metabolisms Generally larger animals live longer  Dogs are something of an exception  Its not exactly clear why large dogs dont live as long but it likely has something to do with the fact that domesticated dogs are highly inbred  This means they have genetic risk factors that are much less common in wild animals  This manifests in a variety of ways  For example large dogs are more likely to get cancer and this is likely because they simply grow more cells throughout their lives,0,cdptcay,1rqeob,askscience,top_week,2.0,2

UnkeptPorpoise,What you are describing with matter bending space time is I believe part of special relativity Not sure how that relates to the universe as a whole spinning The question would be spinning in relation to what Maybe I just misunderstood your question I am by no means an expert though,9,cdpwzj7,1rqeus,askscience,top_week,5.0,-4
