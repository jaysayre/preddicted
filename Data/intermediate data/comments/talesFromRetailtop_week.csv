superspeck,Heh Actually that reminds me of a time when I did school a cashier I wasnt trying to get a discount or anything he was just having a problem with a POS system at a place that Id worked at while in high school It was a regional camera store and is now national This is about ten years ago several years after Id stopped working for them I was buying up their stock of a slide film that had been discontinued He was having a problem getting the machine to ring it up because when looking up by the UPC barcode the POS insisted that the product had been discontinued yet it was obviously sitting right there on the counter which meant it was probably in inventory but under the retailer part number and not the UPC I told him to hit the key that escaped to the manager menu and walked him through looking it up by name When it worked he said that he had to go get his manager to make sure hed done it correctly Fine Ill wait Fatty McManager came stomping out of the back room with each step shaking the carefully planogrammed displays and a cloud of steam coming from each ear He asked me who the heck I was to tell his employee how to access HIS manager menu and what was I trying to pull with having his employee ring up stuff that wasnt in inventory and how the heck did I know anything about their system I just said Yeah I used to work at low numbered store back when the POS system was released and yall probably do it differently these days but we had to use those menus because things were pretty broken when they were first installed That didnt appease Fatty McManager though  he said it was VERY irregular and pompously declared that I should give him my associate number if I was indeed an employee This companys POS system assigned a number to each associate for life They were sequential so you could tell when someone had been hired by how low their associate number was I gave it to him told him You can look me up in the computer F menu  heres my drivers license Address is obviously different but the names the same and sos the cell phone number Oh and whats your associate number His was well up past a quarter million I asked him if a particular district manager still worked for the company and confided that his associate number was in the double digits I got my film and after Mr McManager deflated he actually gave me the employee discount even though I didnt ask for it tldr There are cases where a customer might school a blowhard manager Not that I think you OP are a blowhard However you might find out someday that you were just a number to the corporation ,16,cdlcw22,1ragwd,talesFromRetail,top_week,45,29

MagpieChristine,The grocery selfcheckouts here seem really poorly designed When they first came in you needed to get the attendant to override for you when you started because putting your bags in the bagging error would trigger the scale Its not bad that the scale is that sensitive but the add bags button is an entirely necessary feature I think they might even let you take bags off and add new ones these days I never buy that much at the self checkout because every time it burps I have to wait for the overworked attendant My biggest beef with them is that the grocery store in the mall has ONLY selfcheckouts at the mall entrance Sure I get that its not really feasible to have two sets of conventional checkouts but I hate having to carry my bags of groceries back through the store past the selfcheckout to be able to leave ,0,cdmaq0r,1rbn62,talesFromRetail,top_week,1,1

SonGoku,Hello again other storyhttpwwwredditcomrTalesFromRetailcommentsronpreligionjewelry   I work in a jewelry store and we are coming to one of the biggest times of the year christmas we have our NovDec catalogue out with amazing deals so people have been shopping like madTo start off the day had been going pretty badly from the start people bitching cause they cant get a better deal bargains not being big enough seeing our brand merchandise in a competitive store for a cheaper price etc However the day really started doing horribly when I got a sale stolen from me Two guys walked in to buy a heap of christmas present the two of them together brothers dropped nearly  grand on various things mostly  grand chains rings etc I was serving them for about an hour biggest single sale of the day but still about  grand behind the months best These two gentleman were about too pay we were at the register and one of the other sales assistants came over and said that Our manager wanted her to take over I reluctantly said ok I asked if I could go talk  to said manager after sale but she said no so I told the customers I would be back in a jiffy minute or so I was back and serve them The other sales assistant stated she would stay by the merchandise and the customers while I was with the manager I come back and the two guys are all bagged up there merchandise boxed and a near  grand sale gone through this other girls ID giving her the sale and a hefty commission just over  which should have been mine The thing was the manager was just asking if I could give her her keys back as she gave them to me to look after as she needed to use the toilet I had a bit of a rant at the other sales assistant the manager asked what was going on I explained the situation the other sales assistant said she could make the sale as I said to do so and that even if I didnt she has been there longer than me so she had the right she also stated they needed to leave but even so she can still allocate the sale to me on the sales program we use The two customers heard what happened made a formal complaint asked to see the manager thanked me for my happiness and service and left The other sales person still got the sale etc but I have the satisfaction of knowing she was in the wrong and that she got the shit grilled out of her still want my  back though,8,cdmmfke,1rew30,talesFromRetail,top_week,12,4

Techsupportvictim,Pretty sure that the business doesnt owe her money nor does he So she should be told to leave By the cops And if possible legally restrained from going into said business emailing talking to calling etc anyone associated with the businessIf the courts ordered the kid to pay and he didnt thats contempt of a court order Im sure even in Australia that means getting the courts coming after you Freezing assets etc It will suck for the nice brother but Im sure he can argue to restore access because he didnt violate the law And he might be willing to executor the repayment of the devpbts as ordered by the courts He can repay folks and then tell them to piss off and never come near him again,6,cdng6ar,1rhnqp,talesFromRetail,top_week,24,18
iaskediam,The moment she brought up the business she actually became guilty of two other things potentially laws may vary For one she is now slandering as the business owes no money and she is potentially staining the reputation of the business by saying such a thing For another if it could be construed that she was coming between the business and their customers and causing the business material harm she could be in violation of another law designed to protect the right of a business to conduct their transactionsYou need to have a conversation with your boss when this lady is not present She is potentially causing you harm also if the business were to be damaged through her actions or possibly if your boss were to use company assets to pay her off despite this being about his brother Tell him that you understand his personal situation but when it bleeds into the business it needs to be handled and not ignored or else his problems could compound and you and your coworkers will get dragged into the mess Tell him you are quite capable of handling the intrusion yourself so he doesnt need to be involved in a conflict that he wants no part of Assure him that you are looking out for both him and the store He wouldnt want his business to suffer because of an employees private affairs and he shouldnt let his own get in the way either He has the biggest stake in the company but everyone he is paying for their work also does and they shouldnt be subject to this ladys unnecessary stress inducing presence while they are thereLet him know that the next time she shows up you will give her the option of making a purchase and leaving or skipping right to the leaving part If she refuses you will tell her that the police will be summoned and she will be charged with trespassing Let her know that if she attacks the business verbally like she did on this occasion further charges will be pressed if applicable  In short make sure your boss knows that if the lady continues her antics youll do everything you were going to do after he left last time while he is still there acting on behalf of the business and your coworkers My guess is that the boss will initially balk at the idea but with a little push on your part hell actually be glad to know that theres a plan if she returns and that someone else can take charge of the situation,5,cdnn2ex,1rhnqp,talesFromRetail,top_week,17,12

LostArtofConfusion,Anytime someone pulls out the Mommy Card it makes me think violent thoughts  Dont expect me to cater to your whims just because you couldnt control your biological urges  They know what causes pregnancy  Use birth control  Your bad decisions do not entitle you to a discountThe Single Mom thing is even worse  I know lots of single moms who manage to lump along like the rest of us without announcing it like it gives them a free passThere is a woman I know who has six kids  She decided after kid number  that her marriage was rocky and what they really needed was another baby to make it all better  Then when that didnt fix anything because WHY WOULD IT she started to look for validation from other men  So she ended up being a single mother of six and she rags on her exhusband for being a jerk even though he seems pretty cool and howls all the time about how she should have insert whatever whim because shes a Single Mooooooom And I couldnt possibly understand her plight because my womb is a rocky place where my husbands seed can find no purchase  Because I take steps to make sure of that  ,6,cdo7ljy,1rk5uo,talesFromRetail,top_week,29,23

etterboce,To everyone who keeps saying she should file criminal charges against the customer I agree in theory However even if OP knows who the customer is simply calling the police could result in her termination depending on the company Its a really terrible thing but many corporate retailers side with the customers so much that they will terminate an employee for calling the police without authorization And they are completely allowed to do this without any worry of recourse because it is company policy and in the employee handbook that they make us sign when we get hiredI dont know how I would have reacted I would love to say that I would have done something awesome and put the lady in her place but Im not sure In times like that its hard to say how any of us would really have reacted Ive had some extremely tense situations with customers over the years and Ive never reacted completely how I would have expectedEither way Im sorry you had this happen to you OP Nobody has a right to put their hands on you Next time the best thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation call a manager and fill out an incident report Ask for medical care if you even slightly think its necessary And do not ever serve that customer again Even if management will not ban her let them know that you will not wait on her Make your manager go up to the register every time she comes in,0,cdpt0sl,1rotqh,talesFromRetail,top_week,2,2

mirshe,I completely agree with it  It doesnt even have to be anything big but just a good job here and there goes a long way  Letting your employees know theyre appreciated is a good way to keep employees longer,6,cdpoj1y,1rpynq,talesFromRetail,top_week,45,39
johnnydakota,I work in a bar where one manager thinks were all replaceable and I have literally only heard him say one positive comment to staff in the year that hes been in the position and that was to one specific person who cleaned the bathroom well Ive been at the place just about as long as he has and because of this many people come to me before him when they have issuesI make sure to tell people when theyre doing well I thank people for their effort even if theyre just doing their basic tasks I will go over to the next station and ask You doing okay You need help Okay come to me for anything Im not a manager Ill never be a manager at the place and I know thisIve had people come to me and tell me Im too good for the place and I have a lot more potential than I give myself credit for Because the other manager is such a dick to everyone morale is way down people have up and quit because they dont want to deal with him and inventory has been fucked because people just dont care anymore I love my job but Im not happy where I work anymore because of these issuesI dont really have a point to all that but I just want to agree Yes management please tell your employees thank you good job and make sure theyre happy I promise you your employees will enjoy work more and it will show in the business You can have a line to draw when it comes to getting personal but take an interest in your staff Even if its something small like if you know someone is interested in sports and you saw the same game or something talk to them about it Its not showing weakness its making a connection In turn I believe employees will be more honest with you and try harder,2,cdps306,1rpynq,talesFromRetail,top_week,13,11
tidymaze,Agreed Had something similar happen today Black FridayI work in a corporate tea shop in a mall and we were busting ass today We were beating our daily plan so well that we were in the top  stores in the country for the day competing against stores that were larger and in more populated areas By the time I left at  we had met our sales goal for the dayAs a thank you for busting our asses all day my GM gave myself and one other coworker a small prize  ounces of any tea we wanted Its not a whole lot but to be recognized and given something just feels good,0,cdpzh9r,1rpynq,talesFromRetail,top_week,6,6
