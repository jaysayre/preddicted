COLISSAYING,My grandmothers phone number was one digit different then the supermarkets pharmacy number for some reason the printed labels they put on the bottles the number always came out to look like my grandmothers we had gotten our own prescriptions there as well and could see how people could make the mistake she would get calls constantly asking to renew their prescriptions or ask questions she was a nice old lady and would inform people that they had the wrong number and even give them the correct one she would then call the pharmacy asking them to either check the ink or fix the label that the number on the bottle looked like hers not theirs they should have had an  but it looked like a  they never did anything about it and we would get calls all day and night finally i just started telling people their prescription would be ready in an hour i guess they got a lot of complaints cause months later their label was totally different and the number was clear ,0,cdpze51,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_week,7,7
CalculatingCup,You get my sympathy because Ive gotten this type of call almost every year since having a phone Im in my s for reference Some keep dialing the same number over and over Some hit redial like yours The ones that kill me are when youve been nice for the first  attempts then when your frustration shows on attempt  they get an attitude and say There is no need for you to be rudeIm gonna follow your lead from now on and just pretend to be who they ask for ,0,cdpzd3a,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_week,6,6
tidymaze,My grandparents phone number was oneoff from a local taxi company When the phone would ring in the middle of the night as it invariably did about once a month my grandfather would politely ask where they were and where they were going tell them a cab was en route then hang up His reasoning was that if they couldnt pay attention to the greeting a sleepy Hello compared to a snippy Valley Cab that wasnt his problem,1,cdpzo1y,1rq1xi,pettyrevenge,top_week,7,6

BNugget,Im planning on making business cards just for this purpose The parking garage where I work has compact car angled parking spots and SUVs regularly park there If you can fit in the spot fine but these jerks regularly park over the lines not at an angle and make it difficult for the rest of us The best part is one lane over are parking spots that would fit their cars but the people want to be just that much closer to the stairwell,0,cdpyq3a,1rq879,pettyrevenge,top_week,3,3
