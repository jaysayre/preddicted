Axon,A little while agohttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsozbwhowasthefirstuspresidenttohavehisccxmecontext I talked about the first photograph of a sitting US President You can see some links in that postThe earliest surviving photo of a president in office is of James K Polk There are a couple undated photos of him so the order is unclear but they were almost certainly taken while he was in office because he died just three months after leavingThose are the earliest surviving in digitized form youd be surprised what you can find in books photos of a sitting President Yet there is a mysterious photo of John Tyler Wikipedia says that Polk was the first to be photographed in office without citation but has in its article a photo of Tyler purportedly taken by Anthony Edwards amp Co A press release from March   in the New York Herald talks about an exhibition of pictures taken by Anthony Edwards amp Co and mentions a portrait of exPresident John Tyler The portrait is not described and neither is the date on which it was captured Another press release mentions the gallery on March  implying that it was a multiday event Tyler only left office on March  It is possible that a photo of Tyler was indeed taken while he was still in office Further corroborating this is a brief blurb here at the Encyclopedia Virginia which mentions an advertisement from  from Anthony Edwards amp Co claiming to have photographed Tyler It is as yet unclear when exactly the existing daguerreotype of Tyler was taken though I conclude that it is certainly possible for him to have been photographed in officeHere on the other hand is the largely undisputed first photograph of any US President John Quincy AdamshttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsbJohnQuincyAdamscopyofPhilipHaasDaguerreotypejpg ,2,cdpcwce,1ro73k,askhistorians,top_day,11,9

BeondTheGrave,The pacts were really aimed at Nazi Germany so the Soviet invasion which was a complete surprise didnt really trigger the alliance But because of Poland and the later invasion of Finland the British and French were very interested in bombing the Soviets and possibly even providing troops to support the Finns One of the early plans for the intervention into Norway which was planned before the Nazis invaded btw was to deploy troops across Norway which would serve as a bridgehead for deploying troops into Finland Actually the biggest reason why these plans fell through was the collapse of the Finnish resistance But the Brits and France were really keen on attacking the Soviets Of course that all changed when the Norway was invaded and later when France was attacked ,1,cdpd6ww,1rog7o,askhistorians,top_day,2,1
johnandrewsmith,The short answer to your question is no All of these occurrences were isolated incidents that happened for various reasonsThe long answer is well complicated I dont quite like covering Russia with broad generalizations since their society is so unique but I think in this case it might work Russia is a steppe country whose borders are very long and open making it vulnerable to the various horse tribes of the steppe In order to counter this Russian rulers tend to militarily expand in order to eliminate possible threats from the steppe They also tend to consolidate and centralize power using terror and violence when necessary This is not so different from other European monarchs at the time although it can be argued that the Russian methods were more thorough And then sometimes the ruler was just plain mad as it can be with any monarchy Ivan the Terrible for instance was starting to go crazy at the time he killed his son He didnt intentionally do it and afterwards he  held his son in his arms cryingIts important to understand the situation many czars were in order to understand their actions They were often threatened by war rebellions and coups Sometimes this necessitated harsh policies Peter and Catherine were certainly great rulers but they ruled Russia with an iron fist Peter brutally stamped out opposition to his western policies and Catherine either manipulated or killed anyone who was a threat to her Ivan the Terrible created the Oprichniki which was the original secret police These rulers were keenly aware of the political situation and did this not only to hold onto power but to save their own skin So now were at Peter the Great Peter asks his son to start preparing to become czar while his son wants nothing to do with that Peter had another son but he needed to make sure that after he died that Alexei wouldnt get powerhungry and go after the throne anyway He demands that Alexei become a monk if he wants to be czar one day to join the army Alexei flees from Russia to Vienna This causes quite a stir among the nobility and Peter suspects his son of treason He convinces his son to return on the false pretense of safety After Alexeis return Peter starts his inquisition to root out all the traitors in Alexeis circle His son is convicted then sentenced to death He is instead tortured to death in an attempt to get more informationStalins situation is also unique He was also very concerned about the political atmosphere in Russia He was also in the middle of a devastating war and while it did give him some leverage among the general population he could no longer afford to eliminate political threats in the military Stalins son was captured by the Germans Hitler offered to trade him for Field Marshall Paulus and Stalin replied I will not trade a Marshall for a Lieutenant While we can speculate on the various reasons Stalin abandoned his son it is claimed by his daughter that Stalin believed his son deliberately surrendered and was therefore a traitorThe very long answer to your question is that Russian leaders might not have cultural background for killing their heirs but they do have a history of autocracy and paranoia Hopefully this answers your question,10,cdphgz4,1roiae,askhistorians,top_day,35,25

TheWinStore,Botched intelligence and botched communication within the Kennedy administration contributed a great deal to the failure of the Bay of Pigs Yet the catastrophe was entirely avoidable Just for some essential background information during his first few months in office JFK was immediately confronted with the question of what to do about Cuba In  Castro had taken control of the country and Castro wanted to free Cuba from its dependency on the USthe US bought  of Cubas sugar at subsidized prices and owned the major oil refineries sugar plantations and utilities Castro wasnt a communist when he took over but his brother Raul was and so was Che Guevara Both pressured Castro to draw closer to the SovietsOn November   about a week after his election JFK was briefed on a CIA plan to send an invasion force of  Cuban exiles to invade Cuba President Eisenhower told JFK that the antiCastro plan was proceeding well and that it would be his responsibility to see it through That advice left a big impression on JFK who greatly respected Ikes military background   So what intelligence and bureaucratic failures doomed the Bay of Pigs and why did they developFailure  the Joint Chiefs The Joint Chiefs studied the CIA plan and correctly concluded it would fail without largescale popular uprisings in Cuba meaning the people of Cuba would have to rise up against the government The Joint Chiefs also correctly concluded that there was no evidence the Cuban people would do so Unfortunately the Joint Chiefs obfuscated their conclusions For example they concluded that the CIA plan had a fair chance of success But does fair mean good or bad Its very ambiguous language What the JCs really meant was that there was a  chance of failure which are pretty poor odds relatively speaking But when JFKs advisors read the memo they werent aware of this probability Additionally all the Joint Chiefs reservations about the plan were buried in the back of the long memo Failure  obsession with secrecy A series of meetings were called in the White House to discuss the CIA plan One of the first issues that arose was the disposal problem which was raised by Allen Dulles who was still head of the CIA as a holdover from Ikes administration He said that if the invasion were called off the Cuban exiles who had been training in Guatemala would come to the US and risk leaking the plan making JFK look weak and indecisive In March  JFK approved the plan provided US involvement was kept secret He wanted the plan to be free of traces of US fingerprints Whether this was even feasible was another question entirely But secrecy was desirable at the time because the US was still engaged in sensitive negotiations with the Soviets over Laos JFK also wanted a more benign relationship with Latin American countries and a US invasion of Cuba would make the US look bad Unfortunately JFKs desire for secrecy led to the invasion site being moved from Trinidad Cuba to the lessexposed Bay of Pigs This decision would have substantial consequences As far as intelligence goes JFK approved the plan with the assumption that even if the invasion failed the Cuban exiles could flee to the mountains and conduct guerrilla warfare there There was a minor snag howeverwhereas the original invasion site at Trinidad was close to the mountains the Bay of Pigs was not It seems that no one took the time to look at a map and point this out to JFK Oops Excessive secrecy was a problem even within the process of administrative decisionmaking At every meeting for example the CIA would hand out copies of the latest plan and then confiscate the plans at the end so that none of JFKs advisors could leave the room with them This prevented the administration from consulting outside experts at the State Department and so forth Failure  erroneous assumptions The Bay of Pigs plan was based on numerous erroneous assumptions For example it was assumed that the invasion would set off an uprising in the Cuban underground against Castro But after the air strike Castro just rounded up all the members of the Cuban underground and chucked them into prison The antiCastro forces were weak disorganized and lacked clear leadership No Cuban underground even existed Another poor assumption was that US involvement could be kept a secret  clearly implausible given the extent of US involvement And finally there was the assumption that even a failed invasion would allow a flight to the mountains which never occurred Failure  newbies Typically bad intelligence can be checked by thorough careful decisionmaking However JFKs advisors were reluctant to speak out against the plan The advisors were in place only  days were new to each other and were not used to blunt discussion They were afraid to challenge the CIA on the premises of the plan especially because the CIA was headed by Allen Dulles who had overthrown governments in Guatemala and elsewhere There was no real discussion where advisors were allowed to debate the issuesthe administration simply deferred the plan to the CIA and so the outcome was extremely poorFailure  bureaucratic politics The CIA and the Joint Chiefs were much more concerned about their own parochial interests than national interests The CIA withheld critical information from the president such as the known weakness of the antiCastro underground and the low morale of the Cuban exiles when they learned US would provide direct support The CIA also had no evidence of strong antiCastro forces on Cuba The CIA was not the only culprit The Joint Chiefs did not effectively warn JFK that the operation was not militarily feasible They failed to warn him that Castros air force had to be totally destroyed for the invasion to have any chance of success And the Joint Chiefs did not make their other reservations known to the administration Why They thought if the plan started to fail JFK would have to deploy US troops to salvage the mission which would conveniently serve the Joint Chiefs interests And if the invasion did fail they assumed the CIA would take the blame not them  All of these reasons contributed to the failure of the Bay of Pigs Would a USflagged invasion have succeeded Perhaps but JFK would never have approved such a plan If the intelligence had been properly handled the correct decision would have been to take no action Fortunately JFK learned a few lessons from the Bay of Pigs First dont trust the bureaucracy Second dont be awed by experts And third encourage frank discussion and debate JFK would draw on all of these lessons during the Cuban missile crisisso in a way failure in  laid the groundwork for success in    Source Deborah Welch Larson lecture University of California Los Angeles

Bezant,gtJust outside Athens Pisistratus cut himself and his mules about the body then drove into town claiming that hed been attacked by his political enemies The people gave him bodyguards who followed him around armed with clubs Pisistratus then took the Acropolis by force with the help of his new bodyguardsThis one I dont think is particularly hard to believe  The main point is that he overrode the traditional Athenian objections to an armed bodyguard  Once he had say a handful of men the precedent was set and as a powerful political figure he was able to expand his guard further over timegtPisistratus was later driven out of Athens His plan to get back into power is described by Herodotus as the silliest trick which history has to record He found a tall woman called Phye Φύη and dressed her up as Athena He taught her some goddesslike moves then rode into Athens on a chariot with her standing next to him The Athenians fell for this ludicrous ruse and he returned to power Herodotus himself is incredulous about this storyMy Greek history professor suggested that rather than being taken in by the ruse it was never intended seriously and the Athenians just went along because they appreciated a good show  The entire show was secondary to the political context that allowed him to return and be welcomed by the citizens  I find that a more reasonable assessment than the Athenians being complete idiots  for fun if you calculate Phyes height she was about gtAfter being chucked out of Athens for a second time Pisistratus gathered an army and made for the city On the way a soothsayer wandered by and told him some nonsense about fish being caught in nets Pisistratus ordered his army to advance at that exact time the Athenians were having lunch or playing some dice or having an afterlunch snooze So Pisistratuss army walked into Athens unopposed This strikes me as the fairly common practice of random oracles and divine acts being thrown in  The thing that makes Herodotus different from the people that wrote about history before him is he incorporated human agency rather than divine  A common feature of his work is explaining the human side and  the supposed divine side of any historical event but what really makes it history is they basically function without the divine bitsWhat we know is that during his exile he built contacts throughout the Greek world raised a pretty big army which he marched back to Athens with and won the battle of PalleneAlso keep in mind he was not just some nutter gaining power through crazy tricks  He was an important political leader with a large base of support among the Athenians as well as a skilled and competent ruler  So it wasnt very absurd that he rose to power  As to whether people believed the more fanciful parts of the story probably not at first but as the time passes and the events grow more distant the authority of remaining sources gets stronger so until more serious criticism of historiography emerged Herodotus version was likely widely believed,16,cdphf7u,1rp2ge,askhistorians,top_day,113,97

khosikulu,Only in a few places did various Europeans have the power to generate conflict directly andor raid for slaves even then they had African auxiliaries like Portugal in the area of northern Angola today  So some involvement by Africans of various standings and origins had to exist and did the mixedheritage Eurafrican trading class that grew from the s onward was also a crucial part of factoring slaves into the Atlantic trade  But one must always remember that only certain African societies took part and only certain leaderships under varying conditions usually connected to other existing political objectives  African rulers didnt have to give consent because the majority of people taken into slaveryand certainly the majority of fightingage menwere captured in war or surrendered as tribute  Under the older system however those people remained in the region the export trades removed them entirely  Except for civil war important in Kongo and occasionally the sale of condemned criminals African rulers were not putting their people into the trade but normally their enemies or other strangers  The acquisition cost was effectively pretty low so this was pure profit for the individual captorThe getting guns thing was not quite as important as you suggest in part because a number of societies had other things Europeans wanted too and sometimes they wanted other things from Europeans  Asante for example not only actually imported slaves on the coast but also had gold and could buy firearms It wasnt alone  Arms traffic in West Africa wasnt restricted to those who engaged in slave trafficking  It wasnt just leaders either a lot of traders were pretty independent and simply gathered slaves from the major markets  Slaveoriented states like Dahomey were late developments on the wholeThe Atlantic trade was something of a magnitude unknown in the intraAfrican trade or generally in the African experience of slavery  Chattel slavery required a lot of people to pretend they werent doing anything wrong the massive expansion of the slave trade required the same  In effect answering the question of whos at moral fault is impossible because everyone involved in the trade from the point of capture to the final destination was in some way responsible for the trade  The morality of the slave trade is another matter because of the prospect of presentism but we can certainly recognize analytically that the machinery of the export slave trades worked helically growing and deepening as it went one step at a time involving people of all sorts with a lot of different motivations across three continents and a whole ocean  A search for particular blame is not really relevant here and its honestly not good history to frame a complex  year long commercial trajectory that wayHave a look at John Thorntons Cultural History of the Atlantic World  or his earlier Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World  He gets at some of this in there  One important warning thoughthe agendas in play when people talk about the blame game or the related numbers game are a mile wide on many sides,4,cdphq5f,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,26,22
mormengil,Moral culpability is a very tricky subject for historians to get intoWe really should not anachronistically reflect our own moral values or todays moral values back into the past and use them to judge historical peopleIf we think that it is immoral to conquer other people does that mean we should go back in history and declare that Alexander and Caesar and Muhammad and Genghis Khan were evil and morally culpableInstead if one of the goals of history is to deeply understand the past and the people in it we should try to understand how the people themselves or their contemporaries thought about the morality and how they might have judged themselves or been judged AT THE TIMEAt the time of the early Atlantic slave trade in the s slavery had been a long standing institution in Africa and the slave trade in the Indian ocean had been going on for a long time  I dont think we know of any sources indicating a moral objection to the slave trade within African societiesThere was also little or no moral objection to slavery from Europeans in  It wasnt until late in the s that the abolitionist movement and men like John Wesley and William Wilberforce in England and colonists in Northern Colonies like Vermont and Massachusetts began to be a strong voice against the morality of slaveryAfrican rulers were certainly heavily engaged in the slave trade but whether they or their contemporaries considered them morally culpable for this engagement seems dubiousBy the late s there were enough people in Europe mostly England and the Americas who thought that slavery was immoral and were vocal enough about it that most Europeans were aware that the subject had been opened for debate  Whether or when any of this debate occurred in Africa I dont think we know,1,cdpjwy3,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,5,4
GHboy,The moral culpability of African rulers is a loaded and subjective question whose answer depends on perspectiveIts a complex interplay of the two European powers specifically set up forts on coastal areas to purchase slaves However they could not have purchased slaves without a sellerIn addition to buying slaves from freelance slave catchers Europeans also bought slaves who were POWs and refugees from kingdoms such as the Ashanti KingdomhttpenwikipediaorgwikiAshantiEmpireConsidering the extreme profitability of the slave trade in the Americas it was in European interest to have Africans fighting as it supplied a steady stream of slaves It was in the Africans interest to sell slaves as to acquire guns so as to not be enslaved by their enemiesIf an African kingdom had refused to cooperate and sell slaves the European powers would have simply armed the competing tribekingdom So the Africans had to play ball whether they wanted to or not and some states like the expansionary Ashanti empire definitely wanted to play ballSecondly tribes never actually sold their own people They sold other tribes from further inland So Im not sure if consent is even applicable Its fairly easy to consent to you enslaving my enemy,5,cdphw56,1rp6v4,askhistorians,top_day,4,-1

BeondTheGrave,The answer is really simple so dont be upset if this is a brief answer But  Shiloh is so important for Grant because he almost lost See the battle happens over two days and on the first day the Union forces were thoroughly beaten by the Confederates Grant should have accepted his loss and pulled his troops back its what every other general did during the war need I bring up panicky McClellan But instead he consolidated his forces and fought again on the second day where he turned the tables and inflicted a defeat on the Confederate forces a defeat which allowed the Union to keep all the gains it had made across the Mississippi river I should add This showed Grant to be a tenacious and capable commander It didnt prove that he was a great general that would come in  but it proved he was willing to continue fighting when by all measures he was actually beaten Also its interesting to look at the battle of Shiloh in the context of the Overland Campaign During Overland Grant suffered major defeats at every engagement if we use the same ruler we use for every other Civil War battle which doesnt quite fit the OC Ill admit But US Grant kept turning Lees flank and continuing south Whereas every general before him had retreated after losing to Lee Grant just kept going Thats another reason why Shiloh is so critical to US Grant  Edit Did you delete your comment Anyway get Russell F Weigleys A Great Civil WarhttpwwwamazoncomGreatCivilWarPoliticaldprefsrieUTFampqidampsrampkeywordsRussellWeigley which is really a classic ,0,cdpk2qy,1rpiji,askhistorians,top_day,4,4

LordSariel,It has an extremely high variance depending on what kind of environment youre in Atlantic World Historian Ira Berlin has said something to the effect of To know a person is a slave is to know only their legal status And I stand by this from my own research in the Atlantic World The experience of slaves cannot be so easily generalized even within the very clear lens of British Colonial North America Even there a number of different crops were grown between  and  and slaves were subjected to different legal and social privileges that effected their socialization and cultural melding with the settler populationAs predominantly mentioned in Berlins book Many Thousands Gone The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America the question of language has many factors The most prominent of these factors is how many captured Africans spoke your same language This would effect the actual sales pool upon reaching the Colonies Beyond that the geographic region in which you arrive in which in time you arrive further has a huge effect on your cultural integration Urban slaves generally had more autonomy and were required to socialize faster because they were usually in extremely small numbers in close quarters with settlers Rural farmers could still have    slaves from many diverse regions forcing them to learn a common language usually English Large planters largely in the southern states that had a yearround climate for agriculture could have anywhere from    slaves even in the Early Colonial years and they would be less likely to develop any kind of propensity for English in the first generation In other areas of the Caribbean the native language of the slaveholding class was much less adopted because in places like Brazil Haiti etc slaves were imported in such mass numbers and less care was given to their survival Generally speaking these areas has a much larger population of native Africans at any times This differs from British Colonial North America in that the class of African Americans rose much sooner out of the imported populationFor more information read Ira Berlins book He goes into much more detail based on Geographic region type of work type of crops grown as well as the politics of the time Its a beautiful mix of social political and economic history that transcends national boundaries to give you an exhaustively thorough look into what slavery was like everywhere in British Colonial North AmericaI can elaborate a bit more later but for now I have to shoot out for errands Sorry for the quick and dirty response Expect some clarifying edits later,7,cdpp97v,1rpl4t,askhistorians,top_day,28,21
RamblinRambo,Id like to answer this from a personal experience point of view Sure enough the world has changed and there are a lot of new resources out there but the main principle of learning by doing hasnt changed Ive moved countries a few times and Ive never learned a language through class Ive learned it by listening pointing asking and picking up words as you go And I know a good few others that have done the sameIt is important to note that for some people it takes longer and for some it takes less time Some are just simply much more talented in picking up and understanding new languages Exactly like some people are more skilled in maths than others some are more skilled in athletics and so onIf you try and are completely surrounded by a new foreign language Id say it takes on average  year to learn an acceptable level to be able to speak and converse If the language is close to another language you already know then it might take less than six months But if we analyse it from the perspective of being completely different it takes at least a year Once you get the basics youll learn fasterOne universal thing Ive noticed is that people understand each other very well through basic sign language It is actually amazingMy grandfather moved as a  year old boy with his brother to a country where they did not know a single word It was back in the day when english wasnt a common denominator as it is in much of the world today I remember a story from him on how he agreed to rent an apartment pay rent found a job etc with just basic sign languageAnd Id argue that nothing has changed since early history to today if you take away classes and education If you set out to learn a language by doing youll go through the exact same process Ive done this myselfOnly thing we need to think of when it comes to slaves is their ability or freedom to communicate with others that spoke english If they were heavily tied to one owner and their farm then it might have taken  years instead of one It all ties in with exposure to the language So Id expect heavy correlation with exposure to the language and it will have been case specific Also if there were a lot of slaves that spoke a common language it might mean that some of them never learned the new language You can see this in any areas even today where you have a lot of immigrants from the same part of the world Say china towns that have people that dont speak a word of english even if theyre been in an english speaking country for years,0,cdq593u,1rpl4t,askhistorians,top_day,1,1

DannyGray,The names of the months September October November and December come from the Roman calendar or the calendar of RomulusThis calendar consisted of  months namedMartius  days Aprilis  days Maius  days Iunius  days Quintilis  days Sextilis  days September  days October  days November  days December  daysYou may notice more Latin number prefixes Quint and Sex  and  respectivelySo what happened to this calendar Well first of all it wasnt very good There were  days between December and Martius which werent assigned to any month This calendar was first reformed by Numa Pompilius in around BC the second of the seven traditional kings of Rome He tinkered with the calendar somewhat Because Romans considered odd numbers lucky he removed a day from each month with  leaving  winter days unassigned And so he created two new months Ianuarius and Februarius which pushed the numbered months back by  making their prefixes wrong The calendar then looked like thisIanuarius  Februarius  Martius Aprilis Maius Iunius  Quintilis  Sextilis  September   October  November  December  This year was  days long and roughly coincided with the solar year however an extra month had to be added occasionally to correct for the solar year actually being  days long This month was called  Mensis Intercalaris  and was placed in the middle of FebruariusWere getting towards the modern calendar but we still arent there Next came along the Julian reform by our favourite roman Julius Caesar He started the reform in BC and it was finished by his successor AugustusThe Julian reform was a bit complicated at first changing lengths of years so the calendar year would correlate with a solar year and renaming Quintilis and Sextilis to Iulius and Augustus after Julius and Augustus Caesar This calendar was used until AD when it was changed again in the Gregorian reform so that Easter would stop drifting through the year and thats the calendar widely used in the western world today,55,cdpn2st,1rpojy,askhistorians,top_day,281,226

agentdcf,There were no state regulations regarding labor as far as I know However the trade would probably have been regulated by guild structures in cities or towns of any size Medieval London had Livery Companies for carpenters joiners different from carpenters because they used adhesives and not nails bricklayers and tylers and plumbers among others These guilds would have controlled things like apprenticeships and mastery as well as prices and wages I dont know anything specifically about the building trades but I have studied the baking trade a bit and I think we can extrapolate from one to the other For vital elements of the urban economy guild structures and what regulatory legislation existed served to either remove a trade from market forces entirely or at the very least highly circumscribe its operation Prices and wages were so arranged as to ensure a just price preventing collusion and manipulation of the market by merchants and tradespeople while providing acceptable wages to workers With set wages and prices what frequently happened was that craftspeople competed in quality whoever could build the best house or bake the best bread would have more custom and do better I suspect from my fairly cursory reading of medieval urban history that being a tradesmen was not a bad gig as things go If you could get into a guild you were going to do alright as long as you were reasonably competent If you were a casual laborer things were going to be roughGuild structures also regulated quality and conduct often with their own private courts empowered to fine guild members and punish them publicly For bakers this meant ensuring the proper weight and purity of products For builders I would guess that quality meant ensuring stability of construction and soundness of materials Bakers all had their own personal stamps which marked the loaves so that any loafs baker could be identified if some violation was found I would guess that similar measures existed for builders so that if a building collapsed without cause the builder would bear at least some responsibility ,0,cdq2euv,1rpqi6,askhistorians,top_day,1,1
stayhungrystayfree,This wont be as detailed as I want it to be but I have time to give the quick and dirty In the timeframe youre looking at there wasnt anything resembling a unifying practice Liturgies were local and though there are some who argue for a unifying shape of Catholic liturgy being apparent the wording of the liturgies wasnt uniform and it wouldnt be for quite some time Its likely that the Arian liturgy kept a similar shape but we dont have any extant liturgies to say for sure As far as monasticism goes the idea of ordered monks didnt really exist yet and cloisters were mostly just associations of hermits who lived in community Nothing like the Benedictines or Augustinians The Franciscans sort of follow this model But Im digressing Arian monasticism was very decentralized and existed primarily in the Arabian peninsula and in Syriac speaking eastern kingdoms where it would survive marginally until the rise of Islam It was a very hermetic kind of asceticism and didnt lend itself to putting down roots and putting up buildingsThis is from my earlymonasticism professor who focused on Syriac monasticism I cant really speak to how it worked for the Germanic tribes So they very well may have had an entirelydifferent liturgy but seeing as how liturgies were especially suppressed see how long Donatist parishes lasted after Constantine came down on them we dont have any details of what they included Also Rowan Williams book on Arius and Arianism is a great read and I highly recommend it It focuses more closely on Arius the person but he covers some of this ,0,cdpsv1b,1rpqui,askhistorians,top_day,8,8

backgrinder,Each unit in the US Army has an offcial TOampE or Table of Organization and Equipment established by the Army This determines everything assigned to the unit from men to equipment to vehicles and breaks everything down A division TOampE will call for a certain number of battalions each battalion has companies each company has platoons etc Depending on the tasks assigned to the division the battalions will be set up differently An armor heavy division will have a different grouping than an Infantry division which will have a different grouping than a support unit  The TOampE will call for an infantry company to have a specific number of privates plus a specific number of sergeants and officers and will specify specific ranks for specific jobs when someone is promoted they automatically shift to a new job with different responsibilities  The TOampE will also call for a specific mix of weapons In a WW infantry platoon the standard weapon is a semi automatic rifle Each company will be assigned a set number of light and heavy machine guns used to set up defensive positions and crews will be assigned to carry them tripods ammo and either serve them with ammo during battle or protect the gunner from enemies sneaking in close enough to take out the  weapon Large crew served weapons are generally company weapons that can be assigned to a certain platoon by need lighter  cal machine guns are platoon weapons Then there are the in between type weapons like Thompson submachine guns and BARs and specialty weapons like bazookas  Tommy guns and BARs Browning Automatic Rifle are squad type weapons A company is divided into platoons run by Lieutenants and platoons are broken into squads led by noncoms During combat the squads were often separated each performing a different task particularly in the US Army where the standard infantry doctrine developed by George Marshall before the war called for a unit to be divided with one group firing directly on a target from cover while the other group attempts to flank it A simple easy to learn and effective maneuver but the forces are divided so platoon weapons are only available to one group at a time  A group separated from the rest of the platoon will need enough punch to hit the enemy and may need to defend themselves from counterattack Thats where squad weapons like the BAR and Tommy gun come in A Tommy gun is a close in weapon It is actually a machine pistol not an automatic rifle It shoots a snub nosed  bullet that wont stay straight in midair and it tends to buck a lot and be hard to keep pointed on target Its great for spraying a lot of bullets in a general direction quickly while making a huge calamitous racket though It also has a lot of stopping power Because of this its great for clearing buildings and fortifications Its also good for defending against sudden attack Bullets go everywhere bad guys all duck and your squad gets a couple of precious seconds to assess the new situation and deal with it  The BAR is an offensive and defensive weapon Its a big heavy bitch to tote around but it can be handled by one man and fired while standing and moving It shoots a  rifle cartridge like the crew served Browning Machine Gun so its more accurate than a Tommy gun and you can attach a small bipod stand to it and fire it from a prone position  Now outside of the basics with crew served weapons being company weapons and hand held machine guns being owned by the platoon and assigned to individual squads is the question of who was selected to use each weapon and why Generally during training the biggest strongest toughest most aggressive guys were assigned the squad weapons The most obvious reason is these weapons and their extra ammo are pretty heavy and big men make better mules Also the more aggressive guys would be more likely to actually use them A lot of people arent aware but not everyone pulls the trigger in combat Some are scared and break some just freeze some cant bear to kill and avoid firing at another human being After a unit had been blooded the officers and noncoms figured out who the shooters were and reassigned weapons based on need After a unit had been in combat longer you had vets absorbing in new replacements and vets would get first choice of weapons as well Sometimes after a few engagements that big heavy bitch that was such a beast to lug around and made so much noise and attracted so much attention was a lot more attractive Combat soldiers have a fine appreciation of the value of getting lots of ordinance on target fast and soon realize that big noisy attention getter usually causes the bad guys to duck and cover once it has their attention instead of shooting back at you a nice fringe benefitUS Army Infantry Divisions  by John Sayen breaks down the TOampE of line infantry divisions during WW and WW Infantry Tactics Company and Battalion by Stephen Bull and WW Infantry Assault Tactics by Gordon L Rottman

GeorgyKZhukov,France had a large army at the time and on paper it was possibly the best in Europe They had the numbers and the equipment The problem was that they didnt see the direction warfare was going The generals were still stuck in a mentality gained in World War I Not however the idea of static warfare which people seem to think due to the Maginot Line but rather the tactics of the end phase of the war during the Hundred Days offensiveAs such the French invested in lots of infantry tanks Big slow heavy tanks that were to be distributed throughout the infantry to move with them and supply support While they did have some quality tanks like the SOMUA  they just didnt have enough of them And even if they had more without a serious reevaluation of their deployment the effectiveness would be questionable at best Most French tanks even lacked radiosThey invested in a LOT of artillery Because they believed that it was the key to victory But they didnt foresee the pace that World War II would be fought at Their guns simply couldnt be wielded effectively as the battlefield changed and also since they lacked mobile artillery they couldnt move the guns quickly enough Many of them were of World War I vintageStrategically the French were also lacking While it is not true that the French believed the Maginot Line was going to keep them safe and in fact the purpose of it was to force the Germans to attack to the north of the line the French did make a grave miscalculation in where they expected the German thrust to come Expecting a similar path as that taken during World War I the AngloFrench force was positioned in the northeast of France waiting for the Germans to enter the Low Countries When they did they moved in to Belgium swiftly to counter the Germans But the main German attack was further south through the Ardennes which the French planners had assumed was to rugged for the Germans to move through quickly and consequently had not defended very well This wasnt the case though The Germans swept through and in just over a week the AngloFrench force that had been positioned on the border  the cream of the crop  was cut off from the rest of France The British began evacuating and France soon had no choice but to capitulateAnd thats it in a nutshell France had quantity but not quality They were well prepared for another war fought in the style of October  But what works there didnt work all that well in ,0,cdpp6q0,1rpulu,askhistorians,top_day,11,11

idjet,I think you are perhaps getting hung up on labels and definitions and we should clarify these so that you can understandCapitalism is very strictly defined as an economic system in terms of how economic value is created and stored profit is a byproduct of that Capitalism is generally viewed as having its origins in the late medieval period when we begin to see the creation of broad markets for labour and goods through the transformation of serfdom and bartering economy to monetary economyIts true that there has always been something for sale whether armour houses and castles However if we look closely at what was for sale in the European medieval period we would see the list of things bought and sold is short and very infrequently transacted The greater portion of the economy was what we would roughly call bartering  this was at the rural and village level In fact even taxes were paid in kind often as part of the harvest Remember that medieval society was predominantly agricultural Yes someone with money could by anything  but money was relatively rare For example there were whole regions of Southern France in year  where there were no mints creating coin  ie money note bartering is used loosely here to allow a short response  some will complainAs such from a modern financial perspective the financial transactions were stunted they have no accumulating value To explain as a farmer or as the noble who enserfed the farmer I could not store my wheat for several years waiting for an increase in the value of the commodity and trade it for charcoal or building limestone a year later  I had to trade it within its life or it goes mouldy I could not speculate in value and make a profit on the difference between my production costs and my sale value when wheat supplies were low Or as an blacksmith I would be working directly in the castle of the lord for whom I work but I am not paid in cash I am fed clothed I have a small home or just a room in the compound As a blacksmith I might also do some metal work for the local farmers because they are tending the lands owned by the noble I work for But I am not paid and neither are they There were large towns where money might be used but the overwhelmingly rural medieval population did not engage economically with cities in substantive cashSo how did this economy change to capitalismThe general idea held in economics is that the transition from feudal economics to capitalism was through the transformation of manorial serfdom to free holding tenanthttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofcapitalismPrehistoryofcapitalism This is a point of argument for some and you may see responses to this post which argue differently But the point is still important this was the moment where the medieval serffarmer no longer paid in kind with his crops but he rented his land from landlord for cash and he could sell his crops at market for cash The landlord could evict him from the land for a higher paying tenant and the farmer could sell his crops for more to those who were willing to pay The farmer could invest in his farm so that it was more productive The landlord could take the cash and invest it where he likes perhaps in speculating in other lands or in other assets Its labour and assets that begin to have value not the crops themselvesAnd this is where we begin to see the fundamentals of capitalism in large scale lending in speculation in transforming serfdom and bartering into labourforwage relationships These things did not exist at large scale until after the medieval period None of this happened fast  there were many places in Europe that remained unaffected by early capitalism for several hundred years And there were transformations in forms of capitalism such as mercantilismhttpenwikipediaorgwikiMerchantcapitalism before we get to modern capitalism as we know itThe essence is that economic relationships transformed into an exchange of capital and capital is abstractly related to actual value And this completely overtook all other economic relationships from   Source Das Kapital Karl Marx ,0,cdpumwf,1rpw94,askhistorians,top_day,9,9
CanadianAmbassador,I just wrote an undergrad paper about the history of interestusury and can maybe help shed some light on this In Ancient Greece Aristotle was against any form of interest Interest is the cost of borrowing money His reasoning was that because money had no value in itself and was a medium of exchange between two commodities it should not be hoarded Money by itself was not considered wealth It was the physical goods bought that dictated how wealthy a person was This viewpoint has been debated though as being idealistic and not how life actually operated in ancient Greece Aquinas follows in similar tradition with Aristotle except adds the Christian charity idea to the mix Due to the nature of money hoarding it is bad and unnatural You cannot have a capitalist society without leftover money to fund and invest This was backed up by the Catholic Church Again this viewpoint was challenged by specific people but the Catholic Church stood by its stance Big changes didnt start to occur until the Reformation Both Luther after some prodding and Calvin after no prodding both accepted that interest was an acceptable risk that the lender takes over the borrower Prior to the Reformation interest was an unnatural way to create wealth by the scholastics and the Catholic Church Now that is for loan payments Venture Capitalism was not frowned upon and was one of the ways that people who were looking for investment circumvented the sin of usury The Romans did have some forms but usury has always been condemned under the Old testament I did actually ask a question related to this but it has also yet to be answered I am not a historian by any means but I am taking a class on the History of Classical Economics Basically the economics of the world until Marx The reason I dont address Rome and Roman influences is because from what I found the majority of their contributions were in law not economics and therefore out of the scope of my paper To answer the question though if I was being bold and banking ha on the history of venture capital probably the th century is when you could find the beginnings of modern capitalism That is mostly me talking out of my ass From what I read in regarding interest I would put the timeframe at or during the Reformation The backlash that the ban on usury caused the Church to lighten its stance in the th century but the Protestants had been okay with it officially for  years prior The important thing to remember is that capitalism requires surplus money to invest If you put restrictions in place stopping the borrowing process it makes it significantly tougher to engage in capitalist procedure Hope that makes sense I am a couple beers in because I am finally done essays and slightly celebrating Sources will be provided upon request ,2,cdpqycx,1rpw94,askhistorians,top_day,4,2
Reedstilt,At the time of Old World Contact there were three major polities in Florida and several smaller ones CalusaThe southern half of Florida was under the control of the powerful and expansive Calusa The core Calusa region was center on Charlotte Harbor in southwest Florida with their eponymous capital Calos currently identified as the Mound Key sitehttpenwikipediaorgwikiMoundKeyArcheologicalStatePark but their influence spread eastward to encompass the Mayaimi who lived around Lake Okeechobee the Tequesta of the Keys and modernday Miami and the Jaega near modernday Palm Beach The Ais who lived on the east coast from Cape Canaveral southward to the Jaega who may have been part of the Ais as well were either subjects or allies of the Calusa  the relationship is a bit unclear Additionally Taino refugees from Cuba and likely from elsewhere in the Caribbean since earlier refugees had fled to Cuba first had established communities in southern Florida under the protection of the Calusa dominion before the Spanish arrived on the mainland Until the Spanish negotiated a peace in  the Calusa were at war with Tocobaga who lived around Tampa BayThe Calusa were led by three men First was the paramount chief called the cacique by the Spanish after the Taino title for a similar political position The Calusa word for this rank is probably certepe but thats uncertain as it could refer to village chiefs as well The paramount chief received tribute from Calusa village chiefs and from the leaders of his nonCalusa subjects He also had several wives one each from his nonCalusa subjects for example as well as having a sisterwife according to Spanish chroniclers which probably meant he had one wife from his own clan rather than literally marrying his own sisterThe other two men were the war captain who command the Calusas military specialists and militia on behalf of the paramount chief and the chief priest who oversaw the temples organized important rituals and attended to the religious needs of the paramount chiefs family which he was usually part of The Calusa built canals earthworks to keep their homes above the water during floods and large communal houses and temples The kings house in Calos was said to be large enough that  people could comfortably gather there for councils What makes the size and structure of Calusa society especially interesting is that they made no use of domesticated plants or animals though there ancestors a few centuries earlier probably engaged in some farming The bulk of their diet was composed of seafood though some wild plants were gathered and they made a type of bread from coontiehttpenwikipediaorgwikiCoontie a cycad native to the Southeast Deer were relatively rare in the region and Calusa traded their seafood with people to the north for venison and deer hides In  the Spanish reported that the Calusa or their Tequesta subjects  travelling to Havana to sell fish ambergris fruits turtle shells cardinalshttpenwikipediaorgwikiCardinalbird and other items Such trade likely existed in PreColumbian times between south Florida and Caribbean as wellTimucuaMost of northern Florida minus the panhandle and a large portion of southern Georgia was the realm of the Timucua Unlike the Calusa the Timucua were not unified into a single cohesive nation Instead they had several powerful village and alliances of villages which at the time of Contact were vying among themselves for dominance Each village had its own chief called holata or utina in various Timucua areas For simplicity Ill use holata here The title of holata was inherited matrilineally within the White Deer Clan Clans were ranked and while the White Deer was at the top among the Timucua the relative ranking of the other clans Panther Bear Fish Earth Buzzard and Quail differed between the Timucuan districts The holata had several prominent subordinates The inija was the most important of these who severed as the holatas spokespeson and communicated the holatas orders to others and gather information for the holata The inija was also chosen from the White Deer Clan The holata was also served by two ranked anacotimas and the afetema who seem to have been advisers chosen from the elders of the village Women became holata regularly and when they did so their subordinates were also women The holata oversaw both the secular and religious affairs of the Timucua war however fell to the irriparacusi the war chief also known as the uriutina and possibly just paracusi The irriparacusi had his own entourage of officials ibitano toponole bichara amalachini and itorimitono though their duties are unfortunately unknown The irriparacusi likely inherited their rank as the holata did but thats not certainLike the Calusa the Timucua fished and harvested wild plants But they also hunted and cultivated maize and other domesticated plantsthough not to the extent of their Mississippian neighbors to the north and west Famously the Timucua wore deer disguiseshttpmediawebbritannicacomebmediaFAjpg when hunting Unlike the Calusa however they were quick to adopt Spanish agricultural tools and plantsThe surplus of their hunts were trade south to the Calusa but the most important trade routes went north and west to the Mississippians These trade routes brought down copper greenstone and argillite from the mountains The Timucua also controlled an important chert outcropping in northern Florida which was vital for the production of tools and weapons Chief Utina and his alliance largely controlled this outcropping and the most important trade routes which made him an enemy of other major Timucuan alliances In the s the Timucua would become important middlemen controlling the trade between St Augustine and the nations of the interiorApalacheeThe Apalachee were a small but powerful Mississippian chiefdom located between the Ochlockonee and Aucilla Rivers The Timucuanspeaking Asile who lived east of the Aucilla River were subjects of the Apalachee The Apalachee had two major towns Ivitachuco was the dominant town in the east while Anhayca modernday Tallahassee dominated the west and served as the capital of the whole chiefdom Historically the two towns were ruled by brothers Later in the s political power would shift to Ivitachuco at which time the Apalachee were at war with the Timucua again the Spanish negotiate a peace treaty between the twoNico seems to be their word for paramount chief  Interestingly holata refers to subsidiary chiefs  The Apalachee holatas oversaw major towns which controlled districts and satellite towns within the larger chiefdom The nico and the holatas were the spokespeople for their respective dominions and oversaw ceremonies within them The Apalachee nico was also served by an inija though his role here was to oversee the nicos guards farmland and to serve as a sort of court historian as well as handling trivial daytoday business of the chiefdom The holatas seem to have had inija of their own and the inija were apparently relatives of the holatas Finally the nico had an atequi a translator whose duties extended over other areas where such language skills were importantThe land of Apalachee was an important stop on the trade routes heading west out of the Timucua regions to the Mississippians and was famous throughout Florida for its agricultural productivity That fame was used as bait by other Florida peoples to lure the de Sotos expedition out of their area and encourage them to keep moving onto Anhayca where de Sotos expedition spent its first winter living maize beans squash and other plants cultivated or harvested in the region as well its ample stores of dried venison They grew three types of maize for different purposes a small fastgrowing maize used to quickly replenish their granaries in spring a yellow maize used for hominy and a white maize used for flour They also made flour from a root known as ache which the Spanish said was indistinguishable from flour made from wheat in both versatility and taste Both ache root and the flour made from it were important exports from

sambeau,The origins of Professional Sumo wrestling started in the early s around the time that the Shogun Ieyasu brought peace amongst the warring families of Japan by using a hostage system the wives and children of the provincial War Lords were required to live in the capital Soon the lords themselves build giant mansions there too The peace brought a need for entertainment and a surplus of Samurai The previous ruler Hideyoshi had in  frozen social class so it was forbidden for a warrior to return to peasanthood and as such the place was overrun with bored warriors Thus the samurai started wrestling for entertainmentOriginally the wrestling was fairly Ad Hoc streetcorner shows of Martial Arts skills tsujizumo without a proper ring and the woodcuts from these times show fairly lean Wrestlers Once the ring was added and the forceout rule established the woodcuts show a noticeable bulkingup of wrestlers By the late s the wrestlers in the woodcuts look pretty much like a classical Sumo wrestler does  is when official permits were established for Sumo,5,cdpw3hy,1rpxi4,askhistorians,top_day,70,65
