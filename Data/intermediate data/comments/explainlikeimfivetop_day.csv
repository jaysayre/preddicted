tribecous,Also a bit of an offshoot In a fluid system where two pathways exist one with a wide opening and one with a narrow opening the same amount of fluid goes both ways initially but the limited output of the small opening will eventually result in an overflow Is this the case with electricity That is does the same volume of electrons travel along each possible pathway until one becomes fully saturated causing an overflow of electrons that will travel down the less resistive paths,0,cdp7ila,1roa3z,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2

fivemagics,The water analogy is probably the easier way to explain it Also remember electrons actually go from the negative to the positive and not the other way around What we actually call current is the movement of the holes generated on the valence shell of the atom due to an electron leaving that atom for another one Without the holes electrons wouldnt go to other atoms You could have a path with  holes and a path with one  electrons will move to the first atom  will move to the otherIm pretty sure that would have to do with it Difference in conductors atoms copper silver etc explains the resistive difference,0,cdpbuh9,1roa3z,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2

MayContainNugat,Common Law is the law developed over generations by judges over a long period of time Its the law built up from long traditions and precedents that exists prior to legislative bodies passing specific statutes The English common law developed in the Middle Ages and forms the basis of law in England and its former colonies including the US Except for Louisiana whose common law derives from FranceFor instance under English common law a couple is married when they live together for a certain period of time and hold themselves out to the community as man and wife Legislatures in most jurisdictions however have overridden common law by passing statutes requiring a marriage license issued by the state to be considered married  ,0,cdpa7r1,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4,4
carlfish,As far back as the middle ages legal disputes between individuals in Britain were decided by taking them to courts adjudicated by judges appointed by the crown Judges appointed by the King or Queen would literally travel from town to town hearing cases and passing down judgements In the absence of a comprehensive statutory code judges would base their decisions on their understanding of how the law should work and how judges before them had decided similar casesOn their return to London courts would record their judgements and the reasoning behind them and share them with their fellow judges That way when a judge encountered a similar case on their circuit they would be able to decide it consistently with the last judge who had decided that case Alternatively a senior judge might overrule their junior and create a new precedentThe Common Law is the result of these thousand years of legal decisions Judges in Common Law jurisdictions are expected to decide cases consistently with their predecessors and in turn pass on how they interpret the law in newly arising circumstances to their successorsHow legitimate the Common Law is depends on your jurisdiction The degree to which the Common Law is adopted in your local legal system is determined by your local laws Especially different countries tend to clearly mark where their local system of precedent diverges from the British system they inherited it from  decisions before that date being binding legal precedent and decisions after that date only being suggestions on how the law might be interpreted The only consistent rule is that statutory law always overrules Common Law so once a government passes a law then all other precedent is overruled,0,cdpge46,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2

HashTagWaterFelon,Short answer is that it depends and serious deformities may or may not ever actually ariseThe thing is that if the initial two had perfect genomes with no mutations corresponding to serious defects there is no reason that their breeding or that of their descendants would necessarily give rise to a population with those defects If they arent there to begin with they wouldnt be created by inbreeding The founder effect is the formal name for how low diversity groups starting a population can lead to high incidences of genetic defects But that is only because the genes for those traits were brought by a founding member of the population Inbreeding NEVER creates a genetic mutation It only increases the chance that one already present will be expressedAnd anyways if the two people happened to carry in some serious problem traits as in serious to the point that they would kill off the affected person then natural selection would act to start pushing the genes prevalence downwards anyway Simulations with programs mathematically assigning fitness levels to mice show how when a given gene gives a higher probability of successfully breeding that the inferior gene is purged to a minimal level very quickly described in Reece and Campbell Biology th editionSo in short assuming that these two individuals were healthy to start with that pretty much guarantees that there are enough healthy genes in play to rebuild the population Situations like the Kentucky families that took on a blue skin tone was because that trait didnt really reduce fitness levels by much if it did the blue ones would die and that gene would fade out You would have a low level of genetic diversity yes which would leave humanity vulnerable to being ravaged by a disease or other pressure of that kind So you could very easily get some strange traits popping up but if they were serious deformities to the point that they mess with a persons ability to propagate themselves then no that trait wouldnt show up and stay around,6,cdpg3e8,1rootd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,25,19

BassoonHero,There is a lot of mythology about this so Ill try to post a complete answer This brushes on some old holy wars so please read the whole thing before leaving angry commentsThe first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive or from another system on your network If you install it yourself then its not a virus even if you were tricked into installing it A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse or just a trojan for shortThere is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS for Windows and even for Linux However there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and none that affect the modern Mac OS For Windows this has not long been the case A decade ago Windows viruses abounded and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs At the same time there were still no Mac OS X viruses in the wildCommon internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time so no one tried to write a virus for it While intuitively appealing this explanation is faulty for several reasonsFirst it strains ones credulity to suppose that this could explain a total lack of viruses for Mac OS X Surely someone somewhere would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller it was also ripe for subversion Mac users of the time were justifiably if irritatingly smug about not needing to run antivirus programs If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus then it should have been easier to infect Macs because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions Moreover surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bringSecond the prevalence of other types of malware such as trojan horse software has increased as the Macs market share waxes Its commonplace to hear that yet another Macbased trojan has been spotted in the wild yet still not a single virus If the Macs market share is sufficient to attract trojans then why not virusesThird the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years True Windowss market share has declined somewhat but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share and crucially the prevalence of viruses for other platforms such as Mac OS X has not increased to make up for itSo if we can eliminate market share as the cause then what Well the answer is simple if sadly contentious During the dark ages of Windows viruses the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS The malware explosion that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes retire old APIs and generally modernize their OSIn a way its only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this The classic Mac OS versions  predated Windows and by the late s it was showing its age It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single trusted user Where this assumption was violated there were security holes And there were definitely viruses although in those days you were more likely to catch one from a friends floppy disk than from the internet There were also myriad technical limitations that are welldocumented elsewhere So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale This was a long and painful process and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting but in the end they had OS X a modern multiuser UNIXbased OS And no virusesWindowss evolution took a more gradual path Windows NT New technologies was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast lest compatibility problems alienate their users Apple on the other hand maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apples engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old daysSo during the dark ages Mac users had a brand new modern OS whereas Windows users had an aging singleuser OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug Today Windows is a different animal  Microsofts strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus But people remember a time not too long ago when this was not the case and the impressions left by that era linger on in the popular consciousness,1,cdpfkns,1roy3o,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3,2

TheDoctorApollo,While it is true that there is more awareness for Celiacs Disease and that will lead to increased diagnosis I am not aware of any evidence that suggests it is more common now compared to   year agoMost people who are selfdiagnosed Celiacs have absolutely nothing wrong with them but instead just want to jump on board the band wagon Perhaps they have an intolerance to gluten but an intolerance is very different than an allergy which is what defines Celiacs Disease For someone to truly be allergic to gluten they must have an adaptive immune response to it As I said most people are either doing it because they want the health benefits of a glutenfree diet or because its the cool thing to do I had a friend that decided she was allergic to gluten this summer I couldnt help but call her out on it when she decided that pizza and beer didnt count in her new lifestyleIf your sister was actually diagnosed with Celiacs by an allergist MD who specializes in allergies than it is possible that you have it as well There is some evidence to suggest that there is a genetic link in Celiacs disease It is worth getting check out by a health professional prolonged exposure to gluten can cause tissue remodeling in someone with Celiacs which may lead to cancer or chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel syndromeSource Immunology major,3,cdpfd9i,1roydh,explainlikeimfive,top_day,13,10

liquefaction,Awareness does help but there are many other factors I believe theres been a steep increase over the last  years that is only now becoming public knowledge Children have more sensitive immune systems than adults and those who have spent their whole lives only eating lots of unfermented gluten from a few strains have a more severe immune system reaction than adults who ate less gluten grew up on fermented gluten and ate more diverse gluten For starters we are overexposed to gluten  we eat more processed foods than we did in the past Gluten is also added to more foods than ever because its cheap Its cheap because it stores well and its subsidized While in the past we ate many different strains of wheat currently we eat only a few strains Modern wheat is bred to be extremely high in gluten because gluten is great for texture The way we process wheat has also changed Commercial yeast wasnt developed until the s Before that wheat had to be fermented to help it rise A starter was created for this purpose Starters are usually made from flour and water The flour and water would be naturally colonized by local bacteria which would be fed with more flour and water on a regular basis or less often for sourdough and these bacteria are what caused dough to rise That starter was used to make each loaf of bread The bacteria served another helpful function as well  to break down the harmful substances in grains by digesting them and leaving behind harmless substances humans can digest easily Theres a good reason grain is a common allergy Like animals plants can have defenses Not all though  some plants like fruits want to be eaten Their seeds are spread through feces so it makes sense for them to be delicious and not cause issues in things that eat them Unsprouted grains however die when eaten so they developed a hull as a defense That hull contains phytic acid which blocks absorption of calcium iron and other nutrients we need Its called an antinutrient for that reason Another mildly toxic substance in seeds is lectin In small amounts these substances wont cause permanent issues just some mild stomach upset in those not accustomed However when eaten multiple times a day our bodies sometimes start to react Another thing makes lectins and antinutrients in grains more harmful today than in the past Grains were left in the fields to sprout long ago Just like fruit now is picked before its ripe followers of modern agricultural methods dont allow the grain to sprout as sprouted grain goes bad more quickly Sprouted grain also contained fewer of these antinutrients as it doesnt need the defenses that a seed does Even in people who arent intolerantallergic gluten causes inflammation due to this toxic substance as well as lectins This inflammation causes the intestines to swell The swelling causes tiny holes to be opened When this happens tiny particles of food leak outside of the intestines where theyre supposed to be into the body At this point our body sees the particles as foreign invaders and begins to attack them This is called Leaky Gut Syndrome and is in debate within the medical community but many people myself included have seen relief by avoiding substances that cause inflammation Had I waited around for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me Id still be too sick to leave the house If you think about how your immune system is designed to react to a tiny germ its easy to understand how a tiny particle of gluten could cause a reaction as well Our bodies are reacting to what they see as a constant poisoning by doing what they are supposed to do  trying to make us stop eating something thats bad for us ,7,cdph6p4,1roydh,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,-6

defguysezhuh,When calling  in the United States DeafHardofHearing DHH people have several options links to additional information are included as I go along Video Relay Service VRS amp Video Phones VP  They can use VPs to call  immediately via VRS  Basically the DeafHardofHearing person will dial  over the video phone a certified sign language interpreter will respond first and then dial  is dialed immediately via telephone line in a way conference call deaf person to interpreter to dispatch  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located at home or at a business registered on that account so that when dialing  the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the  dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a timesaver when dealing with emergencies but is also provides clear and direct communication when a DeafHardofHearing person like anyone in an emergency situation may be panicking and would likely stutter with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address  For more information on how VPs amp VRS work you can check out Purple Communicationshttppurpleus or Sorenson Communicationhttpwwwsorensoncom which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA I believe TTYTDD amp Text Relay Services  Just to avoid confusion TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context but have two different names for the same device  Some people know it better by one name over the other so I included both though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out  Moving on its been pointed out that TTYsTDDshttpenwikipediaorgwikiTelecommunicationsdevicesforthedeaf are an outdated technology  For the most part this is true  A DHH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other DHH friendsfamily members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place  However not all DHH people know sign language  As such these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the DHH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that DHH person  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the DHH person as if they were speaking to that person directly  So its the same idea as calling  on a VRS call but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign Captioned Telephones If you still use a landline telephone you can use a CapTelhttpcaptelcom phone which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss usually a HardofHearing person and not a Deaf person  Basically youll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed  Using speech recognition software everything being spoken by the person youre calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone similar to subtitles on a TV with the silent operators ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software  Recently Sprint created a CapTel mobile apphttpwwwsprintcaptelcomwirelesscaptelsprint so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline  Same principle as using the TextVideo Relay Services but you wont have an operator talking for you  Youll be talking for yourself so less delay in  calls Text Messages  This is still in the works  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to  because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if youre a victim of attack and trying to hide eg school shootings muggings home robberies rape etc so this is extremely beneficial not only to DHH but also to hearing people as well  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how Texttohttpwwwfccgovtextto is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up amp running  However as uMastersInDisasters points out SMS as it is defined now is NOT a reliable protocol If possible use voice I hope this information helpsTLDR  We have several options Videophones TTYTDDs Captioned Telephones and Text Messages limited locations only for texts but slowly expandingSource Im a Deaf Social Worker who currently works in the DHH community and Ive been DHH all my life born HardofHearing then it gradually declined as I got older now I consider myself Deaf,14,cdpllpg,1royox,explainlikeimfive,top_day,76,62

cardcha,Okay so I know a fair bit about hardware but most of this is just compiled from a Google search Some of this could be outdated or slightly wrong but I think it is fundamentally correct The Xbox and the PS have virtually the same CPUan  core AMD Jaguar except the the Xbox is clocked slightly higher GHZ vs  GHZ for the PS However the games on the Xbox will only have access to six cores  of the GPU and gb of memoryout of  I suspect that the PS has  some limitations like these as well but I cant find any info on that The PS doesnt have stuff like the Kinect though so the limitations may be lessGames are rarely CPU bound though The GPU tends to have a hugely greater impact on performance for According to RPS  Jaguar cores have less then a quarter of the performance of a iK This means that my fairly lowly i destroys the CPU of a PS or Xbox WTF I dont even have a gaming computerAs for the GPU the PS has  more teraflops then the xbox The PS also has some other advantages like more ROPs and stream processors However the Xbox is clocked a little higher I think it is pretty safe to say based on this alone that the PS has a fair bit more horsepower then the xbox Check this out if you want to here more about those stream processors and ROPs httpwwwigncomblogsfinalverdictxboxonevsplaystationhardwareandspecificationsCOD Ghosts also runs at p on the Xbox as compared to p on the PSThe PSs standard memory is wayyyyyyyyyyyy better then the Xboxs The catch is that the Xbox also has  MB of ESRAM This is the part Im not sure about Sorry Id have to assume it makes them pretty much equal except the ESRAM might be harder to utilizeThe Xbox supposedly has a better audio processor taking a load off the CPU Little bit of difference Overall I think the PS wins ,0,cdpfmnx,1roziq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2
OldFatMonica,For the most part yes dogs do like to be rubbed and pet However it is a common misconception that every dog wants this kind of affectionJust like people some dogs prefer lots of affection and others are more independent or prefer to express themselves in a different manner So how can you tell if a dog is interested You look for body language cues See the following video for a really good idea on canine consent httpyoutubecGDYIscQAs a shelter manager I strive for a nobite environment Educating my staff and the volunteer population on body language is the number one way to prevent bites and to begin to understand whats going on in your pups headGiven that you and a dog have a good rapport already established dogs like pets and rubs for the same reason you do It feels good its a reinforcer its soothing and relaxing Aside from that its a direct form of communication which can tell you a lot about your relationship For example  Your dog comes to you and you scratch behind his ear for  seconds    Your dog is telling you that he trusts you and appreciates your company When you stop your dog stares at your face and gently places his snout under your hand  Hes telling you that youre doing a great job you should probably never stop This seems silly but its very significant because this is actual communication which suggests the dogs understanding of human behavior and social cues Dogs are the most socially akin to humans I wish more folks realized that Either way hope this helps I could probably go on forever,0,cdpfqax,1rozkn,explainlikeimfive,top_day,5,5

SuperStallion,The sails act as an airplane wing does creating a low pressure area on the back side of the sail the relative high pressure area then applies pressure on the sale and tries to push the boat kind of sideways and forward Underneath the water the keel acts as an airplane wing and does not allow the boat to move sideways to the water so it has to move forward The boatis then directed by the rudder  Most boats can travel about  degrees to the actual wind direction high performance boats about  degrees  none can travel straight into itSource avid competitive sailor for around  years in the Great Lakes ,0,cdpkwk3,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3,3

plasticluthier,Ill explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about Three sets of forces are happening while youre sailing a boat   You have the wind pushing on the sail  You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind  The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shapeNow when youre sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry If you squeeze directly from the sides the cherry stone wont go anywhere but if you squeeze from the back the stone will come out of the front Its the same with sailing the wind pushes on the sails the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards Now you cant sail straight into the wind the forces wouldnt balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too So to balance all the forces you zigzag into the wind turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn This is called tacking Now sails are tight in when youre going into the wind completely out when youre going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points generally the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails If you need to know any more Id suggest going sailing I have no idea what AC is ,3,cdpj6al,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4,1

koprita,All of the answers so far are ignoring one thing The keel or daggerboard on smaller boats is a board that sticks down into the water underneath the boat right around the middle of the craft that helps prevent the boat from drifting sidewaysThe keel is shaped in such a way that when the wind is blowing you sideways and the keel is resisting this the effect is like squeezing a watermelon seed between your fingers,1,cdplgbq,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,1

Dirtybirdy,The sail essentially acts like a wing and generates lift based on air traveling  in turbulent flow on one side and laminar flow on the other Just like on a plane wing if air moves faster over one side the pressure will be different on either side and the boat is essentially sucked forward many boats can actually sail faster and more smoothly up wind than downwind This is why boats can sail into the wind even with only one sail The truth of the matter though is that modern computational methods arent advanced enough to theoretically model and calculate turbulent flow too many millions of molecules acting independently in seemingly random directions and the majority of sailing design like Sail shape and curvature is almost entirely empirical Ie Based on peoples personal experience and then fine tuning to obtain slightly better results ,0,cdpnr00,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,1

computervirologist,Computer viruses fall under the category of malware or malicious software Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs A computer virus is usually an executable file that when executed will usually perform the following tasks  search for other files on the computer if the file is a program copy the viruss code to that program execute a payload which may or may not be destructiveOnce a program gets a viruss code injected into it it becomes an infected program An infected program when executed will run the virus code first before running the original code of the programSince viruses only infect files when theyre executed they rely on user interaction in order to spread Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now Keep in mind though that unless the virus has elevated privileges it can only infect programs that the current user has writeaccess to An antivirus virus is a program that spreads like a virus but when its code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it Think of it like a chain virus antivirus virus original program First the virus code will run then the antivirus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it then the original program will run Antivirus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used Besides viruses there are also computer trojans spyware ransomware backdoors worms and fork bombsTrojans are rogue programs they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else For example many trojan programs ironically claim to be antivirus software but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malwareSpyware is any program that collects users personal data without their knowledge and consent Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user In fact many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom Cryptolocker for example will encrypt the users files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files The password for decryption is stored on the hackers computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down A worm is an autonomous computer virus Unlike computer viruses worms do not require human interaction in order to spread Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading When a worm is running on a computer it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as its host It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers Once it finds a host with vulnerable software the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship Multiple viruses may infect a worm allowing the viruses to be transported across networks Once the worm reaches a destination the viruses copy themselves to that machine too You can think of the viruses as piggyback riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated wormFinally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive requiring a hard reboot If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads the computer will crash every time it is turned on The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system ,1,cdpiayi,1rp7ms,explainlikeimfive,top_day,6,5

diMario,Quantum mechanics or more broadly quantum physics studies matter on the level of elementary particles It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of thingsFor instance electric things In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating  Watt  Watt  Watt and so on If Philips were so inclined they could easily make a light bulb rating  watt or  Watt In every day life things happen on a sliding scale A certain property can have a value of  or a value of  or any other value in between  and Not so in quantum physics When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale the properties that you measure take on distinct values For electric current for instance you can measure a flow of  unit of charge per second or you can measure a flow of  units of charge per second but you cannot measure a unit of  charge per secondThis is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either  or  but not one and a halfIn order to describe this phenomenon physicists say that electric charge is quantized from which comes the quantum part of the nameNow as it turns out not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviourOne of the theoretical consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment Ill find that roughly  times the outcome is  and  times the outcome is  But when I perform a single measurement I cannot predict whether the outcome is  or  Weird isnt itQuantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement the property I am about to measure is  and  both at the same time Only after I have measured it the quantum system has decided whether it was  or This means that only after I observe a system the system decides what value it will show me Thus it is said that reality the value of the property is influenced by observation the fact that I measure it,1,cdpij2p,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,top_day,11,10
QuigleyQ,I suppose it would be best to start with a brief historyWhat is light Some people such as Newton believed that light was made of tiny particles corpuscles that were fired off by the light source This explains why light goes in a straight line and how it is reflected off surfaces at the same angle But this does not explain how light is refracted through a prism for example Why would some particles bend more than others This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass Still there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe such as diffractionEventually physicists came to support a different theory of light Instead of discrete particles light was a wave Not like a water wave though this wave only moved tranversely like sohttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonscElectromagneticwaveDgif This explained light much better than the particle theory The most striking example is in diffraction Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it a sensor screen some ways behind it and you shine a light onto this contraptionhttpwwwempiricalzealcomwpcontentuploadsdoubleslitboxjpg If light were a particle you should see two bars on the sensor like thishttpstephenwhittfileswordpresscomdoubleslitbulletsjpgw because the particles go through and continue going straight However if light were a wave the sensor would have a more complicated patternhttpgradphysicssunysbeduamarchintgif because the waves interfere with each otherhttpwwwatomunifrankfurtderesearchsynchrotronphotonmoleculeHdoubledoubleslitdoubleslitplanewavegif It turns out when you do this experiment that you get the interference pattern Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light this theory is pretty convincing So its settled light is a wave rightThe challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction When you heat up an object it emits light And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency While these worked well for low frequencies they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones Clearly this is wrong Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities Other properties such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps So are we back to the particle theory again If we are how do we explain the doubleslit experimentLets go back to it again If it is really a particle then why does the interference pattern form Say we place detectors at the slits If light is a wave then itll trigger both If its a particle itll just trigger one When we do this we see that only one is triggered So light is a particle But when you check the screen the interference pattern has disappeared and two stripes show up instead So we take away the detectors and try again Now it reappears If words dont cut it for you watch thishttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonseeWaveparticledualityogvWhen we watch the slits light behaves like particles When we dont it behaves like waves How can we reconcile these two behaviors The answer is light behaves like some very unintuitive thingQuantum physics is the study of how on earth this works This waveparticle duality only seems to show up for small objects think on the scale of atoms Some of the consequences of this include Objects exist in a superpositionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumsuperposition of all possible states weighted towards the more likely ones Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state The more preciselyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenberguncertaintyprinciple you measure the position of an object the less you know about its momentum Occasionally objects can tunnelhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumtunneling across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross You can entanglehttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumentanglement two particles so that measuring one disturbs the other regardless of how far apart they are,0,cdpuf79,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2

Samatdal,The answer to this is actually quite simple The two divisions of your autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic You can think of autonomic as meaning happens automatically such as breathing and other autonomic processesThe sympathetic nervous system when activated provides fight or flight stimuli such as increased heart rate constricting pupils etcThe parasympathetic nervous system activates rest and digest stimuli such as decreased heart rate and increased digestion Nicotine acts on nicotinic receptors present on neurons all over your body The receptor carries out a parasympathetic tone So the nicotine is directly stimulating an increase in digestion increase in gastrointestinal motility and therefore makes you have to pooHope that helps,0,cdpp7x8,1rp80o,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,1

twobo,Alcohol is a GABA agonist positive allosteric modulatorThis means it affects certain receptors in your brain that modulate inhibition You brain needs to get excited in order to do things  but it also needs a way to calm down to avoid freaking out in a state of hyperactivity In general GABA accomplishes this We find that certain mental states like anxiety are correlated to different levels of GABA activity More GABA more inhibition less anxiety and also less physical coordination etc Other compounds that act on GABA receptors include the benzodiazepines like Xanax which are used to treat anxiety The effects of alcohol on anxiety tend to come into perceivable effect at lower doses than those that affect physical coordinationBasically alcohol acts on certain receptors in your brain that calm the brain which results in a generalized reduction in anxiety This for many people tends to result in an increase in confidence,27,cdpkxar,1rpis9,explainlikeimfive,top_day,197,170

topmarx,Forget everything you know about evolution imagine that youre hearing about it for the first timeReadyWhen a baby is born it is  its mother  its father and  randomThat random part is where something just goes wrong or flips out a bit during the babyformation process Some of the bodybuilding instructions which we call genes get mutated or distorted in some wayThis is why two short parents will usually have a short child but occasionally will have an extremely tall one or an extremely small one Or why some people can be born without their limbs or born blind or with all their organs flipped around in a mirror image Everyones just partially randomised We call these random changes mutationsNow some mutations are bad obviously But some mutations are good You might have a mutation that means you are much more muscular than your parents or a mutation that means your eyes are more sensitive or a mutation that makes you immune to a certain form of illnessWhen animals have mutations like that it means that they usually live longer and more successful lives the eyes help them hunt so they eat plentifully when their rivals starve or they survive an illness that wipes out many others theyre more colourful or stronger and attract more mates All of which means they have more babiesAnd when they have babies their genes get passed on  so the babies might have those lucky mutations their parents had since they are after all  that parent Baby grows up has lots of babies of its own lives a longer better life passes on the mutation to its babiesOver and over and over again If the mutation is really great then every generation the people with the mutation will be having more babies than everyone else which means that the percentage of the population with it grows  today  in a few years  in a few centuries and eventually everyoneOver millions of years this results in a variety of animals who have separated into different species and subspecies highly adapted for their specific environments because the packs that wound up moving closer to Yemen didnt need the winter fur that the Russian packs did the lizards in the desert found the watersaving mutation great but the lizards in the Amazon found more use for the diving one etcLets think of a very recent mutation that has caused so much grief for humanity skin colourHumans originated in north Africa We lived in bands that travelled around picking fruit and hunting small animals as we went Some groups went far south some stayed in north Africa some travelled far east some northish some far northHuman beings need a vitamin called Vitamin D Part of the way we synthesise it is in our skin through sunlight And guess what The tribes that moved north started losing precious vitamin D because theres not much sun up in Germany and Russia compared to Sudan and Egypt Without vitamin D people got sick But some people were paler than others Being pale means that your skin lacks melanin which filters out the sunlight protecting you from sunburn but also stopping you from making Vitamin D Pale people didnt get as sick as everyone else They lived longer and had more babies on average Babies that were pale like their parents Of those babies the palest were the healthiest on average since they had an easier time making vitamin D So they lived longest had the most babies  and the palest babies And this went on and on for years and years until boom  all the people who had settled around Germany Sweden Russia Netherlands they were all white skinnedMeanwhile the people back in Africa didnt have this problem They got plenty of Vitamin D from the harsh unfiltered sun What they needed was protection from too much sun which could cause skin cancers and burns So they developed very dark black skinPeople who had settled somewhere along the middle like in the Middle East or India developed skin that was somewhere between the two because that was the ideal balance for where they were The people who had settled in Greece and Italy developed skin closer to white but still not as dark as the Swedish or Russian groupsThat is a simple and easy example of an evolutionary change happening without mutation Mutation isnt involved in every evolutionary change but it is definitely involved in some of them The ability to digest dairy is considered to be a mutation and its one that not everyone hashttpcdnfoodbeastcomsamazonawscomcontentwpcontentuploadsGlobalLactoseIntolerancepng Thats a map of lactose intolerance See how the mutation has spread among some segments of humanity but not among others,0,cdpn86g,1rpqht,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3,3

Rodorador,When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered third world meaning really that they are underdeveloped by Europeanfirst world standards I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards Now while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so I will not get into this since OPs question was not a moral question The question was about why the north is more developed than the southThe main reason is the fact of colonialism European powers like Holland Spain and Portugal upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the Americas for thousands of years decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations I am not sure how European powers decided to do this but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations If you recall during the renaissance era when colonization was in its beginning stages Columbus had accidentally landed in America in  gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods You can read Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations for more info  Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology enslaved Indigenous miners of gold silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations we move to a period of time called imperialism This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empires benefit In modern day although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call third world countries from developing Structures like the world banks structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing The agriculture subsidy has put out so many countrys agriculture sector out of business even though they would have a comparative advantage ie make crops for cheaper than the usStructural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to third world countries but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector This is bad because these nations dont have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other nonraw resources or technological processes or their human capital  What ends up happening and is happening is that southern countries are still in debt and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt but keeping them in the cycle of debt Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societiesFor more details a good place to start is a documentary called the end of poverty Free on YouTube  ,5,cdprbpd,1rpre0,explainlikeimfive,top_day,14,9

SecureThruObscure,Depends Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation The reason is pretty straightforward Your blood and veins act like a radiator system Theyre brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area and then sent off to a different part of the body Is its cold out your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities  It then radiates transmits that heat to the fingers toes etc Typically they lose heat especially in cold weather  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without Its worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia less blood gets to the skinfingers less heat gets lost and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals ,40,cdpmmm6,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,top_day,161,121

mookie,Ok let me try to give you the perspective that me and my friends have as  year old college students who talk about politics regularly and Reagan frequently comes up All of us even the Democrats agree that our parents have a kind of blind admiration for Reagan as they cant really give us a reason for viewing him as a great president but heres what we think The combination of new technology being integrated into the stock market massive outsourcing looser economic restrictions and crack downs on unions gave the middle class much stronger buying power for the time at least but actually ended up levying almost irreparable damage on Americas social mobility He also had little care for political correctness and used terms like welfare queens and engrained in people the incorrect fact the welfare was being abused by those on it basically perpetuating a kind of de facto racism that persists to this day and it should be obvious how this was appealing to Whites from all social classes Also his Trickledown economics which in theory sounds really appealing but fails to account for the natural greed and self servitude that permeates among all humans but because of economic success due to other factors it appeared to work due to failures in modern day Canada Bush  and Bush  its clear Trickledown doesnt work as well as thought Anyway he empowered the middle class and there was even a mild recession towards the end of his second term which people didnt attribute to him but instead blamed on new technology because of his cult of personality So basically he was loved because he built an aura of invincibility and growth which was powered by short term fixes to our problems which are even today causing us problems ie outsourcing and the fact that he had a massive cult of personality populated by young middle class kids coming out of college who were allowed massive spending power due to the cheapening of goods and the influx of jobs because of the growth technology which had little if anything to do with Reagan and military spendingtldr I dont like Reagan,7,cdpvyi5,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_day,11,4

Drew,You say that Reagan is held to be one of the best US presidents but who believes this  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagans accomplishments  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans  In any case even if he were held to be an amazing president the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the s while being himself young and vigorous having an attractive wife and young children the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelts and that had been nearly  years before JFK and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights the Peace Corps nuclear disarmament and so forth  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful attractive witty and energetic  But Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president No civil rights laws and so forth  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in peoples memories  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process in a way Reagans reputation developed somewhat similarly though not quite in the same way as Kennedys  After all Reagan did not die in office but he was very good on TV witty pleasant easygoing like JFK and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits and Reagans children from his two marriages he had been divorced and remarried were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets  But he was a nice guy had a good sense of humor and his appeal on TV always benefitted him  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal no matter what their abilities really are And Reagan was not a bright man  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with and that America could do no harm  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do  As for his actual policies as president he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union He had come late in his presidency to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing But this was very much different from the rest of Reagans foreign policy   Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive as Kennedys had been as well with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in   Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly  He is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents efforts as from Reagans and it resulted at least as much from the USSRs own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures arguably more from internal problems than from what the US did  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble  But the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually fell during the presidency of Reagans successor GHW Bush  Maybe he should get all the credit  Of course that would be silly too but crediting Reagan is just as illogical  What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy like JFK who made them feel good that he stood up to the Soviets but so had Truman Eisenhower JFK and other presidents often much more dramatically and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the s  So Americans felt better in the s  Was this Reagans doing  Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy and other factors  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today  he began the year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others  This legacy was one of Reagans worst and we are still suffering because of it  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the s and most Americans dont understand very well the economic changes of the last  years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the s This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top  Reagan was also very antiunion his firing of air traffic controllers accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor whatever you might think of unions in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time  Reagan was also a strongly antienvironmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws  On popular issues like these Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS those who got the disease were most often leftie homosexuals which Republicans did not care about or to improve the medical system in any way  In fact Reagans social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president  In short  our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre  But neither is ranked among the top presidents The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and instead they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people was reviving the economy was a patriot on foreign policy  These claims are inaccurate but the average American does not read much Im afraid or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they feel about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan he was reelected in  of course or buy most of the claims made in his favor and in the last years of his presidency Reagans popularity was dropping  This was partly due to his involvement in the IranContra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagans impeachment but didnt He somehow survived to the end of his term and he got Alzheimers fairly soon after leaving the White House he was already very old and people generally liked him so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him  The public simply choose not to care  But the facts are there nevertheless  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past had been divorced and lied a little about his accomplishments but was very charming and told good stories so people liked him anyway Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them  Abraham Lincoln often ranked as the best president today was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good  Popular views are shaped by emotion sentiment misunderstandings a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues and faulty memories  Truman was widely disparaged as president then there was a Truman Revival in the s after wed had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher I think due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were  In any case I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president  Its the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy  Heck I liked him but I hated his policies and still do ,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_day,4,4

DrMerkwurdigliebe,Thanks for asking a great ELI question We need more of these around hereThe difference lies in where power is at least in theory concentrated In a unitary system all power and legislative authority rest with the national government This means that the national government is the only one allowed to make new laws and that it makes laws for the entire country The UK operates under a unitary system A unitary system allows for broad application of national policies and standardizes government services across regionsA federal system splits up power between the national government and regional governments The US is an example of a federal system the national government has the power to do certain things like raise an army and regulate interstate trade and the states have the power to do other things like run schools and build roads This allows different states to pass different laws based on what works best for them It also limits the power of the national governmentThere is actually a third government type that goes along with federal and unitary systems confederations Confederations are on the opposite end of the spectrum from unitary governments In a confederation the nation is divided into regions or states like in a federation however rather than the regional and national governments being in a balance the regional governments hold the vast majority of the power the opposite of a unitary system This means that most laws are tailored to local interests which is good however problems can arise when a confederacy needs to act together as a single nation like in wartime since the national government is too weak to act effectively,0,cdpq1px,1rpza1,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,1

ixianprobe,There are two types of radiation explosure acute all happens at once or chronic slowly over a long time In the case of Elysium Max Matt Daymond is exposed to a lethal medium level dose of radiation It is important to understand that people do not  become more radioactive when exposed to radiation Instead their bodies are damaged by the radiation in ways that are bad for their health There is also another confusing expression you need to understand Often acute radiation exposure is called radiation poisoning even though it is actually not a poisoning at all The reason it is called radiation poisoning is because the damage that happens to the body resembles very much what happens when people are poisoned If they are exposed to a very high dose of radiation they start vomit and bleed from their lungs stomach and such within a few hours This happens because the radiation kills so many cells inside their bodies that the body start to leak so badly that the body cant patch the holes fast enough to keep itself alive For a medium but still lethal radiation dose the damage is still very serious but people will live for a few days before the effects occur Inside the body you have particular areas such as the bone marrow where new red blood cells and the white immune cells are made As long as your bone marrow can produce new cells the red blood cells will transport oxygen inside your body and the white immune cells will attack bacterias and other harmful invaders of the body Unfortunately the bone marrow is very sensitive to radioactive radiation and can be seriously damaged by radiation long before the rest of the body becomes badly damages After a few days the body will run out of white and red blood cells and people start to die from either an infection or because they cant get enough oxygen to keep the body aliveLastly cancer becomes the main cause of death only after someone survives a medium level radiation exposure or if they were exposed to a low level acute chroniclong term radiationThe character Max was obviously exposed to a medium level dosage of radiation because he didnt die after a few hours Hope this was a useful answer to the OPs question,0,cdpu2az,1rq7w4,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2

wreckeditralph,I will give this my best shot  I am by no means an expert but I did a little research when I was looking into water filters    When you pass a substance through a charcoal filter a decent number of impurities will chemically attach to the charcoal and become trapped This is another thing that makes charcoal attractive as a filter medium it attracts a lot of the undesirable impurities while leaving everything else aloneCharcoal is also very porous which helps give it a LOT of surface area  This means that charcoal also has lots of areas for the chemical impurities to attach,0,cdpr1dd,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,top_day,3,3
jackrex,Actually in most cases we use activated charcoal  which is charcoal treated with oxygen Due to this the molecular distance between the carbon atoms is increased thus effectively increasing the molecular surface area  ie it becomes more porousThis increases adsorption of various liquid and gaseous impurities httpenwikipediaorgwikiAdsorptionIn simpler terms due to adsorption  impurities are trapped in between the carbon atomsAfter a certain period of time all the intermolecular spaces are occupied by impurities and the filter will not adsorp any more This is when you need to change the filter,0,cdpratw,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2

soIsaystomabel,Ok what people are missing about why activated charcoal actually absorbs things yes the pores are important but not the only reason is that charcoal is made up of many carbon atoms bonded together The surface of this carbon material has many sites of positive charge When it is activated by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral positive and negative charge In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to removing it from the liquidIt can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid depending on the density of the carbon used as it will have a different density than the waterThe reason it is used is because it is cheap and doesnt require much energy to actually process the water You basically mix them let it settle,0,cdptzuz,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,1

EXI,Take a human standing inside a house that is at room temperature  That human being a warmblooded animal is about  degrees Fahrenheit  This heat radiates from the inside out  When it gets to the skin its no longer  degrees but it is still warm and it warms the air immediately surrounding itIf the air immediately surrounding the skin is warm then it wont cool the skin as quickly  Say as a very rough example that the skin itself is about  degrees the room is  degrees and the air surrounding the skin is  degreesThat is going to keep the skin relatively warmNow if you use a fan to blow air across the skin it is exciting those molecules a little but the bigger effect is that it blasts those molecules away from the skin altogether  So those  degree and recently excited molecules are now no longer touching your skin  Fresh  degree air is now touching your skin  Heat from your body dissipates more quickly into the cooler air and keeps you cooler,0,cdprspb,1rqbnk,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,2
alendotcom,Fans dont actually cool but they make you feel cooler because they wick away sweat from your body and thus heat leaves your body If you had a perfectly sealed room a fan running inside the heat that the motor gives off would technically heat up the roomI HATE sleeping with the fan on and my Girlfriend LOVES it for the soundI have had almost relationship ending arguments over this,1,cdprqm6,1rqbnk,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,1
dasmaraud,The amount of energy the fan provides that transforms inmediately into heat is negligible compared to the increase in kinetic energy Eventually when the air calms down a few feet past the fan this kinetic energy might transform into heat and raise the temperature a bitOn the other hand the increase in the speed of the air surrounding your body will also increase the convective heat transfer between these two This means your body either gains or loses heat more rapidly depending on whether the air is hotter or colder,0,cdps2wl,1rqbnk,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,1

kschmidt,OP You also must realize that depending on the country just because it SAYS its a certain medication doesnt mean that it IS the same medication  Many seniors travel to Canada or they used to to buy expensive prescription drugs because they were cheaper  Travelling to Canada and buying is generally considered safe if its still allowed  Other countries PERHAPS not so much  Buying off the internet has been shown many times that the drugs are not the same drug or a diluted dosage  Unless the drug is something youd feel physical or mental effects from you wouldnt be able to know what exactly you were taking without lab testsEDIT I have no information on specific countries and am not sure if travel to Canada by seniors is still acceptedallowed  I am NOT downplaying the significance of purchasing inexpensive medicines in other countries  Im only advising you to be absolutely sure that you are getting what you pay for,0,cdq3s5j,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,1,1
misanthrope,The FDA  If it costs billions of dollars to RampD a drug they need to recoup their expenses  There are patents that prevent knockoffs for years in the United States but companies in other countries can just make a generic immediately they have no RampD cost to earn back so instant profit off the backs of American companies,2,cdptqf2,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,0

dvfw,The FDA requires that all drugs before entering the market meet a very large set of requirements This means that the cost of producing the drugs increases dramatically and so does the final production cost The regulations as well as patent laws also serve to kill smaller competitors which means the decreased supply of the drugs causes a higher priceIn the wake of the  amendments the FDAs regulation of new drugs became increasingly stringent and risk averse leading critics to complain of overregulation The bureaucracy at the FDA acquired a reputation for remarkable inefficiency and delay with processing times for new drug applications NDAs typically extending to two years or more and paperwork reaching into tens of thousands of pages Meanwhile the time and expense of new drug development increased dramatically By  the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated  million  to  times as much as in the early s while development times had climbed from a coupleof years to the better part of a decadehttpwwwcatoorgsitescatoorgfilesserialsfilescatojournalcjnpdf,2,cdptiug,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_day,2,0
