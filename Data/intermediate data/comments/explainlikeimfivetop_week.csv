Mrknowitall,Youre killing me trying to put it in eliOk you got the gist that Fermat was trying to generalize Pythagoras theorem of right triangles abcIn short Fermat said that beyond squares there were no integers that worked That is you cant take ab to get cAndin fact the proofs were finally accomplished after over where Fermat simply commented that hed leave the proof to the reader Which formed that math major joke And I dont recall the last theorem having to do with areas of squares But i could be wrong Problem am actually ,0,cdkrp35,1r8wp6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

Quaytsar,Movies have motion blur Each frame is actually capturing everything that happens during a brief period of time about  milliseconds for  fps So any motion that happens during those milliseconds is recorded onto one frame creating motion blur This smooths the motion between frames Using more frames means less time per frame and less motion blur which people arent used to in their moviesIn video games every single frame is created on its own and only shows one instant in time There is no blur unless you put it there on purpose This makes lower frame rates like  fps seem choppy when compared to higher frame rates like  fps because it is showing less information in each second,0,cdkxx8a,1r925c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5,5

IAmDanimal,Short answer  because routers arent perfect so resetting it resets all the issues that come up over timeSlightly more in depth answer  Router software is complex and involves things like routing tables basically a list of places that your router can connect to as well as QoS quality of service which prioritizes certain types of internet traffic so videovoice services are faster at the expense of waiting an extra second or two for an email to come through firewall services filesharing services and other featuresAll of this adds up to a ton of complexity and over time a minor problems can add up and slow down your router You could try getting a higherend router as that can help,0,cdktawy,1r92yb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

scholeszz,How often does this happen Routers are designed with several input and output packet queues Over time its possible that the routers queues get clogged with traffic and the router spends more time processing the queues ie reading each packets source and destination and calculating which packets to prioritize if youve got that QoS thingy on rather than actually sending the packets over  If the queues are completely full youll lose several packets and your router will be forced to request several resends making the situation even worse Restarting your router basically flushes all the queues and lets you start over,0,cdkxywh,1r92yb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

danceycat,Psychological disorders are defined by people in the DSM  I dont know exactly how it works or the details but a group of people decide what changes to be added to the latest editions of the DSM every now and then  Should X be a disorder What category should it be under eg mood disorders How many of which symptoms does one need to have in order to be diagnosed  How long must these symptoms have been present And so on  They look at the latest research and Im sure that of course as with most things somehow there are politics involvedDisorders are pretty much defined and diagnosed by symptoms in an effort to treat and study them  Homosexuality could be a psychological disorder if the people who updated the DSM chose to define it as such though probably many people would disagree with it but the DSM is what determines whether or not certain symptoms are a disorder  However things are labeled as disorders so they can be treated not because there is something in the brain that is different than the majority of people  If homosexuality were labeled a disorder the implications would be that it would be treated  Though this used to be the case and homosexuality was indeed in the DSM it isnt any more at least in western society as a whole today  So theres not really a reason to label it as a disordertldr We dont know that something is a disorder  We define it as such so we can treat it,1,cdl0a1u,1r94ti,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7,6

mikejonas,A lot of television entertainment as we know it today was carried over from the live theater also by way of radio so in a sense they were theatrical performances that happened to be recorded and broadcast   So in the early days of sitcoms thats kind of how they set things upeach episode would be a little play in front of an audience who would obviously laugh and react to the action they watched in front of themThe TV audience got used to this format over the decades so even shows that didnt have a live audience animated shows like the Flintstones singlecamera sitcoms like Bewitched included an artificial laugh trackAnd yeah there is something sort of psychologically comforting about it our instinctive itch to belong being scratched by laughing along with others even if the others are on the other side of the screenIm not one of those narrowminded cynical types who think that a laugh track is an indicator that the show is somehow cheesy or unsophisticatedmany of televisions most important and genuinely funniest sitcoms have had laugh tracks  Also ridiculous is the assumption that singlecamera nonlaughtrack shows are automatically superiorthereve been plenty of stinkers over the years since theyve come into fashionIts interesting that someone mentioned How I Met Your Mothers laugh track because the show is actually a sort of hybrid in this sensea stylistic choice by its creators who wanted the feel of the oldfashioned multicamera sitcoms but wanted to innovate on the format  Unlike Two and a Half Men The Big Bang Theory and other current laugh track sitcoms who record their shows the old fashioned way by rehearsing through the week and then performing each episode live in front of a studio audience a couple of times with the final product being edited together from the two recordings HIMYM actually shoots like a singlecamera TV show without a live audience shooting the scenes piecemeal and not necessarily in chronological order and doing as many takes as they feel comfortable with  They do have the cameras and stage set up so that it has the look of a traditional sitcom but its put together differently  That allows HIMYM to be paced faster than your average multicamera sitcom a HIMYM episode has about three times as many scenes as a Two and a Half Men episode and allows for a lot of humor in the edit via quick flashbacks and cutaways   Because of this and the fact that the laugh track is more subtle you dont hear the audience cheer and whoop it up whenever a beloved character shows up for the first time in the episode some people dont actually notice that theres a laugh track until they discover it much later,1,cdl5suv,1r9ogf,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

Prox,Whoa heres one I can do   To make it as simple as possible the human retina consists of two broad classifications of photoreceptive cell rods and cones The cones detect colour light or more accurately detect three different ranges of wavelengths of light and determine colour by comparison whereas the rods are better at blackand white due to not making colour comparisons The rod cells are the focus here Rod cells are wider than cones and can capture a larger amount of information for each cell Because of this they are much better at motion than cone cells In addition to this cone cells are mostly in the centre of the retina while rods are found towards the outside This means that the centre of the eye is more adept at colour while the peripheral detects more motion  This should give a good basis for why you can see motion better out of the peripheral but doesnt quite explain why vision in the dark is better in the peripherals To do this we need to revisit the colour comparison idea I mentioned in the first paragraph  Since cone vision centre of visual field determines colour by comparison of three cone types the peak response for each differs Rods only have one wavelength range which peaks right about the middle of the visual spectrum Because of this the visual range of three cone types is much larger than the range of one rod  If youve stuck with me so far I can put it all back together now Rods which specialise in motion and are found in the peripheral of the visual field detect light in blackandwhite to put it crudely Because of this and a few interactions of photoreceptive proteins they can adapt to the dark faster than cones This means that while it is mostly in black and white your vision in the dark is better with your rods than your cones and being found in the peripheral of the visual field your dark vision is hence better in your peripherals  Did that help or did I lose you somewhere,4,cdl5rup,1ra4os,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14,10

Mephysteaux,Less about immigration in general more about how the government should respond to illegal immigrantsPoints against immigration Many Americans are unemployed because immigrants are willing to do their jobs for less money In some cases this is true In other cases immigrants are often willing to do jobs that are so crappy that most Americans arent willing to do them Since immigrants arent citizens they dont pay taxes but are still eligible to receive some government benefits For example it is illegal to deny a child a public education on the basis that heshe is an illegal immigrant Much of the money that an immigrant earns is sent back to hisher home country removing money from our economy and weakening it Many who oppose illegal immigration will try to link it with crime such as by bringing up stories of individual illegal immigrants who commit crimes like rape or murder or trying to correlate the low income of illegal immigrants to the fact that most crime is committed by lowincome individuals In my opinion the first type are really the exception and not the rule most illegal immigrants are good people I do believe that deportation should be a mandatory part of the sentence for illegal immigrants who commit felonies though As for the second part it has been shown that lowincome illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US citizens in the same income bracketPoints for immigration The human aspect Illegal immigrants are basically just trying to make better lives for themselves and their families Sometimes you have situations where an illegal couple has children in the US making them citizens so to deport them would be to separate children from their parents In many industries employing illegal immigrants drives prices down For example when farms employ illegal immigrants their labor cost goes down and in turn the cost of groceries goes down for the rest of the country making it easier for Americans to feed themselves Many programs meant to curb illegal immigration have some fairly racist implications For example there was the law passed in Arizona a few years back that police could stop motorists if they had reason to believe they were illegal immigrants which to an extent was translated as being Hispanic is probable cause,1,cdl59x5,1ra5m2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7,6

deadmiddlefinger,prjindigo gives a great response I agree with what he wroteOne principle I did not see is much of it is due to the the inherent qualities of chemicals for the actual being There are only so many chemicals that can be used We are carbon based because carbon is extremely extremely easy to create chemical bonds with other atoms It would be very difficult to create a being with inert noble gases like Argon Neon Those atoms do not combine with anything  their outer shell of valence electrons is considered to be full So really one needs to eliminate or assign a value to each atom relative to carbon That way one can get a standard probability or likelihood of combining to get life Also  carbon is the th most abundant element in the Earths crust and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen helium and oxygen So ubiquity has something to do with what life forms can be made from It would be difficult to create life with an extremely rare atom just because of scarcityHydrogen makes up  of the Milky Way Disk and helium makes up  This ratio is from the Big Bang The rest of the Milky Way    is made of heavier atoms which are generated from stellar nucleosynthesis ie we are all stardust even other types of beingsThen you have to look at the relative abundance of atoms and their combinatorial likelihoods This has to do with what atom combines easily with another and the relative abundance of each And again we are talking about  of the galaxy mass non black matter  For example glycolaldehyde It is a key ingredient for life It helps to build Ribonucleic acid RNA which is thought to be the central molecule involved in the origin of life on Earth Glycolaldehyde is a monosaccharide sugar the basic unit of carbohydrates It can react with the chemical propenal to form ribose the building block of RNA It would be nice if that shit were naturally occurring right Well it is It was spotted in a large starforming area of space around  lightyears from Earth in the lesschaotic outer regions of the Milky Way   The finding was made with the IRAM radio telescope in France is published in the Astrophysical Journal LettersAgain I am more concerned with the atomic level of life creation All the other parts like a planet being in a life supporting band is interesting But ultimately it depends on the atomic level  wether it can even happen with relative abundances and valances of atomsIt would be interesting to find out how the energy would be generated Here on earth all beings as far as I know use the Citric acid Krebs CyclehttpenwikipediaorgwikiFileCitricacidcyclewithaconitatesvg It is just atoms For example the citrate is CHO  Six Carbons five Hydrogens and seven Oxygen atoms I bring this up because bringing in energy through some kind of energy source food is necessary if a being works and expends energySo the point is that there are actual physics limitations that determine what actually can happen and the probability of it happening So rather than creating a theoretical model of what is possible habitable zone presence of liquid water etc it is much better to create a  known information of what can happen based on our actual knowledge of what isTLDR stuff stuff stuff,1,cdlhjkv,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,3

Sinstrite,Saying it as simply as I know how scientists base their facts and theorycraft even state the possible and impossible based off of the current rules in the laws of physics  If you break down life as we know it to the most simplistic form you can see it needs certain things in order to live such as different types of mass as an outside source of energy to break down sunlight water etc  If you were to ask a scientist if there is life on Mars they would most likely say that as long as certain variables were there such as the right chemicals in the atmosphere traces of water in the ground the things life evolved from here on Earth then they would say its possible  They only say that though based on the current science and how life is bound to exist or not based on the fundamental laws of physics  If we found a life form on Jupiter that does not ingest any type of outside mass as a way to convert it to energy then the question is asked how does the life form sustain itself  Lets say that to sustain itself it rises from increasing pockets in its body to create a gas and then when its at the right height it releases the gas and falls at a fast rate  The friction of its body against the atmosphere around it may create a type of heat which the life form can convert into energy most of which is probably used to create more rising gas and other energy to sustain its basic life functionsWell some type of life form along those lines my science is very bad obviously  But to discover a life form that lives that way would introduce new possibilities because it doesnt need water or to ingest mass or to take away from anything in order to live  Instead it lives solely from heat created from frictionTLDRBasically because we have our rules that allow or dont allow life to exist currently life we can study we have decided to explore new possibilities using those rules as a template  Until we discover a life form that goes against those rules we will never know what is and isnt possible outside of that realm because we cant actually test anything and come to a conclusion without a test subject life form,0,cdld2no,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

acid,Were mostly looking for what weve already seen but we can also make reasonable predictions on whether theres a possibility of life naturally evolving on a planet based on the chemical properties of the elements present there and hence use that knowledge to rule out certain planets as possibly home to some form of organic life The followings an excerpt from Stephen Hawkings book The Grand Design that explains this in a bit more detailLife  depends on more complex elements than say lithium or helium  atoms whose nuclei contain two and three protons Carbon is the most important of these the basis for all organic chemistry Though one might imagine living organisms such as intelligent computers produced from other elements such as silicon it is doubtful that life could have spontaneously evolved in the absence of carbon The reasons for that are technical but have to do with the unique manner in whichcarbon bonds with other elements Carbon dioxide for example is gaseous at room temperature and biologically very useful Since silicon is the element directly below carbon on the periodic table it has similar chemical properties However silicon dioxide quartz is far more useful in a rock collection than in an organisms lungs Still perhaps lifeforms could evolve that feast on silicon and rhythmically twirl their tails in pools of liquid ammonia Even that type of exotic life could not evolve from just the primordial elements for those elements can form only two stable compounds lithium hydride which is a colorless crystalline solid and hydrogen gas neither of them a compound likely to reproduce or even to fall in love,0,cdlf1g2,1ra7mt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

sababababa,Salt is sodium chloride When saliva breaks down salt it dissociates into Na which has a positive charge and Cl which has a negative charge The Na is the important one here Well get back to it in a minuteYour taste buds operate using something called an action potential These are found in neurons brain cells throughout your brain and spinal chord but also in your taste receptors and other cells Ill give you a brief rundown of how they workTheres an electrical current running through these cells The inside of the cells are kept at a constant mV This charge can fluctuate up or down a little bit if positively or negative charged ions enter the cell You might see where were going with this If the cells polarity another name for the charge kinda rises or falls a little bit nothing really happens But if the cell depolarizes enough that is if its charge is raised enough it hits a point of no return That point is mV What happens nextWell once the point of no return is reached a value also known as the threshold stimulus or simply the threshold we see whats called an a action potential This is a sudden SPIKE in charge making the cell reach upwards of mV This causes a chain reaction where the charge travels to other cells close by This electrical impulse travels through the body and eventually reaches the brain where it gets interpreted as hey Im touchingsmellingtasting something Cells return to their normal mV baseline after they fire an action potential and after a brief refractory period theyre ready to go againFood electrically stimulates taste cells raising them to that critical level so they go nuts and blast your brain with messages Remember how I talked about salt dissociating into Na and Cl Well the Na being positively charged and all effectively raises the baseline voltage on the receptors in your tongue Instead of mV they might be hovering closer to say  or mV That means that they require less stimulation to reach that critical mV and fire signals to your brain  Foods taste richer and more flavorful because your taste buds are primed and ready to fire at the drop of a hatSalt does indeed have its own flavor but to say it brings out the flavor of food is also accurate in my opinion cause thats exactly what its doing As someone else mentioned try putting a pinch of salt into sweet foods Salted caramel ice cream game over dawgedit you might be wondering why the Cls negative charge doesnt just negate the Nas positive charge The  answer is that the resting potential that mV we were talking about is regulated by the concentration of Na and K or potassium inside and outside the cell Cl does come in to play but a little lateredit  whoaaaaa gold Thanks to whoever hooked it up,8,cdl9d2w,1raak3,explainlikeimfive,top_week,76,68

neitherparty,The answers thus far are not accurate  I used to work in the gasoline business  Heres how it works  Gasoline is purchased on contracts and delivered at the local terminal  For much of the US population this terminal was fed by a gasoline pipeline from greater Houston  When the gasoline is pulled at the terminal from the pipeline it is a commodity  Exxon going in Hess coming out  The gas is put into tanks where additives are added to differentiate brands from each otherGasoline is delivered to the various gas stations sometimes up to  times per day based on volume   Despite getting their gasoline from the same place different companies do NOT pay the same price  There are spot prices for those with no contracts and contracted pricing for the more sophisticated gas retailersThe price at the pump is determined by what the other stations are charging NOT the cost of the gasoline  Large gasoline retailers typically independents sell gas below cost for most of the year and make all their profits in  or  months  Competitive surveys are done multiple times per day by the gas stations usually with managers coming on or off shift driving a predetermined route and recording all prices  Then the pricing strategy is applied  Some companies want to match the lowest price some want to best the lowest by one cent etc  Gas price changes are not instantaneous but can happen multiple times per day,2,cdl86ng,1rabdc,explainlikeimfive,top_week,19,17

dageekywon,Because everyones body has different requirements  By supplying more than the body needs Body A which needs  today will get the  today it needs while Body B which only needs  today will get it as wellSince although we do have an idea about what vitamins the body needs on a daily basis and we can kinda guesstimate as to how much they need as well which is where you get the suggested daily allowance figures we can estimate that and set a ratingBut because bodies have different requirements different needs daily and some bodies also have difficulty in absorbing those nutrients providing more of them hopefully assists in a few waysit allows a greater chance of absorption as the pill or supplement travels through the body it meets the varying needs daily also as wellAnd the simple fact is although the benefits and amounts of some vitamins are known fairly well its still honestly an educated guess and since it cannot be narrowed down overdoing it in a lot of cases doesnt cause any harmIf there is known harm from having too much of a nutrient youll see that they usually are not placed into a vitamin or supplement in those quantities  They will be  or less if you can get them from normal food as wellBut unless something is known to be harmful in large quantities its easier to provide way more for those reasons especially if its something known that the body needs but the quantity is unsure  If it doesnt hurt the body to take more and the excess is simply discarded there is no real harm in doing that  And with your body having varying needs providing  RDA daily will be fine some days but not on othersHaving said that unless there is some science in it  is really overkill   would more than meet any variations the body may have for demand  Especially since most people including myself may take a daily vitamin that supplies  of most of the important stuff but we also eat foods and consume drinks with them in it also so any excess we need would be easily supplied obviously,4,cdld8ej,1rapt0,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6,2

diMario,The Moon and Earth circle around their common center of mass which does not precisely coincide with the center of the EarthThe bulge in the ocean nearest to the Moon is caused because there the surface of the Earth feels the gravity of the Moon pulling at it The surface is a solid and cannot rise but the ocean is fluid and it can rise You might say the Moon pulls a bit harder at the water on that side of the EarthThe bulge at the far side of the Moon is a bit further away from the common center of mass and therefore does feel a bit less attracted to it Gravitational attraction diminishes with distance The bulge rises because there are in fact two forces at work on the water gravitation pulls it inward towards the center of gravity but because the world rotates around the center of gravity things are also pushed slightly outward by the centrifugal force The balance between the inward and outward force at the side of the Earth facing away from the Moon is such that the water is pushed outward away from the common center of mass a bit more on that side,0,cdlb9jh,1ratow,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

mrindigo,Its mass doesnt increase theres no new mass created thats an inaccurate shorthand to explain what happens as you accelerate an object close to the speed of light Its not that your mass increases indeed your rest mass is the same in all reference frames  its just that the energy required to accelerate you increases at an exponential rate and you can never supply enough energy to reach CIn any case the law of conservation of mass itself doesnt hold true in many circumstances  its a special case version of the law of conservation of energy Energy and mass can be interchanged the shorthand version of this is E  mc which comes from the more complete equation E  m  c  p  c   its the total that cant move around,0,cdlitib,1rbjsm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,9

michaelc,In physics and chemistry seen at an introductory level it is under a framework in which mass and energy both independently remain the same which provides fairly accurate results in many settings However in other conditions they are considered jointly and while the total massenergy cannot change mass can convert to energy and viceversa,1,cdliv0j,1rbjsm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1
arkadye,Actually conservation of mass is just a byproduct of conservation of energy Mass and energy are equivalent as Einstein showed with Emc Set c  its a constant so you can scale it how you like and Em energy  massIn normal cases mass and energy arent converted but at very high speeds and in nuclear reactions mass isnt conserved but energy is and momentum is,1,cdlivqw,1rbjsm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1
corpuscle,Theres no such thing as conservation of mass in physics Mass gets created and destroyed all the time In chemistry and basic physics mass never gets destroyed so they call it a law to keep things simple Its not true thoughAnyway what youre describing is relativistic mass which is a sort of tricky concept Most physicists these days prefer to avoid it entirely because its just not a very coherent concept If you read a modern physics textbook theyll generally skirt away from the idea entirelyThe reason that most physicists dont like it is that it gives you somewhat nonsensical results For example lets imagine you have a box with perfect mirrors on all sides If you shoot a bunch of photons light into the box the mass of the box as measured from the outside increasesPhotons however dont have mass It doesnt matter how you rig the numbers they just dont So we have a bit of a conundrum because the presence of photons increased the mass but photons do not have massIts frankly a logical inconsistency that most physicists prefer to avoid The preferred approach is to say that by adding photons to the box we increased the rest energy of the system which causes an increase in the massFor your case what physicists prefer to say is that the momentum increases as the object moves faster more than it normally would not the mass,2,cdlj1f1,1rbjsm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,1

LIPCSB,The basic premise is that the Doctor is an alien species Time Lord who travels around in a spaceshiptimemachine called the TARDIS  The TARDIS is bigger on the inside and has a camouflage circuit thats been jammed to London Police Box s since the first episode  He tends to be accompanied by companions people who travel with the Doctor on his adventures  The show began in  and thus far  men have played the Doctor  This is explained inuniverse by Time Lords growing a new body when they die  The show went off the air in   There was an attempt to revive it in  with an Americanmade television movie but that didnt get the greenlight for a full series  It was successfully revived in  with the Ninth Doctor played by Christopher Eccleston  It was a cult show in Britain for many years aimed mostly at younger audiences but having a strong following among science fiction fans but the revival has brought it a more mainstream popularity  Id recommend getting started with Ecclestons episodesSeries  which aired in   Watch the modern series then go back to the older stuff  Theres no need to slog through every episode which is impossible anyway given that a good many were destroyed in the old days of nonubiquitous recording just pick up a story or two stories are several episodes long though from each Doctor  And give the TV movie a lookits not perfect but the th Doctors acting is very good  Eric Roberts as The Masteryour mileage may vary  ,239,cdlo5jt,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1151,912

Risar,This is a very short version   The Doctor the primary character is a timelord an ancient species of alien which live for thousands of years through a biotech process called regeneration This allows The Doctor to survive otherwise fatal events but the process causes physical changes  The series is oriented around The Doctors adventures in time and space usually using his stolen time ship which is a TARDIS time and relative dimension in space You see the Doctor is a bit of a misfit In addition to his rebel streak its important to note that Timelords choose their title so The Doctor views himself as a healer of sorts  Accordingly the show is a bit quirky  odd and has a magic go anywhere do anything mechanic in the TARDIS So The Doctor may be in Ancient Rome or future London some alien ship or planet He often picks up interesting partners in crime to travel with him as he goes So the entire show has a rotating cast essentially with overarching themes and arcs spanning multiple seasons   In recent seasons The Doctor has had some very dark moments but is overall a light hearted show I generally advise anyone who likes scifi to check it out its hard to summarize the mythology on my phone ,12,cdlnnve,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,51,39

laioren,Its hard to describe the Doctor simply The main character has committed genocide on not one but at least two races including his own His closest friends frequently die or meet even worse fates Despite these two facts everyday he wakes up and tries to make the universe a better place The Doctor is a character so complex in his history created from so many poignant but small moments buried in the genre fiction of his show that simple descriptions of him cant help but make him sound unbelievable But he is brilliant That god and the devil could be the same person Absolutely brilliant Thats why the writing of the show is fucking fantastic That they can believably pull off that characterI still get chills every time I see his speech when he confronted the AtraxihttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvFxKcLIdYsBut Ill try to do him justice hereBasic PremiseThe Doctor is an alien that has a timetraveling phone booth He frequently takes companions with him on his travels Companions are just people he meets up with and travels with Theyre like his friendsHe is a devout pacifist though he has his bad days and generally thinks of very clever ways to get out of problems He spends his time saving the universe LiterallyHere are the Doctors powers He has a sonic screwdriver It is the ultimate MacGuffin It works when the story needs it to and doesnt when the story needs it to not workhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiMacGuffin When he speaks others listen He is frequently cornered by enemies with superior weapons but then he starts talking at them By the time hes done talking hes outsmarted them Hes wicked smart He thinks of technobabble solutions to problems sometimes but the best stories are when he thinks of creative solutions that you could have thought up Hes a master of Venusian aikido space martial arts No shit Youll probably never see this though It was really only used by the Third DoctorhttptardiswikiacomwikiTheDoctor He can regenerate Thought up as a way to continue the show when William Hartnell the First Doctor wanted to retire it has now become a staple of the show When Time Lords the race of the Doctor are killed they can undergo a complete cellular regenerate that brings them back to life However they end up looking different ie being played by another actor This change is more than just skin deep though They can change skin colors or even genders Also their memories become a bit muddled and other significant changes can occur such as no longer liking a favorite kind of foodIn the fandom whenever the Doctor undergoes a regeneration its a HUGE DEALCurrently the Doctor is in his th incarnation sort of Thats why Matt Smith the actor currently playing the Doctor is generally referred to as the Eleventh DoctorAbout the ShowThe British refer to what Americans call a season as a series so that can get pretty confusing Ill use the American version for this write up so when I say a season Im taking about a single string of episodes aired typically during a single calendar yearThere are basically three different eras that make up Doctor Who Most people in America refer to these as the different series of the showOriginal Series  Aired from  to  and had a movie that aired in  The original series was mainly characterized by by serials Two to five episodes that made up a single story arch Series  Aired from  to  This is when the show relaunched after being canceled  years earlier The budget for the show was still very small comparatively and is often considered cheesy or unwatchable by younger audiencesSteven Moffat Series  Started in  and running up to today Named after the current show runner or head writer for the show Marked by a noticeable increase in budget All episodes are now broadcast in high definition Still using the same actor Matt Smith as the DoctorWhere to StartYoure going to get lots of different answers for this Im just going to give you the easiest place to start for what is probably the average viewerStart with the episode The Eleventh Hour Its generally considered Season  or Series  if youre British of the  series though fans often make a distinction and think of it as the first episode of the Steven Moffat Series Calling it the  series distinguishes it from the original  to  run and the movie made in httpsenwikipediaorgwikiListofDoctorWhoserialsSeriesEach season of the  Doctor Who is comprised of episodic episodes as well as serial episodes Episodic episodes are standalone pieces Like oneoff shows that dont much connect to any of the other shows Serial episodes are ones that have interconnected stories though they may not have occurred in order Usually the first and last episodes of each season are connected and sometimes one or two other episodes in the middle of the season These form the seasonal story archIf you enjoy the first few episodes of Season  and want to watch the older stuff jump back to Season  with Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor Again this is Season  of the  SeriesIf you have a hard time watching that but just want to see the best episodes so you can keep up with Doctor Who talk then Id recommend theseThe Empty ChildThe Doctor DancesHuman NatureThe Family of BloodBlinkSilence in the LibraryForest of the DeadThose are pretty much the best ones from  to Everything from  on should be pretty easy to enjoy for modern audiencesUnfortunately there are a lot of people that love Doctor Who so much that they want everyone to love it I certainly love it However its not really for everyone Lots of people dont like the more childish or cheesy

Polaritical,Dont let the super devoted fans fool you Doctor Who is just a silly little show about a time traveling alienI think people get scared off because the super devoted fans give an impression that show is much more serious and detail oriented than it really is This is not Lost You dont have to go back over episodes and poor over details In fact you can pretty much watch any episode and catch on pretty quickly Some of the companion related side plot plot might be lost but the show is mainly episodic and focuses on one particular problem and plot each episodeDoctor Who is a beloved british tv show that follows the antics of a time lord a type of alien species that looks similar to humans traveling through space and time with various companionsThink of it kind of like a scifi version of Scooby Doo Every week theres some new mystery or problem and its up to the doctor and his loyal companion at the time to solve it He sort of acts as an intergalactic police officer running around and keeping everything from hitting the fan But instead of the mystery mobile the Doctor has the TARDISThe TARDIS is basically a super high tech spaceship that also acts as a time machine It helps with the adventures by doing nifty things like allowing the Doctor and his companion to understand whatever alien language is being spoken where they are which addresses the issue that so bothered fans of District  who didnt understand how the heck people and aliens were communicating with each other in completely different languages It also has a camouflage function which got stuck on an old phone booth Nifty disguise back when the show first aired that was kept because it was part of tradition but now is pretty funny when you see an old phone booth just appear in a modern London streetThe show started and did pretty well and then ran into the same problem that a lot of shows run into an actor didnt want to do the show anymore Think about Threes Company when Chrissy left or the Office when they had to right Michael off Except this was THE main guy They couldnt just write in a new character and take off with that plot line He was the LAST timelord There was no one they could write about without changing the entire premise of the show look how well that turned out when Scrubs tried itThey wanted to continue the show so they had to think of a way to keep the character of the Doctor going but have a new actor They could do like That s show did with Laurie or Bewitched did with Darren and simply get a new actor and not address it But they had something those shows didnt the doctor was an alien So they just wrote into the show that sometimes a doctor regenerates Which basically involves them taking a new human formAnd thats how the show has had a string of actors that have been able to play the same part throughout the show Doctor Who can pretty much be split into two sections the original run and the modern revivalThe original run was more of a Saturday morning type kids show that was aimed at the kind of kids who thought scifi was awesome The modern series tried to expand the appeal to a wider audience and did so quite successfully with an expanded budget and better special effectsIf youre just getting into the show start with the modern series You can start with Eccleston which was the first series in the modern run David Tennant is widely considered to be the most popular and loved Doctor so if you start with Eccleston and arent a huge fan Id recommend switching to Tennant before you write off the whole showThe show is hugely popular now and popular with a wider audience This can be seen as both good and bad Youll see that in the modern series especially with Matt Smith the show suddenly starts going to America a lot which is largely because the show now has a large American following Theres also some negative views of Doctor Who fan girls who think that the doctor is like super dreamy and cute Some fans think that show show shifted somewhat to appeal to those type of fans by including a lot of opportunities to make the Doctor look like a hunk despite it not really being in vein with the original showIf youre someone whos a bit skeptical about all this alien crap Id recommend watching the episode Blink Its completely different than all the other episodes and barely even features the Doctor But it really highlights the clever writing of the show and can be a good way to ease people who arent usually fans of science fiction into it Its a lot less cheesy than some episodes at first the cheesiness seems bad But once youve grown to love the Doctor you eat that cheese right up,1,cdlo2uv,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6,5
OpportunityBox,An alien race of beings becomes so advanced that the power of the entire universe is at their beck and call  They can instantly travel anywhere in time and space manipulate stars and black holes etc  These aliens called Time Lords use time travel to change history too much to suit their own ends and screw up  They mistakenly create super evil beings just as powerful as themselves  They wage a war so devastating that it tears major holes in the history of the universe and are about to tear apart the entire universe and destroy everything in it just to save themselvesOne of these Time Lords The Doctor determines that he can save the universe but it will mean destroying his entire race  He steals one of the most powerful ships ever created The Tardis a physical embodiment of the energy of the universe itself and uses it to stop the war by imprisoning both the evil race and his entire race of Time Lords for all time   He then spends thousands of years trying to alleviate his guilt and boredom trying to fix the damage to the universe caused by the Time Lords by traveling through space and time The Tardis brings him to places and times where he can do the most good and regenerates him into a new body each time he dies so he can continue his work  His effect is so profound that many races and planets including Earth call their heroes or healers DoctorsHe has access to the best technology ever created in the entire history of the universe  He travels with a human companion who helps to keep him honest and true  Storylines frequently involve a danger where there appear to be only two choices  For example making one choice will destroy a planet but making the other choice will only kill a small child  While the choice of one small child dying seems better than an entire planet dying his human companion attempts to force him to find a third choice where everyone lives  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesntStart with the new version that started in   Watch them all then watch them again,17,cdltld9,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,21,4

EngineeringStudent,The basic premise is the Doctor a Time Lord from the planet of Gallifrey has a machine that can travel anywhere in space and time The machine is called the TARDIS which looks like an old London Police Box The Doctor ran away from his home planet and travels around the universe to explore He picks up companions the first of which he kidnapped back in  and travels around with them until they decide or are forced to leave In his travels he just so happens to help out other races so he can save himself and his companions The show is a chronicle of his travelsBecause he is a Time Lord he can regenerate This means he gets a new body and a different personality His memories are the same but otherwise hes a completely different person This is why there are multiple Doctors The classic series contains the First through Seventh Doctors  to  iirc There was an American TV movie in  which featured the Eighth Doctor The  reboot of the series dubbed New Who began with the Nineth DoctorAs for where to begin I stared with the episode The Eleventh Hour which is the Eleventh Doctors first episode Another good starter as others have mentioned is the first episode of the  reboot with the Nineth Doctor However since every Doctor is different different actor different writers etc I would encourage giving at least two or three of them a try The good thing about Dr Who is that you can jump in pretty much anywhere as stories are generally standalone and dont rely on knowledge of stuff that happened beforeStands for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space The TARDIS is bigger on the inside and we generally see the console room The motivation behind helping other races depends on which Doctor youre dealing with Their MO also changes Some are very peaceful and avoid violence some may have committed genocide Not all Gallifreyans are necessarily Time Lords Time Lords are male Gallifreyans who attended the Academy The female counterpart would be Time Lady,0,cdlq7dy,1rbmab,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Extrmcouchsurfer,The purpose of oil is to lubricate and aid in keeping engine parts cooler  It forms a thin barrier around things like bearings to prevent excess friction  Over time the viscus property starts to decay and the parts basically rub against each other and start to wear out and thus the requirement to change oil,8,cdljqp2,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,27,19
NightMaestro,Imagine the inside of your engines piston boar Inside this giant cylinder the piston will go back and fourth thousands of times in a minute On a molecular level you will see the surface of this boar have very jagged ridges because steel isnt perfectly smooth As the piston goes up and down these pieces of metal will keep catching these ridges on a molecular level over and over and produce a lot of friction This happens in all moving parts of the engine To reduce this friction we use oil to fill gaps where the metal surfaces would otherwise grind up against eachother and subsequently melt all of these pieces of metal together through heatYou cant keep other molucules out of the oil thats just not possible so after a while the oil will be mixed with other contaminates that dirty up the oil After so many contaminates get into your oil those molucular ridges wont fill with the almost friction free oil moluciles anymore instead you will have dirt or metal shavings fill and create frictionSo check your oil And imagine your engine melting together if you ever need a good incentive to check the milage until your next oil change ,3,cdlkxap,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14,11

voucher,There are several reasons to change your oil Even if you hardly drive you should change your oil every three months Why The best reason is to remove the water being built up by taking short trips Condensation will form on the cold metal parts overnight Normally it isnt much amp it evaporates amp gets sucked thru your engine once its fully warmed up amp been driven for some time Constant short trips never let the engine reach operating temperatures The water builds up amp creates sludge It can sometimes be mistaken for a blown head gasket Oil additives break down over time amp wear out If you drive a lot long commutes half hour or longer you can go longer between oil changes You dont have to worry about water contamination as much as people who take short trips amp can go five to ten thousand miles between oil changes use synthetic to go up to fifteen thousand miles between oil changes Most places recommend three thousand miles to help cover their asses Its normal for engines to consume up to a quart of oil every one thousand miles In a five quart system that only leaves two quarts in the engine of key amp fuel drivers If you check your oil frequently amp top it off when it gets down a quart you can go much further between oil changes Your engine runs cooler amp the oil is less likely to get burned The other reason the three monththree thousand mile oil change is a good idea is for the inspection Take your car to a real shop for oil changes A good shop will inspect your car from top to bottom check tire pressure change your oil amp suggest other maintenance items you may have neglected in that time TLDR Change your oil every three months or three thousand miles unless you keep up on fluid levels amp tire pressure Use the guide in your owners manual for specifications based on your driving style ,1,cdlotzn,1rbmyo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1

TimeTravellerSmith,Basically what happens is that people can only contribute so much when they donate to political elections for obvious reasons  It prevents single rich people from buying politicians via financing their electionEnter the Super PAC which is essentially an account thats run by someone and anyone can donate any amount of money anonymously and then the PAC can use the funds however they like towards elections  They can buy ads supporting or against a candidate run rallies whatever  So they can indirectly fund any politician they like with the caveat that they arent supposed to work directly with them  Meaning that they cant go up to their candidate and ask what would you like us to do  Which creates obvious problems  Essentially behind closed doors a rich businessman or company can come up to a politician and his buddy who runs a PAC  The buddy can run campaigns in different districts without consulting the politician to support them while the businessman finances it anonymously  Which means that the three can collude behind closed doors to get a politician in office and then the politician can do what they do best and give their donors perks once theyre in officeExamplePolitician is running for election supports offshore drilling  Buddy opens up a PAC and says its going to support whichever politician will be best for local economy which really translates to whoever wants to do offshore drilling which translates to Im going to support my friend who happens to be a candidate  Rich oil company steps in and says well I support the guy whos going to let me drill offshore but can only donate a limited amount of money directly to the candidate  So the three gather behind closed doors and the oil company says Ill donate millions to the PAC if you work for me in office as in allow drilling lift sanctions get tax breaks etc  To which the politician says no problem and the buddy running the PAC says give me your money and Ill work on some great ads  In the end politicians get the unlimited money they want to get into office the companybusinessman gets a politician in their pocket and the PAC allows them to do it all anonymously,1,cdljxm1,1rbngb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,11,10

timmeh,A couple people have already seemed to have provided an answer but in case you didnt want to click a link or needed an example Ill chime inIll try to explain how DNA knows what to do through a real life example The easiest example I can think of is a small section of DNA frequently found in E coli called the lac operonSo imagine a coil of DNA Now only think of one of those strips The lac operon will look somewhat like this    TATAAAAAGCGATTGATGGCGCTGCATGCTAAGCTGACTCTTTAAGCGATGACATCGATCTThis is what it is like functionally    PROMOTEROPERATORREAL INFORMATIONTHE END    Now that ISNT the real thing  I dont have the real thing memorized or anythinghttpwwwgoodreadscomquotesidontneedtoknoweverythingijustneedto The real thing is longer and umm not that but its a good idea of what I would generally look like the  is just other DNA codeThe lac operon is responsible for making enzymes that process lactose a sugar found in milk To make it simple lets pretend that there is just one enzyme that helps process lactose and that enzymes name is MILKY Now MILKY isnt needed if there is no lactose And he IS needed when there IS lactose So DNA does a clever thingIn a normal state there is a small protein essentially a bouncer at a club that sticks to an area of the DNA called the OPERATOR The name isnt important What is important is that because this fat bastard is sitting in the way the DNA cant be read imagine the DNA is read in a linear manner If you cant read it you cant make itSo what happens when lactose is present The lactose actually its metabolite but just think lactose actually sticks to the fat bastard bouncer When lactose sticks to it the fat bastard bouncer lets go of the DNA Now the DNA can be readWith that area exposed a constantly floating protein lets call him the AGENT binds to the beginning part of the lac operon section of the DNA the AGENT is chemically made to bind there  he fits like a key With the AGENT bound to the promoting area PROMOTER he calls his friend the READER The READER moves across and reads the DNA and while doing so is writing a translation of it almost like translating it from one language to another Except for READER he translates DNA into RNAOnce a copy of the RNA is made this moves to another part of the cell not body just inside the cell to be made into a protein The name of the protein Albert Einstein Sorry couldnt resist The resulting protein is MILKY And with MILKY here he can eat up all the lactose and poop out stuff that the cell can readily useThats pretty much how most stuff in the cell or any organism is made off of DNA If its something that we always need then there is no fat bastard bouncer blocking that bit of the DNA Or this regulation could work in reverse where its always made until something comes which sticks to a different fat bastard bouncer and instead of making it let go makes it stick to the DNAHope that helpsIve left a lot of stuff out like the inducer exclusion lacIs constitutive nature lacZ lacY lacA terminator etc but I think it makes things simpler,3,cdlowre,1rbs80,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7,4
eideid,To understand how this works you have to let go of the idea that anything on this level knows anything Things work because if they didnt the organism would die and we wouldnt see any of that things offspringDNA is read by structures which copy sections and release bits of RNA which float around and then interact with structures in the cell which build new proteins which then float around and interact with other structures In fact most of biology is molecules floating around until they interact with something to cause something else to happenThe really cool part is how different parts of DNA are read depending on the circumstances in the organism There are molecules which will attach to the DNA which suppress or enhance different sections Suppressed sections wont be copied as much if at all while enhanced sections will be copied much more often In complex multicellular organisms this results in different sorts of cells having different bits turned on and off and those differences affect which proteins get created and interact from one cell to the next There are also feedback loops where a section of DNA gets activated resulting in the production of something which results in some activity which creates a new molecule which goes and turns off the section of DNA which was activated in the first place Sections of DNA can activate and suppress entire networks of other sections of DNA With just a few simple rules a tremendous amount of complexity can emerge,3,cdllthm,1rbs80,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,6
Justcreepin,DNA is code Segments of it are read as mentioned through transcription and translation This is the process of turning DNAs code into a message that is read and turned into a protein at a ribosome The protein then encodes an enzyme or other cellular components eg Receptors Now some of these enzymes go back to the DNA and are responsible for helping to express other segments of DNA along with binding partners enzymes are responsible for transcription and translation Cells varying throughout the body express different regions of DNA this is seem by cells in the liver having high expression of regulating enzymes for drugs or glucose while cells in the stomach are responsible for digestion associated factors Cells are able to know what they are supposed to do and what they are supposed to make by a series of things This includes external hormones triggering cells for certain functions in a localized area as well as messaging between joining cells So cells can receive messages from distant cells or other close cells which help tell them what to do Then through intracellular signals tell the DNA what to do Hope this helps ,1,cdln8sf,1rbs80,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

NeutralParty,Same as pointers in C That should clear everything up for youOK really its just a data type Its not scary so if your professor has been making it sound really scary its not Its only hard to deal with if you dont think like the computerTechnically a pointer is just a  bit unsigned integer Or  bit unsigned integer if youre compiling for a  bit machine All it is is some numberWhats special about pointers is what we do with them and how the language will interpret it A pointer is an address in memory When you run a program the OS will allot it some memory in which to copy its instructions and to otherwise work with The way the OS keeps track of memory so it only allots memory to one thing at a time  and the way lowlevel languages work with memory too  is by addressing it The first byte of memory is  the second byte is  etc until the last byte of memory is addressed If your using a  bit OS with maxed out RAM that would make the last address So now you know what a pointer is  an integer thats meant to correspond to a place in memoryHow we use them is a bit more complex but its not that hard if you just always think of it like the computer The computer just has a huge stack of drawers it can put stuff in Each drawer is a byte If you tell the computer put this in that address itll simply go to that address and copy the byte over If you ask it to copy a  bit integer  bytes to an address the first  bits go in the address and the next  bits into the next bytes etc until its copied everything Its really simple its just not how humans tend to think of things We try to bring common sense and other assumptions into how we think Computers dont In CC you can get the address of things with the amp operator and ask the computer to read from memory with the  operator Often called the dereference operator because we often say a pointer references a point in memory so dereferencing is finding whats actually there in the memory    int a      int b  ampa    b      cout ltlt aThat would print  The computer is told by us that b is the address of a and to make whats at the address b points to  The computer isnt aware that we modified a because it doesnt think that much it only understand that a is an integer that it put at some address its kept a record of When we ask it to print a it looks up where it put a in the memory reads the memory location and finds a Heres something to be careful about    int a      int b  aThats bad That doesnt mean b is a pointer to a that means b is a pointer to the address  This is bad because you have no guarantees that the OS has allotted the program the address  and so if you try to ask your program to modify whats at the address  and it has not been given access to it by the OS the OS will complain and will kill your program for attempting to violate memory This is usually called a segmentation fault Segmentation fault almost always means you messed up with your pointers somewhereSimilarly be careful of this    int a      int b  ampa    b  Same as above youre saying to make b point to the address  not to make what b points to  Also something you may not have heard but its true  theres no real difference between an array and a pointer When I say    int aa is an integer pointer The program will give it enough room to store  integers rather than  but nonetheless a is just a pointer to the first byte of the first integer Anything operators and syntax that works with a pointer variable works on an array variable and vice versa,3,cdln4er,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,1

eideid,At a very basic level computer programs have to interact with memory C is a rather lowlevel programming language by todays standards and it lets you requires even interact with memory in a very basic wayWhen you initialize a variable you are telling the computer to set aside a specific amount of memory in a specific place for the program to store and retrieve information This variable begins at a memory address which is represented as a number and it goes to a memory address dependent on the size of the type of data you are storing in it When you reference this variable you are really referencing this space in memoryNow lets take it up a bit and talk about arrays In C variants arrays have to be declared with a fixed length and each element of an array must have the same kind of data When you create an array of size N with a data type which takes up M bits you get a chunk of memory N  M bits long Lets say you want the third element of the array we can calculate it by taking the address of the beginning of then skipping past the first  values or   M bits This is essentially why arrays in this language start with index  since the first element is the address of the array and skip the first   M bitsPointers are simply these memory addresses in a form which you can manipulate with your code Instead of relying on the compiler to do it all behind the scenes you can use pointers to play with the memory directlyOne reason you might see pointers very early is when passing arrays into functions Most of the time we dont want variables we send to functions to get edited by the function without our knowing about it If I were to just send the memory address of a variable to a function and that function changed the contents at that memory address it might cause problems C handles this by copying the value of the variable into a new memory space just for the function to play with which makes programmers happy This however can be a problem when dealing with large data structures We dont necessarily want to copy a big pile of data just to do some trivial evaluation of it so when you pass an array instead of copying the whole thing you just send a pointer to where the array already lives and hopefully you or whomever wrote that function is going to be nice and not mess it up for you,0,cdlnkwr,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

kouhoutek,A pointer is a variable type that holds an address of another variableThat is the technically correct and completely useless answer  The real question is why the heck would you want something like that  That question is more easily answered by looking at the problem that pointers solveLets say you need to write a program that reads numbers from a file sorts them and prints them out  The first thing you probably want to do is store them in an array declared like this    int numbersThis presents a big problem because the storage for numbers will be allocated statically  This means your program will always reserve enough space for  ints  If your list has  elements you are wasting space and if it has  your program failsThe answer is to allocate memory dynamically that is let the program decide how much it needs while it is running not beforehand  For this it is nice to have pointers    int numbersThat creates variable that can hold the address of a int  It hasnt been initialized yet so it is kind of useless so lets take care of that    n  getnumberofelementsfiletxt    numbers  new int ngetnumberofelements is just some function you wrote to figure how how many numbers were in the file  Once you know that you can use new to ask your computer to set aside enough memory to hold n ints  It returns the address of this memory in the form of a pointer and you can use that pointer to access that memory    number                     Store  in the first location    number  sizeofint    Store  in the second location    number                  Cleaner notationThat is what pointers get you  By using addresses you can access data without having to explicitly declare it ahead of tiem,1,cdlnust,1rbx7c,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,0

AyCarrumba,Yes it is trueThere are certain genetic abnormalties that are carried by recessive genes  things like Downs syndrome sickle cell anaemia and gingerness What this means is that to suffer the condition both your mum and your dad must have carried the gene to pass it to you If you get the mutated gene from both parents you suffer the effects of the diseaseWhilst these genes are rare in the general population and so youd have to be unlucky for both parents to be carriers by chance if you interbreed within a family the chances of both parents being carriers of some defect or another is much higher Thanks to the small gene pool you are using you are MUCH more likely to have offspring that suffer genetic abnormalities,0,cdlnhkn,1rbylu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
daver,Im not a scientist but I understand that inbreeding is a bad idea because it increases the chance that negative genetic traits will be passed on to children A person can carry a recessive trait for say hemophilia without suffering from the disease and as long as their partner doesnt also have that recessive gene neither will their childrenIf two people who are closely related have children they are likely to both have the recessive gene and the  children have a greater chance to actually have the genetic condition instead of just being recessive carriers,0,cdlnkq5,1rbylu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
eideid,No as far as we can tell there is nothing about inbreeding which increases the likelihood of mutations but due to the way that genes actually activate inbreeding tends to result in children with a less diverse set of genes which can result in strange appearance and higher likelihood of rare inherited diseasesPeople recognize that severe inbreeding results in people who start appearing and behaving a bit differently from society and they often end up resulting in more sickly children after several generations The taboos and customs regarding inbreeding tend to be rather strong across cultures The idea that this is the result of mutations is due to the public having a poor understanding of how genes and mutations work and how this relates to different mating choices People know somethings up and they know it has to do with having kids with people you are closely related to and ignorance fills in the gaps,1,cdlnr6i,1rbylu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2
experiencednowhack,A good way to think about it is that we have billions of genes Not all combinations of genes are good as evidenced by genetic disorders In fact it is assumed that everyone has a few harmful recessive genes You dont suffer from them because you only have one copy IF you had two copies of the specific genes youd likely die The thing is which particular messed up gene you have tends to run in families So inbreeding tends to lead to an off spring with two of the harmful gene that you carry A rough example of this is Tay Sachs in Ashkenazi Jews Ashkenazi Jews are very genetically similar so when two Ashkenazi born Jews get together genetically they are about as close as th cousins there was a study on this a while back So theyre not inbreeding but they are genetically close enough that you get the same sort of effect where the harmful gene is Tay Sachs ,0,cdlqnnp,1rbylu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
Enlae,Breeding with a close relative makes it more likely recessive traits will become expressed These recessive traits are usually not expressed unless you get a copy from both parents So if a recessive trait runs in a family it will not manifest itself physically unless someone from that family marries another person with a recessive copy of the gene The chance of this increases dramatically if you were to marry a family member who is a carrier for the same recessive traits as yourselfSince European royal families liked to intermarry it has been suggested that some conditions like haemophilia emerged due to having a small gene pool,0,cdlot1w,1rbylu,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

panzerkampfwagen,Youre innocent until proven guilty because they cant just lock you up and throw away the key without a trial  At trial youre not supposed to be required to prove your innocence the state is supposed to show evidence that is supposed to be pretty damning as to your guilt  This is why a lot of defendants win their trials by their lawyer just saying Is that all they have  The defence rests and the jury going Yeah that was a pretty crap show by the prosecution  However the state has to balance your presumption of innocence before trial with the chance that you will run  This means that you may need to be put in jail a holding cell whatever until either bail is paid or the trial is concluded  ,0,cdlr273,1rc9db,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

InfiniteAmbiguity,Detachment more commonly called nonattachment is a very important quality in many Eastern spiritual and religious traditions as well as under many Ancient Greek and Roman philosophical schools  Many people believe that its an absolute necessity if you want to maintain happiness peace of mind tranquility and physical mental and emotional health  Many people spend years studying it meditating on it and practicing it  But I dont think it requires all of that for everyone  If you want to learn detachmentnonattachment start with reading the Upanishads Bhagavad Gita Zen works and commentaries the Vedas and commentaries Seneca Cicero and Marcus Aurelius  Those will get you started and lead you yo further useful study  The word emotion derives its meaning from the Greek word that means disturbance and many people think that emotions are hellish disturbances to remove Entire cultures throughout the centuries have focused on this as one of their primary life objectives and most valuable life achievements  Please note that words are very limiting in many all cases and are just symbols for real underlying things  So many people would define love and joy as emotions but most who practice detachmentnonattachment would say that true love and actual joy are fundamental qualities of just existing in your true essential nature and they have no opposites and therefore they are not emotions  ,3,cdltlep,1rchnt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10,7

MockRocDoc,As someone else here said the simple answer is that the roughness prevents enough surface contact to make a strong mechanical bond but there is also a deeper reason  Before getting to wood I will say that this does happen with some solid materials under the right conditions  Copper can friction weld to itself  Well polished metals can do this much more easily because of the type of bonds they form  Wood is a composite of strong bonds and weaker bonds  If you could sweep away the weak bonds you might be able to create strong bonds in their place  Think of firing ceramics  The water holds the clay together but if you heat it you drive the water out and eventually form strong bonds between the clay particles  There is more to it than that but it is a reasonable exampleI can be a little more specific about the bonds and why this is so difficult with wood  The strongest bonds in the wood are likely chains of carbon which have hydrogen on the sides of the chain  Hydrogen weakly bonds to water which also weakly bonds to itself  It would take a lot of energy to strip the water and hydrogen out which is mostly why this wont happen  However if you had too very flat pieces of wood with the right humidity they might stick to each other a bit not as strongly as if they were actually welded,17,cdmam38,1rcljv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,33,16

marmelukes,First off theyre solids Solids exist in a mostly or completely rigid state and they dont have a lot of free energy so theyre not good at forming new bonds quicklySecond theyre biological Biological bonds are not energetically favorable Your body expends serious amounts of energy to grow or even just maintain their form When you no longer have the energy to fight this entropy youre dead and you begin to decompose Decomposition is your chemical bonds breaking apart bit by bitTherefore two pieces of dead wood can not fuse without some sort of goofy process taking place Im not going to say its impossible but its not normalLiquids can only fuse because they are less rigid and have more free energy to form new bonds In water for instance the HO is constantly making and breaking bonds Forming H and H and switching back However if you sap energy from the system and turn that water into ice it forms a more rigid structure that is less capable of fusing,3,cdm5q85,1rcljv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,16,13

pnsmcgraw,Great question  It has to deal with a couple things  The first is something known as nascent surfaces which are basically surfaces that are too rough to allow a bonding to occur  The second is the existence of elements in the atmosphere that readily form oxide layers on most materials  So basically if the surfaces are extremely smooth very difficult to get and the atmosphere around the surfaces is very lacking of or does not contain elements to form an oxide layer you can get spontaneous bonding  If I remember correctly I saw this demonstrated with goldSource I am a welding engineer,12,cdm7hvt,1rcljv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,16,4
CoolStoryJohn,Think of it like this wood is made of atoms these atoms are connected together in layers This network of atomlayers forms each log  For the wood to fuse together you would need to somehow align each atom in each corresponding layer of each log such that they fit between each other like puzzle pieces  Since there are countless layers of atoms in each log you would need to do this for each and every single layer of both logs  Theoretically  possible  Practically  statistically  impossible  Gday mateEdit  Completely disregarding quantum effects on purpose  If youre interested in such considerations allow me to direct you to raskscience ,10,cdma6k4,1rcljv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,17,7

eideid,To begin the use of terms like liberal and conservative cause a lot of confusion when having serious discussions about politicsThe US tends to go through fairly long cycles of major political alignments Its political structure heavily favors two national parties which are each a coalition of various interests To hold such diverse interests together an important tactic is focusing less on what unites the party and more on why the opposing party would ruin everything making party defection a scary prospect for coalition membersThe US trajectory has been tending toward policies of social permissiveness combined with economic nonintervention since the end of World War II The most recent major political realignment occurred beginning in the mids and finalizing roughly with the election of Ronald Regan in  Since then both parties have been pushing their agenda where it agrees with the national trend and reluctantly retreating in areas which are in opposition to itAn econimically liberal socially conservative party would be economically interventionist against the trend and socially impermissive also against the trend Nonhispanic Catholics in the US are not a terribly reliable voting block with a great many being much more socially permissive or economically noninterventionist than official church doctrine Lowerclass hispanic Catholics tend to vote for the party which seems more authentic in supporting their inclusion in public life currently Democrats which doesnt require a party which agrees more completely with their full range of policy preferences,0,cdlvm8c,1rcp3d,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7,7

Izanagi,Well the idea is that when unstable uranium atoms break apart they release other particles that break apart along with some energy  When the energy is released it heats up a liquid that turns a turbine which generates power  At this point its basically like a traditional power station  However if the fuel is not properly cooled it can melt its casing and burn through the floor  The worstcase scenario here is if the radioactive waste seeps into the water table which would poison between tens of thousands to tens of millions of people,0,cdlys9f,1rcyn9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1
nwob,There are a few components to this question  Substances used in nuclear fuel are radioactive which means that they are unstable and their atoms gradually break down over time into lighter elements and other particlesWhen they do this some of their mass is changed straight into energy  The famous equation Emc describes this relationship  For every gram difference between the starting materials and the end materials in a nuclear reaction    joules are produced  Thats apparently about a seventh of the energy the average hurricane releases in a second which if you consider the size of a hurricane is quite a lot Its also the energy equivalent of eating  million mars barsThey do by releasing three different types of radiation  alpha beta and gamma  Alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons and are the same as the nucleus of a helium atom dont worry about that specifically but Im including it for completeness beta particles are electrons and gamma radiation is high frequency electromagnetic rays similar to visible light but much higher in energyAlpha beta and gamma radiation are called ionising and its this property that makes them dangerous  These tiny ionising particles can penetrate into our bodies and disrupt our cells most notably our DNA damaging them and potentially triggering cell death or cancer  Alpha particles are the most damaging but cant get through your skin  Beta particles sit somewhere in the middle and gamma particles are lowest energy but most penetrating  Were all constantly exposed to a small amount of background radiation but in concentrated doses it can lead to massive cell death and prolonged exposure generally leads to cancer,0,cdlyvp0,1rcyn9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1
Hiddencamper,Nuclear engineer hereIn nuclear fission we split uranium atoms When the atoms split they break apart and release energy which we use for boiling water to steam We then use the steam to make electricityFission occurs when a neutron hits a uranium atom When we split the atom we get more neutrons out to continue the reaction This is why it is called a chain reactionThe split uranium atom becomes  random smaller atoms These smaller atoms are usually radioactive Some of them are so radioactive that as they give off radiation they heat up everything around them similar to a microwaveThe split atoms are so radioactive that they are dangerous for humans They need to be constantly shielded Also they are so radioactive that they give off heat meaning that we need to keep cooling the reactor even after we shut it down otherwise this heat due to the radioactive waste breaking down will melt the core,0,cdm055c,1rcyn9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

bigfish,Theres been a ton of research on this and there are at least five big drivers Waste Price Insensitivity Technology Market Pressures and Regulation Something like  of our health spending is pure waste Well worse than pure waste because of the risk of negative outcomes hospital acquired infections death etc This can be from all kinds of things from outright fraud to doctors and systems simply covering their butts to doctors agreeing to treatments that patients asked for so they dont lose their future business If you understand supplydemand models I hope that you know a bit about price sensitivity There is an assumption of a downward sloping demand for healthcare services with respect to price paid higher cost gt less demand for it The trouble is that the payor is not the same as the recipient of the service and neither is the one who makes the recommendation Here the one that recommends the treatment is often the one who gets paid for doing things the doc the one who pays often just gets a bill for what has been done the insurer and the one who receives the service the patient just pays their copay  a cost that has little to do with the total price of the service A huge driver of costs is the arms race of the latest technology This has all kinds of drivers that are worth diving into  like our current patent and approvals process  but Ill leave that for the inevitable flood of comments The consequence is that doctors and health system spend a massive amount of money on new technology that patients demand that has little if any positive effect on outcomesIn terms of market structure there is massive fragmentation among providers And they are the ones who have to buy supplies Since there isnt one big purchaser of supplies including meds devices durable medical supplies etc and there are just a few major players for specialized and patented supplies the providers have little bargaining power to keep costs of supplies down The higher costs from less market power get passed on to customers Additionally consumers  patients  dont have any real power except through their insurers to keep costs down But if there exists a patients union let me knowFinally regulation It costs a lot of money to comply with all of the regulations This goes from staffing doctor training is massively expensive and heavily regulated to job designation there is generally a very welldefined scope where an individual can practice to required emergency care see EMTALA driving up the cost of bad debts and even to requirements related to safety These all cost a lot of money and those costs all get factored in when the providers set their prices With the general price insensitivity and lack of customer power these costs generally go straight through to increase the cost of careIts messy but those are the top  IMOMasters student in healthcare administration,5,cdlzx2j,1rd0ud,explainlikeimfive,top_week,34,29

Ahrius,A few reasons ERCOBRA Malpractice and MedicareBasically every so often the government decides that the reimbursement rate what the Dr takes home goes down by  Once this happens ALL the other insurances follow the same practiceIn the USA medicine is the ONLY profession that gets a GOVERNMENT MANDATED PAY CUT As a result doctors may try to compensate by ordering a more expensive test or doing an extra procedure becausea hes trying to be thorough for the sake of friendsfamilyb hes trying to be thorough so if something happens he cant be blamedc hes trying to put food on his table because the gov keeps cutting his payMalpractice is another huge issue  a physicians work can and will result in death sometimes The family wants to blame someone because thats more comforting than accepting that there was nothing else that could be done Doctors get sued left and right and if there happens to be a guilty verdict involved that doctors career is over Sure we pay insurance to cover this and technically its alright but no hospital will ever hire that doctor again Since death is involved the verdicts tend to be high in number so malpractice charges a lot As a result things cost more because doctors have bigger bills to payFinally COBRA law  if you walk into an ER you cannot be denied because of poverty So you get treated Something as small as a cold or requiring a multimillion dollar procedure you get treated But who eats the costThe hospitalThe cost of runningmaintaining machines ordering tests buying materials etc all goes to the hospital and they have to front the bill Thats why theres an issue with illegal immigrants Many illegal immigrants who do hazardous labor jobs get into accidents and go to the ER Illegal immigrants also have no insurance because theyre illegal so they visit the ER for everything Essentially hospitals pay for illegals to have free health care The hospital then passes that cost on to the insurance companies by raising the prices of their procedures The insurance then raises your premium to pay for the new prices TLDR  Malpractice COBRA and MEDICARE make it hard to be a doctorThats all Ive got so far,9,cdlzqy5,1rd0ud,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14,5

dvfw, Licensing  Medical schools pharmacies and hospitals are heavily licensed This drastically reduces supply of doctors and hospitals while demand increases leading to higher prices It also reduces competition leading to the same result Regulations  Burdening businesses with regulations forces them to increase the costs of their goods and often kills smaller competitors contributing further to monopolies An example is the FDA After the KefauverHarris Amendments to the FDA Act were singed in  and by  the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated  million  to  times as much as in the early s while development times had climbed from a couple of years to the better part of a decade These amendments also caused longer production times causing many deaths by making consumers have to wait for new drugs Prior to the KefauverHarris Bill of  the average time from the filing of an IND to approval was seven months By  however the average time to approval had increased to thirty months Time to approval continued to rise through the late s when on average a successful drug took more than ten years to get approved In the late s and s times to approval decreased somewhat but are still eight years on average far higher than in the s Subsidies  The US has heavily subsidized the sick  with for example Medicare and Medicaid  by providing them special benefits when they are sick Subsidies create more of whatever is being subsidized This encourages carelessness and dependency on government as opposed to responsibility and selfownership Also corn syrup a leading cause of obesity is subsidized heavily The worse health problems that result cause more demand for health care and higher costs Employerprovided insurance  When insurance is paid for by someone else  in this case the employers  customers are not likely to shop around for the best deals and they will overuse health services This increase in demand leads to higher costs Patents  Patents basically grant a monopoly on the production of a certain patented drug Monopolies as everyone knows lead to higher prices,0,cdmfbtn,1rd0ud,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

dampew,Magnetism in metals is caused by large numbers of electrons having their spins aligned in the same direction with few electrons in the opposing direction  This means that there must be  large numbers of unpaired electrons and  the interactions between unpaired electrons must be strong enough and of the right sign to cause large numbers of them to want to point in the same directionTo understand what I mean by paired and unpaired look up orbital filling and the pauli principle  Each orbital can have two electrons of opposite spin  If all orbitals are filled in this way there will be no net spin in the system  So you need an orbital with only one electron to create a net magnetic momentNot for  year olds but its a straightforward explanation I think,0,cdm708g,1rd10w,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
alex,Metals are made up of atoms as I hope you know to save further explanation atoms arent the smallest divisible unit but there are smaller particles called electrons neutrons and protons It just so happens that electrons have an intrinsic they just have it property called spin While you can visualize this as the electron spinning this isnt really whats happening but I feel that for this explanation we dont need to go any further This spin can be either   or  depending on which direction the spin is in A spin of  negates a spin of  The electrons in atoms populate atomic orbitals and the way they fill these orbitals depends on the aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principleWhen the electrons populate the orbitals in such a way that there are unpaired electrons left over As in some of the electrons dont have their spin of  or  negated then the material is paramagneticOn a side note not only are metals magnetic an example being dioxygen While not possible to see the magnetism in the gaseous phase due to the high kinetic energy of the oxygen molecules it is possible to see the magnetic properties of liquid oxygenHope this helps,0,cdm88vo,1rd10w,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

yellowsquare,In the US at least the reason why monetary compensation is not offered for whole blood donation is because money is too good of a reason to donate Many studies were conducted and long story short intravenous drug users were donating blood to get drug money The American Red Cross and other blood centers around the country do not want intravenous drug users to donate their blood because of the very high risk of those people having undiagnosed hepatitis or HIVPlasma centers like Biolife and CSL are allowed to offer monetary compensation because they use that plasma primarily for research purposes and isnt put into patients bodies usually Some parts of the plasma can be used for medical purposes but thats after being highly processed and screenedNow the next question you might ask is why dont blood centers just screen all the blood thats donated so they can still pay money The answer is they do but the national blood centers have decided to take this extra step to ward off potential high risk donors in order to build redundancy and therefore security in the field of blood banking Taking someones blood and putting it into someone elses body is a dangerous process and the entire system from donor to recipient is layered with redundancy in an attempt to make the process as safe as possible for recipientsTLDR Money attracts undesirable candidates Asking people to donate from their own desire to help others is ultimately safer for patients receiving transfusions,5,cdm634m,1rd4v6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,21,16

sirsri,In WW the US was a natural strategic competitor to Britain and much of the population was german or Irish so they didnt even like Britain  So in WW the US stayed out as long as it could because it was playing both sides  The Royal Navy dominated the oceans of the word so trade meant going to the UK or France or allies  in return for money that way while they were bleeding themselves fighting germany and the US could still buy technology and that sort of thing from Germany without needing much direct physical trade  Then Germany made clear just how far they were willing to go to win  that included being willing to Ally with Mexico against the US and roll the US back to the pre  borders  They were also willing to shoot anything that might be shipping arms to the UK  That wasnt acceptable so the US got involved because if it didnt americans were going to get killed selling stuff and if the Germans won there could conceivably be a massive extremely powerful and dangerous german army liberating a huge portion of the westernsouth western US  In WW the situation was similar but different  The US had massive financial interests in germany including significant loans to the german government and banks and largely correctly felt that France had to some degree brought this upon themselves  The problem was that germany was sinking US ships even when  the US was neutral and Japan was threatening US interests in the Pacific  although the JapanChina thing could easily have gone the other way and China allied with Germany and Japan on the allied side  Most of the western countries didnt really like the soviets and so given the choice letting the germans and soviets beat the hell out of each other seemed  like it wasnt such a bad plan  Particularly for the US who could scavenge the remnants of the british and French empires at the end of it  In both cases the US was involved whether it wanted to be or notThen came the end of the war and the breakup of british and French Empires  The soviets were happy to communist up any state willing to join them which left a problem for the US  The US needs customers and resources and the soviets where going to eat up future customers  and supplies of resources  If it hadnt been involved in the world it would have essentially handed most of the worlds supply of oil and rubber and potential customers for cars and aircraft to the soviets  That would have been problematic And so it is today  The US is big and richand depends on large swathes of the world to buy its cars an computers and airplanes and other swathes of the world to make it cheap socks and sell it oil and whatever else it needswants  The relative balance of power in the world has changed too  In  the US was the third or th largest country depending on how you count the Soviet union but it only had about x the population of the UK or France  Today thats more like   So the relative state of the world means that the US is  proportionally much larger than it was compared to other developed powers  some of the poor countries have grown a great deal faster than the US pakistan bangladesh brazil lots  of africa but  they are not yet capable of securing trade lanes or defending other countries   And therein lies the problem the US very much depends on stability in the world so does most everyone else but now the US is so big it pretty much has to be involved because the list of options  to do it without the US is quite limited  Europe aims to challenge the US as a global power while at the same time being an ally  that would let the US take on a lesser more cooperative role but unfortunately the EU cant organize  itself out of a paper bag   gtmore often than not when their presence was neither needed nor ultimately helpfulWhile that was true in Iraq round  that was an exception rather than a rule  The US has been needed in a lot of conflicts Korea somalia vietnam Iraq round Kuwait Columbia the Balkans etc  Even if you correctly think the way the US handled some of those things was utter incompetence and made things worse it had legitimate interest in trying to be there  Trying to do the right thing is a lot easier than actually doing the right thing  There are also lots of places the US has been needed where it hasnt gone most notably Syria where it appears Assad and his Iranian and Russian backers are going to win  That lack of intervention may be based on the probably correct assessment that the US would just fuck it up but that doesnt mean it wouldnt have served US interests to have had the FSA take over  years ago  ,1,cdm54ww,1rd72u,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

thelozer,As far as I know the philosophy behind homeopathy is that whatever causes illness in a healthy person will cure an ill person so if your illness is caused by a large dose of some poison a much smaller dose of the same poison will cure you Homeopathic remedies are solutions that have been diluted to such an extreme that they contain not a single molecule of the supposed active ingredient Now the original homeopaths knew very little about atoms and molecules and hence that their dilution practices are somewhat extreme but modern homeopaths have attempted to solve this by proposing water memory which always reminds me of a line from Tim Minchins StormhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvHhGuXCuDbU sarcastically Water has memory And while its memory of a longlost drop of onion juice is infinite it seems to forget all the poo its had in itThe fact that homeopathic preparations have no active ingredient molecules in them is the reason homeopathy is widely considered quackery And yes people have been put in jail for denying or dissuading people from proper medical care in favor of it,2,cdm21ed,1rd99h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,7
AmerigoVesa,Homeopathy was invented when what we consider to be real medicine was just getting started Back then most things that a doctor did for you would kill you Homeopathy became popular because it did not hurt you and you might get better anyway if you let things run their course It is based on the idea that something which mimicked the symptoms of a disease could cure it For example if eating a certain kind of toad caused a person to break out in hives and develop a fever that would be the thing which cured a disease that had the symptoms of fever and hives But the new thing here was that it wasnt the thing itself that did the cure it was the energy of the thing That is why you had to put the thing in water shake it a special way then keep diluting it the water remembered the thing and that is what cured you What you had left by the time all the diluting and shaking was over was basically pure water This would cure you only in the sense that it would keep you away from a doctor long enough for a disease to run its course so maybe you could surviveDo not confuse herbal medicine and homeopathy While there are a lot of problems with so called herbal remedies they are at the very least based on the idea that some active ingredient in a plant or whatever could counter act a disease A good example of this is willow bark which led to aspirin Homeopathy by its very nature can not work that way because it has been diluted past the point where any of the original ingredient is left ,1,cdm2etc,1rd99h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,3

bunkerman,The short version is that western countries decided they need to let in more immigrants and eastern ones didnt In part this can be traced to America since America was always built on immigrants flooding into it to build it up since the times of its creation So western countries having a tie to America kind of internalized this we need immigrants mentality where as other places generally still do not want too many That and of course after WWII they wanted to strongly divert from anything that seemed like a racist policy,1,cdmc214,1rdmbt,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1

daveisnotafk,TFSAs and RRSPs do have similarities and differences I assume youre CanadianLets talk about RRSPsRRSP stands for Registered Retirement Savings Plan Basically these are more or less savings funds that you set up before you retire in hopes of creating an income stream for yourself in the future thus by converting it to a RRIF income fund How it works is that you are taking money out of your earnings and putting it away until you retire Any money you put away then gets deducted from how much you earn in a year So for example say you made  this year and youve put  into your RRSP The government will tax your income as if youve only made  Pretty neat huh By doing that you have the opportunity to put money into an investment free of taxes allowing it to grow yet again free of taxes until you retire Once you hit a certain age  I believe its   youre essentially too old to maintain an RRSP so youd have to move your funds into whats called an RRIF registered retirement income fund Once you have your RRIF you can start withdrawing the money youve saved all your life and pay tax on those withdrawls So if you can deduct so much money from your income tax doesnt it make sense to put away   of your annual income in an RRSP so you can enjoy awesome tax breaks Nope Doesnt work quite like that Every year the government sets a limit as to how much you can put away in your RRSP Its about kk double confirm with your bank or financial advisor CAD or up to  of your income Now not everyone can afford to put away that much money so the money that they didnt put away the year before carries away to the next year So say if the limit last year was  and you put away  you still have  limit that can carry forward to next year If the limit next year is  you can put up to  plus your previous years left over limit total  If its your first time buying a home you can take up to  from your RRSP in a program set up called the home buyers plan It allows you to take a taxfree loan from your RRSPs as long as you pay it back within  years This helps you put towards a down payment on a home for yourself If youre in a bind and you need money right away any money you take out from an RRSP will get taxed as added income So say if you needed cash and you took  out of your RRSP and your annual income is  you will be taxed on  worth of income nasty RRSPs are good because they can help you reduce your tax rate if you contribute enough TFSAsTFSAs are a new invention that allows you to invest pretaxed dollars allowing it to grow taxfree Theres no limit as to how much you can put because the money you put in has already been taxedHow has the money been taxed already Simple When you file your annual income taxes any income you make is subject to your marginal tax rate the rate at which you pay taxes based on your income level The government is allowing you to deposit money and letting it grow tax free The cool part about this is that since youve already paid your taxes the withdrawls are tax free What about the fees for managing a TFSA Most banks have whats called zero load or no fee accounts that you can open They are no fee and also offer low interest rates If you go with a higher end fund with another fund company you may be charged a DSC deferred sales charge based on the provisioning of the fund for a set term before it becomes free In the sense of a bank though its pretty much zero fees Theres other things to consider too such as MERs management expense ratios if youre going with a fund that requires a higher degree of management but like I said if its at a bank its not likely youll incur those expenses Last thing to note RRSPs and TFSAs are not some off the shelf product you can just go out and buy Most people are mislead to believe that you just go get an RRSP or get a TFSA It doesnt work like that RRSPs and TFSAs are merely CONTRACTS WITH RULES THAT YOU FOLLOW A financial institution be it a bank or investment firm can offer RRSP or TFSAs on ANY of their funds be it a savingschequing account a bond a GIC money market fund mutual fund  virtually anything For example Person As RRSP is based on a GIC Person Bs RRSP is based on a mutual fund Same goes for TFSAs Sorry for the wall of text ,0,cdm6uzm,1rdnyk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

diMario,It is a bit different than that In normal physics when you dont measure something you dont know the value of whatever it was that you did not measureWhen you do decide to measure the value you observe the system you find one single value You deduce that it did have that particular value all along even at the time when you hadnt measured it yet Furthermore when you repeat the measurement you expect to find that exact same value no matter how often you measure it Within tolerances of accuracyIn quantum physics this is not the case You can make measurements and each time you measure something the outcome can be one of several possible values The first measurement yields  the second and third measurement yield  and the fourth measurement yields  again You cannot know in advance what value will be measured only that it will be one of several distinct values that follow a certain statistical distributionThis phenomenon is explained by assuming that before the measurement the quantum physical system has several different values for the same quantity at the same time In quantum physic speak we say that the system can be in different states at the same time We do not know what state it is in until we make a measurement observe the system and as we make more measurements we will find different values grouped according to some statistical distributionNow the experiment involving Schrampoumldingers cat says that a certain elementary particle has or has not decayed during a certain time If it has the cat is poisoned if it hasnt the cat lives Because it is a quantum physical system we say that the two states decayed particlenot decayed both exist at the same time for the system This translates into the cat being both dead and alive at the same time prior to the measurement Only after observing the system one would find that the cat is either dead or aliveHere is the wikipedia article on this experimenthttpenwikipediaorgwikiSchrCBdingerscat,1,cdm71cf,1rdonn,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,3

ScenarioEditor,Wiki sectionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiTheoryofsolarcellsCelltemperatureSo your run of the mill solar panel works because the electrons in the silicon are separated into two layers There is a bottom layer of electrons with the silicon itself the valence band a layer of no electrons band gap and a top layer of electrons that move around conduction band A photovoltaic cell works be having a photon light particle come in and give its energy to an electron in the lower layer so that it can jump from the inner layer over the layer of nothing and into the top layer where the electron can move around and essentially create a current This is also why silicon  is called a semi conductor because it conducts in some situation and insulates in others Now that band gap the layer of nothing is partially dependent on temperature Temperature is sort of like the average energy of all the electrons the majority of which are in the lower valence band A higher temperature means that they will have a bit more energy and the band gap will be smaller so youll get more current out of your cell which is good Bandgap has its fingers in many pies though and changing the temperature is changing the bandgap Changing the bandgap will change the highest possible voltage that the circuit can have Higher temperatures end up having lower maximum voltagesThis graphhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiFileIVCurveTpng pretty much explains what happens with temperature Higher temperatures mean higher current and lower maximum voltage The voltage rapidly decreases though so you can think of it as either on or off and so youd generally want higher temperatures At any rate the effect is fairly marginal editI wrote this on the fly so I can reword things if it is confusing ,1,cdm7yku,1rdpsh,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,3

MCHaker,A credit card isnt actually a necessity though it is usually one of the first things that come to mind when people think about credit in general There are a lot of ways to build your credit from paying bills on time leasing a car or renting a home from an agency that reports to credit bureaus As you mentioned though the initial step while purchasing or leasing something is usually a credit check Another good way to build credit is to take out loans for which you have the assetscash on hand to immediately pay back It is good to have a somewhat substantial payment history but you can pay them back right away just be sure there are no early repayment fees I believe you are asking why is having credit better than having no credit history at all while assuming that if you have no credit history you are not living beyond your means and can afford what you want to purchase The problem with that is that businesses such as banks have no way of knowing whether or not it is actually you that is the responsible party funding your lifestyle Many people rely on parents or whoever for money so giving a mortgage for example to someone who is perhaps relying on someone else for money or at least cant prove a reliable track record for making payments on time would be an irresponsible business practice and would almost surely result in financial loss In summary if you can afford what you want to buy and that object is a house buy the house out right and do not take a mortgage out That shows that you cant afford the house but you can afford a mortgage I would break it down more but Im on a phone and thats pretty much the gist of it,0,cdmf4zn,1ree66,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

rearviewclouds,The short answer is noThe longer answer is way longer than this post but it starts something like this You hit the nail on the head with one of the reasons  transplant surgery is major  there are risks involved with all elements of the surgery   anaesthetic the laparotomy  ie it is open surgery and the surgery is technically difficult and fiddly To be allowed to donate your kidney in the first place you must be in sufficiently good renal and otherwise health to operate on just the one  essentially you are pretty much perfectly healthy just with one kidney Thus there is no need to subject a healthy person to the risks of a major operationanaesthetic and the challenges of post op recovery infections blood clots pneumonia etc etc  Another big reason is that organs need a blood supply to survive and decay starts as soon as the blood supply is lost  In transplant surgery there are strict time limits for taking organs out of a donor and being put into a recipient Sooner is better After a certain time the organs undergo irreversible changes that mean they wont be able to usefully operate even if they were put back in another person   Organs are put on ice until they are ready to be plugged into the donor which limits the rate of decay of the organs but damage from a lack of blood supply is always inevitable Google things like cold ischemic time and warm ischemic time for further detailsEssentially most of the donors are patients in ICU environments who are brain dead  They are on life support which means that machines have taken over the job of keeping the airway open and providing oxygennutrition to the body Blood is still pumping around their body getting to the organs kidneys liver heart lungs etc  but not the brain  So the kidneys are still alive and working and are suitable to be put into someone else During the transplant retrieval operation this blood supply is cut and the organs are removed Ultimately the donor dies during the donation surgery Clearly this is a huge thing to consider for the donors loved ones  one of the many reasons organ donation is such a complex area The other main scenario is a live donor situation such as you are talking about  where the donor has an operation to retrieve the organ  thus normal blood supply is maintained right until the operation to donateSo in our scenario  it would be technically possible to get your kidney back if the person you gave it to became brain dead in an ICU type environment But you would be doing fine without itOrgan transplantation is a huge and complex topic  this is only the beginning of the explanation The ethicalspiritual side is also fascinatingsource  work in a transplant centre ,12,cdmi3a5,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,29,17
anubisofq,Unfortunately no  When your kidney goes into the recipient their body immediately starts attacking it  Doctors do some testing to help reduce the amount of damage host does to the donor kidney HLA typing but it doesnt check for everything which is why transplant patients are placed on immunosuppressive medications medications that reduces the immune system of the host Those drugs are also toxic to the kidneys as well  So its a balance between drug toxicity and immunosuppression  Thus the kidneys will undergo damage and over a period of years will become dysfunctional people with transplants do not return to normal lifeexpectancy it is just temporarily elongated  Longterm causes of mortality of people who undergo transplantation will be that they either die of the infections secondary to immunosuppression diseases secondary to the cause of the original disease requiring the transplant or kidney failure from drug or host damage  so in the end the risk of the surgery does not outweigh getting the kidney back  You would be hardpressed to find a surgeon who would be willing to do the surgery  Now i do remember an article published awhile back that stated that a transplanted kidney was retransplanted into another patient who needed it not back to the donor because the cause of death was irrelevant to the kidney itself  The first host also had the kidney for a short period of time But this would be the exception rather than the ruleEdit clarification of details and sentence fragments,10,cdmn3fj,1rehjd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,26,16

Fairleee,The default position for humanity on any topic is do nothing If there is a particular problem that needs to be tackled you need to somehow motivate enough humans that instead of defaulting to doing nothing they do something We can see this on a microlevel Im sure a lot of kids dont want to go to school theyd rather stay at home this is the do nothing option The aim is to get them to go to school ie do something So how do you do this A combination of carrot and stick you promise them both long and short term benefits that going to school offers long term includes better jobs and therefore standard of living resulting from an education short term includes seeing their friends being offered activities that they enjoy such as music sport or drama etc and have both long and short term punishments in place if they dont go missing out on education harms their future education and career prospects repeated absence increases likelihood of social services getting involved absence results in discipline from parents in whatever form  being grounded etc The end result is the kids are motivated to go to school because doing something will yield a net positive result both in terms of rewards and by not being punished compared to doing nothingWhen it comes to climate change the science is agreed that humanity is having an effect on the climate and this effect will likely to be detrimental to humanity of course we arent going to destroy the planet but we can make it far far harder for humans to live on But as with anything our default position is do nothing So we need politicians business leaders societal leaders religious leaders etc to take a stance that something needs to be done in order to motivate us to do something rather than do nothing Unfortunately the things we need to do are pretty hard  it would involve massive reductions in the amount of fossil fuels we use widespread curbing of CO emissions by factories and vehicles major investment in green technologies Furthermore we arent likely to see the benefit from this for some time so it is hard to motivate people with promises of future benefits without some shortterm immediate benefits Of course the benefits will be there  less air pollution better designed cities disruptive technological development etc but this is years down the line In the meantime there will be a cost to pay You know how much we like to buy cheap things Put in place carbon reduction requirements for business and those cheap things will get a lot more expensiveHowever these issues are not insurmountable if we have a consistent message from societys leaders that they are necessary Unfortunately there is entrenched opposition to this from people who are benefitting from the statusquo and dont want to see it changed looking at you Big Oil They are responsible for putting out two messages firstly that there is not sufficient evidence that the problem exists which isnt true and secondly that the cost of it will massively outweigh the benefits They use a number of techniques including exploiting peoples wellknown propensity for conspiratorial thinking by suggesting that all academics are part of some shadowy plot designed to pull the wool over the worlds eyes in order to continue receiving funding FYI the amount of funding that goes into climate change research is nothing compared to the oil industrys annual revenues People who oppose the human cause of climate change dont try to disprove humancaused climate change and dont need to  besides they cant But by muddying the waters by insisting on the need for further research that the evidence isnt there that models climate researchers users have some flaws the general public does not have the education they need on climate change and therefore there is not enough impetus to do something Because the people arent demanding that something be done politicians business leaders etc dont need to do something Yes there are calls to do something by a number of groups and some things are being done Germany for example is massively investing in green energy but there isnt sufficient will to carry through on a broad enough scale to make the changes that are neededTLDR people prefer to do nothing and if you want them to do something you need to motivate them to There isnt enough motivation,0,cdmja95,1rehy4,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,4

rixross,Bankers bundled mortgages together and sold them to investors these were called mortgage backed securities or MBSs The rating agencies rated them AAA the same rating as bonds issued by the US Government due to the fact that each MBS has mortgages from all over the country The models that the rating agencies used assumed that there would not be a general decline in home prices across the country Its actually more complicated than that because what the bankers really did was bundle together hundreds of mortgages and then they separated it into different securities in a process called traunching In essence the security was split into several layers all the losses would be born by the riskiest layer first then the second riskiest layer then the third etc In order for the final layer to have any losses every single other layer would have to be wiped out Those layers were rated AAA by the rating agencies even if the underlying mortgages were crap for instance if the owner of the house doesnt even have a jobThe problem was that everyone assumed these securities were safe so banks would hold them as Capital or the cushion used to absorb possible losses These securities turned out to be pretty much worthless and many banks found themselves essentially bankrupt There is even more to this as AIG and other banks sold Credit Default Swaps on these traunches of mortgage This was essentially insurance that said If the homeowner doesnt pay you I will The sellers of this insurance had to pay up and nearly went bankrupt or would have if the government didnt bail them outThe question is however why did all this happen Some people would blame it on greed but that would be like blaming an airplane crash on gravity cant claim that analogy as my own In my opinion it was the housing bubble that caused the crisis as banks and potential home buyers thought that prices could never go down and therefore all the investments described above were extremely safe So why the housing bubble In my opinion we printed an astronomical amount of money that ended up being funneled into the home building sector,9,cdmmfr7,1rewgh,explainlikeimfive,top_week,11,2

BrooklynLaw,In a nutshell the producer is the person who creates and composes the elements of the song that you remember most ie the melody and overall sound of the song the hook or chorus the beat etc  There are a lot of great rappers out there who dont have good music to rap over  Kanye West may not be the best rapper out there but his songs sound good to most people and they sound good because he produced them  Hes produced lots of songs for other rappers like JayZ  If you were more interested in the role of a rap producer in general basically most producers will start off with either a sample of music or a general drum beat and build a song around it  A sample is a snippet from another artists song that is altered in a way to incorporate it into a new original song  Take Kanyes song Gold Digger he started with a sample of Ray Charless I Got a Woman and incorporated it into the song by looping it and laying it over a beat  He created the drum beat in a similar fashion using sampled drum sounds but he likely didnt sample those himself  Many producers can buy large batches of drum sounds as well as other instrument sounds from independent sample libraries  If you gave  music producers the same sample from Ray Charles I Got a Woman they may end up making  very different songs of which chances are youd end up liking Kanye Wests the most  Just like giving  chefs the same ingredients chances are the best chef will create the tastiest meal  Its a shame that the man is in nonmusic ventures an idiot,0,cdmq8fe,1rewia,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

afcagroo,At the lowest level almost it runs due to the actions of transistors Transistors in digital logic circuits are used mostly as switches You want the transistors to be either all the way OFF no current flow or all the way ON lots of current flow And you can use the output of one transistor to control the input of other transistors so you can construct a complicated circuit by wiring them up in certain ways  Using just a few transistors you can build very simple logic circuits to implement binary digital logic called Boolean logic after the guy who invented it     For example imagine a light bulb hooked up to a battery through a switch Switch on light on switch off light off Now imagine that there are two switches in a row A and B The light is only on if A and B are both in the on position This is what a digital logic AND gate does If you hook the switches up differently you can just as easily make an OR gate A OR B turns on the light Label a switch backwards and you have a NOT gate    It turns out that you can build any digital logic function with a combination of just a few simple circuit types such as ANDORNOT you can actually do everything with just one but no one really does that By combining those simple circuits more complicated circuits can be made such as an adder a multiplexer etc You can use those circuits to make even more complicated ones Like a CPU  Its like if you had a bunch of little Lego blocks and you could use those to make larger Lego blocks and you could then use those to make even larger Lego blocks and so on Todays integrated circuits use more than a billion transistors to make something that is very complex but it is built up out of very simple things Transistors are great for building these things because they are small fast reliable cheap and dont use a lot of power These are all important properties when you are trying to make something that uses a billion or more devices    After youve built a bunch of different chips and put them into packages you solder those packages onto a Printed Circuit Board such as a PC motherboard The PCB has copper traces on it that act like flat wires to connect things together It is cheaper simpler better performance and more reliable to use a PCB to do this rather than a bunch of individual wires It even has many layers and connection vias going between layers or clear to the other side of the PCB So now you can connect up different chips that do different functions like CPU memory graphics etc  They talk to each other via the traces on the PCB according to certain predetermined rules called protocols Kind of like the circuits these protocols are built up in layers with the lowest level protocol defining what signals mean  and what signals mean  These protocols get pretty complicated and allow the different components to pass very complex information back and forth   The different parts of the PC have different functions with the CPU acting kind of as the main brain and control center It gets program instructions and data sent from the hard disc to the memory and then to it manipulates the data as dictated by the stream of instructions and sends data out to where it is needed But the CPU does what it does according to the digital logic that has been built into it       Now that everything can pass binary information around and do things with it what remains are ways to represent information and describing how to do things to it The latter is where programming comes into the pictureprograms describe eventually at the binary level how to manipulate information that is in digital form  And pretty much everything can be digitized more or less A sound can be measured very very rapidly turning its waveform into a series of numbers An image can be represented as many rows and columns of tiny dots each one having a color and intensity and each of those colors and intensities represented by numbers And numbers can be represented in binary so that digital logic can do things with ittransform it transmit it etc ,4,cdmn634,1rf8u9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,66,62

sterlingphoenix,As others have mentioned police do often carry nonlethal meansBut when they fire a gun when they pull a trigger the mentality has to be I am trying to kill someone Why Because pulling a trigger is the ultimate extreme measure It is absolutely not to be taken lightly You dont shoot a gun to disarm a person or scare someone or hurt them just a bit Guns are lethal and they should be thought of as such And avoided whenever possibleNow as to why were seeing a lot of reports of police shooting people sometimes excessively well there are a few factors to that First theres the whole thing where the news isnt going to report Police today did not shoot a suspect Im pretty sure there are dozens of nonlethal police interactions a day Or hour Or minute depending on where you live I read the police blotter for where I live and theres occasionally a chase but thats it and yes I am in the US  Second yeah there does seem to be a rise in the shoot first ask questions later mentality But the thing about that is being a police officer is dangerous If they go into a dangerous situation theyre going to react to it that way and be ready to defend themselves I dont know that we want to send police into those kind of situations and train them that its better for them to get killed by a maniac than to shoot someone they perceive as a threat And police officers probably feel threatened a lot Obviously Im no expert but Id assume some combination of better training and people not being stupid ie making toy guns look real would reduce this kind of stuff ,0,cdmxl67,1rfelk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

BrooklynLaw,When the United States was made there was a lot of differences between the states as there still is today  So in order to preserve those differences the Constitution made a list of things that would be controlled on a federal national basis and let the states make up the rules for everything else The federal government is in theory a limited government with all of its powers spelled out in the Constitution  Any power not described in the Constitution is reserved to the states  For instance the Constitution says that the federal government can declare war against another country  Alabama cannot declare war because this ability is specifically given to the federal government under the Constitution  Conversely the Constitution does not list in the powers of the federal government the ability to generally police the population for crimes  This is why you have  different rape laws and no federal definition of rape  Alabama may have a different age of consent than what Maine wants  There are tons of differences but the fact that the federal government cannot do whatever it wants is the reason why there are  state constitutions with state legislatures making different laws  This is also the reason why some federal laws are occasionally declared unconstitutional because the Constitution specifically limits Congresss power to make laws in certain areas  The preservation of limited federal powers to the benefit of the states is to make the states experimental labs for different policies  New York has much harsher gun laws than Florida and policy makers can look at the results of those different laws in deciding how to move forward  The wikipedia article is very focused on the specific cases that expanded and contracted the dual federalism principle and this could be confusing  But all you need to know is that the Constitution spells out the federal governments legislative powers which are limited and anything not spelled out in the Constitution could then be legislated by the states or the people  One more thing the supremacy clause is important because it says that federal laws trump state or local laws  So in areas where the federal government can legislate if a state makes a conflicting law the federal law trumps the state law  A state is allowed to make supplementary laws that go beyond what a federal law says so long as it is not in conflict  For instance the United States congress passed the Civil Rights Act of  to protect certain minority groups  Many states have their own civil rights laws that mirror the federal law but also include additional protected groups  This is fine so long as it doesnt conflict with a federal law or the constitution  If you have more questions about the actual cases in the Wikipedia article let me know  The cases are pretty interesting in learning how we got from a very very limited government to a much less limited one today but if you are just interested in the basic concepts the article could definitely be confusing  ,0,cdmqnzs,1rfhr6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

aeo,As with almost all foreign policy pronouncements you should consider what audience is being targeted and what the speakers incentives are  In this case there are good strategic incentives for IsraelNetanyahu to appear hardline on this dealFirst Netanyahus domestic political situation is dependent on him being seen as hardline on Iran  He has staked his reputation on this position and so whatever deal was agreed to he has to appear more hardline than that  So even if he actually thinks that this is a good deal or a step along the way to a good deal good in terms of what Iran would eventually accept he has to publicly appear pissed off using OPs language  Second there is the international audience  The P negotiators from the United States Britain China Russia France and Germany will be able to get a better deal from Iran if they can point to a hardline Israel stance and say to Iran Look look at the pressure we are under here  If you dont want Israel to reject the deal and maybe unilaterally bomb your nuclear facilities you are going to have to give a better deal  The P negotiators also seem more reasonable and moderate next to a hardline Israel  In addition to strategic incentives there is a thing called fundamental attribution error  Briefly this is a psychological phenomenon that all humans are subject to to some extent where you think that you are a good person and forced to do bad things by your environment but other people do bad things because they are bad people  So even though Israelis trust themselves to only use their nuclear weapons defensively they think that Iran would use nuclear weapons offensively even if that means effectively committing suicide through nuclear retaliation  This means that they are far more concerned about ensuring Iran doesnt have nuclear weapon capabilities than is reasonablerational  These are the most basic and plausible explanations for why Israel is pissed off with the Iran Nuke deal  There are other possibilities but they are more complicated,37,cdmr9r4,1rfnff,explainlikeimfive,top_week,178,141

TheRockefellers,The wildcat offense is an offensive formation in American football  Its a singlewing formation meaning that most of the linemen and backs line up on one side of the center  In the wildcat formation the ball is snapped usually to a running back usually to rush the ball with an option to pass The QB lines up at a different position or may not even be present at all In some trickier iterations of the wildcats the ball may be snapped to any one of  players which keeps the defense on its toesOne of the big advantages of the wildcat is that it effectively gives you more men on a rushing play In a typical running play the QB receives the snap and hands it off to the running back then just kind of watches instead of blocking By snapping to the RB directly you cut the QB out of the equation and have more boots on the ground to block or if the RB elects to pass you have another receiver,0,cdmrq6m,1rfnrq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6,6

strOkePlays,Oh god this is almost not an ELI concept because you must have the concepts of math and logic available and no amount of simplifying will change thatWith that said here goes There are two main kinds of encryption symmetric and asymmetricEveryone knows symmetric if you put a password on a Word document thats symmetric encryption The password encrypts it the same password decrypts it Useful but vulnerable to a lot of things including someone else finding out the passwordAsymmetric which public key encryption is the bestknown example doesnt use a password It uses keys The relationship between the keys is simple and straightforward they do the opposite of each otherThere are two things you want to do to a document encrypt it or make it unreadable and decrypt it or make it readable again In symmetric encryption the password does both tasks In public key encryption you have two keys and each does one at a time and only one at a time of those operations If you use Key A to encrypt a document you cant use Key A to decrypt it it wont work You can only use Key B to decrypt it And vice versa if you encrypt with Key B then only Key A will decrypt Never ever ever can you use just one key to do both thingsSo smart people worked out that if you keep one of the keys secret or Private and expose the other key to everyone or Public you can accomplish two cool things You can invite people to send you secret things They encrypt with your Public key and the encrypted file is safe The public key cant do both things at once if you use it to encrypt its useless to decrypt So any sneaky spy bastards can steal the encrypted file but they cant decrypt it only the other key the Private key can do that You can send out messages encrypted with your private key The message is NOT secret because the public key is public Anyone can decrypt it But that public key can only decrypt things coded by the private key so they know its from you And remember it cant do both things If they change your message and try to encode it again with the public key well that public key cant then decode it it can never do both things so everyone knows its not from you This is the basis for electronic signatureNow as for how does it actually work there are two answers logic and math The logic answer is there are some problems that are very easy to solve but very hard to unsolve we call these oneway functions The simplest classic case is prime factoring theres a fantastic little algebra equation that lets you do a cool trick with prime numbers Its very easy to multiply  x  and get  But because  and  are prime numbers they are the ONLY numbers that divide evenly into  Its challenging for a human to look at  and realize its  x  Its even challenging for a computer though computers are so fast theyd bruteforce it instantlyWhen you start looking at numbers like  and wondering what two numbers it factors into it gets daunting for a human though a computer still doesnt care Where the computer cares is when the number looks like  and you have to figure out what two numbers it factors into even computers start sweating And numbers get much bigger than thatEven so were getting too good at teaching computers to do it and quantum computers will practically spit out the answer so we are finding other oneway functionselliptic curves for instance are very promisingId add links but a other posters have already done so and b there is absolutely no such thing as ELI for the actual math Good luck,0,cdmwhjz,1rfri7,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

sirsri,gtWhy has technology developed so quickly in the last  years in comparison to the last  yearsExplainedThe short answer is that it hasntnew technologies come out and theres a period of exceptionally rapid growth where it goes from a parlour trick to a major technology and then it settles into a long period of slow progressAircraft went from from a rickety pile of wood that was more likely to kill you than get you from point A to point B to a something actively used in serious combat in about  years   years later and you had aircraft that sort of looked like todays commercial aircraft though with propellers rather than jets  Then jets caught on and there was another burst of development and then weve had  years of progress but not rapid leaps and bounds  Metal ships are something similar the first iron ships started showing up around the s with varying degrees of metalsteamwoodsail  By  there was a  tonne ironclad sea going warship HMS Warrior  Shes still afloat at Portsmouth in the UK if you ever go there  By  Titanic the biggest ships were almost   tonnes  Thats absolutely huge progress but since today we regularly build ships over k it doesnt seem like such a big deal  But that was tremendously rapid progress especially considering how long it takes to build huge ships and make ports and for them  The first hot air balloon was basically a death trap  Within  years they were dropping bombs with it eventually they were the size of an aircraft carrier and could carry a couple of dozen passengers across oceans  Then they were replaced by heavier than air aircraft What happens is that engineering and innovation catch up to science  The underlying principles of most of what goes on in microprocessors is EampM and Quantum mechanics weve had those understood pretty well for the better part of  years but the microprocessor didnt really take off until the s  So its rapidly catching up to the limits of our understanding of the science and in  years or well probably start to hit a wall where you cannot make a microprocessor based on traditional semiconductor physics work any better  Someone will figure out how to build a quantum computer well have a race to reach the limits with that and then it will be slow marginal improvements for a while Certainly things like the printing press the telegraph the telephone the internet all speed up communication and speed up development and there are a lot more people alive than there were at any previous point in history word pop in  was about  billion for the first time by  it was like  by  it was about  billion  so there are a lot more scientists doing a lot more science with much better tools  But technology tends to go through spurts and things we think of as unchanged for ages started out as some ridiculous magic trick or gimmick then someone had a revelation about what you could do and that rapidly progressed to something and then did very little for a while  One of the common questions here is why do batteries suck and microprocessors increase so rapidly  Well between  and  batteries went from being a misunderstood lab experiment to an actual technology people understood and could use  Basically from the first battery in  until the mid s no one had a clue what was going on  Then someone figured it out made better batteries that actually worked and could be improved on reliably  By  we had lead acid batteries which are still in use in cars and the technology basically went unchanged from  until    From  to  there were huge advances and then many decades of very incremental progress  Expect something similar with lots of the tech you see as so incredibly awesome from the last  years  ,0,cdn2cna,1rg58k,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

matingslinkys,One of the issues with antidepressants is the order in which they can treat the symptoms of depression Depression comes with a whole grab bag of symptoms and they are all linked but separate in a complicated mess that is different for each person and can respond differently to medication in each personOften one of the most significant things that can affect a person with depression is a lack of motivation an overwhelming lethargy that leaves them unable to perform sometimes even the most basic of tasks This is the reason that the advice just snap out of it get up and do something is so useless to folks with depression The illness cruelly takes that option away by filling a person with leaden thoughts and an inability to even contemplate taking the next few steps in their recovery I have worked with people who have sat soiled on a sofa until someone physically moved them to the bathroom to clean up people who have not eaten in days being unable to summon up the energy to see the point in getting something to eat This lethargy and lack of motivation is linked but separate to any suicidal ideation People may have suicidal thoughts or they may not or they may develop suicidal thoughts only when in the very depths of a depression when the lethargy has already kicked in Sometimes a person may entertain the idea of killing themselves but be unable to summon up the energy to put together a plan to do so after all many suicide methods require some sort of supplies which means getting dressed leaving the house and interacting with people to purchase things or may require the effort of driving to somewhere or other such activities Sometimes even just the effort of making a decision and coming up with a plan to kill yourself is just too much to overcome  Now heres why people suffering from depression should always have someone to help keep an eye on them when they start a course of medication Sometimes with modern antidepressants the first symptom that reacts to treatment is the lethargy All of a sudden the person who was unable to leave the same position on a sofa or in a bed for days on end is able to get up in the morning or to summon up the energy to have a shower or to go out to the shopsYou can see how this is the start of a positive recovery for many people however sometimes the suicidal ideation does not go away at the same time So what happens is that a person is still very much in a place where they wish to end their life but now they have more energy and motivation And therin lies the rub I must stress that this is not the case for every person with depression perhaps not even for most people with depression everyone is an individual and everyone reacts to both depression and treatment in different ways Antidepressants are without a doubt good things that help many many people to recover but sometimes they come with a risk that needs to be managed and thats why they put those warning on the packetTLDR    Sometimes Antidepressants can give a suicidal person the energy to notice their suicidal feelings and sometimes act  on them by bringing them out of a lethargic state in which they may not even have realised they felt that way ,0,cdn1zrg,1rgj2f,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7,7

ZenDragon,This might not seem intuitive but in the case of antidepressants a person with depression may have passive thoughts of suicide but insufficient energymotivation to actually go through with it When antidepressants are suddenly introduced a number of things can happen It may give them just enough drive and energy to actually carry out their suicide plan It might not react well with their body and make them feel even worse prompting more thoughts of suicide Some antidepressants are possible to OD on giving the person a new convenient way to kill themselves Someone starting on antidepressants for the first time may have only recently come to the conclusion that they have a mental health issue Becoming conscious of it may make them feel even more pathetic or hopeless For these reasons its very important to monitor a person starting a new antidepressant drug or if you are taking one yourself to frequently tell people how you are feeling and not hesitate to talk to your doctor if they arent working out for youSource My family has a medical history of depression yep genetics are a factor Weve dealt with many different medical treatments,1,cdn1f8v,1rgj2f,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6,5

DoggoneCat,While I agree with eideids comments Im going to take a little different approach starting first with extant species Where eideid says gt There is no truly comprehensive definition of species and in reality the lines between species are decided by general consensus reinforced by highprestige scientific committees I would say that there are several acceptable definitions of species and all are rather context dependent If two species are asexual but closely related how do we determine if they are species or subspecies races or breeds in some contexts but not others What about two groups of organisms that appear nearly identical but are separated say on different continents They cant naturally interbreed There are literally dozens of scenarios we could suggest to snag someone stuck on a simple definition So we use morphology behavior and increasingly genetics to test hypotheses about the relationships between extant species I dont know that Id call the decisionmakers high prestige scientific committees A single author publishing a convincing set of evidence may decide to split a previously single species into  or more If her argument is sound and the data support it consensus in the scientific community may simply be that other authors cite the work and accept the argument Some taxa have a richer history of committee decision however Birds have long had a devoted following and there are numerous large and prestigious organizations which have committees that review the literature on taxonomy and vote on what the official relationship will be So each year the American Ornithologists Union publishes an update to their official checklist based on the decisions of the committee When we consider extinct species we have much less data to go on both quantitatively the number of fossilized examples of a putative species and qualitatively the different types of evidence There are no behavior observations though we might make some inferences There may be no usable genetic material There are rarely skin or feathers anything to compare looks We might only be left with a partial skeleton At that point paleontologists measure and compare and hunt for more fossils and do the best they can to make informed decisions Often someone coming along  years later having much more data at hand will revise those initial findings to a greater or lesser degree It is messy and somewhat subjective but the idea is to apply any and all new relevant information and to try and let the data suggest the most parsimonious answer  that is the simplest answer is generally the most likely unless you have data to the contrary Hope this helps and isnt too wordy,1,cdn36ww,1rgmpx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

SnafuCoaxer,A lot of these answers ignore the fact that that profit rarely translates into the ability to takeover other companies if youre a listed public company Spyker for example bought Saab briefly despite Spyker being a tiny companyThe reasoning is completely economic If your cars are cheaper and you sell more youre going to have bigger facilities and spend more on things like research Lamborghini if they were independent arent going to have the scale to effectively invest in RampD without outsourcing it But RampD can be pretty much equally used by all car marques ie it would be more efficient for Volkswagen and Lamborghini to share research as their research needs arent all that differentSo a company with a lot of facilities like Volkswagen or BMW is going to be able to make better cheaper cars than a company like Lamborghini But thats not why people buy Lamborghinis they buy them for the name and values of the brand they buy them because they want a sports car with the character of a Lamborghini So if Volkswagen made a car to compete with Lamborghini it might be faster and more efficient and cheaper but it likely wont make much of a dent in Lamborghinis sales If Lamborghini makes a good car it will probably cut in to Ferraris sales howeverSo from that logically If Volkswagen bought Lamborghini Lamborghini would better compete with Ferrari and Volkswagen itself wouldnt lose any sales because their brand doesnt compete in the same markets as Lamborghini So Lamborghini makes better cars and Volkswagen gets more market coverage for their entire portfolio ,0,cdn9hhs,1rgppg,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Cman,The reason we have airspeed and groundspeed is because they serve different purposes For an airplane to gain lift fly it has to move through the air at a certain speed so that the wings will work To make sure we are at that speed and not coming close to falling below it we measure airspeed This is how fast the plane is moving through the air If air never moved anywhere and stayed in the same place all the time then airspeed and groundspeed would be the same thing However air also moves We all know that We call it wind The airplane is a part of the air mass in the same way that a fish is a part of the water mass A fish can swim through the water at a certain speed relative to the water but if that water is itself moving with respect to the earth then fishs speed with respect to the earth is also changed the same amount So if our airplane a skyfish in the air is flying north at mph through the air and the air itself is moving mph south relative to the earth then we have two speeds happening to our aircraft We are going north at mph through air but only mph over the ground because the air itself is pulling us back as we move forwardGroundspeed allows us to calculate how long it will take us to arrive at a given destination and is particularly important so we can make calculations for fuel consumption Our airspeed is important because the plane will behave differently in the air depending on its speed Too fast and we could stress or damage the airframe Too slow and we risk losing lift and stalling which is basically falling out of the sky dont worry we can recover from those easily,1,cdn8ayt,1rh898,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,8
AnteChronos,The planes airspeed is how fast its moving relative to the air around it  The ground speed is how fast its moving relative to the groundSo for instance if the wind is blowing in the same direction the plan is traveling it can reach a higher ground speed because the limits of the engines have to do with how fast the plane is moving in the air,0,cdn817g,1rh898,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

jayman,Theres a lot of variation in how a movie gets made Heres one general example of how it could happenFor starters Spielberg doesnt always write his own stuff So the first thing he does is look for inspiration Then he gets together with a writer to come up with a treatment He takes the treatment to the studios and tries to sell itAssuming the studios want it theyll greenlight it  that is draw up contracts assign a budget and agree on certain dates like start of production completion of principle photography target release date ect Theyll usually have notes or suggestions like asking him to work with a particular writer or using the film as a vehicle for a star they have under a multifilm contractOnce the contracts are signed preproduction starts This is where the script gets hashed out completely At the same time people are sent out to scout locations Sometimes they plan of filming on location other times they just take pictures to build the sets somewhere else They start working on wardrobe concepts and set dressings and all that jazzOnce the script is pretty close to finished Spielberg give his shortlist for actors to the casting agent and they see if any are available If not they move down the list andor hold open casting sessions Meanwhile he starts storyboarding the script and comparing it to the location info that his team gathered upOnce the actors are set they agree on a date to start working and then begin actually building all the sets and securing the rights to film in the locations theyve chosen They also hire a studio to start early work on special effects like the big space battle and the alien ships or whateverThey will bring the actors in for costume fittings promotional shots and script readings They might walk through the sets and talk about the scenes that will go on there and spend a little time getting to know areas that theyre supposed to be familiar withThe big day comes They have the sets looking just the way they want the actors are in their trailers the script is good and the actors are satisfied craft services have snacks out for everyone the lighting department has everything perfect the camera crew are set its the start of principle photographyThis is the easy part You have a list of shots that need to be completed Theyre usually organized for convenience rather than the order theyll appear on the screen Like if you have three scenes in a particular house that all take place at different times in the movie theyll all be filmed in the same general timeframe with wardrobe and lighting and set changes as necessaryTheres also a second and sometimes a third team of actors and directors working on things like tracking shots where you cant see the actors close enough to notice its really their stunt double and insert shots like a closeup of Batman grabbing something off his utility belt where it doesnt really matter whose hand it isOnce all the shots are in the can they move on to editing all the footage together into a film The actors are free to go work on other projects Now Spielberg is in a little room with his editor a screen and a tool for cutting and splicing film They look for the best takes and the best lengths for each scene Its usually around this time that scoring and special effects work begins Some bigger FXheavy movies they send the scenes for special effects as soon as they have the actors parts shot instead of dumping the whole film on them at onceSo he has FX shots coming in on a regular basis he has the composer coming in to look at scenes and get a feel for things and then returning with music which he adds to the scenes If necessary hell bring the actors back to shoot new scenes or record new dialogue Maybe the wind was muffling the mic maybe he decided he needs a scene where someone else builds a mashed potato mountain stuff like thatOnce he has the cut he likes he shows it to the studio The contract will determine who has the final say in the films edit Spielberg has a lot of clout so he generally will get his own way Some films go to test at this point where they bring in an audience and gauge their reaction This might result in new edits or other changes and it can also take them back to reshooting scenes again if necessaryOnce the studio the audience the director the producer the editor the composer and everyone else is happy they create a master print of the finished product This is usually the version of the film that gets screened at festivals and such Around this time is when director and actor commentary gets recorded usually at some festival or other promotional eventThen the studio takes the master and uses it to print the copies that get sent out to theaters This is generally about the time TV advertising starts The promo shots were probably already released but theyll use some of those to make posters and print ads and whatnot The studio has a deal with theater chains where they get a certain cut of ticket sales on a sliding scale the more recent the film the higher the cut the studio takes They send out the films the people pour in they buy lots of popcorn and snacks that the theaters actually use to stay in business and the reviews startMeanwhile they use a copy of the master to get the DVDBluray production going They slap in the commentary and other special features and schedule a release

MisterFiftyFifty,The Cuban Missile Crisis began basically as a combined result of two things the Cuban Revolution that had happened fairly recently  and NATO missiles that were placed in Turkey The Cuban Revolution overthrew a particularly brutal dictator Fulgencio Batista who was backed by the US basically because he was anticommunist Once this happened the Soviet Union saw a great opportunity for an ally a communist nation led by a widely popular and charismatic leader Fidel Castro on the front doorstep of your archnemesisThe missiles in Turkey were widely believed to be pointed at the heart of Soviet Russia as Turkey is in a strategically valuable spot for doing so with ICBMs The Soviets needed a counterbalance to this and they saw it in the form of Cuba What went down in a nutshell is that the US noticed these huge missiles  miles from their coast and through diplomatic maneuvering and a naval blockade of Cuba by President Kennedy and his entourage convinced the Soviets to back off and remove the missiles in exchange for the missiles in Turkey being removed they were later replaced by nuclear submarines anyways No one wanted a nuclear war despite the large amount of dick measuring that went on in the Cold WarIm not exactly sure what you mean in how the Cuban Missile Crisis connected into Vietnam Vietnam was a completely different situation and official involvement did not start until  two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis While the latter was more of a direct threat to America itself Vietnam was somewhat more of a political gamble to stop the spread of communism as had been done in Korea though only halfway As far as I know Fidel in Cuba had little interest in Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh was more concerned with reuniting his country though Im sure they would have rooted for each other,0,cdnbvj8,1rhek9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,4

Yankeessfan,While the actual act of executing someone may be a lot cheaper than life in prison it usually takes years to get a person to this point because the court allows the defendant to appeal the decision to give the death penalty So essentially giving the death penalty is adding the fees of a prison sentence to house the person with years of legal fees to prove that the person does deserve the death penalty  years sticks out in my mind from my criminal justice class I took in high school but Im not sure if thats the average time before the final approval of the death penalty or the maximum time they allow the trial to go on for Perhaps someone can elaborate on this ,0,cdna1yw,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,10,10
DeweyCheatemHowe,The expense comes from legal fees and expert fees Once the state declares its intention to seek the death penalty a defendant will automatically be appointed not only an attorney assuming hes indigent but probably a couple attorneys as well as a mitigation investigator That person will go back to the defendants roots and dug up everything they can from the persons life that would help sway a jury to recommend life There will likely be a sanity commission to determine whether he is competent to stand trial consisting of several doctors The state is also hiring experts and will be spending extra man hours to ensure everything goes exactly right so a later court has no reason to reverse Same thing goes for the trial court So all that happens before trial Day one of trial starts an exhausting version of the standard jury selection Before the normal process starts each juror may need to be media qualified have they been biased by prior coverage of the case and will need to be death qualified whether they could vote for death under some set if facts or are they too against the death penalty to consider Only then can the attorneys start regular jury selection Trial will probably run  weeks If guilty then the jury comes back and hears testimony about the mitigating an aggravating factors this is where that investigators work becomes relevant Then they will vote on lifedeath If death at least in my state the defendant gets an auto appeal to the state Supreme Court He will be appointed a different attorney for this who will have to learn the case go through the whole deal Defendant argues anything and everything that he says went wrong from the moment the crime happened If affirmed he can petition the US Supreme Court to hear his case Unlikely here Then he starts state post conviction New attorney goes back to arguing constitutional challenges in the same court he was convicted If affirmed back to state Supreme Court and the petitioning the US Supremes If he hasnt managed a new trial yet he will file a petition for habeas corpus in fed district court again arguing constitutional issues If affirmed he can go to the appellate court and then petition the US Supreme Ct again Only when the supremes deny his petition or affirm does his conviction become final Meanwhile this whole time hes been housed in an ultra secure area of the prison by himself rather than in the GP Every appeal except US Supreme Ct and maybe US Appeals are of right He gets them regardless and taxpayers are paying his attorneys and fees think of all the copies for instance If any court finds a a significant error process restarts Also its in the defendants best interest to fight to delay all of these waiting for new rulings new facts or just more days on earth Most defendants will then file some sort of  claim alleging that the method of execution is unconstitutional Usually some interest group pays his fees here but the people still pay the state and the federal judge thatll hear it Overall its not hard to see how the costs pile up Source friends in the DAs office and I took a capital punishment class in law school Forgive type os on mobile and I might be a bit rusty on some of the facts above ,3,cdnd25l,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,6

AshRandom,The claim that is so often trotted out is that there are a tremendous number of manhours spent by lawyers and judges during the appeals process While this claim is true for a single event its not as meaningful as one might imagine especially when the total ledger is examined A death sentence trial with appeals when totaled up in number of days averages around  as compared to about  days for a life sentence Three times as much But the kicker is recidivism Yes Recidivism The term used to describe a failure the failure to reform criminals who serve their time and go free only to end up back in jail as repeat offenders The recidivism rate in the US within three years of being released is over  in every state BJS Bureau of Justice Recidivism Statisticshttpwwwbjsgovindexcfmtytpamptid Combine a multitude of trials for a multitude of crimes with the additional cost of medical care feeding housing and guarding felons for decades during their terms and suddenly executing criminals comes out as a bargain With the overwhelmingly obvious sparkle covered bonus prize of zero additional victims The big question of course is should we allow the state to have the power to kill people The answer to that question has absolutely nothing to do with cost It is a question of human rights And it cannot be answered with recourse to cost as life itself has worth unquantifiable with dollars,10,cdnc08p,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,12,2

Brelya,The death penalty in most states results in a bifurcated trial where the same jury most of the time sit through two trials The first is the guilt phase where they decided whether to convict a person  The second is the penalty phase where the State and defense counsel each present relevant evidence of either aggravating or mitigating circumstances so that finally the jury may decide whether that particular defendant should get the death penaltyDefense counsel should invest a lot of time in looking for mitigating information prior to the case even going to trial because if convincing enough and if in the right place the State may waive seeking the death penaltyIn some states the decision to impose death is then automatically reviewed by the States supreme court for a proportionality review They decide whether this person truly deserves the penalty in light of every other defendant that has received itDuring this time appeals and postconviction motions run wild The defendant can assert many claims such as  ineffective assistance of counsel unfair trial etc There are many avenues to have not only state courts but federal courts to review the case and claims the defendant might have In every instance the State most likely will defend their positionThe prosecution State is financed by the state government and where the defendant is being represented by public defenders that is also financed by the state governmentIt is a long and arduous process but it costs money because death is different It is a lot more sensitive and dangerous to put someones life on the line without making sure the process is fair That includes hiring of many experts on both sides to help provedisprove the case,0,cdneepo,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
benofepmn,After a lengthy jury trial with two phases one for guilt and one for punishment that results in a death sentence the defendant has a lot of due process rights to exhaust before he can get executed First is a direct appeal to the states high court After the conviction is affirmed the defendant can then ask for postconviction relief such as a writ of habeas corpus When that is denied he can appeal If the denial is affirmed on appeal his state remedies are exhausted but he still cant get executed Now he can go to federal court and ask for habeas corpus relief When that is denied he can appeal Then he can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case When they choose not to hear the case the defendant often tries desperate measures such as contesting the method of execution or claiming that there is newly discovered evidence that warrants a new trialAll these appeals and due process take time Transcripts of proceedings need to be ordered and created Briefs need to be researched and written Oral arguments are heard The courts written decisions need to be researched and written This results in these appeals taking yearsThe serial killer in Missouri Joseph Franklin who was just executed on  had his original conviction affirmed in ,0,cdngbw1,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
Lizzipp,Because if you want to kill someone youve got to be really really certain theyre guilty An innocent person who was sentenced to life in prison could come out twenty years later when DNA evidence shows they were innocent or the guilty party comes forward or they could successfully appeal Thats not ideal of course but the point is its not irreversible where the death penalty is If someones been sentenced to death you want to get all your appealing done before the sentence is carried out and you have to delay it for as long as possible to ensure no one is going to come forward with new evidence that could potentially reopen the case and also you want to delay it for as long as possible  youre going to demand every single appeal and retrial and whatever you can because at the end of all that youre going to die Youre going to be the biggest pain in the arse you possibly couldAdd to this the fact that the death penalty isnt legal in most countries and in the ones that it is which are also a functioning democracy the US its only legal in a handful of places Say you commit your crime in Texas and flee to the UK even if youre arrested in the UK youve got to be extradited back to Texas with is an extremely lengthy and therefore expensive process The touchy nature of the subject is a real hindrance since lots of countries believe the death penalty is immoral and may refuse to extradite someone if they believe they would face execution in the same way they do for potential torture victimsAlso life in prison is not always life in prison Where Im from life in prison more often means  years although you can be sentenced to a whole life order which means theres no possibility of parole It can easily take fifteen twenty thirty years on death row before the actual execution maybe even more So although the cost of an execution itself is pretty low youre already adding that to whats essentially a life sentence and thats before you take into account the cost of thirty years worth of legal work ,0,cdnit48,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
poppopntheattic,The level of judicial process to execute someone is much higher than for a life sentence for three main reasons  First you cannot take back an execution  Second the public wants to believe that we only execute guilty people  Third the Supreme Court has said that only certain crimes and criminals are eligible for execution under the th Amendment so there are additional legal issues in death cases that are not present in lifesentence cases  The result is a very expensive legal process that usually goes on for years  This is all aggravated by the fact that states often appoint lawyers who are inexperienced underfunded and in over their heads to represent capital defendants in their initial trials  This leads to subsequent challenges that the trial was unfair due to inadequacy of counsel   Source  I am a lawyer with a client on death row  His trial was nearly  years ago and I was first appointed to represent him more than  years ago  Due process is timeconsuming and expensive    ,0,cdnknv4,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Coltfourty,The death sentence costs more for the basic fact that once you are sentenced to the death penalty your case is required to be reviewed by the supreme court  They receive thousands of cases every year and only hear around  of them  The whole process requires an insane amount of man hours put in by the federal prosecutors where as if someone is sentenced to life in prison without parol their isnt as much work from the start on the prosecutors side       Another factor in the cost being higher is that death sentence inmates cost more to house  Most states require death row inmates to be housed alone instead of in a group cell  This means more space taken up and more intensive supervision which accounts for more money  In california for instance it costs up to  times as much to house a death row inmate compared to a regular inmate because of the treatment differences,1,cdnf8m4,1rhemv,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,0

MistaSchlong,Ok so you know about digital devices  Think about a binary switch something that just turns on and off  Thats what a neuron does it just turns on and off  At the end of a neuron there is a signal to the neurons close by whether they should turn on and off too  These signals are made of molecules and we call these molecules neurotransmitters  We wont need to talk about these neurotransmitters but I wanted to make a point that when people talk about them theyre really just talking about the things that make a neuron turn onOK your brain is made of neurons  Its also made of other types of cells but the most simple straightforward explanation obviates the need to discuss these other cells in detail  Knowledge is stored in these neurons  Now because a neuron can only essentially turn on and off the only way you can change that a bit is to make turning on harder or easierMaking the turning on of neurons harder or easier can come from different mechanisms  You can make the neuron more sensitive to neurotransmitters  This can for instance happen through the expression of receptors within the dendritic arbor  Likewise you can make a neuron less likely to turn on by decreasing sensitivity to neurotransmittersNote you may have heard of the term Action Potential  This is what I mean when I say the neuron turns onNow knowing that a neuron can turn on and off and that is regulated by how easily or difficult it is to turn specific neurons on and off I want you to think about chords on a piano or guitar  Chords are made up of notes and notes are made up of pressing keys or strumming strings  Basically turning them on or keeping them offHowever and this is the key with just a few chords you can play millions of different songs  Its just about how the chords are played the timing the tempo the coordination  Similarly the firing of neurons on and off in combination generates recall of stored knowledge  And knowledge is stored in how easily or difficult these neurons are fired on and off,0,cdnep8v,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

airor,The memories are stored in the pattern of sequences your neurons fire throughout your brain  A single neuron will tend to fire at a rate determined by the neurons attached to it so groups cortical columns of neurons tend to fire at the same time and at a steady rate  This rate can be influenced by other groups of neurons firing at nearly the same rate such that the two groups start to synchronize  Patterns form as the different rates compete for synchronization throughout your brain  Some of your neurons are directly connected and influenced by sensory input and tend to sync to that input  Due to the feedback of all the other neuron groups the input can be predicted the pattern is recognized and other groups start performing the pattern that is the expected future sequence of input  The brain is built to allow for many layers of this pattern recognition dance each layer predicting the future output by simply repeating the patterns that occurred the previous times it received that inputWhen the pattern is confirmed and the input really does follow the expectation the two groups stay in synchronization and new connections are made to strengthen that pattern  When dissonance occurs and the input does not match with a group the connections to that group weaken  So in effect your brain evolves the connections between neuron groups that correctly predict the futureHow is that a stored memory  There are areas of your brain that can fake sensory input into the system and let it perform its dance  This ability gives us the power to imagine situations and remember previous input  The feedback and the flurry of patterns that emerge as we think is horrendously complex and not well understood because we cant reproduce how it actually works  But in principle it is the fact that certain areas of our brain react to internal input simulated inside our minds that give us our self awareness and memory,0,cdnismc,1rhfcd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

bisteccafiorentina,httpwwwplosoneorgarticleinfodoiFFjournalponeAmong the many potential environmental triggers for TD diet has been considered a significant contributing factor   Of the various dietary factors gluten warrants special mention because epidemiological data suggest that early exposure of infants to cereals containing gluten may increase the risk of TD  Rodent studies have supported this claim  Mechanistically it remains to be determined how dietary gluten could facilitate the development of TD In the current study we explored whether alterations in the gut microflora could potentially explain the prodiabetogenic properties of dietary glutenCeliac is a life threatening response to gluten  However there isnt much science investigating the responses that arent as pressing  There is something loosely called gluten intolerance which is characterized by a host of symptoms including bloating abdominal discomfort or pain diarrhea muscular disturbances and bone or joint pain It can also cause other unexpected symptoms such as headaches and vertigo among many others from the wiki for gluten sensitivity  Vitamin deficiencies are often noted in people with coeliac disease owing to the reduced ability of the small intestine to properly absorb nutrients from food from the celiac wiki The response to gluten obviously falls somewhere on a spectrum while a lot of the symptoms and pathology of those with celiac and gluten intolerance are the sameTo address your question Why do people go on a gluten free diet  Well there is obviously a pile of evidence indicating that its consumption correlates with a host of negative health outcomes  To which part of that pile any one person pays attention may vary and they may only have heard that such research exists and not done any investigation personally  But nonetheless often times the best way to determine if a dietary intervention will benefit you is to implement it on a personal level and see what happens  ,4,cdncwl4,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,13,9

legowife,As a diet as in a way you eat to lose weight its a fad Replacing nongluten free foods with gluten free foods has no garuntee to make you lose weight One caveat however is that if you do not replace wheat bread and other gluten products with a comparable gluten free product which are often higher in calories and sugar then the likelyhood is that you will have actually entered into a lowlower carb diet than you were eating previously and maybe even a lower calorie diet purely because you are avoiding foods with gluten and havent replaced them with something else Low carb diets do have a great track record for weight loss Whether it is a healthy method or not is a matter of some debateOn the flip side the gluten free diet as in what you eat to live and sustain yourself long term is imperative for people with Celiacs who are directly allergic to it and some other conditions like crohns which are deeply irritated by the gluten protein and it can also be beneficial for those who have or suspect they may have other digestive sensitivities as they work with their doctor to eliminate possible causesIn no case is purchasing a gluten free product a necessity for eating gluten free as the number of foods that are naturally gluten free is enormous but it does make the transition easier for someOne additional note is that the fda recently ruled on how much gluten something could contain and still be called gluten free which is one reasonamong many others including taking advantage of the fad why gf stickers and labels have begun to get slapped onto everything even products that one should assume are gf by nature ,1,cdnlle6,1rhj3z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1

maestro,Okay so nobody here is right  Not even doovidooves with his  upvotes  It has nothing to do with commercialization or recording and classical versus modern isnt the right way to break things downFirst some terminology  Im going to refer to it as Classical versus Popular  Classical music is the musical tradition going back to church music eg Gregorian chant certain types of Renaissance music motets madrigals etc the Baroque period the Classical period the Romantic period and modern periods that we dont quite have the historical context to classify yet  It continues to be written todayPopular music is the tradition going back to the earliest music ever created which today involves the rock combo with guitars basses drum sets keyboards etc but includes folk music all the way back  It actually predates ClassicalPopular music has always been meant to be easily imitable  In the days before recording it was meant to be playedsung by amateur musicians in the home or around the campfire or whatever the cultural equivalent of those things may be  Its simpler music not that impressive in its composition so any enjoyment that the listener receives is due to the skill of the performer  And usually there arent that many performers which makes it simpler stillClassical music is not meant to be easily imitated  The forms are longer and more complicated and traditionally written for instruments that take years to master  Sometimes the technical abilities of the instruments are pushed to their limits  Performing Classical music is a serious endeavor  We marvel at the composers ability to coordinate that many musicians playing such difficult instruments into one harmonious piece  We still marvel at the performers but we marvel more at the composer  Many people can both write and play Popular music  Few can play Classical music and even fewer can write itRecording and distribution has changed things a bit  Now rather than relying on simplicity and catchiness exclusively to make a piece of Popular music popular we do still use that but not exclusively we can record the worlds best Popular musicians and distribute that recording  So Popular music has been allowed to become more technically difficult and impressive in its construction see MetalAnd Classical music has certainly leveraged catchiness to become popular see Mozart operas  So the lines have always been a bit blurry and may have gotten blurrier recently  But thats the basic distinction,4,cdnlzvj,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,38,34
ersFaithfulForLife,Commercialized music is more about marketing an image and selling an identity than it is about the music itself Its easier to take a goodlooking singer stylize them and build a brand around their face and name than it is to do with the songwriters who may have a less marketable image In some cases especially in hip hop the producers name may be wellknown and liked enough that theyll make a point to associate it with the album but this is an exception to the ruleFor the most part the music industry doesnt want you to be consciously aware of the fact that the majority of the music you hear isnt written by the performers but by marketers in suits and ties applying a formula finetuned to maximize the likelihood theyll get your fifteen dollars for the album That doesnt look as good Yeah most consumers know or have been told this is the case but its not something the consciously think about every time they listen to a songClassical music on the other hand wasnt about image or identity it was just about the music,6,cdnegam,1rhkhi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,27,21

Typobro,There are a couple of ways to transmit radio signals but the principle is the same for all of them  We create a carrier signal with a certain frequency  Then we add a signal to the carrier signal We start transmitting that signal A receiver picks up that signal  He subtracts the carrier signal All that remains is the original signal The difference between the various transmitting methods is the way we add the signal to the carrier signal ExamplehttpwwwnicomcmsimagesdevzonetutdhallanalogmodulationJPG The reason why the signal gets transmitted is power A whole lot of power Its very dangerous to stand close to powerful transmitters because it would be like standing in a microwave Hope this answers your questions a bit ,0,cdnd9l9,1rhkok,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

PRATFO,I dont know about any of the explanations that the brain shuts down for protective reasons I just dont see the adaptive benefit to this unless youre arguing that cerebral blood flow is somehow compromised by the trauma and the brain shutting down is to reduce metabolism and minimize ischemic insult This simply is not the case if anything the blood flow is increased following impact This is the basis of secondimpact syndrome When there is concussion brain function is altered resulting in increased vulnerability for a period of time Massive glutamate release impairs blood vessels ability to autoregulate As a result of this dilation there is increased blood flow that can lead to massive cerebral edemaAs to what happens that causes one to lose consciousness I would imagine in many cases the answer would be brainstem involvement There a number of nuclei in the hypothalamus and brain stem that are responsible for maintaining arousal The details probably arent worth going into But some convincing evidence for brainstem involvement is the fencing response that is seen with many sports injuries This phenomenon manifests as arm raising with loss of consciousness likely due to certain brainstem reflexes that can be seen in infants such as the Moro reflex which involves the vestibuloapinal tract to raise the arms in response to head position change This reflex originates in the pons ELI Forces strong enough to cause loss of consciousness likely affect the brainstem where the arousal network is This is why you often see athletes raise their arms when concussed this reflex is located in the same areas of the brainstem this is called the fencing responseFencing Response httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvZlXjwAlOflA,0,cdng7nr,1rhm8j,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Fairleee,The creation of the standard is one of the most important inventions in human history  it is the reason why we can have global networks and infrastructures because they all rely on there being a universally agreed concept of a thing  this universally agreed thing is called a standard There are a number of different standards and sometimes we dont have a single one Consider something like transferring data between devices The USB port is a standard port that is used in data transfer but it isnt the only one  however because it is so popular most devices will have a USB portIn terms of distance these measurements are absolutely crucial to a huge amount of what we do  basically if we didnt have a standard system of measurement for length then mass production of components couldnt exist which would mean that we wouldnt be able to build things on such a mass scale in a uniform wayThe meter was designed to try and use some natural phenomenon as the referent for its length This is similar to the celsius system of temperature which was intentionally designed to use the boiling and freezing point of pure water at sea level as its referent system However the systems proposed to serve as the definition of a length of a meter were not accurate enough or constant enough to be fully acceptable So part of the work the organisations responsible for setting standards had to do was try and find some universal constant To measure time a second has a precise definition of a certain number of periods of radiation of a caesium atom  I cant remember details off the top of my head For distance the length of a meter is defined by the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a certain incredibly tiny period of timeAs for whether there is some Master Ruler somewhere yes there is There is a prototype meter kept in France I believe and a number of almost identical with the tiniest tiniest variations and the variations of which are recorded meter rods were given to various nations to use as standards So basically precision measuring equipment uses the lengths of these rods as their basis for the length of a meter Other measuring devices are then calibrated from these and so on and so on So a cheap ruler that you buy to use in class will not be precisely accurate but the accuracy is good enough for the job that you are doing However if you are doing a job that requires a very very very high degree of accuracy such as precision engineering then you basically have to buy a far more expensive tool that has a far more accurate calibration And that is how we are able to use a standard length across the worldIf you are interested in reading the history of the meter the Wikipedia article can be found herehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofthemetre,4,cdnd8a9,1rhqwm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,16,12

iaccidentlyreddit,To understand this we need to look at the history of writing in the westIn the modern day western world we use the Latin alphabet The Romans however first wrote in GreekBut maybe you know just how much of a chip the Romans had on their shoulder about not being seen as as smart and as cultivated as the Greeks So while Greek still was lingua franca in the Roman Empire they got really obsessed with their own culture and language and tried very hard to make Latin the dominant language in the MediterraneanAnd of course developing a own typography goes a long way in setting the two languages apart This led to what we now know as the Latin alphabet excluding J W and U and all upper caseSeeing however that it is quite tedious to write all those big capital letters all the time the written language evolved into what is called a uncial scriptAll the letters are still majuscules but the beginning of a sentence or a important wort is capitalized so essentially its smaller capital letters if that makes senseNow this is were the fun part starts typographers are a weird bunch of people they are both artists and geometers Back then every written text was basically a piece of art with the capitalised letters being carefully ornated trying to reflect the tenor of the writing And the typographer himself knows how the properties of some letters within the text impact the whole synthesis of his art workAnd seeing that he has some sort of artistic freedom he just cant allow a A H or R to destroy the natural flow of text he is trying to conveyFun fact on the side there are Latin papyri dating back to around the turn of the eras that include lower case letters for the before mentioned a h or rSo from there on it is basically just years and years two thousand and counting of improving on the given letters And this is still happening for example the upper case S used to have two lower case letters  s   and  ſ  which we got rid of basically just recently in the beginning of th century Or the english th used to be the a rune called thorn and fell out of favour in the middle agesso TLDRRomans wrote Latin in GreekIts actually not that all caps is harder to read its that lower case text was developed to be more readableIts like asking why its easier to eat with a fork and a knife than just with a knife,0,cdnfryw,1rhxjh,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Throned,Speaking from past experience braces which are not removable do not really seem to have sharp points on the individual brackets the metal pieces glued to the teeth except for on those brackets where elastic bands could be required in my case it was the third tooth from the middle on both sides on both the top and bottom of the mouthThe wire however which is attached to  threaded through these brackets is made of some sort of memory alloy which when bent away from its set position will try to bend back to what it was set to the correct shape of the mouth  layout of the teethSometimes the wire is not cut enough towards the back of the mouth where it pokes out at the end of the brackets and is usually able to cut the inside of the mouth If the gum scrapes along it while chewing or speaking for example it is likely to damage the inner lining of the cheek Alternatively as the teeth move into position the wire may end moving around in the braces as it is not fixed into position from what I can tell but instead is kept close to the brackets by being enclosed This could cause it to be fine when the orthodontist first puts the wire in but then get worse as you go along until the next time the braces are tightened  rewiredOh and as uSunfried has mentioned  there are two main types of pain with braces in my experience A sort of ache which is usually worse just after them being rewired and for a day or two afterwards and the cutting pain which the ends of the wire cause Just after I had my braces put on however the ache lasted for approximately a week but was not as bad afterwardsWax can be used on the edge of the wire and on the ends of the hooks used for elastic bands on the brackets if it hurts too much,0,cdni7ev,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

debman,There are several parts to braces that can be sharp The braces themselves which may cause some irritation at first but her lips will get used to The wires that orthodontists use have to be strong enough to adjust teeth like others have noted However they also have to be cut to fit her mouth sometimes if the wire is too long they will poke into cheeks and cause quite a bit of pain This is cause for concern and can be adjusted by cutting a new strip of wire bending the tips of the wire or using dental wax as others have suggested I recommend getting the office to adjust the wire itself its a few cents to them free to you and a lot of alleviated pain for your daughter As to why its metal there are several other statements that essentially address the issue The wire has to be strong enough to adjust teeth yet be flexible to go through every brace and also cheap enough to distribute to every orthodontist and every person must be able to use the same wire Cutting a bit of metal wire is extremely cheapthere simply is nothing that could come close to the strength that metal has and retain the flexibility cost etc Unfortunately cutting metal leads to sharp edges unless its treated with something to smooth out the edge As they are more interested in cutting it to the right length than smoothing it out they dont do anything to smooth the tips of the wires that they cut Hope that helps,0,cdnw5hg,1rhzq1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

restricteddata,The same question came up on here a day or two agohttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentsrfmeliwhycansomecountriesdecidewhocanand heres what I wrote thereIn the early s the USA and the USSR decided that it would probably be a bad thing if more countries got the bomb Maoist China had just set one off and was considered a pretty looney rogue state at the time Cultural Revolution and all that and was a mutual enemy to both Both were predicting that without some kind of stopping mechanism there would be dozens and dozens of nuclear nations in the world in the near future as opposed to the five that then existed US USSR UK France China They both saw this as a bad idea because it would destabilize their own influence eg once China has nukes you cant threaten China with nukes without being threatened back and because it might increase the chance of nuclear weapons being used in general which could lead to allout nuclear war which neither the US or the USSR wantedBut the problem is that they didnt want to give up their own nukes They saw general disarmament as an entirely separate problem from proliferation Once a country has nukes a whole new potentially stabilizing political order emerges They didnt want to give that up they just wanted to stop new political orders which they saw as destabilizing from cropping up elsewhere The countries without nukes of course were like wait you guys get nukes but we dont Lame So they made the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty NPT include sections that said that the socalled Nuclear States the ones that already had them would commit to getting rid of their nuclear weapons eventually as well This is Article VI which statesgt Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete disarmamentWell that is a very nice statement but none of the nuclear states have really thought that this was binding All of them are willing to say sure well get rid of our nukes if everyone else does but they all know that isnt going to happen anytime soonSo why would a nonnuclear state sign a treaty that basically says that five states are allowed the bomb but nobody else is Not so much because of the disarmament clause but more because the NPT also says that nonnuclear states will get to have all of the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy as well So they get help with reactors and things like that as long as they agree to safeguards that wont let them weaponize any of it Its also the case that the NPT does serve as kind of a guarantee about the nuclear stability of a given region  if everyone in say South America agrees to not get the bomb and this is enforced by means of the NPT then that means you dont have to spend time worrying about whether your neighbor is trying to get oneIn practice things have always been messier than that For one reason not everybody signed the treaty There were many nonsignatoriesnonratifiers until the end of the Cold War Among them were two of the named nuclear states France and China both of whom did help other states proliferate and four states that everybody assumed were thinking about going nuclear Israel India Pakistan South Africa as well as a number of other states that had reasons to perhaps go nuclear ie Egypt Taiwan South Korea Cuba Argentina Brazil ,1,cdnl5zy,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,13,12

rsdancey,After WWII ended the United States thought that there were only two options  Either nuclear weapons needed to be turned over to an international agency for use only in the enforcement of collective security or there would be unlimited proliferation leading in short order to a nuclear Third World WarThe civilian benefits of nuclear technology were overstated  People thought that nuclear power generation would replace conventional power generation very quickly  The potential of nuclear medicine was just being investigated but hopes were high  So most countries wanted access to nuclear technologyThe problem is that nuclear reactors using uranium the easiest and first technology available produce plutonium as they operate  That plutonium can be removed from spent fuel and reprocessed to make nuclear weapons  There is no good way to allow unlimited nuclear power generation without creating a nuclear weapon proliferation riskOnce the Soviet Union developed its own nuclear weapon it was no longer possible for the US to imagine giving up its own weapons to an international body  In the end an international treaty was developed that traded the right of a country to operate nuclear reactors for the enforcement of rules that prohibited the development of nuclear weapons  This treaty called on the powers that had nuclear weapons as of the date it came into force to eliminate those weapons as fast as possible so that eventually no nation would have nuclear arms  Those countries were the US the USSR the UK France and China  Coincidentally those countries are also the vetowielding permananent members of the UN Security Council which via the language of the nuclear weapon  nuclear power treaty serves as the arbiter and enforcer of that treatyA small number of countries have never signed the treaty or have withdrawn from it which is how India Pakistan North Korea and Isreal have built their weapons programs  Technically they should face crippling economic sanctions and potentially military action to force them to comply with the treaty even though they are not signatories but practically the decision has been made to enforce those penalties ad hoc or not at allThe problem with the treaty is the danger of dualuse  A country can remain within the limits of the treaty while preparing itself to make nuclear weapons  It can create enriched uranium or extract plutonium up to a limit  It can conduct research on the triggers and controlled explosions used in nuclear weapons  And then it can break the treaty and dash for a weapon trying to get the work done before it faces international consequences  North Korea shows that once you have nukes you probably cant be forced to give them up  This is why Iran is so worrisome  They are following the classic path to use the legal limits of the treaty to position themselves for a quick sprint to a bomb  In fact they have repeatedly violated the treatyand been caught which reinforces the world opinion that they are planning to make bombs,2,cdnkqx7,1ri2dm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,2

afcagroo,When a CPU reads an instruction it often does it from DRAM or SRAM memory chips inside the computer It changes the voltage levels on some of its control pin outputs that tell the memory chips Give me the information at this address It provides the address by setting the bits on the pins that make up the address bus  high voltage means  low voltage means  The memory reads that address and sends back the contents that are stored there in a similar fashion It toggles some control pins to say Here ya go and puts its data pins at the right voltages to represent the s and s corresponding to that binary data The CPU now looks at the data bus pins and reads in that data into its internal memory This description is actually vastly simplified but hopefully gets the idea across    Similarly the CPU or other devices can move datainstructions from the HDD into DRAM or tofrom network interface chips etc One thing asks for data stored in a particular set of locations the other thing says OK here it is and sends it and the first thing sometimes says Thanks got it Or something says Im going to send you some information to storework on and a similar handshaking goes on    All of this communication is built up in layers The lowest layer that I described above where voltages change to represent something is called Layer  the physical layer  Sometimes a  is sent via a high voltage sometimes it is a change of voltage sometimes it is a change of voltage simultaneously on two different wires  There are lots of different ways to do it and some are better for some uses than others      Higher layers define the protocol for decoding that information and deciding what it means and how to use it   These generic layers are described in the OSI modelhttpenwikipediaorgwikiOSImodel But there are various different bus protocols SATA PCIe Ethernet etc and to understand any one of them youd need to read up on its specifics     Processors tend to have their own proprietary or semiproprietary bus protocols for some things this has been a recurring issue for companies like AMD who are trying to compete with the  pound gorilla in PCs Intel For other things like DRAM they tend to use protocols that the industry has agreed upon like DDR     Wireless communication adds a bit more complexity Since things arent connected with wires information must be sent by modulating a radio signal There are several ways to get light or other electromagnetic waves like radio to carry information      One simple way is to use signalling You can pulse the light on and off like Morse codehttpenwikipediaorgwikiMorsecode As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code you can transmit information  This is actually done in some fiber optic systems They dont use Morse code and it is much much faster than a human could do But its the same general idea This technique isnt really used with radio broadcasts though   Another way is to modulate the signal  If you think of EM radiation as an oscillating set of electric and magnetic fieldshttpwwwastronomynotescomlightemanimgif that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency then you have a lot of ways to change it  If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send youve got Amplitude ModulationhttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaAmfmendegifpxAmfmendegif If you change the frequency to be a bit fasterslower according to what you want to send youve got Frequency ModulationhttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbaaAmfmendegifpxAmfmendegif There are also other methods like Phase Modulation that are a bit more complicated  And some things use a combination of modulation techniques together such as AM and PM     That gif with the AM and FM waveforms show them modulating an analog signal  Similar techniques can be used to modulate binary signals and thats given a different name For example using FM to modulate a binary signal is called Frequency Shift KeyinghttpwwwmathworkscommatlabcentralfxfilesFSKjpg     You can think of AM as making the light brighter or dimmer very rapidly according to the information you want to send  Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly very rapidly according to the information you want to send Of course you cant see radio waves because the human eye doesnt detect them but the concept is exactly the same Radio is just colors of light we arent built to detect directly with our senses    ,0,cdnjdst,1ricgj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

OrangeCrack,A cell phone is actually a radio  an extremely sophisticated radio but a radio nonetheless Before cell phones trucks would talk to each other using CBs however this was limited to the number of people that could talk at the same time due to the  range and the fact these typically only had about  channels The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneouslyIn a typical analog cellphone system in the United States the cellphone carrier receives about  frequencies to use across the city The carrier chops up the city into cells Each cell is typically sized at about  square miles  square kilometersBecause cell phones and base stations use lowpower transmitters the same frequencies can be reused in nonadjacent cells Here are the basics  As you drive through the city areas are divided into cells  The cells read a unique ID on your phone to identify you and what carrier you are with  If your ID matches that of the tower you will be considered in your home network   Along with your ID your phone also transmits a registration request and the cell tower keeps track of your phones location in a database  this way the tower knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone  The cell tower gets the call and it tries to find you It looks in its database to see which cell you are in  The cell tower picks a frequency pair that your phone will use in that cell to take the call  The cell tower communicates with your phone over the control channel to tell it which frequencies to use and once your phone and the tower switch on those frequencies the call is connected Now you are talking by twoway radio to a friend  As you move toward the edge of your cell your cells base station notes that your signal strength is diminishing Meanwhile the base station in the cell you are moving toward which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies not just its own oneseventh sees your phones signal strength increasing The two base stations coordinate with each other through the cell tower and at some point your phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies This hand off switches your phone to the new celltldr  Your phone acts as a radio and cell towers communicate with your phone and each other to automatically transfer your call,1,cdnjtsw,1rid4r,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,8

Schnutzel,Stack overflowWhenever you call a function memory for that function is allocated in a place called the call stack When the function completes its run that memory is released A stack overflow happens if too many functions are called and theres not enough room in the stack which has a hard size limit to allocate more memoryHow can this happen Look at the following code for example    int foo         return foo    When you execute foo for the first time memory for it is allocated on the stack But then the function calls itself  so memory is allocated again The nd invocation of the function calls itself a rd time  and so on to infinity and beyond Eventually the stack will run out of memory and the program will crash,3,cdnm8mi,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,18,15
Schnutzel,Buffer overflowA buffer overflow when you try to write data into a buffer an array and the data exceeds the size of the array For example    char buffer    scanfs bufferThe function scanf reads a string from the user into the buffer which is  bytes long However scanf doesnt limit how many characters will be read  it will read until its done until a whitespace character is reached So what happens if the user enters helloworld The first  bytes are written into the buffer but the rest are written just outside the boundaries of the arrayNow one of three things can happen The overwritten memory can be unimportant and nothing bad will happen for example the memory could have been used previously in the function but not anymore The program is not allowed to write to this memory so it will report an error and probably crash The worst case is that the memory being overwritten is important but the program continues running This allows the user to change parts of the memory they shouldnt normally have access to which is a security flaw thanks uBrQQQ for expanding on this,3,cdnmsqz,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14,11

MEaster,Buffer Overflow Any random piece of data has a certain size For example an ASCII character is  byte So if you have a string of  characters you would need  bytes to store it A buffer overflow would be when you write data past the end of this string overwriting other dataStack overflows are a bit more complicated Firstly a stack is a way of storing a list of data Its whats known as a lastinfirstout list Basically think of it as a stack of plates You add data to the list by putting it on top of the stack and then remove data by taking it off the topAnother thing to explain is that in programming your code will generally be separated into subroutines A subroutine will generally be things you want to do multiple times without having to rewrite it every timeWhen a program enters a subroutine it needs to keep track of where it came from so it can return It does this by adding the current address to the stack before entering the subroutine If you keep going into subroutines without returning the stack gets biggerIn an operating system such as Windows I believe each program has its own stack of limited size If the operating system detects that the stack is full when the program tries to add something to it then it will halt the program with a stack overflow error to prevent the program from causing problems,1,cdnmnhf,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1
RandomRobot,The two can be combined or independent depending on the context A buffer overflow is very common in the CC languages It just means that you try to fit more data into a buffer than what it can holds In those languages you can access memory directly so a string can be shown as     char myStringIf you try to copy more than  chars into it then it will overflow A stack overflow means that the data was on the stack when it overflowed like in the previous example However if you dynamically allocate memory that memory will be on the heap a large chunk of RAM that your program has access to     char myString  new charThis string will be stored on the heap so when you overflow it it will not be a stack overflow but a heap overflow which is handled slightly differently by the programOverflowing the stack is especially bad since the program stores a lot of useful addresses on the stack such as return addresses If you carefully craft your x chars then you can potentially control the execution of the program If your buffer was large enough say char then you could embed assembly code in the buffer and control the return address to execute the buffer Those assembly codes are usually called shellcodes because what an attacker wanted back in the days was to get a shell or a command line to the infected computer There are whole books dedicated to this how to write them and how to detect themAnother way to generate a stack overflow is to call too many functions The stack is a limited place with around M depending on tons of factors such as your OS your language your compiler Recursion is a common mistake to generate a stack overflow like this    void func      func    Those kinds of overflow are not as dangerous as the previous ones first because they are easy to detect even by just reading the code The first execution will also crash fast Secondly the first kind of buffer overflow is more tricky to detect and an overflown buffer might not cause any problem to the execution of the program while leading an attacker to complete control of your machineThere is a very good tutorial about buffer overflows and how to execute arbitrary code with it called Smashing the stack for fun and profit by Aleph OnehttpwwwphrackcomissueshtmlissueampidModern OS such as Windows  and Ubuntu  have built in protections against those attacks since they are so dangerous and difficult to avoid A common protection is a canary on the stack It means that the OS puts a special magic value at strategic places on the stack After some instructions the OS checks if the magic value has changed If it has then the stack was smashed and some kind of error is returned to the userThere are other kinds of attacks that are directed toward the heap overflows but they are more difficult to execute properly,0,cdnv0ez,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1
kyz,The implicationsThe stack is some memory that keeps track of where you are in the computer program Every time you call another function it saves your current state on the stack and where to come back toThe called function runs and when it finishes it restores the state to before you made the call stored on the stack and jumps back to just after the call instruction also saved on the stackIf you run out of stack the program simply has to stop running Where can you store the details of the next function call Nowhere youre outta space The OS has to abort the programHowever theres something worse Imagine you take input from the user and put it into space located on the stack What if the user tricks you into putting more data there than there is space for it means that the end user gets to control whats on your stack They get to overwrite it with whatever they like They now control the state of your program They get to control where your program will go to once the next function returnsIf its easy enough to guess where the stack is if its at a predictable location like it used to be before address space layout randomizationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiAddressspacelayoutrandomization was promulgated you can tell the program to jump to the stack data itself which is something you the attacker have control of thanks to the buffer overflow This is called smashing the stackhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSmashingthestack for fun and profit The stack data which is actually code is called shellcodehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiShellcodeSo now you have complete control of the program Just from supplying input to a program you have made it start running your own code and you get to take on the privileges it had and access the resources it hasOne fix against this as well as ASLR and not writing exploitable code is to mark the stack memory as No eXecutehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNXbit which means that if the CPU is told to run code on the stack it will immediately end your program,1,cdnpmng,1rih4i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,0

solonballa,Criminology undergrad here Successful sting operations occur when law enforcement provides the means to commit a crime to a criminal who is predisposed to committing crime It becomes entrapment when the police also provide motivation to commit the crimeFor example in Jacobson v United States the government repeatedly sent the defendant child porn in the mail Jacobson initially refused to purchase the porn but eventually gave in and bought it The repeated mailing of child porn became the motivation for for him to purchase the porn His case was overturned on grounds of entrapment  In regards to prostitution the police can pretend to be prostitutes but they cannot repeatedly ask a person to pay for sex that would be providing motivation,7,cdnm7e2,1rimmo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,28,21
Synarus,Entrapment only occurs when the suspect would not have committed the crime or a similar crime if not for the pressures of the police In the typical sting the suspect seeks out the illegal service be it drugs or prostitutes and thus the court can make a good case that the perp would have done it even without it being a sting These stings are typically a lot less pushy then an actual prostitute or drug dealer would be ,5,cdo0r8u,1rimmo,explainlikeimfive,top_week,23,18

neanderthalman,Simplest terms with some inaccuracy  atomic nuclei are made of little particles called protons and neutrons The protons themselves are made up of quarks The quarks are held together by the strong force to make the protons and neutrons and the protons and neutrons are also held together by the strong force to make the nucleusThe weak force is tougher to explain but one thing that it does is keep a quark stable Quarks can change color which can in turn change a proton into a neutron or a neutron into a proton In doing so it will release energy in the form of an electron or positron which is ejected from the nucleus as radiation,1,cdnmpfi,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2
InfiniteAmbiguity,The strong and weak nuclear forces are two of the four fundamental universal forces  As you mentioned the other two fundamentaluniversal forces are electromagnetism and gravitation  There are many interesting theories about why we have four and how they started including that they allstarted as one combined fundamental force and separated over time after the Big Bang  In any event the strong nuclear force allows for the otherwise counterintuitive formation and integrity of an atomic nucleus  An atomic nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons but gravitation doesnt operate a subatomic scales and is a very weak force in any event while electromagnetism says that protons should repel each other in such close proximity and prevent any atomic nuclei from forming  Obviously without atomic nuclei forming we would not have anything we see including life forms So the strong nuclear force is what overcomes electromagnetic repulsion among protons and allows atomic nuclei to maintain structural integrity and thereby for atoms molecules and things we see  The strong nuclear force is very strong but only within very short distances such as atomic scales  So in summary the strong nuclear force is what holds atomic nuclei together allowing the formation of atoms and obviously molecules by extension  The weak nuclear force allows for radioactive decay It is different from and weaker than the strong nuclear force  The crucial practical effect of the weak nuclear force is that it allows for nuclear fusion within stars Nuclear fusion within stars is essential for fueling the stars and for ultimately allowing for the formation of the higher elements  ,1,cdnn7on,1rimo6,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

MooiWeer,The most used anesthetic in surgery is propofol Propofol works by making it harder for your nerves to transfer signals If your nerves dont transfer signals you wont feel pain cant move are not conscious and you dont make memories Propofol can make your nerves stop transferring signals through at least two pathways Neurons the cells that are mostlyyour nerves communicate with each other through neurotransmitters There are neurotransmitters that make a nerve cell send a signal but there are also neurotransmitters which prevent a neuron from activating Propofol makes your nerves more susceptible to an inactivating neurotransmitter called GABA By doing this it makes sure signals dont go from neuron to neuron  To transfer a signal through a single neuron an electrical charge must pass through it A resting neuron has a portential voltage between the inside and outside of the cell of mV when activated this is raised to about mV thereby sending an electrical signal through the cell The potential goes form  to  by opening sodium Na channels which makes Na flow into the cell increasing its potential Propofol blocks these channels making it impossible for neurons to transfer a signal So basically neurons are less able to send send to other neurons and are less able to send information through the neuron itself  ,0,cdnoa67,1ripzx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Pandashriek,First a bit of introduction Voltage is measured in volts current is measured in amps resistance is measured in ohms and power in wattsWatt is the actual power an electrical unit lets say a light bulb consumes The higher the watts the more power is needed to feed the unit Engines power is also measured in watts   horsepower being around  wattsAs for volts ohms and amps  water pipes are a good analogy The voltage is equivalent to the water pressure the current is equivalent to the flow rate and the resistance is like the pipe sizeI hope that it makes more sense now I am not so familiar with electricity and if you want a more detailed explanation Id suggest asking wikipedia or googling the topic ,0,cdnolc3,1ritvw,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
meldyr,Usually people start using the water analogy I have a couple of problems with it You have positive and negative charges That would be the equivalent of water particles with positive and negative mass Current goes in circles at least in circuit theory Water doesnt do that necessarily Usually they say voltage is height or pressure The problem is that voltage is just energy It is thus a little bit of both that can complicate the thinking sometimesChargeParticles can have a charge You have positive and negative charged particles Two particles with the same charge repel each other Two particles with an opposite charge attract each other  Charge is expressed in Coulomb Eg An electron has a charge Qx CQ is the symbol of charge and C is the symbol for CoulombCurrentCharged particles can move If charged particles move through a wire you have current Current tells how much charge goes through a wire in an instant of timeIf  Coulomb of charge travels to a wire in  second you have a current of I  Cs AWhere I is the symbol of current and A the symbol of AmpèreAmpsWhat is voltageAn electrical particle causes an electrical field Suppose you have a nonmoving electrical charged object Lets call it object A If you bring another electrical charged object close to it This is object B Object B starts to move Object B starts to gain speed You could say that just because B is put on a given start position it has some kind of energy When it starts moving that energy is converted in kinetic energy energy because it gains speedThe voltage represents the electrical energy that particle has because it is on in that position in proportion to its charge To every position in space we can assign a voltage VV  EQWhere V is the voltage E is the energy an electrical particle would have on that position and Q is the charge of that particle EgSuppose the object B has a  charge QC Because of being at that place it has an energy of EJ We say that on that place the voltage VJCVNote that the first V represent the voltage And the second V stands for VoltsResistorsIn this figurehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsddeOhmsLawsvg you see that on the top is a high voltage called V  and on the bottom we have a low voltage V We know from the previous section that a charged particle that is in the highvoltage area will flow down to the low voltage area and gain speed The problem is that it doesnt go that simpleWhen the particle goes down it has to travel trough a resistor and the particle will bump against a lot of other things How more things that it will hit when going through the resistor the slower the current will flowWe can characterize a resistor by using Ohms LawVIRIf the Voltage difference over the resistance is V and the current IA the resistor has a resistance of  OhmWattsPrevious I explained that a charged particle has trouble to go trough a resistor The particle will lose speed as it goes trough the resistor This means that the particle lose energy Because the current runs in a circle we can assume that at any place the speed of the particle should be the same The kinetic energy doesnt changeSo the amount of energy that is lost in the resistor equal to EVQWhere V is the voltage and Q the amount of charge that went trough the resistorIf we want to know how much energy we use for a given time instance we can do the following dividing trough a time tPEt  VQt VTP is the power that is lost in the resistance The power is expressed in Watts Buying a light bulb Voltage The light bulb is designed for a given voltage and the wires in your house provide that given voltage So nothing to worry about Power This is the amount of watts The more power it uses the higher your power bill will be On most light fixtures you can find something like W In that case you should put a light bulb in it that consumes less than  Watt  If your light bulb consumes more power than your light fixture can provide you could damageburn your fixture  Light Intensity The more Lumens L the more light it gives Dont assume that because a light bulb uses more power it will produce more light  Color Temperature It is expressed in Kelvin K But its tricky what scientists call a low color temperature describes colors which normal people would describe as warm So if you buy a lightbulb choose one that has a low co lour temperature to keep your house cozy If your light color is too high you will have an unpleasant hospitallike light A right choice depends on the atmosphere you want in the room I wouldnt go above KBuying a microwaveHere you have to be careful You have two times a number in watts which describes different things Power consumption the microwave consumes  Watt This is the number that ends up on your bill Microwave Power this is how much of the power is actually used to heat your foodAn average microwave oven uses about  Watt to provide  Watt microwave food If you buy a microwave oven you should check that it provides enough microwave power and the efficiencyBuying a generatorFor a simple generator you shouldnt mind the voltage It produces the same voltage as a power plugPower The more power it can produce In Watts The more electrical appliances it can support at the same timeEfficiency How much fuel it needs to create one Watt Sometimes given in literWatt sometimes just given as a number Note dont compare these two different numbersTLDR The power in Watts you see on your appliance ends up on your bill Something that gives power eg a light fixture has a maximum power it can supply Dont attach anything to it that uses more

LeSquish,Oooo memeI grew up in a movie theater and I think more detail about the process requiredEveryone makes a lot of money but who gets it all depends on how well the movie does There are a lot of people paid up front for their services Many of these people are technicalsupport and are often paid at a flat rate but depending on their talents might be able to negotiate royalties Actors producers and directors often receive their pay in a combination of flat pay and royalties overtime Even if the movie flops they already get some cash This is why this group has to negotiate because if the movie does really well you dont want to have worked for too cheap and screwed yourself out of ass tons of cash Next we move to the theaters and producers For theaters deciding what movies to show are a gamble Producers dont take a flat cut of sales They take different percentages over time and these percentages vary from company to company A producer will present a movie they want to distribute to the theater operators The producer may ask for something like  cut of the profits for the first  weeks of box office receipts and then maybe bring it down to  later random imaginary numbers The theater owner then looks at the movies being offered and tries to ascertain how long the movie will stay popular or if it will be popular at all If theaters think the movie is too risky and turn out will be poor they haggle down the price or refuse to show the movie in their theater Now that the terms have been decided theaters have to pay up front to purchase rights to show the movie Then they hope to god that they movie will be popular for more than  weeks because they wont really be making any money before that time period So now the movie premiers and the producers starts to make bank The first weekend is the most important because that is when studios mop up the biggest cut of ticket sales  weeks pass movie is still popular and now the theater can mop up without the huge cut going to the producers if it turns out to be a movie popular as long as the Avengers theaters will make ass tons of money on top of their concessions that is their primary source of income But what if the movie flops immediatelyThe reputation of the all the people that madestarredworked in the movie is diminished and you lose your bargaining power with the theaters and hence can loss access to key markets The producer absorbs the loss If the movie flops later the theater takes most of the loss Sometimes people lose interest in a movie after a week of it being out The theater next time will be wary of this producer and probably negotiate a shorter run and less seating for that producer as well as a larger piece of the profits tl dr Too badEditTyposgotta fix em all,0,cdo4mui,1rj2k2,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

Rakaicius,Ill take a crack at this one  The brain uses several different cues for judging distance some of which only require one eye   if object A is partially covered by object B our brain assumes B is closer than A   the more detailed we see something the closer we think it is  This is why studies have shown people tend to underestimate distances in foggy conditions our brains already have an idea of the size of familiar objects due to past experiences   objects closer to the horizon appear bigger because we assume it is closer to the ground   Next time you see a lowhanging moon that looks big curl your hand into a very loose fist and look through it you should notice the moon now looks smaller  The brain will use these cues to give you an idea of the relative distance of an object but its not a perfect system  If you ever try to play a sport with one eye closed youll notice a huge difference  Nothing beats having two perspectives to compare differences  For an interesting example of using two perspectives check out how Napoleon was so accurate with his cannons  ,0,cdnvwax,1rj7gx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

Cogythea,Condenser microphones work by having a metal diaphragm right next to an electrical circuit httpwwwmediacollegecomaudiomicrophonescondenserhtml Put simply when the sound waves hit this diaphragm they push it back onto the circuit as sound is a vibration thereby completing the circuit This then sends an electrical signal down the wire the microphone is connected to or the sound card in the case of the camera and this signal is then interpreted and converted into its original form When a microphone is exposed to wind it is constantly pushing that diaphragm back onto the circuit so the signal is being sent when it ordinarily would not be This creates an anomalous sound The volume of this sound depends on the windspeed  a higher speed means that the signal is being sent more times per second I would assume that we dont hear wind as loud because we have evolved to filter some of it out Not  sure though but thats my explanation as to why microphones pick up wind very loudly If anybody has any corrections Id be more than happy to hear them ,1,cdnuv3t,1rj90z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,0

DashingDipper,Ill explain agriculture commodities markets because thats my area of knowledge but other commodities are traded similarly Futures contracts are essentially a document that says I Bob the Farmer agree to sell Paul the Processor x amount of corn soybeans etc These contracts are typically traded in set amounts  bushels is pretty standard for agriculture at an agreed upon price These futures contracts help to reduce price risk because the person can lock in a favorable price months or even years in the future The farmer knows what he will be paid ahead of time so he can plan his expenses accordingly and the processor will know what they are paying for inputs Most contracts are never actually settled through the physical commodity but rather in cash Because they can be settled in cash many investment firms speculate on these contracts almost as if they were stocks What most people find lucrative is the fact that when you purchase or short a contract you only have to post a percentage of the value of that contract Example  bushels of corn at bu but the buyer might only have to supply  when they buy the contract They can complete the payment when they sell the contract Substitute your preferred commodity for corn and the corresponding units and you have yourself a very basic overview of commodities markets ,0,cdnz6ln,1rjdm1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Koooooj,You just need a Bitcoin wallet  Note that in Bitcoin the word wallet means several different things including The application or website that manages your balance The file that stores your private keys the data that indicates that you own the Bitcoins The collection of addresses that you ownFor this post I will be using wallet to refer to the first definition  There are several options to choose from when selecting a Bitcoin wallet  You can change your mind at any point though so dont stress out about it too much  I would recommend Electrum for a new userits a wallet that will store all of the sensitive data  on your computer meaning that you have zero reliance on any website while it allows rd party servers to store the  GB of data from the Bitcoin blockchain  If you want to use a completely standalone wallet then either Bitcoin QT or Armory would be a good choice the latter is built on the former but has more features for advanced security  You could also consider using something like Blockchaininfos online wallet which can be done carefully to minimize risk of losing your coins due to the actions of a rd party  If you have a smartphone then the Android or iOS wallets would be a good choice since they easily allow you to see that youve received a payment without needing to carry around a laptopWhen you select your wallet application there should be some button that says something to the effect of generate new address  When you hit that button youll be given a string of numbers and letters that represents the new address something that looks about like ABsAjenaBjyPxyTjvkBhpreJT this is an address I own  When you go to sell you just have to give the buyer that information and tell them how many bitcoins to send  When they send the bitcoins you should get a notification that there is a transaction incoming and some time later the transaction will be confirmed by the network  Once confirmed the odds of the buyer scamming you are virtually zero although many buyers will not want to wait for the confirmationit can take a while  For most transactions it is reasonable to consider a transaction as being complete when it is first received unless you stand to lose quite a lot of money in the event of a scamAs always make sure you use good common sense  Dont meet people in locations where they can easily rob you and what not  If all you give the buyer is an address and an amount to pay then theres not much they can do to scam you though  Honestly theyll probably be more worried that youre scamming them since theres no way for them to unsend the bitcoins once theyve paidthey have to trust that youll hand over the goods  Keep that in mind to keep the buyer at easeYou should also look into securing your wallet nd definition  Most wallets st definition have the ability to encrypt the wallet nd definition with a password  Be sure to use a strong passworda good choice would be a phrase that doesnt appear in any literature or anywhere online nonsense makes a good choice here provided you will remember it,1,cdo1xky,1rjs58,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,0

Faustroll,Basically notions of creativity skill and quality underwent drastic shifts beginning in the th centuryIt is imperative to understand the word master in historical context which at the time connoted skill but also crucially described an artist who had a studio in which he rarely she trained other artists Students had a fairly rigorous training in academic drawing for a few years before they learned painting This method created a kind of consistency and helped encourage the notion that artists with large studios were true masters The exceptions here are Michelangelo who was notorious for not having a studio and for berating assistants until they abandoned him and for Leonardo who worked in relative isolationSo master in the Renaissance more often implied individual skill but also skill as a teacher A notion of individuality plays a role in forming a notion of the master during the Renaissance and at this moment it meant the extent to which you could teach others to make art that looked so much like yours that it was indistinguishable Its interesting that you picked Michelangelo and Leonardo since neither of them had studiosAnother piece of this has to do with the Renaissance belief of where in the process creativity actually happened Drawing was the central node of intellect at this time it was why artists studied it for so long and it was why assistants generally carried out the majority of painting in the studios after which the master generally did touch up That was your entry into the grand style in which drawing was seen as the place where the real thinking happened So if you were good at drawing then theoretically you could be good at anything Drawing in Italy disegno implied that design the putting together of something occurred before the execution of it All of these ideas of creativity and individuality underwent a massive change in th century Europe with the decline of academies Artists gradually began pursuing the idea that real creativity did not hinge on excelling in an accepted style or having a studio in which you taught others So the word master changed drastically at the time and became a question of unique personalities The focus on personality and emotion was best seen in unique styles that shied away from the polish of the academic style Impressionism and turned quality into something that was way more granular So to ask whether an artist is a master the reply could be a master of what In determining a master there needs to be a comparative body of less talented artists With collective style dissolving art was no longer something that had a collective comparative premise Artists were judged by their sincerity to the motif which was a personal question Most importantly total emulation like the kind you would find in a studio system gradually vanished So while a young artist was inspired by Picasso actual copying was anathemaArtists today create in different media but judging mastery is based more on the taste of the viewer for different specific artists and everyone has an opinionSorry if this is kind of meandering but it is a complex issue with lots of aspects that feed into each otherA good source for how these ideas came about in the th century is Cezanne and the End of Impressionism by Richard Shiff and The Academy and French Painting in the th Century by Albert Boime,0,cdo8832,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,9

FoolOfFools,I dont know if someone said this already so sorry if Im being repetitive From what I remember the three big names of the High Renaissance Da Vinci Michelangelo and Raphael only became famous after their names were propagated by Georgio Vasari who was from the same location as them but I dont remember where that was Florence perhaps The reason he was so successful at this propaganda was because he wrote one of the only surviving literature on art and great artists of that time periodbooks were just coming into popularity and books on art were rare Vasari didnt acknowledge other artists who were of the same calibre because they either werent from the same location or didnt suit his artistic preferenceThat being said there could have been other great artists and there can still be great artists now but nowadays its all about being different and selling the artist instead of the art This concept was first initiated by Marcel Duchamp I believe with his controversial urinal fountain his idea was that anything can be made into art if you believe in the artist The term art has become so subjective now that great artists are often passed over in favour of those who can produce something different and unique Even before the Renaissance when all you usually find are unrealistic illustrations by tribal people or eastern cultures the capacity for realistic art was still present but nobody believed in it due to religious beliefs They believed that portraits should emphasize specific traits Realistic art was considered offensiveI took two consecutive courses of ancient and modern art a couple of years ago so my memory is rusty and the details might be a bit off so I apologize for that,0,cdobr2h,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Eventhorizon,Today though there are quite a few individuals who are as multifaceted few artists in art programs are taught to fully cultivate each medium simply put there are more human beings on the planet in contrast with  years ago In comparison to art apprentices in the time of Da Vinci and Michelangelo there is a saturation of the art school market with students who simply cannot draw well or sculpt etc Instead art schools today exist as businesses and about less than  of students are multifaceted Most art students choose to pick a particular route ie graphic design or animation and ignoresimply get through other reqs like ceramics sculpting or drawing As a result theres also been a huge shift in the medium through which artists choose to express themselves relying less on pure technical talent and more on conceptual art This also means that mean people who think they are artists saturate the market and cant find work easily Lastly artists dont benefit from being masters of different art forms in the way that they used to through patronage royal court reputations instead art students are incouraged to use multimedia collage technology etc to diversify their art creating new possibilities but simultaneously helping some artists better hide the fact that they cant draw or paint technically well there have been many painters throughout history accused of not knowing how to paint classically many Impressionist painters considered among them ,0,cdohdbk,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
laioren,So everyone here is pretty much just posting things about their favorite artists I think the OP was asking more for contemporary artists that would qualify as a Renaissance Person Or a polymath if you willhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPolymathIll try to contribute this Certainly there are still some really amazing artists and scientists out there Now more than ever However we dont generally have true Renaissance people anymore for the following reasons Lack of Forced Focused Education  Leonard and Michelangelo both endured very focused apprenticeships starting in their teen years Both received specialized education before that Most of the First World eschews such focused educational practices The Less a Culture Knows the Easier it is to Be a Master of Several Basics  To attain a PhD in the United States from a respected University now requires an immense amount of specialization The idea that you could get a PhD in both quantum physics and architecture is very rare and exceedingly difficult The idea that you could get both of those and like five others is unheard ofDuring the Renaissance you could point glass at a star and become a master of astronomy Thats an exaggeration of course but today even if youre really good at science no one really cares unless youre the freaking best at it Financers Rightfully Think There is Only Enough Room in Peoples Heads to Think of Someone in One Way  The people that finance projects have done enough research to know that a large number of people can really only think of someone else in one particular regard So whereas some artists might want to be both musicians AND sculptors the people that publish and distribute their art will generally only choose one medium to sponsorLook at someone like Natalie Portman Sure some people probably know of her work in the sciences but most people dont And even more people dont give a shithttpwwwnytimescomscienceangierhtmlpagewantedallYou can find this again and again Creative people that are good at things tend to continue trying to work However financers rarely back these side projects for fear that the less profitable venture may actually detract from the profitability of what they see as the more promising one Lots of Things Can Now Be Produced with the Same Skill  Someone below mentioned how awesome Kanye is Which is true However everything Kanye does boils down to digital workIm not trying to denigrate anyone here I myself am a digital artist of sorts but being able to produce music digitally movies digitally and graphic design digitally has more in common with the digitally than it does with art portionWorking with real physical stone and sculpting it is WAY fucking harder than creating a D image of it on a computer Again I am NOT saying that creating a D image isnt difficult or that it isnt art or any such polarized interpretation bullshit that some people will make up because they feel threatened when their work is called into questionBut simply put the copy and paste functionality and the fact that undo allows you to make an infinite number of attempts while simultaneously removing the scarcity factor makes all digital work vastly easier to produce Better too but just so much easierIts because of this ease of using digital mediums that generally no matter how many types of things you can do with them most people will simply recognize you as a digital artist of some kind rather than a Renaissance PersonAnd thats fair because sculpting and painting the Sistine Chapel while lying upside down are two very different skills Yes theres still some overlap in the skills especially with the concepts such as the understanding of perspective foreshortening etc but they require much more practice talent and skill to actually accomplish Void of Competition  The Renaissance produced a large number of grand artists but nothing compared with today Now everyone with a computer is an artist with something to offer the world And everyones attention yours mine art critics everyones has universal access to their artSo now people compare and argue about which was a better movie Citizen Kane or Dolemite because our experiences are inundated with the work of artistsWhen there are only  artists of acclaim working in a generation its easy to see all of their talents When there are  billion all you do is compare that kids YouTube clip to the one you made of your cat yesterday and call bullshit,1,cdoj4lq,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,3

oechsph,Forgive my interpretation of this question but I think that its difficult to answer provided that your two examples had significantly different roles during the Renaissance Michelangelo would have been considered an artist during the Renaissance while Da Vincis role as an artist is only secondary to what made him so successful His name would have resonated more as a scientist and engineer than an artist In other words its like asking if there are any modern artists like Nikola Tesla and John Cage The problem is that one was an innovator while the other was an artist Im guessing you are looking for an artistAlso I would like to point out that Da Vinci DID NOT do many different art forms He did painting and drawing He never did ceramics sculptures glasswork etc So again and I know Im being a stickler it seems like your question doesnt even know what its askingThat being said I might take the liberty of revising your question then answering itAre there any contemporary artists like Michelangelo who are masters of several artistic mediumsSimple Answer Yes YES DEAR GOD YES Not only are there a few THERE ARE HUNDREDS The Renaissance popularize the sentiment that the artist does not need to stick to one medium Since the Renaissance you can find artists from pretty much every movement who were masters of their movements in painting and sculpture but not exclusive to those two mediums Looking to what we deem as modern art you could claim that Salvador Dali film photography sculpture painting Picasso sculpture painting costumes theater Boccioni literature painting sculpture Braque sculpture painting  Kollwitz woodblocks sketching sculpture THE ENTIRE BAUHAUS MOVEMENT textiles painting design architecture theater music the list goes on From the perspective of art history they were all masters of many different mediumsWe now live in the age of postmodernism and arguably postpost modernism where the idea or concept behind art is more important than the work itself you may know this as conceptual art In a sense this is now the norm An artist who does one thing and one thing only is easily swept under the carpet Why is this This is subjective but we have a tendency to want something new constantly eg iPhones Art is no different We want to experience new things making a demand for multiple mediumsAlso it should be noted that the living artists or masterswhom we consider celebrities today may very well be forgotten in a hundred years This is pretty common practice in art historyOh I also have a No answer to your question but that is definitely going to leave the ELI zone Is there a ELIBut the short short answer to your question is Yes and they are all over the place,0,cdomd4y,1rkau3,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

dazfive,A collar is a method of attempting to make money on a purely options play It is used separate from any position on the stock There are many strategies like this and are often named other types of buzz words calender spread Iron Butterfly etc They are fancy names for taking a position on both puts and calls long andor short in an attempt to profit while mitigating risk  As for when to use options unless you are a sophisticated investor never The options game can be dangerous but as well lucrative I am an options trader  I use options to make money usually as a seller or writer  The best use of options for an average investor is to protect against downside or lock in a profit If you are long ABC and its has gone up sharply I would say just sell but if you want to participate in more upside while ensuring some profit you can buy and out of the money put This put give your the right but not the obligation to sell at that strike price regardless of where the stock is trading options can also be used as a cheap method to play in a stock  IF you think AAPL is going to rise you can buy an out of the money call which gives you the right to purchase the stock at that price regardless of where it trades Effectively if the stock goes up you can sell the call as opposed to exercising the option to purchase the stock  An out of the money call may only cost  per share rather than the  to buy the actual stock  WARNING  options have an expiry date and are subject to what is known as time decay  The closer the expiry without the equity moving towards your strike the faster the price of the option will drop This can be a tricky game to play I hope this helps   ,1,cdo6gha,1rkcbx,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,1

Fairleee,The first thing to understand is the geography of the United Kingdom Ireland is an island lying off the coast of Great Britain which comprised England Scotland and Wales Historically Ireland was under British rule from  and subject to numerous invasions by the English prior to them establishing rule In the early s a successful Home Rule ie independence movement arose and Ireland became independent shortly after the end of WW with the exception of the top part of the country  Northern Ireland which opted to remain part of the United KingdomTo put it simply the main reason why Northern Ireland wanted to remain part of the UK was because much of the population were colonists from the UK and were predominantly protestant This group is known as the Unionists because they want to remain part of the Union of the United Kingdom There was a smaller native population that was predominantly Catholic that wanted to split from the UK so the whole country was part of the Republic of Ireland  this is known as nationalism as they are Irish nationalists or republicanism as they want to join the Irish republicSo the Unionists see themselves as British and the Nationalists see themselves as Irish However as the majority of Northern Irelands population are Unionists it is unlikely that Ireland will unify with Northern Ireland Because the two groups are also split along religious lines protestants and catholics this adds an extra element to the situationThe Troubles were at their worst from the late s onwards and numerous people were killed and injured The UK deployed part of its army to permanent duty in Northern Ireland and radical nationalist groups carried out a number of terrorist attacks in both Northern Ireland and the UK  in  the IRA a nationalist paramilitary group managed to kill the Queens cousin Lord Mountbatten with a bomb Both Unionists and Nationalists were responsible for a lot of awful violence in Northern Ireland itself and the British Army didnt always help matters  Bloody Sunday is a particularly notorious example where the army killed a number of unarmed protestors In recent years the Troubles have become less severe and the IRA has officially announced a ceasefire and no longer engages in bombings or terrorist attacks This is actually one of the lasting legacies of the last Labour government and Mo Mowlam a Labour politician is credited as being a major force behind the peace process she was the Secretary for Northern Ireland at the time The Republic of Ireland has largely acknowledged Northern Irelands existence and it has been established that if unification is to occur it has to be ratified by both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland However sectarian violence still does continue as there is a long long history of violence in Northern Ireland and feuds are still ongoingSo why is Catholicism and Protestantism relevant Well the fact that the two political positions unionism and nationalism were also largely split down religious lines was significant because it is an obvious marker of difference This is similar to how tribal affiliations in various other nations can be used to justify conflict Religion is often a very important part of a persons life as it can play a large role in how they define themselves so anyone who is not part of your religion is automatically an outsider In Northern Ireland the protestant and catholic communities have largely selfsegregated  in Belfast for example people know whether an area is Protestant or Catholic So it was not the primary cause of the Troubles but it was another complicating factorI hope this answer has been helpful please note that bearing in mind this is an ELI I have simplified a lot of the issues The fact is that the history of the Troubles in Northern Ireland is very very complex so if you are interested in finding out more the Wikipedia articlehttpenwikipediaorgwikiNorthernIreland on Northern Ireland would be a good place to startEdit added a bit more info,1,cdo6422,1rkebc,explainlikeimfive,top_week,7,6

ampellang,Ok I will explain how copy protection works on PS and PS since thats what I am well versed on but I cant say definitively how it works on other consolesSo to start you have to understand that the tracks on CDDVDs are not a perfect spiral  There is a wobble which is that the track itself moves back and forth in a sine wave perpendicular to the direction of the track  This wobble is  kilohertz and some change IIRC  The tracks exist independently of the data which is to say when you buy a blank disc the track with its wobble is already there  A Playstation game changes the wobble slightly on the leadin the part of the track closest to the center where that the drive uses to orient itself prior to reading any data  So when the head is orienting itself on the leadin it follows the wobble of the track  By measuring voltage and impedance of the motor that runs the head the system is able to determine exactly how fast the head is moving back and forth and determine that it is different from a normal khz  If the wobble is exactly correct a analogtodigital converter circuit then sends the okay this depends on the region for America the chip sends hex the representation of SCEA to the CPU and allows the game to be playedThis is why it is still impossible to play burned games on a PS without modifying the console in some fashion,0,cdod1s9,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3
IntHatBar,Many methods of copy protection have been invented and cracked over the years  An example PlayStation  remember the black discs have a special CD Drive that can read data from a track on the disc that is not accessible using standard CD drives  The drive seeks to this special spot near the center of the disc and reads a special code from this track to verify game is legit  Hackers quickly found ways to get around this  The most prolific solution was to modify the PS to intercept the signal and respond with the appropriate code  This logic was built into a small integrated circuit and sold online as device allowing users to verify backup discs  If one has the mod chip installed in the PS heshe can simply copy an original black disc using a typical CD burner then play it on the modified PS  You know so you didnt damage your original game disc by playing it  And stuff,0,cdo771w,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
EatDiveFly,one way is thisThis is how they did it back in the diskette days but is probably still interestingrelevantWhen you ask your operating system to make a copy of a disk you are essentially saying please take data from here and put it there in whatever way you pleaseWhen copying operating systems dont generally write to a specific track or sector on the disk Often the native copy command cant for instance write to track  sector  specifically So when the creator makes the disk he puts a code right in that spot  If that code is not there when the software starts up the sw checks with a low level command is there an X on track  sector  it knows its a copy  ,1,cdo78tx,1rkigi,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

machinehead,The behavior you are seeing on Reddit is not typical and not how a webserver would normally behave  Reddit is very specifically designed to handle shittons of traffic and they have certain traps in place to make sure if the site is getting slammed to make sure it doesnt get slammed harder  So as uSchnutzel points out instead of making you sit there watching your browser spin for  seconds they just throw back that error page with the reddit alien getting buried by upvotes and you refresh to try againOn a single threaded webserver or a smaller website where special considerations are not taken into account this would not happen  If you are running a website where these special traps are not in place and that website gets completely slammed to where a page would take too long to display  your browser is going to spin and you will sit there and wait until either your request times out or the server is able to respond  In that scenario you couldnt just hit refresh to get the page to come up  the server would still be unresponsive,0,cdo63rm,1rkjki,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

BassoonHero,As has been noted E and B do have sharps  F and C This really isnt any different than C sharp being the same note as D flatBut why are B and C closer together than C and D The answer is that there are twelve distinct pitch classes in western music but seven in a diatonic scale such as the C Major scale When notation was being standardized the C Major scale became the default and the seven pitch classes in that scale got simple names whereas the other five pitch classes have to be referred to via flatsharp namesBut why does the diatonic scale have seven notes You can arrange the pitch classes in the C Major scale or any diatonic scale so that each is separated from its neighbor by the interval of a fifth F C G D A E B This is in fact more or less how the scale was defined Why seven notes Because this is the smallest scale that will contain every interval Chop off a pitch class at either end and you cannot form the tritone six semitones Chop off one more and you cannot form a single semitoneFor a more complete explanation read thishttpwwwredditcomrexplainlikeimfivecommentsehsuaelithedifferencebetweenwesternandeasterncapko,0,cdocls0,1rkjsr,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

alwaysdownvoted,Most people who are well off have investment income that is taxed at a lower rate than earned income  This includes some types of interest and capital gains  Many people are angry for some reason that the rich are not being taxed as much as everyone else but I look at it like this I work hard and save money so that when I retire I can invest my nest egg and retire without having to paying the higher earned income tax  This also benefits the people that are saving for retirement because that money is also taxed at the lower rateEdit Changed wording to reflect that only some interest is at a reduced tax rate Thanks InfiniteAmbiguity,0,cdo5pxf,1rkkst,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3
InfiniteAmbiguity,So everyone who receives income pays taxes on that income whether or not they work or make any which are actually very difficult things to define when you look at them closely and impossible to administer orpolice in a large scale But basically the tax code says that all money you receive is taxable unless something in the millions of pages of tax code regulations revenue letters court rulings and other sources  Essentially every rich person pays a lot in taxes on income that they actually receive with one glaring exception  municipalbond investment income is totally tax free regardless of amount received total income or wealth  So for example if I out  billion into municipal bonds that pay me an average of  per year then I keep my billion plus I received  million in income every single year  totally tax free   By contrast if instead of lending the billion to some localgovernment I lend that money to a local private company for  then I will still keep my billion assuming the company doesnt fail I will make my  million per year in interest income and I will pay about  of that  almost  million every single year  in federal taxes plus state taxes as high as an additional  or  million in some states  So municipal bond interest income is the only real total tax code scam that wealthy people can use to actually receivemuse and consume income while spying zero taxes If Americans were actually educated about this it would go away immediately  But both political parties tolerate this game while pointing out totally irrelevant stuff and meaningless but heated sloganeering  In addition to giving people a free ride this municipal bond income exemption also forces residents of fiscally sound states to subsidize the fiscally reckless states which just encourages the fiscally reckless states and their voters to tolerate fiscally reckless behavior  All forms of investment income rental income nonmunicipal interest income and corporate income are heavily taxed or where deductions exist they were consciously chosen for public policy reasons to encourage specific behavior such as research and development charitable giving expanding capital plant and equipment exploration construction and similar behavior  Id say that the mortgage interest deduction is alsoa scam but it primarily benefits existing home owners at the expense of renters and effectively subsidizes the realtors mortgage bankers and home builders  Edit  literally thousands of pages can be written about how horrible the tax system is and why a corrupt federal government  with both parties conspiring  refuses to make it simpler and only keeps making it more complicated But people should start thinking about the most glaring weaknesses  municipal bond interest income being totally exempt from all taxes and the overall complexity of the tax code as a whole  ,0,cdo77xm,1rkkst,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

CoolStoryJohn,WWII ended with two primary power brokers the US and USSR  Both countries were inherently distrustful of each other for two reasons a their systems of government capitalistdemocratic and socialistcommunist were significantly different and b after having fought a bloody prolonged war together both countries knew what the other nation was capable of militarily  It really broke down to fear  The US wanted to cement its place in the world as the sole hyperpower but the USSR threatened that designation by being so powerful itself  While initially the USSR opposed the US on more ideological grounds the belief that capitalism was a true evil and the US was the greatest exporter of this evil that opposition grew less ideological by the end of WWII less about the evils of capitalism and more about also wanting to be the worlds sole hyperpower  As the postWWII th century rolled on a lot of the world took sides  Most of eastern Europe and some South American countries allied themselves with the USSR and generally all of the western Democracies allied themselves with the US all other countries taking a wait and see stanceneutrality  Both sides fought each other through what are now known as proxy conflicts  In other words the US and USSR would find a conflict often Democracy vs Communism themed in the world and each would support whichever side more favored their interests  The side that won added credibility and power to whichever country supported them  On top of these proxy conflicts espionage was incredibly common with USSRallied spies in the west and USallied spies in the east Eventually the west realized that the USSR had achieved a status that would result in mutually assured destruction MAD if they ever launched a nuclear strike at the east  The USSR long had nuclear weapons but MAD requires more than for both sides to just have atom bombsthere need to be nukes AND a delivery mechanism that cannot be disabled in the event of an attack for example the US has planes flying and submarines operating  armed with nuclear missiles in the event of a nuclear attack on US soilso if the US is attacked it will be able to offer a nuclear response regardless of how much damage it sustains  Once the west realized that the USSR had mastered this delivery mechanism and MAD took effect the chance of a direct armed conflict between the two sides which one could argue would have been very likely if MAD was never achieved diminished to about   The result was more proxy and more espionage until eventually the USSR moreorless collapsed itself in the s a very complicated issue itself and the USallies won the cold war    ,0,cdodwm2,1rknqj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

RexMundane,Since the whole story rather confuses itself a few times most of this is interpretation as much as anything so grain of saltThere was a man named Booker and during the battle at Wounded Knee he did some very bad things On his way home he stumbles on a baptism and participates But at the last minute he resists reasoning the bad things hes done cant be washed away in a moment and a prayer He grows older becomes bitter taking a series of jobs working for ever harder and crueler men He marries but his wife dies in childbirth and in time he sells his daughter Anna to a crime boss to pay for his gambling debts Despondent with grief cynicism and drink he loses himself in his misery and ultimately forgets any happy moment he ever knew and there he remains for some  years or soDesperate again with gambling debts he takes another job to rescue a young woman from a city called Columbia which is made of buildings that float among the clouds led by the prophet Zachary Hale Comstock The young woman in question is Elizabeth Comstocks daughter locked in a tower and is herself is a bit of a mystery missing part of her little finger uncommonly intelligent and posessiong supernatural powers Rescuing her avoiding the monstrous Songbird and getting through the political struggles of a class structure at war with itself Booker and Elizabeth in order to affect their escape Booker and Elizabeth ultimately destroy the tower where Elizabeth was kept releasing all the energy that had previously kept Elizabeths diminished and she becomes in effect a kind of goddess capable of exploring alternate universes past and present And it is here Booker learns the truth Comstock is in fact Booker and Elizabeth is actually Bookers Daughter AnnaAll those years ago at the Baptism in an alternate universe there was a version of Booker who decided that yes all his cruel misdeeds could be wiped away easily That by extension perhaps any cruelty can be mitigated by circumstance and ambition that any ends can justify all means And of that mindset he pursued the construction of Columbia using the bizarre science of a physicist named Rosalind Lutece which would allow not just for levitation but crossing planes of reality To accomplish his dream he needs a daughter of his own bloodline but the scientific experiments would render him sterile and so he along with Rosalind would conspire with Robert the version of Lutece from Bookers universe to take Bookers daughter Anna Knowing this and how much trouble is caused by it all Booker realizes the only way to stop the madness and evil Comstock would eventually become responsible for is to back yet again to the baptism to go under the water and never come up again sacrificing his life which he does with the help of various iterations of ElizabethAnnaAfter all of this Booker awakens on the day he would trade his daughter Anna to the mob boss Was all of it a dream A vision of a parallel universe and bad times to come Or all a memory of a reality undone by Elizabeth ,1,cdo8bud,1rkq9z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5,4

entropydecreaser,Short answer yesEvolution occurs whenever the frequency of alleles in a population changes over time Alleles are essentially types of genes that code for specific traits For example theres an allele for black hair an allele for blonde hair and an allele for red hair The hair colour you get depends on which allele you have This is a huge oversimplification but it gives us a goodenough groundwork when talking about the theory behind evolutionThere are several things to keep in mind The first is that evolution is not only governed by natural selection There are four factors that result in evolution mutations gene flow genetic drift and natural selection Ill go through each one and discuss why humans are continuing to evolveMutations are the random introduction of new alleles in a population They arise as a result of errors in DNA replication or other factors So regardless of medicine mutations will always arise Mutations are not as significant of a factor as the other three so I wont go into detail hereGene flow is the introduction of alleles to a population because of immigration This is very significant when applied to humans Lets look at London for example A thousand years ago almost all Londoners had Caucasian alleles that coded for white skin light hair etc Now however there are people immigrating to London from around the world Im going to use India in this example So Indians move to London and are essentially adding new alleles to the population that code for brown skin black hair etc Assuming that there are whiteIndian couples their kids now have different set of alleles than Londoners would have had a thousand years ago If we go back to the initial definition of evolution regarding the change in allele frequencies in a population this clearly satisfies thatNext is genetic drift This is the random change in allele frequencies over time Though this does happen the population of humans is big enough that we can dismiss it as being not particularly influentialLastly natural selection I assume that you understand natural selection due to your question but Ill explain for any readers that might not Natural selection occurs when certain alleles are favoured over other ones in a particular environment For example in a cold environment dogs with thick fur will presumably live longer and have more offspring than those with thin fur Over time since those with thin fur die out and dont have as many kids the allele coding for thin fur disappears from the population The one coding for thick fur increases in frequency This is where medication comes in Historically diseases frequently killed many people and those that were resistant survived If we take the example of smallpox being introduced to the New World many Native Americans died but those that were resistant lived and continued to have kids and spread their alleles Thus alleles that caused a resistance to smallpox or overall better health increased in frequency Now medication erases many of these selective pressures Those with diabetes in the first world dont die as much anymore Previously alleles that caused people to be prone to diabetes would have been decreasing over time because those with that allele died young and didnt have kids Now they continue to live just like healthy people and they presumably have as kids that inherit these alleles So in a sense you have a valid point However there are plenty of diseases that we dont have easy cures for Cancer and AIDS are two examples Individuals who are resistant to HIVAIDS are presumably going to live longer and have more kids generally than those who are not resistant so we can expect certain alleles to increase in frequency over time and others to decreaseThere is one other point I want to make about natural selection There is a particular kind of natural selection called sexual selection This is when females pick their mates based on certain characteristics and those that are chosen have more kids than those who are not chosen By having more kids the alleles that coded for these characteristics are passed on Sexual selection is certainly existent in modern populations For example women often prefer men that are muscular over men that are fat Of course musculature and fat are hugely affected by lifestyle but genetics also plays a role Assuming that these muscular men have sex more and have more kids than fat men do on average then over a long period of time alleles coding for big muscles will increase and those coding for a predisposition to fat will decreaseThese are just a few of many ways in which humanity continues to evolve Thanks for the question,0,cdoa5cu,1rkw3i,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

CoolKidBrigade,It is better to turn down your heat when you are not home tldr The amount of energy it takes to bring your house from cold to warm is less than the amount of energy required to keep it warm all dayTo answer your question you need to define better Ill take better to mean wastes the least amount of energy If each technique keeps your house the same temperature when you are home the energy inside is constant what we need to compare is how much energy gets leaked outsideWhen your house is hotter inside than outside the energy heat will move from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration The warmer your house is than the outside the faster this will happen Its the same reason why you can boil water faster on a stovetop set to high than a stovetop set to mediumhigh The hotter something is like the burner the faster heat will flow from the source to the surrounding environment like the water You can look up Newtons Law of Cooling for equations that describe this effectSo when you keep the house warm all day you leak heat outside at a constant rate The only way to leak heat faster is if you heat the house above room temperature If you turn down your heat when youre gone at first the heat leaks at the same rate as a heated house but as the house cools the rate of heat leaking will slow down simply because there is less of a temperature difference between outside and inside When you need to reheat the cold house it doesnt matter that it might feel like you are using a lot of energy as you bring the temperature of the house up you are always leaking heat at a slower rate than if you kept it that temperature the entire time,2,cdoa9lq,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,30,28

TimeTravellerSmith,TLDR  Its better to turn it down if no one is in the house  If youre not running the AC youre not using electricity and if youre not running heat youre not using gas  Not using those things means you spend less month to monthIt costs money to heat the house in the winter and AC the house in the summer and either case they sit around  degF  So if no one is in the house during work hours  hours a day then its not worth paying for  hours of heatingcooling which is what just about every modern thermostat does these days  They let the house heat up in the summer and not run the AC or it lets the temp drop in the winter by not running the heat  Then they usually are set to reactivate an hour or so before you get home so the house is at  when you pull in  ,1,cdo99am,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2
brokengoose,Im going to assume that by better you mean cheaper Think about it this way is it better to turn the thermostat down if youre going out of town for a month Yes Obviously How about a week A day A few hoursIn other words whats the magic point at which it becomes better to leave the heat on The correct answer is usually Never Youll always use the least energy by turning down the heat when its not needed That usually means that its cheapest to turn down the heat whenever you leave the houseThe one exception would be if your heat comes from a source that charges different rates depending on the time of day Say an apartment with electric heat In that case if theres a huge difference in price it might make sense to keep the heat on during a cheap part of the day so that you can run the heat less during a more expensive part of the day Thats a really complicated problem to solve but fortunately it doesnt apply to most peopleA lot of people assume that when a multistage furnace kicks into high that its operating less efficiently Thats usually not true Usually a furnce churning away at full power is more efficient than one thats kicking on for a few minutes every hourEdit to add My experience is that people who argue that leaving the heat on is better are really more worried about how long it takes to heat the floors and cold corners They feel stupid arguing that turning the heat down when were gone makes it less comfortable to walk across the floor with my shoes off for a few hours so they concoct strange arguments that defy the laws of thermodynamics ,0,cdomzz0,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
DickEB,Depends on the house and the system yourre using to heat and the outside temperatureThe basic equation is thisHow long would your heater be running in order to bring the house back up to temp ltvsgt How long would your heater be running during the time you are gone  In my experience it is worth turning down the temp a bit  AC generally takes longer to cool a house a few degrees than a heater does to heat a house up a few degrees  So turning the temp up in the summer when the house is empty isnt as effective as turning down the heat in the winter  Although I think turning the temp up a few degrees is usually still economical,1,cdoa4qe,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2
SoLongFall,TLDR It is better to keep the temperature closer to outside temperatures to decrease power consumption however the benefit decreases with better insulation Edit Dont drop the temperature below  or  F to keep the pipes from freezingAlright there are several ways that your house transfers temperature but basically we have discovered that the energy in heat must go somewhere  In this case we have four ways that the heat can transferRadiation this sort of heat transfer will happen through energy carrying electromagnetic waves This is solely based upon the temperature of the object and not the surroundings The higher the temperature of the object and the more surface area the more heatenergy it will radiateConvection This is the transfer of heat through flowing winds and water This one depends upon the temperature difference of the two objectshouseoutside and the bigger the difference the faster you try to heat up the windConduction The other types of heat transfer deal with the walls and roof of your house this one deals with the flooror earth if you like living one with nature and have dirt floors  In this case the earth stays ish degrees so some of your energy is going to heating up the the surface of the floorAdvection Some of the air inside of your house goes outside taking all of that precious heat with it and some air comes inside  You will need to reheat this air and the more you have to heat it the more energy it will useNow all of this depends on heat getting to the outside walls of your house See your house is essentially two cubes with one inside of the other  The inner cube is the floor you walk on and the drywall inside of your house with that sweet wallpaper while the outside is what you show to the world as well as the foundation of your houseThe heat will move from the inside to the outside through your walls based upon the first three ways of heat transfer listed above This is where insulation comes into play The better insulation you have the slower it will move through the walls and the less the inside of your house will heat up the outside of your houseHopefully I didnt get too specific for ELI on this one but I wanted to get a bit of info on what makes up the heat loss of your house  Hope this helps,0,cdouvne,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1
Juanfro,If you turn it down while you are out the house will get cold so it will need some time to get it warm again The best option when you go out is to keep the thermostat on but maintainining a comfortable low temperature This way the house wont be freezing when you arrive and you wont spend too much energy and money,2,cdo9bjp,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,0
Xelopheris,For one you should never drop your house below a certain temperature All those pipes running in the walls of your house need to stay above freezing which means the area of your house that is actively heated needs to stay even further above thatGenerally speaking outside of a few weeks of the year your heater never turns off once it starts running If you let it drop a few degrees while youre away it saves slightly more energy during that drop as it costs to heat back up ,5,cdo9bu0,1rkxdj,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,-3

criedley,Snow is a whole bunch of individual ice crystals arranged together When a light photon enters a layer of snow it goes through an ice crystal on the top which changes its direction slightly and sends it on to a new ice crystal which does the same thing Basically all the crystals bounce the light all around so that it comes right back out of the snow pile It does the same thing to all the different light frequencies so all colors of light are bounced back out The color of all the frequencies in the visible spectrum combined in equal measure is white so this is the color we see in snow while its not the color we see in the individual ice crystals that form snowBasically if you just had a big block of ice light can pass right through it where as with snow light is being reflected and bounced around many many times through many crystals of snow,1,cdoasge,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,top_week,39,38
Nickel,Expanding on criedleys comment as to give a bit more to the reason why  Atoms arent arranged so theyre right next to each other which makes sense since atoms arent REALLY round spheres  They form a crystal they have a pattern  This pattern repeats across the structure  When light waves enter a material certain wavelengths get lost within the structure others bounce back we see the wavelengths that bounce back  The crystal repeats across the entire material so the color is consistentCompare this to snow  Each snowflake is random  The snowflakes fall in a random pile  There is no order in a snowbank  Therefore all wavelengths get reflected eventually  Resulting in whiteCompare this to ice  When water freezes the water molecules have time to align themselves as to reach a the lowest energy possible  This alignment will be the same for each water molecule  It happens that at this arrangement light waves are able to be reflected in such a way to let us see throughtldr Ice has a pattern snow does not,0,cdot5mb,1rl2xe,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

Hirodo,Well take a seat this post may take awhile  As states elsewhere each organization was originally created for a specific purposes  Sometimes these purposes could not be combined for legal reasons an issue Ill explain a little later onFirst the FBI was created as a solution to the pesky problem of gangsters and jurisdiction  During the s and s many bank robbers bootleggers and other mafioso types could keep away from the law by crossing state lines  Crossing into another state would effectively halt any chase and apprehension by the authorities in the state the crime was committed in  The FBI was created as a Federal Police like force that could continue the investigation and chase despite criminals crossing state lines  Needless to say the FBI has grown to be the go to investigative law enforcement agency dealing with high profile crimes and other federal level crimesCIA The CIA grew out of the WWII intelligence agency the OSSthink early Medal of Honor games  The CIA main goal was operational  intelligence and foreign intelligence aka spy stuff  This is still what they do  The CIA main goal is to find out what we dont know usually from the source such as agents inside the host countries and any contacts they have fostered  During the last fifty years or so the CIA has grown to not just include covert monitoring but covert action as well  The CIA Special Activities Division is very active in war zones and other countries forcing changes such as overthrows  In fact the first US forces into Afghanistan where CIA operatives from SAD  Of course any and all of this is subject to speculation  NSA This is actually a very simple agency from an overall perspective  The NSA provides intelligence both domestic and foreign by electronic means aka SIGINT  The NSA is a component of the DoDSecret Service  The Secret Service started as the law enforcement and criminal investigation arm of the Treasury Department  The Secret Service is one of the oldest forms of federal law dating back to the Civil War  Back then theyre role was slightly larger but for the purpose of being brief Ill skip that part  The Secret Service fell into the protection of the President and other VIPs after the assassination of William Henry  ATF Will talk about during Homeland SecurityHomeland Security  Now here is where everything ties together kinda  The Department of Homeland Security is just that a cabinet level Department that over sees many agencies including the Secret Service and FEMA  The main mission of Homeland Security is the internal protection of the United States by threats both domestic and foreign  Although not completely compromised of Law Enforcement Agencies Homeland Security does maintain a certain level of LE capabilities when these agencies have missions that correlate to actual security  For example the Coast Guard is now an agency of Homeland Security there main mission is domestic maritime policing or Customs and Border patrol whose main mission is security of the borders and entry points  Homeland Security agencies do not focus of the prosecution of criminals other then the ones stated above  The falls to the Department of Justice where the FBI and ATF reside  In essence the ATF is like the FBI but with a strong focus on you guessed it Alcohol Firearms and Tobacco  They do more then policing work as they also regulate the sales and transfer of such items         ,0,cdohcn1,1rl61p,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

Koooooj, PM is one hour past noon  Similarly  AM is one hour past midnight  This is a justification for why we dont call noon  oclock which would make it go  am  am  am  pm noon  That would solve one problem but introduce a new oneThat sets us up with a system that should go  am  am  m noon  pm and so on   am is clearly before noon and  pm is clearly after noon so what do we do with noon itselfIf you just look at the even hour times then it would seem that noon ought to still be AM is more similar to  and  than it is to  and  so it should get the same suffix right  However ask yourself  is  before or after noon talking about the  that occurs near mid day   is clearly after noon and thus ought to be labeled as pm  The same is true of  or   Thus if  is to be AM then we would have  AM  PM  PM and so on  Now that seems out of placeIn fact if you continue that argument then we can look at seconds as well AM  PM  PM and so on  Since noon is only a single instant in time we find that for essentially the whole th hour the time is already pm  Therefore making noon be  AM is inconsistent more so than making it be  PM is inconsistentNow there is a completely consistent solution  We can still make  hour past noon be  oclock and we can make it so we dont have that weird discontinuity from  AM to  PM  We simply call noon and midnight  oclock pm and am respectively  This is actually the most consistent is more like  and  than it is like  and  so labeling noon as  oclock PM is consistent there and  PM conveys the idea that it is  minutes past noon while  PM would suggest that its  hours after noon  This is the most internally consistent  hour clock but the existing  hour clock going from  to  instead of  to  already has too much hold for this idea to gain much tractionusing the existing clock works just fineThe other consistent solution is to do away with a  hour clock in the first place and just call midnight  oclock and count up from there  We have  am  am  pm  pm  pm and so onthe break from am to pm happens at noon if its reported at allwe never have to specify which  oclock were talking about but we dont reset the numbering an hour later so theres no problem  This clock system is arguably better than my proposed  hour clock since it removes the ambiguity of a  hour clock being used for a  hour day and it sees widespread use around the world ,0,cdoh7pc,1rl8id,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

GryphonNumber, Countries define unemployment differently Every country fudges the numbers in one way or another In America the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes  different measures of unemployment each with an increasingly expansive definition of unemployment U is the most often repeated measure currently standing at  U the most expansive definition encompasses part time underemployed workers those whove been discouraged from looking and all other marginally attached persons Its at about  When talking about unemployment across different countries you need to be sure youre looking at statistics that are actually measuring the same thing Many European countries especially the ones that are having economic troubles today have a recent history of bad government that exacerbated economic problems leading to chronic high unemployment and socioeconomic dislocation For example Spain had a fascist government until the s and around the same time Greece was ruled by a military junta Italy has had like  different Prime Ministers since it adopted its modern constitution in  By comparison America has had only  presidents over that same time frame Over time the populations in these countries got used to having high unemployment and started to consider that the norm America has grown accustomed to a certain level of affluence since World War II ended and we became the dominant military and economic power on Earth So what might be acceptable levels of unemployment in other countries isnt good enough for us And because we are used to almost total employment we never developed the expansive welfare programs that Europeans did in their effort to rebuild after WW so when someone loses their job in America it can hurt them more than in other rich countries,0,cdoy07q,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,top_week,5,5

MarginCalls,There is something called the natural rate of unemployment NRU which accounts for this in part Basically think of it this way if the economy is operating at maximum capacity everyone is working as hard as possible all businesses are operating at maximum efficiency there will still be some people unemployed due to various factors Lets look at those factors Frictional Unemployment Basically this is where people have just been layer off or quit and are unemployed but manage to get a new job fairly quickly For instance if you work for Dole selling bananas for Reddit to use as a scale in photos but suddenly a giant plantain comes along and destroys Reddits ability to use bananas as a scale thus reddit no longer uses bananas and you get layed off as a result However luckily in a  month you get hired quickly to sell bananas to truck drivers in Africa who use it to temporarily fix truck Truck differentials This is a real thing actually Thus you were unemployed for a small amount of time thus it would temporarily cause an increase in unemploymentTLDR Unemployment can vary based on how often people change jobs Structural UnemploymentPeople who cant a job but want a job They often lack the credentials to get a job or there is simply not enough jobs total for the population This is where government policy tends to come into effect a country with a very strong unemployment benefits program and other welfare might have higher rates of structural unemployment since they can rely on the programs more rather than taking a very low paying job There is also another area doesnt really fit in to these categories at all and that is people involved in illegal business or who have undeclared income A hypothetical scenario is a crack dealer who claims unemployment benefits because he has no income to report other than his illegal money Thus a country that has a large amount of people who falsely claim that they are unemployed when they are actually Meth dealing ex chemistry teachersSo I wouldnt generalize too much about the whole continent of Europe but generally European countries as a whole have stronger welfare programs and thus a higher structural unemployment that is probably one of the biggest reasons not sure about the other two Also some countries in Europe have shittier economies Though this really only makes sense if youre framing this in the context of unemployment that is most commonly used for government policy The unemployment rate used is really only helpful from a monetary and perhaps fiscal macroeconomic policy viewpoint Its not really a good measure of quality of life or an individualistic perspective of an economy ,1,cdorwr2,1rluaa,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

opensketchbook,ITT A horde of libertarians and a very narrow view Lemme balance that by giving a more leftist POVThe smallscale examples given in the other examples whereby rise in wages and rise in living expenses are directly correlated is true inside of a smallscale closed system However it fails to account for changes that occur at larger scalesFirst off you are absolutely right Just raising the minimum wage will do very little on its own However it is an important part of creating a demand side economy Youll also want to ensure business regulation will prevent monopolies from emerging in the new markets created by the new demand and you want to make sure your tax scheme is progressive enough to prevent the rich from getting so rich they flip it around again creating the situation you described So yes preventing an executive from making too much more than the workers can help but you have to be careful not to overdo it you still need investment capitalSo why have a demandside economySimply put the health of an economy is tied to the flow of money If money is changing hands it generally means things are getting done goods and services are trading hands and have good value associated with it and you have an example of the old saying A rising tide lifts all boats While the actual value of individual units of currency might change in an economy that is both growing and health purchasing power increases As growth is primarily fueled by technological innovation and doesnt really look to slow down increasing the value of labour to match is healthyThe next thing to understand is that poor people and rich people handle their money very differently Poor people they spend their money as soon as they get it on things like rent food clothes medical care etc They dont and cant hold on to very much By contrast rich people traditionally either save their money or shunt their money off into the financial sector where it is invested Ideally that money is invested in ways that enhance the economy by keeping the money flowing into businesses especially small businesses on a competitive stock market and into limited markets That dynamic of investiture is what forms the basis of the financial sector of the marketNow something interesting happens when the system gets top heavy when the richer portion of society has a disproportionately large chunk of the money compared to the poorer half like for example in a society which believes in supply side trickle down economics Essentially this causes the financial sector especially small portions of it to become bloated with capital Money is invested at a faster rate than growth can keep up with because money is not the only limiting factor on growthInvestment is rarely straightforward Oftentimes an investment is actually an investment into an investment ad nausium which is finally being invested in the actual market What happens is that large portions of the economy are segregated off circulating only in an incestuous subset of the financial industry chasing real value to be invested in for growth Other people usually middle class people who want to be rich take out loans in order to invest in these seeminglyvaluable markets Pretty soon there is more money being invested than the things are actually worth When people realize this has happened and they wont see a return on their investments the bubble popThis is known as a Bust and it involves the sudden loss of value in a market as everyone tries to get out as once This not only releases a bunch of money back into the wild leading to inflation but saddles a bunch of people with worthless investments they cant get rid of Booms and busts are commonplace in an economy without regulation they are extremely vicious creating periods of extreme growth followed by even worse depressionsSo why does this matter for minimum wageBecause the people making minimum wage dont invest in the financial market Money comes to them through their jobs and is immediately spent on stuff which pays other people their salaries so they can spend it on stuff and so on and so forth When you pay minimum wage workers more they still do that but they have more options They might be able to afford to eat out and eat better so new markets open up for restaurants and quality food They can buy electronics and entertainment so those markets expand Competition in these markets is no longer strictly a race to the bottom in terms of prices which creates a more diversified economy as luxury options move in You still have people who own those companies and make lots of money and are rich but they are not making quite as much as they were their profit margins are narrower further encouraging competition and reducing monopolization and less money is shunted off into the financial sector so booms are not so frantic and busts are not so drasticA demandside economy sees more regular stable growth in markets that are more in line with the longterm value of a market because most of the money is coming from consistent spenders the poor instead of investment chasers the rich The growth of the economy is seen directly by everyone instead of just to investors Rich people still exist and still invest providing the raw capital needed to break new ground into fresh markets and reaping the benefits but because the system is more bottomheavy investments are more metered and safer Less runaway booms and bustsEither way you get growth usually fairly comparable numbers when you look at it over long periods of time But in a supply side economy where minimum wage is low thus devaluing labour and massively increasing profits for the rich the economy spikes and drops harshly wasting capital and hurting the people at the bottom who cant afford to have their labour devalued any further In a demandside economy the growth is a steady line with little dips and rises Less money is squandered and prices are more stable so your money goes furtherSo everyone else here is absolutely right in a closed system raising the minimum wage would be meaningless But its not a closed system the economy of labour exists alongside things like financial sector like government and public spending and like the global marketTLDRHigher minimum wage and redistribution of the economy so poor people have a higher proportion of the money leads to steadier more stable economic growth with better competition by growing new markets in proportion to the consumer rather than the investor However this sort of economy also requires greater regulation and progressive taxation,3,cdott95,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,top_week,12,9

SayreFC,There are a couple points here to considerOne issue is that the government is subsidizing private companies it far too many ways  We all pay taxes that go to support services for these workers food stamps etc  Do you think its fair that people fund these services through taxes so that companies can make bigger profits  Pay their execs bigger pensions If a company survives off of paying people less than they need to survive because of a system set in place by their own lobbyists and tax breaks then I dont feel bad for them if they choose to close shop rather than run a slightly less profitable business I mean I worked at Starbucks and made a decent amount more than minimum wage and without a car and walking to work and with the cheapest apartment I could find in the walkable area I was still living just barely above water  I couldnt imagine if I had healthcare costs just talking copays and deductibles even with sbuxs has unprecedented healthcare coverage for entry level positions or kids or even had to pay for a bus pass  I have worked for many small companies over the years and I have seen it first hand  People are not hiring workers because of profit or how much they are making selling xyz They are hiring because they are selling more stuff than they can create  This happens when more people have money to spend a stronger middle class ,0,cdot21u,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

bjornartl,Minimum wage is a little bit like game theory Look at the climate debate The cold war This is why we have treaties Everyone wants to be the one that has cheaper production Or has more military force More whatever the conflict is about The solution to such conflicts are treaties where all parties decide they are better off if ALL parties involved reduce equally The reason why this is not always possible is because they cant always decide what is equal or who should be more equal than the others When it comes to minimum wage its a little easier Theres a higher power a government who can decide who what and when these treaties should count for A government could for instance enforce a minimum wage for the food industry only This would help avoid the outsourcing a lot of labor but its not like the fast food industry would stop selling food in the US Unlike a phonetech assistant these jobs require working hands on US soil Thing is that probably most work that can be done without being located in the US for less than  probably already is outsourced so you might as well not make it limited to say the food industry So wouldnt the prices go up on their products Not necessarily They dont pay people more if they make more revenue The price of labor is mostly decided by supply and demand This means that every time a nation is losing jobs and markets then there is a high demand for jobs that they can take advantage of These swings will always happen Nations change and then it takes time to adapt to new markets more suitable for their nation In the US this would probably mean a higher focus on better education towards tech and greater investment in tech development along with other particularly and less about manual labor but thats a way different discussion Point is that swings will happen and they always take time to adjust So basically it does two things  it helps reduces between classes in the US These classes are more or less made up by  stands of sociaty a people who have ownership in US companies who either succeeds in markets suitable for the US nation andor outsources b The people who work for these companies in the US because they make up a profession that is desirable to said companiesmarkets and c which is the last and lowest stand which are the people who are not desired by any of these marketscompanies but does jobs they cannot outsource Minimum wage helps the second classb but more importantly it prevents massive abuse against the third stand of society  It helps spreadread keep more money within the US Money spent towards thirdc class professions are money spent on services they more or less mustve spent money on anyways This again leads to less buyer force directed towards imported goods and pleasures Both these points are economically profitable for the US Being a first world country they are expected to have a certain amount of welfare although it is shit compared to the rest of the first worldwestern world Having more people be able to afford their daily lives through their own work is good And who pays for this The middle and upper class through the services they purchase Then less money goes overseas Now who want you to think this is a waste of money Well the upper classa first and foremost but also to a great extent class b Togather they make up a big enough voters pool so that they have a great chance and Id argue they have already to a great deal too steer politics in their own advantage through political campaigns and advertisement ,0,cdp3btr,1rlx2u,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

SnafuCoaxer,Theres a huge number of reasons for this and Ill try touch on a few but its very important to first recognize a few assumptions Firstly youre coming at this from the perspective of someone who exists postrise of the West so youre going to look at the world as being on a sort of linear progression of technology That isnt how anyone viewed technology prior to the point that it changed radically in the span of a single lifetime so around the late thearly th century Also note that to someone in the periods were talking about these sort of differences in technology might not appear to exist and technology the concept only really exists in the popular mind by the early modern ageAnyway the main reasons I can think of that Europe ended up with superior technology to much of the rest of the world Geographically Europe isnt particularly well suited to farming especially Northern Europe While there are some very productive regions theres nothing like the Mekong Delta and the continent is often too cold or the terrain too undulating to grow large quantities of crop This means that agriculture is often very difficult This has three effects firstly it means that the population is less content with an agrarianbased society secondly it facilitates trade within the region Lastly its a huge limit on the growth of urban areas So Europe is typified by very dense very small urban settlements Those geographical factors set up the perfect environment for huge economic growth If I need to buy Egyptian grain I need something Egyptians cant produce themselves like wine Using far more modern economic theory we know that the most productive trade is done between highly specialized economies with very different advantages and this leads to increased wealth for all economies involved This develops rapidly in Europe however its not going to develop as well in South East Asia or North America where food is abundant and so trade in these places becomes a largely diplomatic exercise rather than a vital force Trade is a source of imported luxury goods not a vital lifeline for the majority of the population So we know that Europe is going to be more interconnected and wealthier in the long run than many other places with abundant food and smaller trade flows  Greater trade flows means that ideas travel faster through Europe than through other locations For example if im in Peru and everything I consume is locally produced there is little need for new ideas and more importantly if i did have an innovative idea it would likely never reach say Mexico without generations of people physically migrating However an innovative farming idea in Baghdad is likely going to reach Vienna in less than a year So the research base the knowledge that youve building off is much greater in Europe especially if you view Europe as a monolithic entity Socially the Black Death creates a need to radically restructure society This leads to the Renaissance period which triggers renewed interest in the Classical world and things like philosophy This causes the Reformation which for a bunch of highly contentious reasons leads to Northern Europe developing at a very fast pace this is in a large part due to Protestantism removing much of the outerworldliness of Catholicism and much of the comfort it provided its practitioners in terms of the promise of heaven Coupled with a lack of agricultural land and an abundance of fuel sources the Industrial Revolution occurs first in the region,0,cdosar9,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,4
whatIsThisBullCrap,This is my own theory and as far as I know not commonly supported But Ill share it anyways because I think its at least a contributing factor Basically trade Specifically information trade Europe was very connected to much of the world and they were in constant contact with Arabia India China North Africa etc This meant that information most importantly technology could be shared The result of this is that technology advances faster Consider this basic example ammunition arches and plows just three random things that popped into my head are complicated technology They might each take  years to invent and perfect For a single culture to invent all three would take  years Or three different cultures could invent one each That way the whole old world has them in  years plus a couple for the information to spread Obviously technology doesnt work like this First of all it can take s of years before someone realizes the need or potential for something and then in a year it could be complete Theres also no reason you cant work on more than one piece of technology at the same time However this does demonstrate that having more peoples to invent technology that can be shared does speed of up the process On the other hand the Americans and southern Africans were more isolated In America the natives had ni contact with other peoples and even amongst themselves wasnt that common except for with a few select tribes In southern Africa it was a similar story Isolated tribes and even when Europeans began exploring the rest of the continent there was little trade as it was mostly colonozation and resourcehunting This means Americans and southern Africans didnt get the benefit of other societies inventions ,0,cdos9ks,1rmmct,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

skorps,Im not entirely sure the difference between semi auto and auto but there is a difference between single shot and semi autoauto Single shot you lock the action in place and fire and all the force as to go out the end of the barrel Semi auto and auto redirect some of the gas back to the action to blow it back which allows the next bullet to load Maybe semi auto doesnt let as much as out since the action has more time between shots Some guns also have muzzle breaks which redirect some of the gas straight up at the end of the barrel to help counteract the gun rising from recoil which you are shooting in auto ,0,cdow0cd,1rmnm1,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

TheRealAlfredAdler,This is an educated guess but in vocal music singers modify vowels Basically when sung vowels arent pronounced exactly as they would be when spoken and are typically sung longer or shorter to suit the needs of the piece This is done so that the words aurally blend better and the music sounds more pleasing If you factor out the accentbased pronunciation of vowels by modifying them to fit the tone of the piece the singers accent in and of itself is going to be dilutedIt may not make them sound more American outright but it will decrease the apparentness of their natural accent and level the playing field in terms of pronunciationIf this violates any rules feel free to delete this,1,cdotknj,1rmt71,explainlikeimfive,top_week,21,20

cc,Most of these answers suck so Im going to try to give another perspective hereThanksgiving is one of a handful of holidays that is celebrated primarily with family  As far as I can tell it is rarely seen as an actual harvest holiday my grandpas farm finishes harvest in October before the frost but rather as a time for reuniting with family and enjoying an elaborate delicious multicourse homecooked meal together  And pie thats important  It is also a time for appreciating what you have food and a family to share it with if nothing else  And despite what some here are saying it absolutely is a time to learn about and reflect on our history  The pilgrim story isnt a completely happy one but it reminds us of why people came to America to begin with and what they had to go through to survive here  It is also a time to reflect on the story of the Native Americans both how they helped the pilgrims initially and how they treated each other later  Thinking about these things helps us recognize what most of us have to be grateful for  It is also a tradition that is rooted in our history and helps preserve a sort of cultural identityIf Thanksgiving is just about football and parades to you Im sorry,0,cdp4w93,1rn00b,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

phillystix,The short answer is your brain is still developing and you are unaware of how to communicate your thoughtsA little more of an explanation movement is There are different types of memories that start at different times in a childs development Declarative memory Which is the memory youre referring to which allows us to consciously recall events and skills are still rapidly developing the first  to  years of a childs life Its not that a child doesnt have memories its that a child doesnt know how to communicate those thoughts or give them a proper language That develops by school age,3,cdoyhj9,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,top_week,21,18
psychologythrill,theres another explanation also theres this thing called object permanence which is an infants ability to represent an object in its mind To get an idea of this think of playing with a baby and his toy and then hiding the toy under a blanket until a certain age the baby wouldnt look under the blanket for the toy because it doesnt yet have object permanence or  a symbol of the toy in its mind So the theory goes that until a child acquires object permanence it wont be able to represent objectsscenarios in its mind and so wont have that kind of memoryLanguage also uses symbols the idea that a word represents a concrete thing and so another idea is that using language throughout the day will aid memory formation and so before children begin speaking their memories will be weaker evidence of this was shown in the different social environments that north american vs asian children have Its more common for NA parents to discuss the events of the day with their children what happened today what did you learn etc and this is not so common in asian cultures Theyve found that NA children have stronger and earlier childhood memories Interesting stuff,0,cdp18x4,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,top_week,8,8

SunAvatar,We dont really know exactly why but there are several proposed explanations Neurological immaturity The brain structures that form lasting personal memories are just not fully formed yet This is probably the most popular theory yet it has the problem of explaining why twoyearolds can frequently remember things that happened when they were one Emotional immaturity Emotion is heavily involved in recollection and during the first few years the brain structures that regulate emotion are still developing Supporting this theory is that the occurrence of deeply meaningful and emotional events in a young childs life such as the birth of a sibling can lead to earlier memories Repression The first few years of life are so traumatic that they are simply repressed Supporting this theory is the fact that adults who were abused or traumatized in childhood frequently have their first memories even later around  Lack of selfawareness Until a certain age toddlers dont really understand that they are a person with unique characteristics and separate from all others Until this happens toddlers can learn but they cannot construct memories that are autobiographical in the way you or I would understandThere are probably others but these are the ones I can recall from those old undergrad psych classes,0,cdpcohp,1rnevl,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,4

Kutulainen,Human brain has its own rewardpunishment systems Your brain rewards you for doing things that your instincts tell it are good things Example Eating fatty food rich in carbohydrates is very rare in natural condition think stone age people so your brain tells you damn this is good stuff eat as much as you can Same thing with grooming and playing with friends they are likely to enhance your social status and make you more likely to survive as part of a group Your brain also punishes you for doing things that it considers are bad for you This is why some things taste horrible or feel badPeople wit addiction to gambling or some other activity usually have their rewardpunishment systems slightly skewed the rewardpunishment doesnt work properly Such as giving rewards for activities that dont really benefit you or forgetting to give punishment for something that is harmful So in that way a gambler might remember only the winnings they make him feel good but forgets all the losses as these dont bring the correct punishmentreaction ,0,cdp1bjm,1rnjc0,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

flamingmanny,This is copied from another thread i saved only this excerpt so unfortunately i dont know who the original writer of this is Very informative whoever posted thisTheres actually an international classification of headache disordershttpcepsagepubcomcontentlong that classifies the different types of headaches The brain itself has no pain receptors because all pain receptors send their signals to the brain Its the thing thats doing the feeling of the pain This is why awake brain surgery works as well as it does the neurosurgeon can go in an electrically stimulate the awake brain and remove brain tissue without the patient feeling anythingAs can be seen in the ICHD there are many kinds of headaches Some are caused by muscle tension in the head and neck Others by inflammation pressing against nerves Some even caused whats called referred pain which is when it feels like the pain is in one place but thats actually a phantom pain being caused somewhere elseThe classic examples are heart attacks and icecream headaches In icecream headaches the rapid cooling of blood vessels in the throat and mouth stimulate the trigeminal nerve which brings in pain information from the head making it feel like your head is in pain when the stimulation is actually happening in the mouthFor other headaches its good to know about the three protective layers called meninges that cover the brain thepia mater soft mother which adheres to the brain and is very fine the arachnoid layer which sort of provides a barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and the rest of the circulatory system and the dura mater hard mother which feels very leathery like bat wings and holds in the cerebrospinal fluidThese meninges also help form the blood brain barrier and cover a lot of the fine blood vessels that supply the brain with bloodBoth the blood vessels and meninges have pain receptors The pain receptors in these regions can be stimulated by a lot of things For example meningitis is when these become enflamed due to infection This inflammation is painful due to the stretching and pressure Similarly pressure changes brought about by dehydration or changes in blood salinity or what have you like in a hangover can also cause pain that we feel as headachesSo in short theres not one kind of headache and sometimes even though a headache feels like its located in one place its not really because of the phantom stimulation from referred pain,13,cdp2rr0,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,65,52

doctoranonymous,Headaches are basically pain referred outside from any damage or irritation to structures inside your head other than brain mostlyBecause brain itself is insensitive to pain and even if touched directly it can only cause funny sensations in the areas of the body represented by that portion that is touchedWhereas the layer covering the brain which holds the blood vessels are very sensitive As someone mentioned earlier hangover headaches are from hereToo much alcohol too much byproducts and even constipationcauses toxic products in the vesselsirritation of vesselsHeadacheIn Migraine too much emotion and tension will make the blood vessels go crazy which get tired and become flaccid and blood keeps gushing in causes it to stretch more including the layer covering brainHeadacheEmotional headaches are when muscles of scalp and neck spasmie when muscles get too stressed out lactic acid is produced which causes pain but still it feels like your head hurts from inside because all types of headaches are referred outside and feels the sameIcecream headache is just referred pain from your palateI dont know if I ve  put it right but thats all I know,0,cdp5y8t,1rnl1h,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Itwasntmehonest,The parts that go into a PC all conform to agreed upon standards  What the parts do where they go what the connector looks like how the power is attached  All standardized  You can almost think of the various components like lego bricks  You buy a selection of the right color and shape and plug them togetherThe software environment is also standardized  The main board or motherboard for example has software on board the BIOS that can recognize keyboards and video cards can access the hard drive and read a DVD ROM  This means you can take your Operating System eg Windows DVD ROM pop it in the drive poweron and your system will install itselfWhen Windows is done installing it will often be able to use all your devices either immediately or once you pop in the driver disk for your new video card  If the video card or printer manufacturer have done a good job then this should be trivial  Device manufacturers write software for Windows based on Microsoft published specifications and then have to pass a set of tests called certification in order to publish their device software  Things can still go wrong  if the manufacture hasnt done good quality assurance then bugs can get through that can crash the operating system omg Windows suxorz uh no  Usually though things just work almost like magicConsoles arent like that  Consoles are not like lego sets put together with welldefined pieces that can be plugged in and out Typically the insides of a console are rigid  they cant be changed  Theyre put together in one configuration and cant be changed  This does two things First it keeps the costs down Making a mainboard with all the components fixed is cheaper than building individual components and connecting them  Second it presents a fixed configuration to the games companies  They can write their game knowing that it will always work at these graphics levels and at this resolution  They dont have to build the flexibility to work with  years worth of different graphics card performance  They can tweak and tune their game graphics so it looks as good as possible without risk of some unexpected variable old busted graphics card coming in and ruining the experienceOn the software side the operating system will be hardcoded in the platform and cryptographically signed which means it contains a magic number that mathematically proves the software came from the vendor  This doesnt mean its not upgradable just not upgradable by you  You cant but the OS install on a DVDConsole vendors often make either miniscule profit or an actual loss on the console itself in order to get it out in the world in mass quantities ie they cant price it too high otherwise people wont buy it  They actually make their money on games  Every game you buy a slice will go to the console vendor and thats what makes the whole enterprise a viable business  The console vendors then cant have people installing unlicensed software on the machine as that would defeat the business model  So signed binaries are everywhereSome people might argue that Its my machine and I should be able to do what I want  Uh no  Not when youre buying  of hardware for   If you want to tinker get a PC,0,cdp3wuh,1rnq48,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

sirsri,Those questions are hard to answer  Partly because we dont know exactly what independence would mean  Scotland is a relatively poor part of the UK that has benefited quite a lot from payments from the central government over the centuries for things like health care and roads etc   But it has oil reserves well some anyway which have inflated GDP lately  So first thing  scotland only has about  million people of the UKs  ish  So if they leave in the grand scheme of things it wont make much differenceBut how oil revenues are carved up would be non trivial as would how the territory is split  There no answer here because it hasnt been decided  Presumably scotland would get most of the oil as most of it is close to scotlandgtstandard of living etcIn the long run its bad for scotland  It wont matter much to the UK  Unlike Ireland which was a rd world country caused by deliberate UK policy attached to europe when it got independence Scotland is overall well off  That would start to gradually erode as the practical realities of trying to do business in scotland sink in  Without oil they dont have anything and while they could try and set themselves up as an Ireland like english speaking tax haven how many more tax havens does europe need or want and if they cant be a tax haven what are they  There isnt a critical mass of people for any meaningful industry anymore and trying to use the Euro or the pound would turn them into a greece or spain   For a little while it would all seem rosy as the ship building and the IT sector seemed great and then the problems of goods and people across borders the currency imbalances etc would all sink ingtetcThe etc is really the main question  Unlike just about everyone else who has asked for and gotten independence scotland is not particularly culturally distinct from the UK on a day to day basis  At least not anymore  They all speak the same language albeit with an accent they go to similar jobs they live in similar houses they already have representation in government they go home and watch TV and play games and go to bars and pubs etc in much the same way as their english counter parts  The scottish are not particularly committed to one religion that is being oppressed by another or any of that  So what do they get  Somewhat like Canada and australia and new zealand they get to waste a pile of money having independent foreign policies which almost no one in the world cares about because theyre too small to matter and most of the serious important issues it will get to spend a pile of money to feel good about itself for agreeing to do what everyone else sane is doing anyway  Made worse is that scotland is never going to get much bigger  While Canada and Australia could conceivably pass England in population by the end of the century or so scotland is going to be well small  The UK has military bases in Scotland and Scotts serve in the  British military that would change and less money in one pot will make it a bit harder to have major military assets like aircraft carriers and airplane RampD and that sort of thing   That weakens the UK a little bit but makes scotland basically irrelevant in the world  If the EU got its act together into a single megastate it basically wouldnt matter at all  It would be like splitting New York state in half  You can or you cannot in the end it doesnt make much difference to anyone  Arbitrary lines on a map are arbitrary  NB Im in Canada we have our own separatists in Quebec who do seem to be culturally different from the rest of us in Canada  But on the whole Canadian independence hasnt actually gotten us much  It makes us feel good about ourselves but thats about it ,1,cdp3qp0,1rnq5q,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,0

Shmalpin,The blood flowing to your legs has the benefit of the heart pumping it there  Once blood is there it needs the action of leg muscles to help pump it back to the heart  Locking your knees makes standing upright and still easier but decreases the use of your leg muscles in standing This causes the blood to pool in your legs effectively taking it out of circulation    Less blood in circulation means less oxygen getting to the brain  When the brain senses a dangerous drop in oxygen you pass out  An intuitive way of conceptualizing it blood flow isnt fighting gravity when everything is on the same level  By passing out your brain gets itself the legs and the heart all on the same plane so no more relying on leg muscles to overcome gravity    Long story short its not the locking of the knees that causes fainting  Its the pooling of the blood in the legs that can accompany long periods of standing without engaging the muscles that gets you  There are no blood vessels being pinched off when you lock your knees ,0,cdpfiyn,1rnr8z,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

SirEbonwolf,Im not  sure but as Ive always understood it has to do with the concertration of oxygen in the atmosphere That in the prehistoric period there was more oxygen that let animals grow to extreme sizes and still be able to easily get enough oxygen out of breathing as the larger an animal is the more oxygen it needs to fuel its cells As far as I know whales can get around this by not having the same type of extremities like arms and legs They do not need these as they are suspended in the water getting air to these extremities is harder than getting it to central parts of the body so as the oxygen concertration has decreasedanimals with extremeties like arms and legs have become smaller over the generations,2,cdp8kyp,1ro239,explainlikeimfive,top_week,16,14

MayContainNugat,Common Law is the law developed over generations by judges over a long period of time Its the law built up from long traditions and precedents that exists prior to legislative bodies passing specific statutes The English common law developed in the Middle Ages and forms the basis of law in England and its former colonies including the US Except for Louisiana whose common law derives from FranceFor instance under English common law a couple is married when they live together for a certain period of time and hold themselves out to the community as man and wife Legislatures in most jurisdictions however have overridden common law by passing statutes requiring a marriage license issued by the state to be considered married  ,0,cdpa7r1,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,4
carlfish,As far back as the middle ages legal disputes between individuals in Britain were decided by taking them to courts adjudicated by judges appointed by the crown Judges appointed by the King or Queen would literally travel from town to town hearing cases and passing down judgements In the absence of a comprehensive statutory code judges would base their decisions on their understanding of how the law should work and how judges before them had decided similar casesOn their return to London courts would record their judgements and the reasoning behind them and share them with their fellow judges That way when a judge encountered a similar case on their circuit they would be able to decide it consistently with the last judge who had decided that case Alternatively a senior judge might overrule their junior and create a new precedentThe Common Law is the result of these thousand years of legal decisions Judges in Common Law jurisdictions are expected to decide cases consistently with their predecessors and in turn pass on how they interpret the law in newly arising circumstances to their successorsHow legitimate the Common Law is depends on your jurisdiction The degree to which the Common Law is adopted in your local legal system is determined by your local laws Especially different countries tend to clearly mark where their local system of precedent diverges from the British system they inherited it from  decisions before that date being binding legal precedent and decisions after that date only being suggestions on how the law might be interpreted The only consistent rule is that statutory law always overrules Common Law so once a government passes a law then all other precedent is overruled,0,cdpge46,1rodcd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

BassoonHero,There is a lot of mythology about this so Ill try to post a complete answer This brushes on some old holy wars so please read the whole thing before leaving angry commentsThe first important point is that a virus is a specific type of malware A virus exploits holes in an operating system to spread itself from system to system You might get a virus from an infected disc or flash drive or from another system on your network If you install it yourself then its not a virus even if you were tricked into installing it A piece of malware disguised as something innocuous is called a trojan horse or just a trojan for shortThere is a variety of trojan horse malware out there for the Mac OS for Windows and even for Linux However there are few viruses that will infect modern Windows and none that affect the modern Mac OS For Windows this has not long been the case A decade ago Windows viruses abounded and users had to be very careful to keep up with software updates and to run antimalware programs At the same time there were still no Mac OS X viruses in the wildCommon internet wisdom holds that this is because the Mac OS was far less popular at the time so no one tried to write a virus for it While intuitively appealing this explanation is faulty for several reasonsFirst it strains ones credulity to suppose that this could explain a total lack of viruses for Mac OS X Surely someone somewhere would have seen that while the Mac market was smaller it was also ripe for subversion Mac users of the time were justifiably if irritatingly smug about not needing to run antivirus programs If there had been no additional hurdles to creating a Mac OS X virus then it should have been easier to infect Macs because their users were not accustomed to taking precautions Moreover surely some ambitious hacker must have realized the infamy that writing the first virus for OS X would bringSecond the prevalence of other types of malware such as trojan horse software has increased as the Macs market share waxes Its commonplace to hear that yet another Macbased trojan has been spotted in the wild yet still not a single virus If the Macs market share is sufficient to attract trojans then why not virusesThird the true cause is evinced by a decline in Windows viruses over the past several years True Windowss market share has declined somewhat but the number of true viruses has dropped precipitously The drop is all out of proportion to the fall in market share and crucially the prevalence of viruses for other platforms such as Mac OS X has not increased to make up for itSo if we can eliminate market share as the cause then what Well the answer is simple if sadly contentious During the dark ages of Windows viruses the Windows OS was far more vulnerable to viruses than either its contemporaries or the modern Windows OS The malware explosion that accompanied the rise of internet use among ordinary users hit Windows the hardest because Windows was the easiest OS to write a virus for The subsequent decline of true viruses came as Microsoft worked to close security holes retire old APIs and generally modernize their OSIn a way its only by happenstance that the Mac OS avoided this The classic Mac OS versions  predated Windows and by the late s it was showing its age It was designed for a world where a personal computer had a single trusted user Where this assumption was violated there were security holes And there were definitely viruses although in those days you were more likely to catch one from a friends floppy disk than from the internet There were also myriad technical limitations that are welldocumented elsewhere So Apple decided to replace the OS wholesale This was a long and painful process and an interesting one if you find this sort of thing interesting but in the end they had OS X a modern multiuser UNIXbased OS And no virusesWindowss evolution took a more gradual path Windows NT New technologies was in some technical respects a dramatic step forward but Microsoft was very careful not to move too fast lest compatibility problems alienate their users Apple on the other hand maintained compatibility by requiring their users to emulate the classic OS within OS X an approach that infuriated users but allowed Apples engineers to make a much cleaner break with the bad old daysSo during the dark ages Mac users had a brand new modern OS whereas Windows users had an aging singleuser OS full of holes that Microsoft was working to plug Today Windows is a different animal  Microsofts strategy of replacing the planks as the ship sailed seems to have mostly worked And a modern Windows PC is very unlikely to get a computer virus But people remember a time not too long ago when this was not the case and the impressions left by that era linger on in the popular consciousness,1,cdpfkns,1roy3o,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,2

liquefaction,Awareness does help but there are many other factors I believe theres been a steep increase over the last  years that is only now becoming public knowledge Children have more sensitive immune systems than adults and those who have spent their whole lives only eating lots of unfermented gluten from a few strains have a more severe immune system reaction than adults who ate less gluten grew up on fermented gluten and ate more diverse gluten For starters we are overexposed to gluten  we eat more processed foods than we did in the past Gluten is also added to more foods than ever because its cheap Its cheap because it stores well and its subsidized While in the past we ate many different strains of wheat currently we eat only a few strains Modern wheat is bred to be extremely high in gluten because gluten is great for texture The way we process wheat has also changed Commercial yeast wasnt developed until the s Before that wheat had to be fermented to help it rise A starter was created for this purpose Starters are usually made from flour and water The flour and water would be naturally colonized by local bacteria which would be fed with more flour and water on a regular basis or less often for sourdough and these bacteria are what caused dough to rise That starter was used to make each loaf of bread The bacteria served another helpful function as well  to break down the harmful substances in grains by digesting them and leaving behind harmless substances humans can digest easily Theres a good reason grain is a common allergy Like animals plants can have defenses Not all though  some plants like fruits want to be eaten Their seeds are spread through feces so it makes sense for them to be delicious and not cause issues in things that eat them Unsprouted grains however die when eaten so they developed a hull as a defense That hull contains phytic acid which blocks absorption of calcium iron and other nutrients we need Its called an antinutrient for that reason Another mildly toxic substance in seeds is lectin In small amounts these substances wont cause permanent issues just some mild stomach upset in those not accustomed However when eaten multiple times a day our bodies sometimes start to react Another thing makes lectins and antinutrients in grains more harmful today than in the past Grains were left in the fields to sprout long ago Just like fruit now is picked before its ripe followers of modern agricultural methods dont allow the grain to sprout as sprouted grain goes bad more quickly Sprouted grain also contained fewer of these antinutrients as it doesnt need the defenses that a seed does Even in people who arent intolerantallergic gluten causes inflammation due to this toxic substance as well as lectins This inflammation causes the intestines to swell The swelling causes tiny holes to be opened When this happens tiny particles of food leak outside of the intestines where theyre supposed to be into the body At this point our body sees the particles as foreign invaders and begins to attack them This is called Leaky Gut Syndrome and is in debate within the medical community but many people myself included have seen relief by avoiding substances that cause inflammation Had I waited around for doctors to figure out what was wrong with me Id still be too sick to leave the house If you think about how your immune system is designed to react to a tiny germ its easy to understand how a tiny particle of gluten could cause a reaction as well Our bodies are reacting to what they see as a constant poisoning by doing what they are supposed to do  trying to make us stop eating something thats bad for us ,7,cdph6p4,1roydh,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,-6

defguysezhuh,When calling  in the United States DeafHardofHearing DHH people have several options links to additional information are included as I go along Video Relay Service VRS amp Video Phones VP  They can use VPs to call  immediately via VRS  Basically the DeafHardofHearing person will dial  over the video phone a certified sign language interpreter will respond first and then dial  is dialed immediately via telephone line in a way conference call deaf person to interpreter to dispatch  The FCC also requires that all VP users have the address of wherever the VP unit is located at home or at a business registered on that account so that when dialing  the interpreter can immediately relay that address to the  dispatch operator after the victim has explained the emergency  The address being programmed into the VP is not only a timesaver when dealing with emergencies but is also provides clear and direct communication when a DeafHardofHearing person like anyone in an emergency situation may be panicking and would likely stutter with their own signs or their minds go blank while trying to remember the address  For more information on how VPs amp VRS work you can check out Purple Communicationshttppurpleus or Sorenson Communicationhttpwwwsorensoncom which are two of the larger VRS providers in Florida with Sorenson being the largest provider in the USA I believe TTYTDD amp Text Relay Services  Just to avoid confusion TTY and TDD are the same thing in this context but have two different names for the same device  Some people know it better by one name over the other so I included both though I will refer to it as a TDD from here on out  Moving on its been pointed out that TTYsTDDshttpenwikipediaorgwikiTelecommunicationsdevicesforthedeaf are an outdated technology  For the most part this is true  A DHH person who knows how to sign is more likely to be using the previously mentioned VPs to contact other DHH friendsfamily members and using VRS services to call everyone else from doctors to employers to their local pizza delivery place  However not all DHH people know sign language  As such these people have a tendency to rely on TDDs to communicate with one another or make their relay calls  Instead of a sign language interpreter relaying the calls they will get an operator on another TDD who will then pipe through to the landline to whoever the DHH person is calling and voice whatever is being typed on the screen for that DHH person  The operator will then type everything being spoken back to the DHH person as if they were speaking to that person directly  So its the same idea as calling  on a VRS call but using text instead of video for those who cannot sign Captioned Telephones If you still use a landline telephone you can use a CapTelhttpcaptelcom phone which is a telephone with a large digital screen that allows a person who speaks but still has some degree of hearing loss usually a HardofHearing person and not a Deaf person  Basically youll call someone and a silent operator will automatically pick up while your outgoing number is being dialed  Using speech recognition software everything being spoken by the person youre calling will be captioned live on your CapTel phone similar to subtitles on a TV with the silent operators ONLY job being to correct errors made by the speech recognition software  Recently Sprint created a CapTel mobile apphttpwwwsprintcaptelcomwirelesscaptelsprint so people can use their smartphones to make captioned calls wirelessly as well and have their calls captioned on their smartphone screens instead of relying on a landline  Same principle as using the TextVideo Relay Services but you wont have an operator talking for you  Youll be talking for yourself so less delay in  calls Text Messages  This is still in the works  SOME cities in the United States have now begun doing text messages to  because they recognize that making a phone call in an emergency situation can give away your location if youre a victim of attack and trying to hide eg school shootings muggings home robberies rape etc so this is extremely beneficial not only to DHH but also to hearing people as well  The FCC has a whole page answering your questions on how Texttohttpwwwfccgovtextto is being set up through mobile carriers and when they expect it to be up amp running  However as uMastersInDisasters points out SMS as it is defined now is NOT a reliable protocol If possible use voice I hope this information helpsTLDR  We have several options Videophones TTYTDDs Captioned Telephones and Text Messages limited locations only for texts but slowly expandingSource Im a Deaf Social Worker who currently works in the DHH community and Ive been DHH all my life born HardofHearing then it gradually declined as I got older now I consider myself Deaf,14,cdpllpg,1royox,explainlikeimfive,top_week,76,62

plasticluthier,Ill explain it to you haw it was explained to me when I was about Three sets of forces are happening while youre sailing a boat   You have the wind pushing on the sail  You have a centerboard that stops the boat just going sideways because of the wind  The boat prefers to go forwards rather than backwards because of its shapeNow when youre sailing across the wind or into the wind you can imagine all of these forces as your thumb and index finger squeezing a cherry If you squeeze directly from the sides the cherry stone wont go anywhere but if you squeeze from the back the stone will come out of the front Its the same with sailing the wind pushes on the sails the boat tries to move sideways but the centreboard stops it and the only place left for all that force to go is into making the boat move forwards Now you cant sail straight into the wind the forces wouldnt balance out and there would just be an almighty flapping noise backwards motion and possibly mild panic before you realise the steering is now backwards too So to balance all the forces you zigzag into the wind turning the front of the boat through the wind every time you want to turn This is called tacking Now sails are tight in when youre going into the wind completely out when youre going away from the wind and pulled in until they stop flapping at all other points generally the position of the centreboard matches the position of the sails If you need to know any more Id suggest going sailing I have no idea what AC is ,3,cdpj6al,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,1

Dirtybirdy,The sail essentially acts like a wing and generates lift based on air traveling  in turbulent flow on one side and laminar flow on the other Just like on a plane wing if air moves faster over one side the pressure will be different on either side and the boat is essentially sucked forward many boats can actually sail faster and more smoothly up wind than downwind This is why boats can sail into the wind even with only one sail The truth of the matter though is that modern computational methods arent advanced enough to theoretically model and calculate turbulent flow too many millions of molecules acting independently in seemingly random directions and the majority of sailing design like Sail shape and curvature is almost entirely empirical Ie Based on peoples personal experience and then fine tuning to obtain slightly better results ,0,cdpnr00,1rp2jd,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

MINTBERRYcrunch,For me I noticed this lung burning happened when I did not properly warm up my lungs to the air intake required during running which is more than when standing still sitting or walking A slow jog before running will raise your heart rate and breathing rate steadily rather than jumping right up to a running pace This will allow for a more controlled and comfortable run letting your body reach its maximum potential the legs tiring in this instance This is why warming up and cooling down is so crucial to a good work out or run,1,cdpjus9,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,9,8
fouzzz,EDIT Totally misread your question but I already typed this all up so Ill leave it for whoever is interestedI thought you were referring to a burning sensation in your legs before you tire OopsIm not an expert but I think youre referring to the effects of the build up of lactic acidAs I understand it when your body cant deliver enough oxygen to your muscles it temporarily forms lactate which helps break down glucose and give you energy However one of the downfalls of this process is that youll eventually experience increased acidity levels in your muscle cells hence lactic acid Now the whole process doesnt work very well in acidic environments so the whole process is hindered and this is where youll tend to get that muscle fatigue feeling This is all done as a natural mechanism to prevent muscle damage caused by overexertion Once your body slows down oxygen becomes more available and the whole system sort of reverses itself and everything is back to normalTLDR When oxygen is limited your body resorts to other means that provide a temporary fix but this process naturally halts and reverses itself before the quick fix causes any permanent damage ,10,cdphypn,1rp5hk,explainlikeimfive,top_week,15,5

computervirologist,Computer viruses fall under the category of malware or malicious software Even though viruses are commonly used as a term to refer to any type of malware a computer virus is technically a computer program that attaches itself to other programs A computer virus is usually an executable file that when executed will usually perform the following tasks  search for other files on the computer if the file is a program copy the viruss code to that program execute a payload which may or may not be destructiveOnce a program gets a viruss code injected into it it becomes an infected program An infected program when executed will run the virus code first before running the original code of the programSince viruses only infect files when theyre executed they rely on user interaction in order to spread Each time you execute the virus or a program infected with the virus any new programs that were not infected before will become infected now Keep in mind though that unless the virus has elevated privileges it can only infect programs that the current user has writeaccess to An antivirus virus is a program that spreads like a virus but when its code is executed it will detect and remove any virus that has attempted to infect it Think of it like a chain virus antivirus virus original program First the virus code will run then the antivirus virus code will run and remove the virus attached in front of it then the original program will run Antivirus viruses are just one of many of a concept for good viruses and are not widely used Besides viruses there are also computer trojans spyware ransomware backdoors worms and fork bombsTrojans are rogue programs they are programs that claim to do one thing but instead do something else For example many trojan programs ironically claim to be antivirus software but in reality they have malicious payloads such as downloading more malwareSpyware is any program that collects users personal data without their knowledge and consent Spyware programs may run in the background silently while monitoring the user In fact many trojan programs can also be classified as spyware if they carry this feature ransomware will deny access to your computer or data unless you pay a ransom Cryptolocker for example will encrypt the users files and ask for payment in exchange for the password to decrypt the files The password for decryption is stored on the hackers computer and the hacker will not send the password unless you pay up backdoors classify a feature of malware that allows the program to give remote control of the computer to the hacker Many computers installed with backdoors usually part of a botnet A botnet is a collection of computers compromised with backdoors which can all be controlled en masse by a single person usually for the purpose of overloading internet traffic to a bring a website down A worm is an autonomous computer virus Unlike computer viruses worms do not require human interaction in order to spread Worms usually have a database of exploits to use in order to find loopholes in networks for spreading When a worm is running on a computer it will execute any payloads it has and then try to enumerate over any computers in the same local network as its host It may try to scan the software ports of the neighbouring computers it finds to determine if there are any exploitable networking software on those computers Once it finds a host with vulnerable software the worm will run the appropriate exploit to transfer itself to that computer Viruses and worms naturally develop a mutual relationship Multiple viruses may infect a worm allowing the viruses to be transported across networks Once the worm reaches a destination the viruses copy themselves to that machine too You can think of the viruses as piggyback riding on the worm to spread at a faster rate Any worm infected with a virus is known as a mutated wormFinally the one of the simplest of all malware is the fork bomb Fork bombs simply replicate instances of themselves in order to saturate computer memory and system resources The result of fork bombs is the entire system becoming unresponsive requiring a hard reboot If a fork bomb is configured to always run when the system loads the computer will crash every time it is turned on The solution to removing a fork bomb configured for start up is to boot to an alternate operating system and modify the system files of the original operating system ,1,cdpiayi,1rp7ms,explainlikeimfive,top_week,6,5

diMario,Quantum mechanics or more broadly quantum physics studies matter on the level of elementary particles It turns out that strange things happen when you dig down to a smaller and smaller scale of thingsFor instance electric things In everyday life you can have a light bulb rating  Watt  Watt  Watt and so on If Philips were so inclined they could easily make a light bulb rating  watt or  Watt In every day life things happen on a sliding scale A certain property can have a value of  or a value of  or any other value in between  and Not so in quantum physics When you look at things in a smaller and smaller scale the properties that you measure take on distinct values For electric current for instance you can measure a flow of  unit of charge per second or you can measure a flow of  units of charge per second but you cannot measure a unit of  charge per secondThis is explained by theorizing that electric charge in everyday life is made up by the sum of a bunch of very small but distinct elementary electric charges of which you can have either  or  but not one and a halfIn order to describe this phenomenon physicists say that electric charge is quantized from which comes the quantum part of the nameNow as it turns out not only electric charge but practically all properties of matter that you care to study exhibit this behaviourOne of the theoretical consequences is that when speaking about properties on the quantum scale of things you cannot deal in certainties but only in probabilities When I perform a thousand measurements in a certain quantum physical experiment Ill find that roughly  times the outcome is  and  times the outcome is  But when I perform a single measurement I cannot predict whether the outcome is  or  Weird isnt itQuantum physics solves this weirdness by assuming that before the measurement the property I am about to measure is  and  both at the same time Only after I have measured it the quantum system has decided whether it was  or This means that only after I observe a system the system decides what value it will show me Thus it is said that reality the value of the property is influenced by observation the fact that I measure it,1,cdpij2p,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,11,10
QuigleyQ,I suppose it would be best to start with a brief historyWhat is light Some people such as Newton believed that light was made of tiny particles corpuscles that were fired off by the light source This explains why light goes in a straight line and how it is reflected off surfaces at the same angle But this does not explain how light is refracted through a prism for example Why would some particles bend more than others This could be corrected for by assuming that these corpuscles speed up when passing through glass Still there are other phenomena that the particle theory does not describe such as diffractionEventually physicists came to support a different theory of light Instead of discrete particles light was a wave Not like a water wave though this wave only moved tranversely like sohttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonscElectromagneticwaveDgif This explained light much better than the particle theory The most striking example is in diffraction Imagine you have a solid sheet of metal with two slits cut in it a sensor screen some ways behind it and you shine a light onto this contraptionhttpwwwempiricalzealcomwpcontentuploadsdoubleslitboxjpg If light were a particle you should see two bars on the sensor like thishttpstephenwhittfileswordpresscomdoubleslitbulletsjpgw because the particles go through and continue going straight However if light were a wave the sensor would have a more complicated patternhttpgradphysicssunysbeduamarchintgif because the waves interfere with each otherhttpwwwatomunifrankfurtderesearchsynchrotronphotonmoleculeHdoubledoubleslitdoubleslitplanewavegif It turns out when you do this experiment that you get the interference pattern Coupled with the fact that you can explain pretty much all properties of light this theory is pretty convincing So its settled light is a wave rightThe challenge to this theory came from an unexpected direction When you heat up an object it emits light And physicists had equations to predict how much light of a particular frequency While these worked well for low frequencies they predicted that objects emitted infinite energy in the higher ones Clearly this is wrong Planck showed that this problem does not occur if light comes in discrete quantities Other properties such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering are also well described if light comes in lumps So are we back to the particle theory again If we are how do we explain the doubleslit experimentLets go back to it again If it is really a particle then why does the interference pattern form Say we place detectors at the slits If light is a wave then itll trigger both If its a particle itll just trigger one When we do this we see that only one is triggered So light is a particle But when you check the screen the interference pattern has disappeared and two stripes show up instead So we take away the detectors and try again Now it reappears If words dont cut it for you watch thishttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonseeWaveparticledualityogvWhen we watch the slits light behaves like particles When we dont it behaves like waves How can we reconcile these two behaviors The answer is light behaves like some very unintuitive thingQuantum physics is the study of how on earth this works This waveparticle duality only seems to show up for small objects think on the scale of atoms Some of the consequences of this include Objects exist in a superpositionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumsuperposition of all possible states weighted towards the more likely ones Measuring the object collapses this superposition to a more defined state The more preciselyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHeisenberguncertaintyprinciple you measure the position of an object the less you know about its momentum Occasionally objects can tunnelhttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumtunneling across gaps or barriers that they otherwise could not cross You can entanglehttpenwikipediaorgwikiQuantumentanglement two particles so that measuring one disturbs the other regardless of how far apart they are,0,cdpuf79,1rp7qb,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2

Samatdal,The answer to this is actually quite simple The two divisions of your autonomic nervous system are the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic You can think of autonomic as meaning happens automatically such as breathing and other autonomic processesThe sympathetic nervous system when activated provides fight or flight stimuli such as increased heart rate constricting pupils etcThe parasympathetic nervous system activates rest and digest stimuli such as decreased heart rate and increased digestion Nicotine acts on nicotinic receptors present on neurons all over your body The receptor carries out a parasympathetic tone So the nicotine is directly stimulating an increase in digestion increase in gastrointestinal motility and therefore makes you have to pooHope that helps,0,cdpp7x8,1rp80o,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

YourDoubt,Actually the very front is the most losable part of brain tissue to keep you alive to say nothing of the Circle of Willis which is more at the base of the front The Brainstem is typically where the respiratory and other vital maintenance areas are if you take this out you will definitely die An interesting example of losing a large chunk of the Frontal lobe is Phineas GagehttpenwikipediaorgwikiPhineasGage What is important to note is that the brain is incredibly vasculated if you knock out a vessel which is likely you not only have to deal with the blood loss to vital regions of the brain but the blood itself is incredibly neurotoxic and before that you have to deal with inter cranial pressureof course if you have a bullet wound you likely have a shunt already formed for the blood to come out Also you have to understand that some bullets can create a shockwave of force that can travel through the body itself and cause damage in areas not local to wound itself There is also the issue of the brain having a completely different immune system so you may have to deal with an incredible infectionSo to recap if you survive the trauma of bloodloss toxic damage from blood and intracrainial avoid widespread tissue damage from the bullet traveling through the brain and bouncing aroundthis can happen with  caliber bullets its a not uncommon method of execution in the underworld of our society have ALL the bullet fragments miss your medulla you could survive But what happens next if you survive Well it can go either two ways essentially Either you may go the way of SchiavohttpenwikipediaorgwikiTerriSchiavocase in which case are you really living This is an incredibly controversial case which I dont even want to touch here And the other is the way of GiffordshttpenwikipediaorgwikiGabrielleGiffordsAttemptedassassination great recovery These are two extremes in terms of brain recovery after massive trauma and have various shades of prognosis depending on where and how the injury was formed The brain has incredible plasticity in repair but it is not without limits,0,cdpjqyb,1rpdhm,explainlikeimfive,top_week,3,3

redrew,I had a commuted fracture of the third metacarpal of my left hand back in April In my experience the point of the fracture is the origin point of the pain And boy did it hurt like a bitch As mentioned by uMomotsuki and others the pain is actually caused by the nerve fiber that runs the length of the bone carrying impulses to the muscles along said bone and returning sensory information back to the brain The bones themselves contains no nerves Aside from the spine but thats different as the spinal column isnt a single bone but many discs stacked on one another hollow on the inside so that the spinal nerve can be protected and flexibility is still possibleAs far as anecdotal experience is concerned you know for certain if you have a broken bone just by the pain alone It starts as a very intense stabbing feeling at the point of the fracture Inflammation occurs rapidly resulting in swelling and a throbbing ache as the surrounding tissue attempts to stabilize the bones My hand injury had to be treated with an Open Reduction Internal Fixation ORIF technique where an orthopedic surgeon had to make an incision into the back of my hand reduce the fracture so that the two bone fragments were aligned properly then insert a steel pin inside the bone to keep the two pieces together while they healed Fortunately everything went fine in my case and my hand works just as well as it ever did Cue masturbation jokes,0,cdpq2mz,1rpdms,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

yakusokuN,First of all before answering any of the questions let me emphasize that the things that nonAmericans see are highly atypical and not representative of what happens everywhere  Theres  million or so of us and if you see  people acting crazed thats one person in a million  You arent seeing the vast majority of the other calmer bored tired shoppers who wait patiently in long lines in stores where nothing happens  These things dont make the news  gtIn such videos people always seem to be grabbing items at random Is this true Or do they have specific items in mindIn the videos you see they probably arent grabbing things randomly but theres so many people that its hard to calmly make your way through the crowd and tapping someone on the shoulder and saying pardon me can you pass me one of those  They most likely have items in mind but the craziest people seeking out the best deals are usually after expensive large items like television sets and its difficult to just grab one of the shelf tuck it under your arm and get out of the waygtIf theyre grabbing items at random just because theyre cheap what is the rationale behind that Do people grab and buy lots of things they dont even actually wantThis sometimes happens but its far from the normgtIf people arent grabbing items at random do they decide beforehand Do places like Walmart advertise lets say iPads as  off and then the riots happen because everyone had a premeditated goal to grab that one particular itemOh God does Walmart advertise  I was over at my parents place on Thanksgiving night and within one hour of watching a football game I must have seen  Walmart ads no exaggeration  We get ads in the mail ads in the newspaper and ads on radio and television nonstop for days  Its really impossible not to know that there are stores having deals on Friday  As youve noted yes often stores like Walmart will feature one big item thats normally  marked down to  and a few people every year get zealous about being the person to get it because quantities are usually limited  just enough to get people excited and in the store but not always enough for everyone to buy it who wants itgt Why are sales such a big deal to begin with Sure I like to save money as much as the next guy But mostly I cant be bothered going out of my way for the sake of a sale I dont mind paying a bit more money for the sake of convenience  even though I only work parttime and have a low incomeIm not justifying the kind of crazy behavior that makes the news in other parts of the world about us but its not just a little more at least percentage  Some items are marked down  so if you dont get it now you will be paying literally double if you go a week later  In the case of the really expensive things this can mean a few hundred dollars and for many who dont earn much this may mean a lot of hours  If you earn hr  off a tv is half a weeks paygtwhat makes Black Friday in the US so different to the equivalents in other countries What inspires all the excitementHonestly companies advertise for weeks the media hypes it up to create a story then reports a story where it happens and makes it seem like its a huge thing and so whats normally less hectic than shopping on Christmas Eve has now become a major deal with huge crowds and chaosDont think the US is unique though  When HampM stores were opening in Europe and other parts of the world there were crowds lined up to the stores  When big name movie stars show up at premieres in London and the like fans line up for hours  Fanaticism isnt localized to the US,38,cdpj66t,1rpfj9,explainlikeimfive,top_week,274,236

danpaquette,gt What happens after a company forgets to renew their domain name Once the domain expires it enters a renewal grace period of about  days where the original owner can reclaim it Once that  days is up it enters a redemption period where the domain is frozen for  more days and drops from the zone file The original owner can reclaim or make changes to the domain but the registrar fees at this point are often well into the hundreds of dollars which is easily still worth it if the alternative is losing your businessFor about  to  days it goes through deletion processing where it is dropped from the registry and is available to be registered by the general publicSome registrars will retain their deleted domains to auction them off whether they do it themselves or have an agreement with a third party auction house depends on the registrarMore often than not a domain that had an established website never makes it through deletion processing and is sold off for auction Old domains that had measurable bodies of content users or search volume can be extremely valuable and can sell for many thousands of dollarsWhen its bought at auction the new owner can use the domain as they see fit The vast majority of auctioned domains end up in a portfolio of domains owned by a reseller we call them a squatter They often prompt the original domain owners their competitors and other interested parties to buy the domain well above cost gt Can the person who bought it afterwards negotiate a huge price for the company to get it backThis is legal as long as the domain isnt a registered trademark and they arent trying to actively impersonate the original owners of the domain If there are trademark or legal issues there are avenues people can take to reclaim their domains otherwise theyre out of luck and either have to pay the squatters exorbitant fees or find another domain Ive had companies that drop their domains because no one was monitoring their registrar billing information that were squatted and reoffered to them for tens of thousands of dollars The moral of the story is to always make sure your billing information is uptodate and set your domains to autorenew,15,cdpl9aq,1rpk3n,explainlikeimfive,top_week,107,92

Rodorador,When you mean northern hemisphere I think you truly mean the US and the majority of European nations Many vast regions that are officially part of the northern hemisphere like Central America Northern Africa and regions of Asia are actually considered third world meaning really that they are underdeveloped by Europeanfirst world standards I am not sure why you would pose the question from a European standard but I am going to hypothesize that it is because you were raised in a region of the world where folks are educated with European standards Now while the book guns germs and steel is definitely a fascinating account of why certain societies are more powerful than others or have the ability to conquer other societies does not answer the question of why such societies are justified in doing so I will not get into this since OPs question was not a moral question The question was about why the north is more developed than the southThe main reason is the fact of colonialism European powers like Holland Spain and Portugal upon coming into contact with the cultures that had been existing in what we call the Americas for thousands of years decided that they would like to conquest the people and the land they used to to create a sustainable living environment for their civilizations I am not sure how European powers decided to do this but what resulted was a history of large scale exploitation theft and enslavement and forced serfdom of entire civilizations If you recall during the renaissance era when colonization was in its beginning stages Columbus had accidentally landed in America in  gold and silver were measures of a countries wealth and used to trade goods You can read Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations for more info  Present day Bolivia and Peru as well as Mexico were excavated by Spain until every ounce that could be found by contemporary technology enslaved Indigenous miners of gold silver and precious metals was shipped to Europe So much gold was found that European gold reserves quadrupled Once Europe had effectively colonized and extracted the wealth of American civilizations we move to a period of time called imperialism This is a term meant to signify a process by which European nations set up government in other regions of the world to dominate and hold power over other people for the empires benefit In modern day although former colonies like the majority of the African continent and all of the Americas were allowed to become independent sovereign states we still see the legacy of colonization and imperialism continue to keep what we call third world countries from developing Structures like the world banks structural readjustment programs and the US agricultural subsidy prevent these countries from developing The agriculture subsidy has put out so many countrys agriculture sector out of business even though they would have a comparative advantage ie make crops for cheaper than the usStructural readjustment loans from the world bank and IMF give loans to third world countries but force them to run their fiscal policy in such a way to force the countries to overdevelop their raw goods sector This is bad because these nations dont have the funds to develop processed goods like computers or other nonraw resources or technological processes or their human capital  What ends up happening and is happening is that southern countries are still in debt and the loan programs are not enabling the countries to get out of debt but keeping them in the cycle of debt Thus is the legacy of societies who felt justified in conquering other societiesFor more details a good place to start is a documentary called the end of poverty Free on YouTube  ,5,cdprbpd,1rpre0,explainlikeimfive,top_week,14,9

SecureThruObscure,Depends Individuals with bad circulation really do have numbness or coldness in the extremities faster than people with healthy circulation The reason is pretty straightforward Your blood and veins act like a radiator system Theyre brought to the same temperature as the surrounding area and then sent off to a different part of the body Is its cold out your blood is brought up to your core temperature then sent out to the extremities  It then radiates transmits that heat to the fingers toes etc Typically they lose heat especially in cold weather  People with circulatory issues just supply less blood to their extremities than those without Its worth noting that in cold weather your body constricts the blood vessels in your extremities to prevent hypothermia less blood gets to the skinfingers less heat gets lost and in people with circulatory issues this effect has a greater effect of restriction on overall blood flow than  in otherwise healthy individuals ,40,cdpmmm6,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,top_week,161,121

Shmalpin,Your extremities are naturally the coldest parts of your body this is why gout crystals most commonly form in the big toe  They are the farthest away from the heated core of the body so it follows that they are more susceptible to the cold than your head abdomen chest etc  In the cold the body attempts to generate heat in the extremities  this manifests as shivering  If cold in the extremities persists the body shunts blood away from the arms and legs to preserve a warm functional core temperature    If someone genuinely has bad circulation or a pathological reason that their extremities are very coldsensitive and not an offhand selfmade diagnosis then it would be due to a lack of blood reaching the extremities  Individuals with autoimmune disorders like Lupus Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension and Vasculitis generally suffer from some sort of peripheral blood vessel damage  This damage leads to less corewarmed blood reaching the extremities  When less blood is getting to your arms and legs they naturally become closer to the temperature of their environment  Diabetes and Hypertension are becoming increasingly prevalent but autoimmune disorders and vasculitis are extremely rare    Bad circulation is something that a lot of folks are eager to diagnose themselves with whether or not a true medical cause exists  Similar to people that claim to get migraines when really they suffer from the occasional worse than usual headache More likely than not folks generally  dont have medicalgrade bad circulation,2,cdppuxh,1rptm5,explainlikeimfive,top_week,11,9

Drew,You say that Reagan is held to be one of the best US presidents but who believes this  Your statement is a pretty sweeping statement which suggests that there is widespread respect for Reagans accomplishments  But that is only true except among fairly traditional and conservative Americans  In any case even if he were held to be an amazing president the quality of a president is not determined by their popularity or JFK would be one of the best presidents this country had ever had JFK is now generally considered to have been a fairly mediocre president  His popularity and the very positive memories of him today came largely from factors such as his coming into office at a very conservative time at the end of the s while being himself young and vigorous having an attractive wife and young children the last young children in the White House had been Teddy Roosevelts and that had been nearly  years before JFK and caring about important issues of social change such as civil rights the Peace Corps nuclear disarmament and so forth  The American public liked the fact that he cared about making changes and that he was youthful attractive witty and energetic  But Kennedy accomplished almost nothing as president No civil rights laws and so forth  Then he was killed which froze the positive feelings about him permanently in peoples memories  The public was heartbroken at the death of such a youthful and charming president and so did not want to even consider rethinking Kennedy which would have seemed unfair and ghoulish  He was our prince and that was the end of the thought process in a way Reagans reputation developed somewhat similarly though not quite in the same way as Kennedys  After all Reagan did not die in office but he was very good on TV witty pleasant easygoing like JFK and much like Kennedy the camera seemed to love him So Regan came across as a likable person as JFK had  Reagan had a less appealing wife in Nancy who was somewhat odd in her belief in astrology and other  habits and Reagans children from his two marriages he had been divorced and remarried were older and a few did not much like him so he never had those assets  But he was a nice guy had a good sense of humor and his appeal on TV always benefitted him  Attractive people with a deprecating sense of humor always appeal no matter what their abilities really are And Reagan was not a bright man  He subscribed to a conservative and narrow philosophy that business could do not harm that our enemies were all evil and did not need to be negotiated with and that America could do no harm  His view of the country and the world was pretty much the view he had learned as a young man and he never really changed it into a more nuanced or sophisticated view as thinking people do  As for his actual policies as president he was impressive in that very late in his presidency he changed his mind and went against the advice of his advisors in seeking nuclear limits with the Soviet Union He had come late in his presidency to realize that a nuclear standoff was a very dangerous thing But this was very much different from the rest of Reagans foreign policy   Much of the rest of his foreign policy was unusually aggressive as Kennedys had been as well with the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis which took us to the brink of nuclear war in   Reagan invaded Grenada in the Caribbean and escalated the nuclear and conventional arms race greatly  He is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union but that is a great oversimplification since the defeat of the SU came as much from all previous presidents efforts as from Reagans and it resulted at least as much from the USSRs own economic and political failures as from any outside pressures arguably more from internal problems than from what the US did  Reagan was in the right place at the right time as the Soviets began to crumble  But the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries actually fell during the presidency of Reagans successor GHW Bush  Maybe he should get all the credit  Of course that would be silly too but crediting Reagan is just as illogical  What people remember about Reagan is that he was a nice guy like JFK who made them feel good that he stood up to the Soviets but so had Truman Eisenhower JFK and other presidents often much more dramatically and that the economy was reviving after a terrible economic decade in the s  So Americans felt better in the s  Was this Reagans doing  Perhaps the economy revived due to Reagan but more likely it was due to other factors such as the end of the Arab oil embargoes which Reagan had nothing to do with ending and to the cyclical increase in the economy that always follows a weak economy and other factors  Reagan actually did do something economically that we still suffer from today  he began the year shift of wealth to the upper class and away from the middle class through his very uneven tax policies which cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans far more than on others  This legacy was one of Reagans worst and we are still suffering because of it  But almost no one today realizes this since they had already formed their opinion of Reagan in the s and most Americans dont understand very well the economic changes of the last  years or who is responsible for the fact that they are not getting ahead while the wealthiest Americans are doing better than at any time since the s This shift was engineered by Reagan and his advisors who sought to cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and deregulate corporations shifting vast amounts of wealth from the middle class into the pockets of a few at the top  Reagan was also very antiunion his firing of air traffic controllers accelerating the destruction of labor unions which has been a major factor whatever you might think of unions in maintaining good wages for the middle and lower middle classes which stopped improving at this time  Reagan was also a strongly antienvironmental president whose Secretary of the Interior and head of the Environmental Protection Agency abused their offices to serve the needs of timber and coal companies and let auto companies off the hook in not enforcing safety regulations and gas mileage laws  On popular issues like these Reagan was out of touch and left a very negative legacy  As he did with healthcare and the AIDS epidemic which began while he was president  Reagan did nothing to deal with AIDS those who got the disease were most often leftie homosexuals which Republicans did not care about or to improve the medical system in any way  In fact Reagans social record in general is among the poorest of any modern president  In short  our popular views of presidents are often somewhat in conflict with the realities and often at variance with the more considered view of historians  Reagan is ranked somewhere in the high middle of American presidents today while Kennedy is ranked lower and generally considered mediocre  But neither is ranked among the top presidents The public tended to ignore the facts of what Reagan was actually doing and instead they just liked the guy and believed the rhetoric of his supporters that he cared about people was reviving the economy was a patriot on foreign policy  These claims are inaccurate but the average American does not read much Im afraid or dig very deeply into politics and tends to go by whatever the popular image of someone is and how they feel about someone rather than looking more critically at what they are really doing And a sizable part of the population never did like Reagan he was reelected in  of course or buy most of the claims made in his favor and in the last years of his presidency Reagans popularity was dropping  This was partly due to his involvement in the IranContra Scandal which was a series of illegal activities his advisors had been involved in with Iran and Nicaragua which could have resulted in Reagans impeachment but didnt He somehow survived to the end of his term and he got Alzheimers fairly soon after leaving the White House he was already very old and people generally liked him so there was little effort to reevaluate him or criticize him  The public simply choose not to care  But the facts are there nevertheless  It always reminded me of a somewhat tipsy old uncle who had a questionable past had been divorced and lied a little about his accomplishments but was very charming and told good stories so people liked him anyway Popular views of presidents are a very poor way of evaluating them  Abraham Lincoln often ranked as the best president today was considered at the time he was president to be fairly average while some Gilded Age presidents no one even remembers today were considered at their time to be very good  Popular views are shaped by emotion sentiment misunderstandings a certain amount of ignorance abut the issues and faulty memories  Truman was widely disparaged as president then there was a Truman Revival in the s after wed had a series of failed presidents which made Truman look much better and now Truman is receding somewhat as he has been reevaluated once more  Reagan is likely to remain in the middle of presidential reputations but not much higher I think due to his economic divisiveness and other legacies we still suffer from today without being seen as the architect of the fall of communism anymore than other presidents were  In any case I know very few educated people who consider Reagan at all impressive as president  Its the average folks of a more conservative nature who just kind of liked the guy  Heck I liked him but I hated his policies and still do ,0,cdpwhoq,1rpxue,explainlikeimfive,top_week,4,4

spockatron,charcoal has an absolutely huge number of small pores a few grams of charcoal has hundreds of square meters of surface area for the filtrate to flow over and then bind with the carboneventually the carbon runs out of binding sites and is exhausted meaning you need a new filter,0,cdprmll,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1
soIsaystomabel,Ok what people are missing about why activated charcoal actually absorbs things yes the pores are important but not the only reason is that charcoal is made up of many carbon atoms bonded together The surface of this carbon material has many sites of positive charge When it is activated by being treated with oxygen the surface of the carbon many of the neutral sites and some of the sites of positive charge are changed so they now have negative charges This leaves the surface of the charcoal with regions of neutral positive and negative charge In practice this means that just about any material suspended or dissolved in a fluid can find a location of attraction on the carbon which it sticks to removing it from the liquidIt can then simply be allowed to settle out of or float to the top of the liquid depending on the density of the carbon used as it will have a different density than the waterThe reason it is used is because it is cheap and doesnt require much energy to actually process the water You basically mix them let it settle,0,cdptzuz,1rq92s,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

eternalfrost,Developing a new drug takes an incredible amount of money You need a team of hundreds of PhDs to develop the chemistry thousands of engineers to design and build the machinery to produce it and hundreds of thousands of test subjects in clinical trials This is all made much worse in America and Europe where basically all new drugs are developed because of very high governmental safety standards In the end each new FDA approved drug takes billions of dollars and decades to get to market Drug companies start out very deep in the hole and need to make up a lot of groundPlus this all takes place in the crazy healthcare system and corporate greed cultures as other people have elaborated onIt takes a billion dollars to invent a pill but like  cents to actually produce one Sort of like how it takes a billion dollars to create a blockbuster movie but  cents to make each actual DVD to sell You need to price it way above that to make up for the development cost at first but  years later you can buy Ghostbusters  for  cents it walmart because it is so cheap to make the actual physical item,0,cdpzu8c,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,2
tmnvex,Because the healthcare industry in the US is run for profit before any other consideration Ostensibly it is supposed to be a free market but really it isnt it is highly regulated Unfortunately unlike in many other countries which also have highly regulated healthcare industries the regulation benefits those that are seeking to make a profit rather than those that use the products and services,2,cdq0gcx,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,0
wdmc,One aspect that hasnt been mentioned is drug patents In most developed countries a company can apply for a patent for a drug it is developing This patent lasts for  years and gives that company protection from anyone else who would produce a generic version of the drug This allows them to charge whatever they want in order to recoup the costs of developmentUsually companies apply for the patent long before the drug is developed Then it still has years of trials so by the time it gets to market it may only have  years of patent protection left Therefore many countries also allow for a patent extension of  years One notable exception is Canada,0,cdq1s6d,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1

kschmidt,OP You also must realize that depending on the country just because it SAYS its a certain medication doesnt mean that it IS the same medication  Many seniors travel to Canada or they used to to buy expensive prescription drugs because they were cheaper  Travelling to Canada and buying is generally considered safe if its still allowed  Other countries PERHAPS not so much  Buying off the internet has been shown many times that the drugs are not the same drug or a diluted dosage  Unless the drug is something youd feel physical or mental effects from you wouldnt be able to know what exactly you were taking without lab testsEDIT I have no information on specific countries and am not sure if travel to Canada by seniors is still acceptedallowed  I am NOT downplaying the significance of purchasing inexpensive medicines in other countries  Im only advising you to be absolutely sure that you are getting what you pay for,0,cdq3s5j,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,1,1
misanthrope,The FDA  If it costs billions of dollars to RampD a drug they need to recoup their expenses  There are patents that prevent knockoffs for years in the United States but companies in other countries can just make a generic immediately they have no RampD cost to earn back so instant profit off the backs of American companies,2,cdptqf2,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,0

dvfw,The FDA requires that all drugs before entering the market meet a very large set of requirements This means that the cost of producing the drugs increases dramatically and so does the final production cost The regulations as well as patent laws also serve to kill smaller competitors which means the decreased supply of the drugs causes a higher priceIn the wake of the  amendments the FDAs regulation of new drugs became increasingly stringent and risk averse leading critics to complain of overregulation The bureaucracy at the FDA acquired a reputation for remarkable inefficiency and delay with processing times for new drug applications NDAs typically extending to two years or more and paperwork reaching into tens of thousands of pages Meanwhile the time and expense of new drug development increased dramatically By  the cost of developing a new drug had risen to an estimated  million  to  times as much as in the early s while development times had climbed from a coupleof years to the better part of a decadehttpwwwcatoorgsitescatoorgfilesserialsfilescatojournalcjnpdf,2,cdptiug,1rqfoq,explainlikeimfive,top_week,2,0
