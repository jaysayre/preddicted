DavC,So you leave the bathroom door open while you shit Your family only has one shared laptop and when you take it they immediately search for it So taking a laptop to the bathroom directly means that you will be watching porn What about a smartphone or tablet Does your mother seriously believe that somebody would fap WHILE taking a shit I imagine you could smell it if she came in Even if you were beating it your mother decides to call you out for it and make you feel bad for it great parenting really Also because you MIGHT have fapped youll get consequences for it why Oh and why not show her your limp dick as proof for not masturbating ,4,cdkwegw,1r9952,tifu,top_week,27,23

mcj, months ago I was in the opposite position almost exactly I have been friends with this girl for more than  years I started dating someone she confessed her love except we were never physical  I cant speak for your girl obviously but from my perspective this is what I thought about the situationI appreciated how difficult it was for her to admit that to me knowing that it likely wouldnt change anything at the time I had been dating the new girl for about a month  I understood the desire to put it all out there and if I were in her position I likely would have done something similarHowever in my case this girl had about a year that she could have come to me with her feelings while I was single  It wouldnt have changed my feelings since to me our relationship is strictly platonic but it would have been a little more respectful of MY feelingsShe said she needed space when I let her down as gently but clearly as possible and I obliged  For awhile we didnt speak  A few months later she reached out and we began textinggchatting small talk mostly infrequently  Now our relationship is as close as it likely ever will be to how it used to be  In fact I hung out with her and another friend last night without my gf present and it felt very comfortable for us bothUltimately I am glad she told me her feelings since I know how much strong quiet feelings can eat away at a person  I do wish she had come to me before I was in another relationship but I have no ill feelings towards her for it TLDR friend confessed love to me it was awkward for awhile but comfortable friendship was not ruined  IMO you didnt fuck up but you should have said something before you found out she was seeing someone else,1,cdni2bz,1rhz0q,tifu,top_week,8,7

ghostlyharmless,I would suggest giving her some space I know that part of you thinks theres still hope that she didnt say it couldnt happen but you have to know that her reaction told everything Its not going to happen and thats not the end of the worldNot only does she deserve space after this bombshell so do you The more you hang around her the more difficult it will be to get over those feelings The sooner you can move on romantically in your life the sooner your relationship with her will return to normal,1,cdnjgmg,1rhz0q,tifu,top_week,5,4
Ironmind,The way I see it is youve got the awkward part out of the way now youve got to try and relax a bit I am fully aware that will be virtually impossible and concentrate on not making things more awkwardGive her a bit of space to get her head round it keep yourself busy you can be pretty productive when youre trying to avoid something and when shes ready to talk try to act like you didnt say it Dont deny it but just try to be friends like you were before show her that this is not the end of you being friends and hopefully she will feel at easeWhen it does come up pretty sure shell want to talk about it eventually apologise for blurting it out like that and for putting her under pressure especially as shed just told you about some other guy Tell her how hard it was to tell her because you dont want to ruin your friendship explain how youve recently realised your feelings for her are not purely platonic anymore and ask her how she feels about itWhen youve heard her thoughts ask her what you can do to not lose her ask yourself this while youre at it Try your hardest not to be selfish here youre gonna get emotional and want to know how you can be more than friends but you need to do everything in your power to ensure youre not going to be less than friendsGood luck and FFS keep us updated,0,cdnvcir,1rhz0q,tifu,top_week,4,4

dudesbeingdudes,Im gonna assume youre no older than  Dont hate her for wanting dick girls do that Guys wanna fuck other girls too and youre a fucking liar if you deny it When youre young you think losing your virginity to someone means youre supposed to be with them forever but trust me you need to experience some things It probably hurts now because you feel like the other guy was better than you and thats why she wants to blow him he isnt Hess just different Were wired to seek variety in our genes so its natural to want to test the waters when youre young So enjoy being single homie And as someone whos been on both sides of this I was her twice and you once just chalk it up to her being a fucking kid Youre both just dumb kids that dont know what you want yet no offense Youll move on and look back and realize you needed this to happen but realistically probably not until youve met someone else and inevitably compare the two You might even overcompensate by going for someone whos the complete opposite of her and tricking yourself into believing shes the one Then you start having your doubts a couple months down the road but its already too late you told her you loved her and you cant go back or youll look like an idiot so fuck that you need to prove to Amanda you found someone better and Amandas a bitch But I digress and thats a story for another day You need to make a few mistakes along the way to fine tune what youre really looking forSo grieve about it if you need to but for gods sake dont be the faggot that uses grief to try to get attention from another girl That shit will only attract the equally emotionally damaged which you definitely dont want Unless you want some depraved crazy amazing sex In that case stick your dick in crazy You need to have your life threatened a few times or maybe just your status quo to realize how much you value it Anyway Ive been all over the place with this because I think Im drunker than I think I am Feel free to ask for clarification because Im sure I fucked up someone in hereOnce again enjoy the single life Im sure you have the biggest swinginest dick in all the land OP The other fish in the sea gon learn today DeucesEDIT Id like to add for future reference that breaks are for pussies If you can feel the disconnect already a break isnt going to fix it Break up like a man and dont become that annoying couple thats always on again off again because your boys will stop giving a shit and wont bother to keep up whether youre with her or not at any given time Or go on the break FUck it I said make mistakes right Your call Ill be right behind you ifyouknowwhatimeanjpg all homo,3,cdq2wep,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,14,11
smileandmeanit,Im not trying to defend her but sometimes people need to experience other things and other people and a bit of freedom before they can really settle down Given that you both lost your virginity to each other youve obviously never explored those different possibilities It doesnt feel like it now when its raw and fresh but this is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to you You get a somewhat clean break instead of having it drag on and on until youre both bitter and depressed and thus the opportunity to go out and really find yourself and find who you are and who you make yourself without having a right hand lady Im a huge believer in when one door closes it gives opportunity for another potentially even better door to open and I can confidently say that this mantra has proven itself over and over again to me from both my first relationship to second and second to current and having felt like I could have found that guy I wanted to be with forever in each of them All have improved Ive managed to learn things from each and implement to my nextIt hurts now but youll be okay Have faithEdit,4,cdpvygt,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,15,11

tnv,This might be a bit late for you to notice OP but just a little advice from someone who has felt a fraction of that pain in case you do see it Get rid Theres no reason for you to stay with her if you do youll only be bitter and resent her More importantly take some time being single After a fairly long relationship you really need time to be by yourself again Sure its lonely at first but you will start seeing the benefit soon When youre in a LTR you dont realise yourself changing as a result of your SOs influence This isnt to say shes manipulating you but instead you change simply by being around her And its so gradual you dont even notice like your hair growing or another better example You become suppressed because you tend to show your SO the side of you that you want them to see You need time to be yourself again You became a stale boyfriend for a reason my man Like someone else said cut all ties I cant stress this enough The less you see her pop up on your newsfeed and the like the better You need to be thinking about you After a relationship like this you need to be selfish for a while This doesnt mean taking pregnant ladies seats on the bus or not feeding your pets You need to do stuff for YOU Focus on bettering yourself and moving towards that idealistic image you have of yourself in your head And if you dont have said image get one By taking little steps towards this be it taking a class getting fit or eating better you can take your mind off the pain This doesnt mean avoiding it it sounds like youve agonised over it enough and fair play she was important to you but youll see that improving yourself can be quite therapeuticGood luck youll be fine Youre not going to look back and laugh at this but you will see it as a turning point Get out of that rutessay,0,cdq6pxf,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,1,1

OriginalityIsDead,You didnt fuck up dude You just found out what was beneath the surface what was always really there But dont worry because while today might be tough might hurt might put you on the edge of breaking theres always tomorrow to look forward to Youll love again youll meet new better people and some day you might even find someone who will truly cherish you as a partner and wouldnt think of hurting you in the ways she obviously has Today is the first day of the rest of your life Appreciate that now is your lowest moment and its uphill from here on out as far as relationships go You now understand heartbreak firsthand Use that learn from it grow with it and live your life with the knowledge that youve survived this and can thus survive anything ,1,cdq0izk,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,1,0

alhena,We have evolved past the need for monogamy and sexual possession  My boyfriend and I help each other get women and I have no shortage of males  Still who do I live with who do I cook for who do I cancel on anyone else in favor of  My boyfriend  Yeah he fucks other girls but who does he come home to every night  Not saying this is the solution for you but you certainly wouldnt feel so destroyed if you had this attitude  Yes she desires multiple strange cocks and thats perfectly ok normal healthy and she deserves no shame for it  She should just help you get a couple other girls on your dick to make it up to you and then you can go on to have a healthy open but committed relationship  Or you know continue to suffer or find some other girl  All you can control is your attitude,1,cdq5jio,1rq3aa,tifu,top_week,1,0
