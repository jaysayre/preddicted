LeaveTheMatrix,Perhaps he was thinking of PiezoelectricityhttpenwikipediaorgwikiPiezoelectricity which generates power from crystals and is currently used in many areas for VERY LOW amounts of voltage such as electric cigarettesFrom the above link A similar idea is being researched by DARPA in the United States in a project called Energy Harvesting which includes an attempt to power battlefield equipment by piezoelectric generators embedded in soldiers boots However these energy harvesting sources by association have an impact on the body DARPAs effort to harness  watts from continuous shoe impact while walking were abandoned due to the impracticality and the discomfort from the additional energy expended by a person wearing the shoes Other energy harvesting ideas include harvesting the energy from human movements in train stations or other public places and converting a dance floor to generate electricity Vibrations from industrial machinery can also be harvested by piezoeletric materials to charge batteries for backup supplies or to power lowpower microprocessors and wireless radiosHe is just a bit ahead of his time needs to wait until dilithiumhttpenwikipediaorgwikiDilithium can be better used as a power source,0,cciecop,1nfkej,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,4.0,4

hotcod,No one touches anything in our place even simple things like swapping a mouse or a keyboard should come to us In fact this reminds me of a time the accountant complained a staff members mouse was clicking too loudly and wanted it replaced To put this in context the women sits in an open plan call centre The Senior Tech refuses on the grounds that we are not going to waste time trying to find a suitable mouse when its no louder than any other mouse in the officeThe next week Senior Tech is way and I get a help desk ticket from the user whos mouse was causing all this trouble asking for a new one Which struck me as a little odd so I go talk to the user and apparently she was asked by the accountant to raise the ticket So I wrote a email to the people involved user accountant and ops making it clear despite the accountants apparently have a help desk allergy she would actually go with out a problem being fixed if after coming down expecting us to jump at it we asked her to raise a ticket its not ok to waste another members of staff time raising a ticket more so when its been made clear it didnt warrant action This puts the accountant in a right strop and the ops manager comes to talk to me I just made it clear that I wasnt going to change the mouse and the whole thing was ridiculous Not however as ridiculous as popping upstairs later that day to find these two ladies of a certain age crawling about under desks swapping a mouse around Which it should be noted left the noisy mouse in use just less so and its replacement being as far as I can tell exactly as noisy I had to tell them that if they cause an issue with the wiring on the desk that I wasnt going to fix it and wasnt going to tidy up the cabling either and wondered off to send a few more emails to Senior Tech to make sure he was aware of the sillinessThe ops manager was just looking for an easy life which I can understand as Id have hung my self if I had to sit next to the mad women and after a Senior Tech has a quite word or two with her we did then make sure to check the desks and tidy it up but only when the accountant wasnt around Funnily enough after Senior Tech was done talking to her about her behaviour she did actually start to raise some tickets  In short IT cant take responsibility for making sure the IT works if users can simply screw around with it when they feel like it ,0,cck4ln6,1nlvmb,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,5.0,5

RamsesThePigeon,SighYou know its fun to laugh at these people but their crazy ideas are really harmful to progress Personally Im absolutely sick to death of this whole reptilian aliens are controlling our society businessFirst of all the Schraschz are not aliens They were the first sentient species to evolve on Earth and they were rescued by the Greys just before the cataclysm that killed off their reptilian cousins They were transported to Fszst what we call GJ Cc where they lived for millions of years eventually evolving into the humanoid reptilian species we know today While they may very well have inhabited an alien planet their ancestors were as terrestrial as yours or mineWhat makes the conspiracy so confounding and aggravating though is this ridiculous notion that theyre somehow secretly in control of our society Personally I think we would have noticed if every one of our leaders had a projecting snout green scales and soft feathers instead of hair Of course that doesnt stop the theorists who claim that the Schraschz use some kind of hologram technology or that they surgically alter themselves to appear more humanOh but it gets worse Apparently the Schraschz are here to enslave humanity or use them for food or other equally outrageous suggestions but theyre doing it by allowing us to develop newer and better technologies than they currently have access to I mean were talking about a species that  due to humankinds xenophobia  is forced to live exclusively in regions that we find inhospitable Even those small tribes of humanshttpenwikipediaorgwikiSentinelesepeople they do regularly interact with are forced to remain cut off from the outside world as a resultLook I understand that theyre a bit scary at first sight The idea of competing physically against a sevenfoottall lizard is a pretty frightening one Seriously though I dated a SchraschzhttpiimgurcomWFzbyjpg for about a year and a half and other than the obvious difficulties like sex which was a bit interesting I found the young lady to be both intelligent and incredibly witty Hell even the accent is pretty sexy Ill admit The only reason we broke up was because of ignorant bigots who would yell at her threaten her or even physically attack her any time she went out in public with me For those that care shes living happily in the Amazon Basin now though we dont keep in touch as much as either of us would likeSo yeah this idea that theyre a marauding group of malicious aliens really angers me and I wish humanity would just learn to accept the Schraschz for who they are Theyre a hell of a lot more evolved than us and we could learn a thing or two from them,23,ccl1ukn,1nq071,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,134.0,111

rcns,Sounds like a printer with a PostScript interpreter limit check is a PS error These printers often had more RAM than the computers that sent jobs IIRC PostScript interpreted everything so if your file contained a complex image that was entirely covered by a simple box the interpreter would RIP the complex image and then try to figure out how to exclude it as it was covered by a box Limit check errors were very often associated with complex clipping paths think close cropped irregular images removing the background with a vector path a more difficult task than the first example The problems were almost always associated with EPS files which were fully interpreted before rasterization So if a  pip image  high was printed at  size all of the data was crunched and not just the  required as it was scaled One of the advantages of PDF is that the data may be flattened and resampled making processing easier on the interpreter ,1,cclrzjx,1nscqy,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,12.0,11

conwaytwt,I used to deal with PostScript printers all the time and the few I was responsible for maintaining got all the RAM we could afford for them I had a Lexmark in my office for awhile and I paid way too much for its RAM Eventually one of the drums wore out and I didnt want to spend hundreds of dollars to fix it which hurt All that expensive RAM wasted For less money than I had spent on the RAM I bought a whole new Brother printer  scanner to replace the LexmarkNow the Brother DCP laser printer  scanner works great but it sometimes runs short on RAM especially when Im trying to print at dpi but its RAM is not upgradeable When the Brother runs short on memory it prints an extra page with really blurry text explaining that whatever I was trying to print exceeded the memory capacity So far reducing the resolution to  or  dpi eliminates the error I dont know whether the printed message comes from the printer or the linux print driver,0,cclyj84,1nscqy,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,1.0,1

pilif,In his defense  this kind of application based file management is something that we need to fix This is really difficult to explain to people and for people to understand This gets even worse as all applications have the exact same File gt Open command and they all open the exact same OS file picker dialog And to make matters worse while they only list files they open by default they can easily be told to circumvent that even though thats never going to lead to a desirable result under normal circumstances speaking from a normaluser perspective hereNow working using a file manager would solve that issue just double click the file you want to open and have the shell sort it out but file managers are even more difficult to explain to nonversed users and they allow them to do even more damageI really dont know what a good solution is I guess nobody does or wed be using it but laughing about a user confused by this is not the right response,4,ccni51p,1nxnj0,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,6.0,2

davt,I received a very similar message a few years back from the FBI but the twist was a bit different  The FBI was claiming they needed my help to test money transfer systems for terrorist compliance  To do so they would send me a cashiers check that I would need to cash and then send part of the money back to them via Western Union  Of course I could keep a portion for myself for my efforts  Long story short I had the FBI send it to  Wilshire Blvd Suite  which is the Los Angeles FBI field office  The kicker is the guy sends me over a dozen messages the next few days demanding the money  I gave him the LA FBI office number and told him to call and I would work out the details over the phone  Never heard from him again,57,ccox0s4,1o551p,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,256.0,199

Valriete,This is sort of related and since its an enduser story Ive been waiting for the right opportunityThe houses Compost cable internet went out for a couple of hours last week We get our land line through em as well and with no dial tone the options were quickly narrowed downAfter an hour or so and a modem reboot my landlady wakes up this was  and gives em a callNow so you dont wonder too much I rent a room in this house for CHEAP since I cant currently afford not to Her daughters eternally unmarried livein fiancé  well call him Ash for lack of a better unisex name since his gender is a bit vague  is a friend from school so I get some financial slack Which means yes I encounter most of the shit that happens around hereAnyway the landlady henceforth Hamplanet is apparently connected with a tech Its been a few minutes and Im in an adjacent room when I hear the squawking startWHY DO I HAVE TO GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION AGAIN I ALREADY TOLD YOU ONCE At which time she huffily recites her name and address for as far as I know the first time to the tech shes connected to For better or worse Ash and I are both largely nocturnal so hes awake as well I mention to him notsosubtly that Im gaining a greater understanding of why posters in the techsupport subreddit to which I subscribe tend to have a history of alcohol abuseWell he says she already told him onceMaybe so but was it even the same guy If it was is it his problem or is it Comcasts policy StillHe shrugs I position myself between Hamplanet who at this point has the poor bastard on speakerphone and the cable modem in case anything remotely technical has to be done The tech does a signal reset and makes the mistake of telling her itll be at least a minute but might take five or so or whatever the exact figure was I was halfasleep at the time Hamplanet is noticeably flustered by receiving multiple possible figures so I stand there waiting rubbing my templeThe tech asks her to reset the modem I go to do just thatThe circus arrives in townNO says Hamplanet in her usual indignant voice Its the white oneMy response Thats the router It wont HP NO thats the modem See it says Comcast on itMe They both say Comcast It was a package dealHP It gets the signal from the wallMe No No it does not It gets the signal from the modem which is this black box which has a coax cable attached to the back of itHP Yes it doesMe glad Im unarmed Well Im sorry but I Ash who should damn well know better Thats what theyve had us reset in the past when this has happenedMe knowing Ash knows what different cables are All right You knew I was dealing with the modem not the router earlier Show me the cable and phone cords coming from the back of the white box Which for those listening at home is still the Netgear wireless router not a cable modem The cable modem is black its larger and it doesnt have an antennaAt this point Ash goes ahead and unplugs the router then plugs it back in presumably to appease Hamplanet The modem remains untouched since the call was initiated The tech tells us to go ahead and try itI am hoping the signal reset has done the trickIt hasI head upstairs and drinktldr No THATS my microwave Its got gas burners on top and can fit an entire turkey But Ive cooked pizza bites in it before,16,ccua1vk,1ooikt,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,57.0,41

dekenfrost,This happens a lot where I work as well however I have to cut our users some slack here   The password musst be more than  characters and have  different types of characters  The password musst be changed every  days  The password cannot be any of the last  passwords  Users are encouraged to log in via secureID Card which does away with the need of a passwort and instead uses a  digit pin that doesnt change   However the windows password still needs to be changed and if it runs out they get locked out of the system even if they use the Secure Card and the system doesnt warn the user if logged in via secure card  When they then get asked to change their password since they are logged in with the secure card this doesnt work and they have to change to a different user not their logged in user and input their username and password again for the system to prompt the password change correctlyOn top of that we use a multitude of systems Most of them use the Secure Card and only that some only take the windows password and yet other services have their own password all together I can totally understand people getting confused in all this mess,0,ccwzxri,1ox1v3,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,1.0,1

lynxSnowCat,I knew this painWhen I worked near to a printer I had to constantly chase down people who kept trying to reclaim the stapler I bought and return it to the workplaceAfter realising that I could never have enough staples to supply everyone I chained the stapler to my workbench so that I could load  staples at a time from my remaining cache  Eventually people became afraid of being caught using the last staple by others queing up to use it and started handing me boxes of staples to hold for them win or had that precious sliver of hope of theirs dashed by the empty kaclick too many times to consider approaching itIt worked well until the hammer in the stapler broke off from being loaded with the wrong sized staples too frequently and wedging the hammer back on wasnt a convincing enough deception   Interestingly personal staplers actually did became a bit of a status item for a few people after mine went But I think they got fed up with running out of staples for other people because they quietly hid them afterwards only talking about them in hused tones to trade remaining caches of irregular sized staples to matching staplers for reciprical stapling privledgesAs for myself When I gave up on keeping my stapler I switched to pliers and bailing wire only regretting having managed to traumatize adults of the peril of an empty blue stapler,1,cd2mng0,1pdspb,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,3.0,2

feelingfunky,I feel your pain We had a double whamy of having the offices renovated and new cabling and power put in Apparently the design group thought that it was necessary to bundle the all the power outlets together the network drops together and the telephone together in each  or  person room So we had Telephone drops beside the door Power drops in the opposite corner and Network drops in between Naturally these were all but covered up by the Large desks and attached cupboards ans shelving units It took  weeks to dismantle the alltogetherassembled units drill holes and create conduit After that it was still a nightmare as Each room had  network drops  telephone cables and  duplex power outlets So there were switches and Powerbars galore none of which FIT the conduits thoughtlessly put in after the fact For  YEARS ugly wire and cables were taped to the floor and walls It wasnt that bad as there were only  office rooms  They later had to renovate again when the Execs and VIPs were forced to use these rooms for meetings The horror at the huge expenditure to modernize  the rooms only to have it look like the IT departments office was palpable  Needless to say IT was involved in the new designs and Every employee that had to use the offices were very happy Also the monitor arms that they had before the first reno couldnt be used as the low tops of the cupboards prevented anything slightly over eye height when seated All the monitors were at their lowest settings EDIT added the monitor arms section,0,cd3r5ok,1plnel,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,5.0,5

hicow,Incidentally a tip for anyone that may be putting out for new office furniture and I mean something on the order of  workstations plus hard offices etc  beat the RFP to death  The company that comes in low is going to go with a low profit on the major work  the workstations panel systems etc  Where they make the money is when you didnt notice you need monitor arms and grommet holes drilled for them and CPU holders to get the PCs off the floor and cable routing hardware and so on and so onThere will always be some incidentals that get missed on a large project but Ive seen jobs of half a million dollars where they made more on the thisandthat details than they did on the panels and desksAlso if you want to play dirty approach an independent company and get them to put in all the work and come in low because they want that foot in the door  Once its all specd out turn around and give it to whoever you normally get your furnitureoffice products from and tell them the job is theirs if they can beat the competitors bid by ,2,cd4ah37,1plnel,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,4.0,2

frosty,I work at a repair shop That everyone knows but I wont describe because ill just get flamed for it Im the tech that actually sits in back and does repairs First step of most repairs is to run our automated script which does things like runs a full hardware diag scans for viruses and whatnot with  differnt big name scanners defrags the hdd if it needs it Then I go through  manually fixing infected system files with good copys or rebuilding the bcd or unfucking the registry You get the picture Anyways its awesome and does all of the boring repetitive stuff for me including deleting all of the useless trash like temp files annnnd the recycle bin I cant tell you how many times iv had a up front tech come back with a laptop where the client claims we deleted all of their stuff we never would on purpose without asking and wants to see whoever did it me Without fail I walk up and after they face melt me a bit I ask where they put it They point to the recycle bin or some other god awful stupid place like their antivirus vault I ask why they would put it there point to the disclaimer about data they signed and walk back to my cave to unfuck some more idoits pcsOhh also reminds me of the client that  literally called in within mins of getting cryptolocker I said to turn it off asap as in RIGHT FUCKING NOW so that we could pull the files off her drive before they all got encrypted She came in  days later and after she opened her pc it became apparent that it hadnt been shut down for at least a week and literally every goddamn file was gone forever She cried after I explained as nicely as I could that by not listening she lost  years of photos including the birth and raising of  kids Last I herd she paid the  and they still didnt decrypt it,2,cd61ogh,1psoua,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,15.0,13

GunnerMcGrath,I also did this not once but twice  Once I managed to catch it before it committed once I did not This was not on a  row table but on our biggest table with all our transaction data After that I created a trigger on that table that would throw an error if trying to update all the rows that said something like You might want to try a WHERE clause idiot  A year or two later I definitely got that error message,4,cd6hx24,1pvck3,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,36.0,32
ZedPM,My favorite form of this includes the WHERE clause but does the exact opposite of what you wanted I had a coworker run a query to delete a row it was supposed to be    Delete from tableName where id  Unfortunately he fatfingered it and instead of   it ended up being       Delete from tableName where id  does the exact opposite of what you want as    is  so that row is excluded while every other row in the table gets deleted because id   is nonzero Good times,4,cd6kvv4,1pvck3,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,34.0,30
pmcquay,ergh This is the stuff of my nightmares I really think the syntax should be Update columns from table where condition set fields So you are forced to write the where clause firstMore controversially I think that update statements should be required to have a where clause event if it is just  and error out if they dont Maybe have this settable on a connection by connection basis so that legacy apps dont explode but have it default to required,4,cd6gbqo,1pvck3,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,32.0,28

ufmace,This reminds me of one time I actually found a good use of torrents within a company One of our major pieces of internal software was meant to be installed with system images  installing it would format the hard drive and restore a standardized image with properlyconfigured Windows and the program with all required dependencies Yes this was a good idea and necessary for the situationThe main downside to this is that the install is over GB and thus a headache to copy over the network Even worse the department creating them was located in China while my department was in the US That means copying GB or so of files over a flaky overseas network linkGetting it done at all pretty much required leaving an autoresuming FTP client running on it overnight Corruption seemed to be pretty common too and since we were installing Windows and everything it often resulted in the installed system being unusable The only way around that was to checksum the files and recopy them if they didnt match That gets really annoying when it happens  times in a rowIt occurred to me that an internal torrent would be the perfect way to distribute these files We would get automatic resuming hashing and retransmission of small pieces of the file and automatic local serving to anyone in our geographical area who needed their own copyNaturally torrents were forbidden on our networks for the usual reasons I tried to persuade IT to allow it in our case  internal distribution of company files  but they were having none of it Gave up and kept doing it the old way,6,cdai4ia,1q8xr2,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,32.0,26

halftomato,For what its worth it looks like the Carbonite backup tool is either hashing or padding the Encryption Key Password the password you type in the Carbonite GUI when you choose to manage your own key before it is used to encrypt the RSA private key  You can verify this yourself if you have OpenSSL installedInstall Carbonite on a test machine choose to manage your own key and specify an Encryption Key Password eg  and save the file when promptedNow try and decrypt the RSA key using the Encryption Key Password you just specified It bombs out as if you typed it wrong     openssl rsa passin pass in carboniteencryptionkeypasswordispem out devnull    unable to load Private Key    errordigital envelope routinesEVPDecryptFinalexbad decryptevpencc    errorAPEM routinesPEMdoheaderbad decryptpemlibcInterestingly even if you dont enter a password at install time the RSA key still appears to be DES encrypted You have tried following Carbonites restore procedure as if the IT guy never entered a password rightAll this means that a dictionary attack based on what the IT guy might have typed into the Carbonite GUI is unlikely to yield results unless we know how to convert our password guesses eg LTpasswrd into the actual passphrase that the Carbonite tool would have used to encrypt the private key if that password had been entered  If someone from Carbonite is following the thread can you confirm either way,1,cdb5xfv,1qb7xk,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,14.0,13

ericbrow,Im not defending the customer here but we used to super glue the power jacks on when replacing them as well   Most power jacks on laptop motherboards only contact the mother board in  or  solider points and nothing else This is what makes it so easy for them to break off when a little pressure is applied to the power plug  By super gluing the replacement power jack to the mother board wed make sure the laptop didnt come in for that problem again,3,cddhuph,1qjb3b,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,6.0,3

Hexorg,I had a similar case But it was off the public eye for a friend I ended up carefully removing glue with dremel tool Unfortunately it damaged motherboard traces so I had to find other spots on mobo where the power was fed and solder wires between those spots and the jack ,1,cddhnd8,1qjb3b,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,2.0,1
justcommenting,Ive actually repaired power jacks with superglue before under certain circumstances  If its a normal barrel plug then frequently the jack housing will be broken rather than the jacks electrical connections to the motherboard  Since the jack housing typically forces a contact against the outside of the barrel plug a broken housing results in poor or no contact  If the housing is mostly intact you can press it back into place and superglue it back together  You definitely dont need much glue though and if youre using enough that it slops onto the circuit board you should probably just replace the entire jackIf you need to remove superglue normal cyanoacrylate superglue not specialty epoxies acetone usually works pretty well  Be careful and use it with a swab though as acetone may remove labels  stencils from the circuit components  Id use rubbing alcohol afterwards to remove the acetone residue,0,cddnk7q,1qjb3b,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,1.0,1

Pavix,This is not TFTS related but its related to your story I moved into the house Im currently living at back in January The guy who owns the house has owned it for probably  years at least In that time he has never replaced batteries in any of the smoke detectors or so he says As guys we cookread overcook things and cause smoke which annoys the smoke alarm and it starts blaring We do the typical caveman guy thing and pull down the smoke alarm and pull the battery and go back to our meal About  months ago we started to hear a chirp Its infrequent but constant We ignored it for several weeks until it was too annoying At first we thought that it was one of the other roommates playing with an annoyatron But we all pleaded innocent under fear of being tar and feathered then evicted So we set about finding it to make the chirping stop We tried replacing the batteries in our digital thermostat and even went so far as to pull the batteries for  hours But the chirp persisted Since I work third shift I went into my roommates rooms and searched their ceilings and closets for any rogue smoke alarms I found  that had no electrical wiring to the house and no batteriesno matter this was war and not a time for common sense so I pulled it downI checked the basementAHA Theres a relatively new smoke alarm So I pull it down pull out the batteries As its sitting on the kitchen counter and Im walking to my bedroom it mocked me the chirp was still happening So defeated I returned the new smoke detector back to the basement and scour the rest of the basementNo joyNow heres where its strange the chirping has lasted at least  months maybe longer From what Ive read the chirping should stop after a month or  tops Alas the only place it can be that we havent checked is the attic The owner of the house is afraid of Kabuki monsters my other roommate is afraid of going up there and seeing severed corpses of racoons and squirrels with a big knife sticking out of a x and me I just dont like spiders Its still happeningchirp,26,cde585y,1qm11a,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,120.0,94

Smith,DSL user here I absolutely hate those automated line checks that can also mess with your provisioning automatically My ISP uses a very similar system and although your speed wont be turned down if your modem is not actually on your speed can get turned down for no reason at all or because the provider wont fix their lines properly or just run Fiber and get it all over with gtgt  The automated line optimization system will set speeds as low as kbpskbps which by definition isnt even broadband in this countryIn the case of my circuit I had the automated line checks disabled and blocked from my circuit as they were breaking many things with my connection I have a MbpsMbps DSL circuit on a solid line and I can get a little more than that day and night thanks to overprovisioning The automated line checks kept trying to apply an Interleaved profile to my circuit it sets this on all lines by default No nonInterleaved for anyone which takes latency to the ISP BRAS from ms to something between ms Second each time it would run itd find something wrong with my line and it would go ahead and botch up my provisioning The way the provisioning broke can be best described as what happens when you create a duplex mismatch between a Mbps Ethernet link and a Mbps Ethernet link and you add bursting from the Mbps circuit to the Mbps circuit using UDP data and your Mbps link happens to be on an extremely old Ethernet hub with other duplex mismatches In my case it is a very old ADSL DSLAM that needs special love to workIll let this picture do the rest of the talking Mbps trying to do a download with a provisioning messup on a very very good day httpimgurcomcQAodl So yeah in short I had to backdoor my way into getting support from someone deep in network operations no customer should have to dig their way into support because no one in the ISPs chain of support could figure out how to fix the problem even though I told them what the problem was and how to fix it  The awesome guy in network operations not only blocked those automated line tests for good but ensured my provisioning was fixed permanently He admitted too that there were less problems back when provisioning was done manually ,0,cdg4u8e,1qonc9,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,1.0,1

therealmentaloid,CAT cable does come in  pair form x leaving one spare pair I use it all the time between risers or between racks It works great and Ive ever had an issue This of course is assuming they used CAT not the more common CAT that telcos generally use Of course they still should have checked and verified requirements before making changes I have to wonder at the choice of switches however SMC has never been a good performer IMHO The back plane gets saturated fairly quickly in these devices but they work adequately under average loads I suppose A single SG would do the work of both switches and give you trunkvlan support It is hard to tell from this photo The rg cable appears to have a decent ultraseal connector and antronix splitter but the rg cables appear to have either hex crimp or ampamp twist on connectors I would check those for proper termination as well,4,cdf1jdh,1qp3n8,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,21.0,17
dwitman,Came here to rage that a cat   pair cable would do the trick but as thats covered Never expect a telco to preform like a structured cabling shop They simply do not know what they are doing when it comes to inside wire and they also have an institutional culture of lazy techswhich grew out of being the only game in town for so long  Make sure your patch panels are rated for cat  as well I cant tell by looking at the picture what they are rated for but I do not recognize them so they are probably some off brand  When you do have a real cable house come and fix this they should be able to provide a lifetime warranty If they cant or are taken back by the question I would look elsewhere Any cable house worth its salt has vendor trained techs with certs who follow good practices stick to proper product lines and can provide a lifetime warranty If inside wiring is done right once it should never have to be done again baring some huge unexpected change in technology or a new tenant They should also give test results for each port on the panel from a Fluke DTX  This is what allows for the warranty Ive been in structured cable since  or so and the number of shops with lazy and or incompetent techs is pretty staggeringbut the phone company going with the cheapest solution possible really is not Analog phone especially once you are inside the building just needs copper pairs and that is all they are used to dealing with No twists no heavy gauge copper no real bend radius concernsConversely any nd year structured tech worth a damn would have told you to go with at least a cat e  pair and patch panels to match If you are in Western WA I can provide the name of a few shops I trust LA area as well ,3,cdfc9vj,1qp3n8,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,9.0,6

thagrandcow,Back when I was in the military one of the systems the comms guys used went down with some pretty important info on the drive  It was a small unit and nobody had ever set up any kinds of backups  He tried everything he could think of but couldnt get the drive working again  On a whim I told him about the freezer trick and after he stopped thinking I was just messing with him he pulled the drive and stuck it in a ziplock in the freezerObviously the freezer trick is a last resort dont do it ever unless youre convinced the drive is seriously dead and youre not going to spend the big  getting it to a data recovery shopThe HD spent all night in the freezer and the next morning was ready to be booted  The only downside was the unit commander was the first one into the freezer that morning and saw the drive sitting there  He was not happy to have people sticking electronics randomly in places where they shouldnt be  Pretty sure even after explaining it to him he still didnt believe the comms guy but he also didnt toss the drive   minutes later the drive is in a different computer hooked up as a slave the computer boots and like magic the drive is readable for a few minutes  After pulling the data the comms guy drove to my house to thank me personally since I was just a reservist and had finished my drill weekend the day before  That was a good day,15,cdha43t,1qwdtk,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,59.0,44

ForumWarrior,Helpdesk hereAn agent will follow the direction they are given by the people who tell them what to do  If the helpdesk has been told to catch and dispatch with no troubleshooting that is what they will do  If the helpdesk was told to troubleshoot the issue before dispatching that is what they will doWhat a helpdesk agent will not do is change a policy or procedure because an L desktop support calls and doesnt like that we didnt even try to troubleshoot  Thats because universally the person on the phone isnt the person who makes the rulesGet your manager to contact the helpdesk manager or contract coordinator and see why your SD agents are only running catch and dispatch on calls in your area  Its almost a guarantee they have very little staff with high call volume and troubleshooting isnt possible because they would blow their service level agreement by taking even two minutes more per call,8,cdkl327,1r7yh4,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,28.0,20

johnska,I feel your pain but dont feel bad about exploding I worked technology in a school district for a number of years and every meeting we had with our high school staff wound up with one of us techs usually me arguing with one of our business and technology teachers usually the same one and it was very similar to your story They always either needed something brand new every time we talked to them ostensibly because the last thing they had to have last month that would solve all of their problems didnt And they never gave us enough time to try and work through the problems One time they decided to skirt our buying procedure and purchase video cameras for a business class why does a business class need cameras you ask Silly question How else are they supposed to make presentations They dont present in person in the business world they make videos and show them So they went and purchased some Sony cameras that only wrote to DVD And then yelled at us when they couldnt just grab the footage onto their PCs and edit the videos You had to write it to the DVD and then rip it then edit which at the time would take a few hours But if they had talked to us first and let us do the research we could have avoided that This is one of the many things that ended in a shouting matchThe bottom line is always the same though Techs are hired for their knowledge and experience but because someone read something online somewhere they are immediately more qualified to make purchasing and setup decisions They practically goad us into exploding because of the lack of respect of course its not all of them but the ones who do it are always the loudest I always wondered how some of the teachers I had to deal with would react if I jumped into one of their department meetings and said something like We need to switch to the Crackenstein method of teaching Just stop teaching the lesson plans youve worked on crafting for all of these years and just start doing this new thing in midstream and next week Ill have even better ideas for you to implement on the turn of a dimetldr School pizza was just as bad as I remembered,1,cdkyoko,1r88u6,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,8.0,7

DrVinginshlagin,Yay Linux I recently installed Ubuntu on my MBA and started fiddling around with it Being an OS X person at heart I never really had a need to try anything on the command line but Ive started using terminal and learning a bit about different commands and syntax and how to use it properly,0,cdops15,1rkzqe,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,4.0,4
Smith,Kudos for installing Ubuntu Back in  when I was coming across a large string of budget computers budget as in AMD MhzGhz Celeron boxes with SiS chipsets and MB RAM average that needed repair I would come across people who would catch viruses to no end no matter how much you tried to prevent infections Others were given dirt cheap machines that were not only slow but had unlicensed Windows XP on them as well installed by the system builder or did not have a COA attached to their system not attaching these is against the Microsoft Software Agreement For the COA bit Id always ask for these and the user very rarely was able to produce one much less any documentation provided with the machine proving it should have a copy of Windows XP installedWhenever I came across an unlicensed copy of Windows I gave the person two choices  Either buy a license for Windows XP or  I give the machine back with Linux installed Considering people were not playing games or doing much besides check email and browse the web on these horribly slow machines they all for the most part received a copy of Ubunbu with all of their files and essential programs to read those files installed Id also give them full blown lessons for the price of a pizza Months later when these individuals have a quick question for me they always tell me theyre amazed at how fast the computer has been and the lack of games in the browsers Every once in a while Ill receive a call asking for help to install specialized software and Ill gladly remote into the machine and walk them through installing the softwareFor the users who kept getting infections most of these are also the same types that will not bother to try using Linux no matter how close I make it to Windows UIwise They just get a fully patched fully repaired machine back with locks on the machine,0,cdp1n96,1rkzqe,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,4.0,4

IsilZha, hah this is quite familiar to me  I worked at an office where most of the company did a majority of their work in our own in house software IT had a development team of  plus our boss help and me Before I was the systems administrator I was the help desk and occasionally took calls if they were overwhelmed or out   Anyway our proprietary software had its own user database with various permission sets groups and even extremely granular permission control down to specific menu items buttonsetc Well users always needed to have their manager grant any additional permissions either in our software additional internet access  internet was very locked down  certain network resources etc Sometimes it was easy and i would get a call or email from the manger stating an employee should get x  permissions  Id have them email me as well if it was a call so I had a tangible record   On a bit of a side noteI found an actual use for OneNote and copied the emails into it and organized my authorizatios with it Most of the time users just send me or help desk that they need y   permission Half the time Id get the manager email later or nothing   I started getting annoyed when users would send a new message later to either someone else on help desk or even to me again asking the same question so at some point every request that came sans manager approval I forwarded the message on to their manager CCing them asking if it was approved  I got quite a few nos back that way and Im sure those users got flack for it which was definitely part of my plan so those types of users would quit wastng our time  Anyway that aside I got one user that would constantly approve himself for broad high level access to various things even after I had been forwarding his emails off to his manager constantly complaining that he required these permissions immediatelyIn the end he was bad all around  He was fired after only being there for  weeks as he had started spending a majority of his time job hunting during his work hours  Apparently he expected to get paid while he looked for a job he actually wanted  rolleyes,0,cdq2aqx,1rqiy1,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,1.0,1

Smith,I come across this pretty routinely and people for some reason always hate to ask their managers first Last year it was almost an everyday occurrence with people asking for copies of Expensive software that were not standard issue or site licensed Wed ask them to get their manager to signoff and submit a request on their behalf via the ticketing system While most were happy to do this some would complain about the process taking far too long when the problem really wasnt with IT at allFor programs which are installed on the computer The users I deal with are actually good on this regard Occasionally well come across a request for a program which does the same exact thing as a program preinstalled on all of the computers does but the user didnt know about,0,cdq2o8a,1rqiy1,TalesFromTechsupport,hot,1.0,1
