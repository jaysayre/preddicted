beer,Dont get me wrong I like this joke but I feel it might lead to a funnier punchline if you give the first two guys something to say  It gives a little more context I guess  So something like the first guy saying his wife has dinner ready for him every night when he gets home and the second guy says he has his wife trained so she has his favorite channel on and wont speak to him for three hours every night after he comes home  The details of the stories dont really matter but a little more to set up the last story seems to me to give it more of a punch  ,19,c6clgo7,10cthj,jokes,top_all,100.0,81

timotab,After his horrible meal he went to another house which was in fact a farm house He checked the electricity was still on and then knocked at the doorHe went through his spiel again to the farmers wife who had answered the door but said I no longer have anything to demonstrate with but with this being a farm perhaps you have some wheat or something  The farmers wife found a sack of wheat and he took a handful of it and threw it on the ground  However try as he might the highpowered vacuum cleaner simply would not clean it up  He got a little frustrated then looked at the wheat and noticed it was a little damp  He thought for a moment and as he was thinking he noticed another sack that had been sitting by the radiator in the hallway He asked the farmers wife if he could try with that wheat insteadShe rolled her eyes and said OK but this is your last chance He took some of the wheat from the new sack and poured it onto the floor and the vacuum cleaner cleaned it all up without any issues The farmers wife was delighted and bought one right thereThe moral of the story is If at first you dont suck seed try drier grain,92,c6i640w,10zvow,jokes,top_all,696.0,604

PintOfGuinness,I seen a variation of this joke here a year ago think this is betterhttpwwwredditcomrJokescommentsjsmsgzooperformerjokeOne day an out of work mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performerHowever as soon as he starts to draw a crowd the zookeeper grabs him and drags him into his officeThe zookeeper explains to the mime that the zoos most popular attraction a gorilla has died suddenly The keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off He offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one The mime acceptsThe next morning before the crowd arrives the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage He discovers that its a great job He can sleep all he wants play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mimeHowever eventually the crowds tire of him and he gets bored just swinging on tires He begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to hisNot wanting to lose the attention of his audience he climbs to the top of his cage crawls across a partition and dangles from the top to the lions cage Of course this makes the lion furious but the crowd loves itAt the end of the day the zookeeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction as a gorillaWell this goes on for some time The mime keeps taunting the lion the crowds grow larger and his salary keeps going up Then one terrible day when he is dangling over the furious lion he slips and falls The mime is terrified The lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce The mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behindFinally the mime starts screaming and yelling Help Help me but the lion is quick and pounces The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says Shut up you idiot Do you want to get us both fired,1,c6lccsl,11bn6s,jokes,top_all,8.0,7

drewmitchell,Same punchline different setupA man notices his ten year old son doing his nightly prayers before bed and decides to look in and watch  His son doesnt notice and prays the usual yadda yadda yadda but finishes with and goodbye grandpa  Amen  The man thinks thats sure unusual but he doesnt want to reveal that he was spying on his kid so he doesnt say anything about it and just goes to bedThe next day on his way home from work he gets a call from his wife  her dads died  He takes off for his funeral and consoles her and its just awful but the thing hes most troubled by is how his son said goodbye Grandpa the night before  But coincidences happen you know  He decides not to think anything of it until a couple months later he thinks maybe he should listen in again since its still nagging at the back of his mind  He listens wideeyed as his son finishes his prayer with Goodbye Grandma  AmenThe man is too shocked to say anything about the whole thing  If it was possibly his parents he might have but they were already dead so he decides maybe its not even his place to say anything  The next day on his way home from work sure enough he gets a call from his wife  her mom is deadMonths pass and the man now nightly spies on his son praying but cant bring himself to mention it to anyone  This is scary  On the night that he gets the nerve and decides hes going to say something his son says Goodbye Daddy  Amen  The man just quietly backs out of the room as his face turns white as a sheetHe struggles to sleep all night  He doesnt dare mention it to his wife  He would just look crazy  The next morning hes extra careful not to slip in the shower or cut himself in the kitchen  He drives to work mph under the speed limit and while hes there he cancels all his appointments and holes up in his office the whole day  Finally pm rolls around and he starts making it back home  Hey he thinks maybe I avoided the curse  Then he laughs and realizes stupid ol me there was no curse after all  He happily drives the rest of the way home and even picks up flowers for his wifeWhen he gets to the door he says honey Im home and you will not believe the day I had at work  Then he sees his wife and shes a wreck again  Oh no what nowWhatever you had was nothing I went to check the mail this morning and the mailman was dead on the doorstep,0,c7btsa2,149jjc,jokes,top_all,2.0,2

PoorJokeExplainer,The punchline of this joke adds a new twist to a wellknown setup by taking advantage of the fact that the English preposition in can have several meanings The common interpretation of the setup is that of screwing a lightbulb into a socket Here the humor derives from the fact that in can also mean inside thus two ladybugs are physically located inside of a lightbulb add to it the doubleentrende of screw to twist or to have sex and therein lies the jokeNow its almost Christmas folks Do any of you kind souls have a few extra greenbacks to lend so I can buy myself a bottle of peppermint schnapps,109,c7bsw1m,14bult,jokes,top_all,405.0,296

alnewestand,Lets see if we can tweak this joke too improve it  Lets take the first sentence  A guy marries this woman  Its okay to be ambiguous and want to get to the punchline of the joke quickly but this comes off as lazy  Lets try something that gives this character some life and makes him real  Lets call him ArchibaldA man named Archibald is celebrating his th birthday  Now its not necessary to flesh him out this much but weve established a couple of things already just in that one sentence  Archibald is a nerdy name  is a terrifying birthday and the use of quotation marks around celebrating lets us know that Archibald is not happy  A man named Archibald is celebrating his th birthday  Well he would be celebrating but his idea of a celebration by now was a one man game of Russian RouletteNow what Ive done there was bring in a darker sense of humor and downplay it by informing you Archibald wasnt actually playing Russian Roulette  Now in practice Id recommend going one route or the other  You dont want anyone calling you a pussy for not sticking to your guns  Now for this second sentence of the original post  Were in comma splice territory here but not only that you dont want to just jump right into small dick town  The biggest problem is that theres nothing joining these two ideas together  A man can still get married if he has a tiny tallywacker  This could be solved with specifying that his dick is too small too satisfy her or something more savoir faire like unfortunately hes unable to satisfy her in bed  People are smarter than you think they get the ideaThen out of nowhere Archibald hits the romantic lottery with the most beautiful woman hed ever seen  The only problem isThen you need a teensie bit of buildup here  Archibald and Margarite go a year without sex due to Archibalds crippling fear of disappointing his new wife  One day he finds an abnormally large pickle in the jar and has a flash of inspiration  For years day in and day out his wife just cannot get enough  Archibald gets to make his wife happy so hes happy  Even if the two never actually have sexNow what the hell is that are you using a pickle on me  Thats a statement  She doesnt sound very shocked does she  Lets try Remember now it was a point to mention the two had never had sex Archibald I cant believe this  All this time youve been using a pickle  How could you betray my trust like thatArchibald opens his mouth to answer but before he can get out a word their children walk inThats simply the first thing to come to mind  You could just keep the format the same but clean it up  Good luck,16,c7c4lo7,14cy4x,jokes,top_all,15.0,-1

babyiknow,Why Latvian jokes you ask Because for many centuries Latvia and Estonia to the North and Lithuania to a slightly lesser extent was invaded and occupied by Germany Sweden Russia hell even Poland  They would come in rape and pillage then sit around and impose their will and culture  Meanwhile all the poor Latvians ever wanted to do is go berry and mushroom hunting in peace They are pretty depressed as a society from what I hear But on the bright side I think all the raping made their gene pool awesome or something because they are BEAUTIFUL people along with Estonia  More supermodels per capita than anywhere else  And while they are not fighters they found their strength in massive peaceful protests in the late sor early s Estonians Latvians and Lithuanians once formed a chain of people singing and holding hands running almost the entire length of their countries North to SouthEdit I apologize I meant not fighters ANYMORE read my other comment below if interested,140,c7fery1,14q1lq,jokes,top_all,658.0,518

cosmo,So this guy is out in the woods hunting bear  He spies a bear passing by a brush  Sitting he focuses his gun  The bear vanishes  A couple minutes later he feels a tap on his shoulder  Turning he sees the bear  The way I see it the bear says is that you could pull down your pants and let me fuck youor Ill tear you apart and eat you while youre still alive enough to watch meThe man turned around pulled down his pants and the bear had his way with himThe next day the man was pissed  He took his gun and limped off back into the woods determined the find the bear  Shortly after arriving he spied the bear near a brook  He took aim and before he could shoot the bear vanished behind a clump of trees  A few moments latertap tap tap  The man turned and saw the bear behind him againThe way I see it the bear says is that you could pull down your pants and let me fuck youor Ill tear you apart and eat you while youre still alive enough to watch meThe man unbuckled his pants turned and the bear took him againThe next morning the man was pissed  He spent the night rubbing tucks pads on his ass he had to use one of his wifes maxipads in his tightie whities  He took every gun in the house and headed into the woods before sun rise  This would be the day that he had his revenge  He rigged wires to trap the bear set bear traps in every location he could think  He set them with steak and chicken  As the sun came up he found a spot where he would see if the bear came around  Soon he saw his foe  Taking aim with his gun he almost had a perfect shot  Almostand then the bear vanished  Moments latertap tap tapThe man turned and the bear was smiling arms crossed over his chest  Dude the bear said  You aint here for the hunting are ya,167,c7of6zi,15omyt,jokes,top_all,703.0,536

GeekyCivic,I heard a joke years ago that went something like thisA priest a lawyer and electrician are on a plane to a thirdworld country upon arriving their identities are mistaken for criminals wanted for capital crimes When disembarking the plane they are immediately detained by local authorities and taken directly to prison The language barrier between the men and their captors makes it impossible for them to prove their true identities Weeks pass the men are disheartened and it is now their time for execution death by electric chairFirst man to be executed is the priest The priest is shackled into the chair the spongy thing on his head is fastened down the executioner throws the switch but nothing happens The priest proclaims it is by the grace of god he is saved from being wrongfully executed and the guards release himNext is the lawyer he is shackled into the chair same routine The executioner throws the switch again nothing happens The lawyer declares his full faith in the law of the land was what saved him from a wrongful executionFinally its the electricians turn He gets shackled into the chair spongy thing fastened down onto his head but before they got the hood over his head he looks over and follows the power cord to the outlet and shouts I found the problem The chair isnt plugged inThe moral of the story when it was told to me was the difference between knowledge and wisdom is knowing when and how to use it,5,c7y1966,16olj1,jokes,top_all,13.0,8

EKat,I really want this joke to be funny but it isnt logicallythough of course no joke is truely logical Allow me to explain why as a trans woman this isnt all that funnyFirst of all one does not just go to a clinic to have the who sex change thing right then at least not yet It is a long and arduous process that take in the shortest amount of time a year but in most all cases it is a multiyear processSecond of all Trans women are not new women They have always been women since they have first realized what gender is and it is not a mental thing but a physical thing I myself did not start transitioning till about a year ago but I have always known I was actually a girl but due to societal pressures and cultural notions toward the subject I have always been too afraid to admit it to others and myself at timesLastly if the joke as written had been correct those womenand men cause they exist too would totally not have sex with you You are just there for the easy lay and these are women the same as most all other women would be disgusted with that kind of act In conclusion This joke follows too illogically in all of its facets to be funny It could not ever be a good sex tip and isolates an entire group of human beings to be made fun of and is on par with racism antisemitism and other highly offensive forms of prejudicesTLDR Try again,29,c7yzq4g,16rn27,jokes,top_all,13.0,-16

LukeIAmYourOtter,Since this thread has turned into a debate on racism I just wanted to say that i think  of all jokes are prejudiced towards some group of people whether theyre about gender sexuality race religion etc  And I think theres a reason for that  Joking about serious issues in society makes people feel better about it and like it doesnt hold as much power over them  My husband is in the military and I dont think that landmines ambushing people is funny or ok but when you make a joke about it some of the fear I have goes away  Thats the point of jokes  They provide you with an escape even if for just a brief second  I dont think that any topic should be off limits to joke about  As Stephen Fry saidhttpimgurcomQmeh,1,c7zngzz,16t8wk,jokes,top_all,2.0,1

darksingularity,Nice joke Funnier edit But regardless of the fact that this is an open forum there are simple things we should abide by Your use of this joke was an accident and should not have been punished as it was At the same time though I dont think you appreciate the extent of the matter at hand This has less to do with money and more to do with intellectual property Sure on reddit this is routinely broken but if this were to happen in the real world and the joke you usedreached high places wouldnt it suck for the original person if everyone thought this OP made it Again I dont agree with most of the dicks who commented but I hope you realize that intellectual property no matter how trivial should be respected above that of piracy of original content which does not actually take credit for the work it steals Thanks and have a good day OP,15,c84ixvz,17cjms,jokes,top_all,3.0,-12

Thab,Years ago a famous golfer was invited by the king of Saudi Arabia to play in a golf tournament He accepted the invitation and the king flew his private jet over to the United States to pick up the pro They played golf for several days and enjoyed a good time As the golfer was getting on the plane to return to the United States the king stopped him and said I want to give you a gift for coming all this way and making this time so special Anything you want What could I get you Ever the gentleman the golfer replied Oh please dont get me anything Youve been a gracious host Ive had a wonderful time I couldnt ask for anything more The king was adamant He said No I insist on giving you something so you will always remember your journey to our country When the golfer realized that the king was resolute he said Okay fine I collect golf clubs Why dont you give me a golf club He boarded the plane and on his flight back home he couldnt help wondering what kind of golf club the king might give him He imagined that it might be a solid gold putter with his name engraved on it Or maybe it would be a sand wedge studded with diamonds and jewels After all this would be a gift from the oilrich king of Saudi Arabia When the golfer got home he watched the mail and the delivery services every day to see if his golf club had come yet Finally several weeks later he received a certified letter from the king of Saudi Arabia The US professional thought that rather strange Wheres my golf club he wondered He opened the envelope and to his surprise inside he discovered a deed to a fivehundredacre golf course in America ,3,c85s1b4,17i3f5,jokes,top_all,29.0,26

ChazEru,Its a similar joke to the International Mime competition Better told when you can act it out but Ill try to convey it hereIt was the finals at the annual international mime competition The two nations represented were France and Canada a Quebecer of course The competition works as a conversation with pantomime only If one makes any noise or takes too long they are disqualifiedThe coin toss gave the Frenchman the first go He held up one finger The Canadian held up two fingers The Frenchman immediately replied with three fingers to which the Canadian vehemently replied with a fist to the air After a moment the Frenchman gave the okay gesture The Canadian replied by making a wedge with his hands and pushed them forward The Frenchman stopped uh A noise was uttered and the Frenchman lostBack in Paris the French are drowning their sorrows in wine Pierre How could you lose Well I began with unity So he replied with duality I showed him the trinity And he proclaimed Power to the People I said that was an okay response And then he did this Mimicking the winning gesture WHAT IS THISBack in Quebec theyre celebrating drinking their Molson How DID you beat that old Frenchman eh Well he said hed shove a finger up my ass so I said Id shove two up his He upped it to three fingers in the ass so I said Id shove my whole fist up his He worried that his was too small I offered to widen it a little,8,c8bph7i,184qb5,jokes,top_all,47.0,39

bakchodminator,Actually this is not a JokeThis is a true story the actual conversation though was betweenKalidashttpenwikipediaorgwikiKClidCsa a great Sanskrit writer and his wife to be VidyotmaIn this case Vidyotma was learned one True Side Story Vidyotma was a princess she was very intelligent and proud of it When her age came her father decided to get her married But she wanted she would only marry some one who is intelligent than her So she created a marriage challenge that who ever will beat her in intelligence she will marry him Wise men from all part of the kingdom started their journey to visit the competition There was a group of these  Pundits who saw this guy who was cutting a tree branch on which he was sitting They asked him is he out of his mind he will end up hurting himself to which the he replied that it took him long time for him to climb this tree this is the fastest way he will come down They all got an Idea On the way they asked him to keep his mouth shut as he cant speak Sanskrit they will do the translation he did what they saidthe joke partThe princess was impressed and they got married On the wedding night he saw a camel out side palace and starting speaking utra how ever the correct Sanskrit is Ustra seeing this he is not Sanskrit literate princess kicked him outBecause of this Kalidas studied and worked hard and wrote  Great Epics which to this date are one of the best epics written in Sanskrit When he returned to his house his wife asked the following famous question Asti Kashchit VaagvisheshaH asti  is kashchit  when as in questioning vAg  speech visheshaH  expert ie  are you now an expert in speaking have you got the linguistics degreeIn response to her question Kalidasa wrote three works of exceptional literary beauty all three poems  starting with the three words of her questionWith Asti  astiuttarasyaam dishi  Kumarasambhavam epic poemWith Kashchit  kashchitkaantaa  Meghdoot lyric poemWith Vaag  vaagarthaaviva  Raghuvansha epic poemthe three books starting with the  wordswith asti  astiuttarasyAm dishi  Kumarasambhavam  epic with kashchit  kashchitkAntA  Meghdoot  poetrय with vAg  vAgarthAviva  Raghuvansha  epic,8,c8buiac,184qb5,jokes,top_all,13.0,5

usernameugh,One of my favorite jokes of all time I almost posted it earlier this week However I heard it as Pope vs Rabbi and think it is a bit funnierHeres the relevant part of course this is a physical joke thats what really makes it workThe Pope makes a semicircle over his headThe Rabbi points at the groundThe Pope raises one fingerThe Rabbi raises  fingersThe Pope does the communion ceremonyThe Rabbi eats an appleLater the Popes chief Cardinals and Bishops gather round Father they say we got most of what happened but can you explain the finer points Certainly says the Pope First I said this is the Vatican home to all Catholics on Earth The Rabbi reminded me that we must all deal with Hell which is below us I then said that we believe in one God And the Rabbi reminded me that of the three Abrahamic traditions Christianity Judaism and Islam we all believe in the same one God Then I said by using the Eucharist that we believe in Jesus the Christ who died for our sins But the Rabbi reminded me that we must all deal with Original Sin Thats when I decided that the Jews could stayLater in a delicatessan across from St Peters the Rabbi was tucking into a nice pastrami with his chiefs and advisors now this next part has to be said in your best New York Jewish voiceTeacher they said What givesThe Rabbi shrugged and explained The Pope said this is the Vatican The Jews are outta here I said we aint leaving He said you got one week I said give us three Then he ate his lunch and I ate my lunch,2,c8c0xuk,184qb5,jokes,top_all,2.0,0

MeAndLazarus,Imagine this joke being retold but with one seemingly small factor changed the big guy is white Maybe it is equally funny to you and its certainly possible that its been told that way before Yet for some reason here its not presented that way Its not even presented in raceneutral language Somehow race has come to be explicitly mentioned here Truthfully if we wanted to tell this joke with two white characters race probably wouldnt even be mentioned at all We need to explicitly present the man as nonwhite in order to have us bring other races into these jokes So now lets ask why is he explicitly presented as black Is it because black people are rumored to have larger penises Or because we have an image from sports media of the physically impressive black man Could be But the big guy states his remarkable height and penis size anyway  either way he informs us that hes a large individual and we have no trouble imagining abnormally large white individuals such as to pick from popular culture Andre the Giant Is it then because black people have historically been presented as being oversexualized and animalistic which has actually been part of the reason why in addition to a longer flaccid penis we even have the myth of the hugely endowed black man because black people have long been feared as rapists going back to times when white men felt the need to protect white women from them because black people have been characterized in the media as violent criminals and scary hoodlums or because it is easier identifying with a white person being so fearfully afraid of a black person This is not to say people of color wouldnt necessarily also tell this joke with the races constructed as such  most of us in the West regardless of race read the same newspapers see the same movies buy into the same advertisements and hence belong to similar ideological backgrounds This is increasingly so as the world becomes globalized It could be a coincidence but since its ultimately about the homosexual interestingly victimization of a white person by a hypersexual monstrouslysized black person I think we can argue that it might not be This joke doesnt overtly present itself as being about race and yet race is present Its up to us as creators and consumers of culture to analyze our words the small bits that whiz by almost unnoticed and to think what are they actually saying,40,c8kr6u4,193oue,jokes,top_all,66.0,26

Topochicho,I have heard it before but slightly different Heres a quick version of the joke since I am on my phoneThe bicyclist is an old man trying to pass the Porshe in the bicycle lane at a stop light the driver is a dick amp is in the bike laneThe cyclists stops his bike amp begins to straddle walk the bike past the car for fear of loosing his balance if he tries to ride by The driver sees the cyclist as he gets to the door amp not liking him so close  honks his horn scares the old man amp he loses his balance falling against the car The cyclist amp driver start cursing at each other amp as soon as the light turns green the driver takes off like a bat out of hellQueue sequence of driver looking in mirror seeing the cyclist speeding up and looking in mirror againAt mph the driver was really beginning think he had lost his mind and the old man had decided that no matter what he was never ever going to wear suspenders againThe cop that saw them go by called it in amp told the station to send a deputy to the old folks home to arrest the staff because he just saw a Porshe go by at mph amp old man Jennings was on his bike behind it flashing is little light and honking his horn to pass So whatever drugs theyre giving those people up there cant be legal  minutes later when the cop caught up to the Porsche and the cyclist he found them on the side of the road  man performing CPR on the other manAfter the cop called for an ambulance the old man explained to him about his suspender being caught on the guys mirror But it all finally came to a stop after the long corner they had just gone aroundThe driver was having a fit because the cyclist was keeping up but when they went around the corner it had slung the cyclist really wide amp the driver had a heart attack when he realized that he was being passed on the outside in a corner,0,c8nq9qf,19dgkn,jokes,top_all,1.0,1

streetwalker,this is a variation of  an old gag told by flight engineers Prior to modern technology there were runway markers that tell the pilot where given the weight payload wingspan and other characteristics of an airplane the optimal point to pull back on the stick is in order to take off All this needed to be calculated before takeoff so the pilot knew which marker is the takeoff point  The joke is there is a new flight engineer in the jumpseat and the pilot enters the cockpit drunk so he cant fly No worries he has the best copilot When the copilot  turns around and smiles to say hello  it becomes apparent that he is nearly blind with these thick cokebottle glasses on At this point the person in the jump seat is pretty worried  how can he see where the marker is but the pilot says to relax  hes the best copilot  They pickup speed down the runway for talkoff and as they pass the proper marker the pilot lets out an loud sucking gasp and the copilot pulls back on the stick You have to tell this joke in person for the suckinggasp sound to have effect and it has to be told from the perspective of the person in the jumpseat ,9,c8o1dh5,19gvqg,jokes,top_all,11.0,2

tdillo,I think the joke is funny but it could be better I agree with DirichletIndicator that you should differentiate between the two better than just man and old man I also think there should be a more compelling reason for the guy on the roof to come down other than hes just polite Even something like the man on the ground telling the man on the roof that he doesnt want to yell where the neighbors can hear creates a bit of curiosity Likewise the man on the roof should say or do something that might compel the man on the ground to follow him back up the ladder as well as give us some reason to believe that the man on the roof is indeed going to help the other man out without actually committing himself to do so That way when the man on the roof says No it is a bit more unexpected and so carries more of a punch,0,c8su9np,19z45z,jokes,top_all,9.0,9

ImurderREALITY,This doesnt add up Are you suggesting that the genie gave him a giant dick and took away his ability to recall things Because the way it seems in the joke the genie gave him a choice between a giant dick or a flawless memory implying that if he chose dick his memory would be unaffected But if he cant remember something that just happened that means the genie gave him a bad memory when he got the giant dick while also implying that if he had chosen memory his average sized dick would then be taken away leaving him with a small dick I guess the guy could have already had a terrible memory but that is never said in the joke so we dont know Basically not a very well written joke,34,c8vw0qr,1aawld,jokes,top_all,7.0,-27

DameWigginsOfLee,Three logicians walk into a bar  The bartender asks does anyone want a drinkThe first logician says YesThe second logician says YesThe third logician says YesThe bartender pours three beers Then the first logician says However it is not pursuant to these premises that such an individual is located in this establishmentEDIT Most commenters below appear to have misunderstood this version of the joke  The bartender assumes that anyone ranges only over the people she is addressing as most people do in conversation  However the logicians have interpreted it as ranging over well anyoneGunswick farsightxr EatingSteak and meshugga have all made the same mistake  You cannot in fact deduce that the first logician wants a beer  only that he knows of the existence of someone who does  Indeed his final line strongly suggests that he personally doesnt want one  Most of these commenters are correct though that the second and third logician may not want drinks and may not previously have known of anyone who doesTL DR Logicians are no fun at parties,12,c9155zq,1av39x,jokes,top_all,78.0,66

takesjokeliterally,Okay lets assume for a minute that the lawyers arm could have been torn off without pulling him into the street and killing him how in the hell could he have called  with  hand  without noticing that he only had one arm  not very likely if you ask me  And even after the  call assuming he neglected to mention that his arm was off when the officer arrived on the scene he would have obviously noticed the missing arm and called for a paramedic before even talking to the lawyer  And even after calling in the paramedic and then listening to the lawyers rant theres no way he would then berate the fresh amputee by calling him materialistic that would be completely unprofessional and everyone knows every cop ever has only been nothing but professional  ever,113,c9b0kpk,1bx7kf,jokes,top_all,320.0,207

TheTalentedAmateur,Ive heard of this lady and her life story is fascinating  Eventually she wound up in Las Vegas and worked as a prostitute at a brothel  One day a truck driver came to the brothel and hired her services  When they got to her room she popped out that glass eye and said do me hereThe trucker was shocked  Though he was reluctant at first she eventually convinced him to try it out  After the act was completed he said That was the best I EVER had  I never imagined it could be that good  I have to take this truck load to Denver but I should be back this way in a couple of weeks  Will you still be here then  Can I see youShe simply replied Ill keep an eye out for you,44,c9euffy,1caoou,jokes,top_all,266.0,222

TheDogwhistles,A man bought a parrot for his wifes birthday It cost thousands of dollars but it was trained in seventeen different languages The parrot had gone past pure mimicry and could carry on a conversation with you in any of those languagesThe man comes home and the parrot is nowhere to be found He asks his wife where her birthday present isOh dear the wife replies I thought you gave that to me so I could roast it in the oven Not to keep as a petThe man is dumbfounded That parrot could speak over ten different languagesWell then why didnt he say anything when I put him in the oven thenA man gets a parrot but for some reason it wont talk He goes to the pet store and the manager there immediately knows whats wrongParrots wont talk unless they have some sort of physical interaction What you need is one of these here ladders that fit in the cage Hell climb the ladder hop around a bit and then start to talk PromiseBut a week goes by the parrot hops around the ladder alright but still doesnt talk The manager isnt quite so confident this time But Im sure that if you buy this little bell the parrot will talk this time Hell climb up the ladder hop around on it ring the bell and then talkAlas the parrot still refuses to talk for a week The man is getting kind of annoyed with the pet store for wasting his money on silly toys that dont get the parrot to talk Isnt there anything he complains That I can get for my parrot that he actually needs I go home every day and tell him what the things I got for him at the pet store are for but he refuses to talkThe manager looks very carefully at the companys guidelines for parrots not wanting to lose a customer Sir he says after leafing through the book I know exactly what to do You need to buy a mirror and put it in front of the bell at the top of the ladder Your parrot will hop up the ladder ring the bell look in the mirror and begin to talk because he thinks hes talking to another parrot Its foolproofThe next day the man comes back into the pet store Well my parrot diedThe manager is shocked And he didnt say anything the entire time he was aliveWell he did say one thing Doesnt that pet store sell any parrot foodA man gets a parrot for his son but it has a terrible vocabulary I dont mean to say that he speaks grammatically incorrect but rather that the parrot would swear like a sailor every time someone passed his cageThe man tried everything to get him to not use such foul language around his young son He knew it would be a bad influence on him if the parrot kept it up but it would also be detrimental to simply give away the parrotHe begins by tapping the parrot on the beak with a stick every time he swears Instead of conditioning the parrot against swearing as he had hoped the parrot swore even more after being hit on the beakSo the man takes a handful of bird food away from the parrot every time he swore But the hungrier the parrot got the more he sworeHe calls up the pet store and asks the manager what to do Its simple sir the manager repies Parrots are tropical animals They dont react to the cold well at all If he does something bad just put him in the freezer I have to warn you though it might severely damage the parrot if you leave him in there for too longThe man takes the advice to heart and tries his previous tactics to get the bird to stop cursing But one day he snaps grabs the parrot and throws it in the freezer He can still here the parrot kicking and squaking and cursing worse than he ever had while in the freezer until the parrot abruptly stopped after a few minutesSomewhat surprised the man opens up the freezer and the parrot calmly hops onto his owners shoulder and says perfectly calmly Im sorry about my foul language earlier sir I now realize the error of my ways and dont need to be punished anymoreWell what caused you to have a change of heart so suddenlyI saw the turkey in the freezer and dont want to end up like him sirWhy do I know so many parrot jokes,50,c9oy4r4,1dc52k,jokes,top_all,234.0,184

kuqumi,I like to tell this one as a shaggy dog joke about a man who becomes president Hes from a small town the kind where everyone has a signature dish that they bring dinner when theyre invited over You can go into great detail about the different dishes each family brings If your audience complains explain that the joke is worth it The most important one is that his mom makes an amazing fruit punch Anyway he rises through all the different political offices from Town Clerk all the way up to President The first few promotions he gets together with the other folks from home You can add some more families and their famous dishes at this point if you like At least mention his moms punch and a few other dishes At some point though he gets too busy to participate in these gatherings The fundraising the press the need to maintain a public image use whatever reason suits your storySo he has a successful run as president and someone has the bright idea to invite his friends and family to the capitol building for a farewell dinner At this point you can list off all the families and what they bring just make sure to mention his mother and her famous fruit punch So hes at the party he wants to eat and he especially wants to get some of that fruit punch since its been years and he has such happy memories But as the president he has to shake hands and greet the other politicians and he cant get a minute to himself So he steps away for a little while to clear his head He resigns himself to the fact that hes not getting any punch and heads back in to shake some more hands But the dining area is clear He sees his mom standing by the punch bowl with nobody waiting How wonderful Theres no punch line,0,c9pr6j9,1dejga,jokes,top_all,2.0,2

CloakNStagger,I have a similar oneIn a village deep in the African jungles there was a king who ruled over a moderately sized clan named Kwanda Recently they had begun to start diplomatic relationships trade agreements and the like with other neighboring tribesOne day Kwanda had an important meeting with another powerful leader to negotiate the trade of the precious stones Kwandas tribe had in their posession The throne of Kwanda was highly decorated with these stones making their abundance in the area very obviousIn order to get the upper hand in the trades and convince the other leader the stones were of supreme rarity he ordered his subjects to hide his throne away in the thick folds of the thatched foliage that made up their homesSoon the other leader arrives and they begin to barter inside Kwandas home but before long the throne dislodges and falls crushing Kwanda underneath The tribe learned that day Dont stow thrones in grass houses,7,c9x7r47,1e61mt,jokes,top_all,17.0,10

Deyorunner,Three men where driving on the road and their van broke down Luckily they were next to a farm with a large fence behind it They talked to the owner of the barn and he agrees to let them stay the night so their van could get fixed as long as they dont look over the fence They were very curious at this point and wanted to look but they knew they needed a place to stay the night so they agree That night their curiosity got the best of them and they had to look over the fence So they went to the fence and looked over There were several severed penises and they started freaking out What made it worse was the farmer was right behind them Fearing for their lives they beg for him to let them go He agrees as long as they tell him what their fathers did for work Thinking they successfully avoided death the first responded with My father is a lumberjack The farmer then proceeded to get a chainsaw he cut of the first mans penis and threw it over the fence The second responds with My father is a gardener of  years The farmer pulled out a pair of hedge trimers cuts of the second mans penis and throws it over the fence At this point the third man cant stop laughing The farmer irritated asks him why he was laughing The third man responds still laughing My father worked at a candy shop so youll have you suck my cock off,63,ca0xu4j,1ej1b2,jokes,top_all,257.0,194

ArMcK,Tldr actual answer for those who might be interested Kinda funny but no If I recall my catechism correctly believers think abortion is a sin and they think that Mary was chosen to bear Christ because she was without sin other than the Original Sinhence her having an abortion would have stained her mortal record leaving her unsuitable to bear the Christchild even if she had been the perfect candidate before Furtherif God were truly omnipotent then he would foresee Marys choice and he would pick a different vessel for his seed leaving Mary as just some other forgotten carpenters wife and her fetus would never have been Jesus in the first place just some other smut on the end of a coat hanger ,13,cam974y,1go4g4,jokes,top_all,18.0,5

thamonsta,Verbose  Same joke  An Englishman a German and a Frenchman are in Saudi Arabia sharing a smuggled crate of booze when Saudi police rush in and arrest them The mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia so they are all sentenced to  lashes each of the whip  As they were preparing for their punishment the Sheikh announced Its my wifes birthday and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping  The German was first He thought for a while and then said Please tie a pillow to my back This was done but the pillow only lasted  lashes before the whip went through When the punishment was done the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain  The Frenchman was next After watching the German in horror he said smugly Please affix two pillows to my back The two pillows withstood  lashes before the whip went through and the Frenchman was soon led away whimpering loudly  The Englishman was last but before he could say anything the Sheikh turned to him and said You are from a most beautiful part of the world and your culture is one of the finest For this you may have two wishes  Thank you your Most Royal and Merciful highness the Englishman replied In recognition of your kindness my first wish is that you give me not  but  lashes  Not only are you an honorable handsome and powerful man you are also very brave the Sheikh said with an admiring look on his face If  lashes is what you desire then so be it And your second wish what is it to be the Sheikh asked  The Englishman smiled and said Tie the Frenchman to my back,25,cb5ivap,1ikvz7,jokes,top_all,24.0,-1
Jikininki,Very good joke What would be an interesting twist at the end could be for the Englishman to ask the Sheik to recieve his  lashings not from a whip  but from his wifes or daughters tongue Mostly because he gave the Englishman the chance to do so with a second wish,2,cb5o16y,1ikvz7,jokes,top_all,1.0,-1

moderatelybadass,For the high school German student in me and the pointlessly drawn out pun lover in me Next a tourist from Deutschland walks up to the bar with a dachshund and the tourist asks the bartender for the same bet The bartender agrees so the tourist asks his dog What would you call a womans breast which has a tattoo on it The dog then stares at his owner while saying nothing at all This goes on for almost thirty seconds until the bartender speaks up asking for the money The tourist gives it to him because he is an honest man but as he does this he says to the dog Why have you done this You lost me fifty US dollars The dog then replies  How do you expect the barkeep to know about the German word for a dogs vocalizations Besides we dont really say tatutata Its sounds that humans dont understand so they make up words but not all dogs make the same kinds of sounds This seems to be the case with humans as well The bartender is mildly to moderately amused by the clearly superior dog so he offers to put the money on the tourists tab which is already almost forty US dollars as any relatively acceptable beer was grossly overpriced ,2,cb85il1,1itgd7,jokes,top_all,4.0,2

TheNeckbeardKing,Reminded me of one of my favoritesA man is looking through the latest issue of his favorite cheap porn magazine  Hes sees an ad for The AMAZING singing blow job with just an address listed  He thought to himself What the hell is a singing blow jobDays go by and the man cant stop thinking about it and his curiosity gets the best of him  He heads down to the address and it leads to a small bare office with a woman behind a desk  The man says Im here for the singing blow job please  The woman replies Great That will be  dollars dollars thats ridiculous  But then he thinks to himself dammit I have to know what this is  He reluctantly pays the money and the lady tells him to go to the door at the end of the hall  He slowly makes his way down with all sorts of fantasies bolstering his anticipation for whats to comeHe opens the door and sees a very attractive petite pixie looking blonde waiting for him  The room is mostly empty with just a small couch and a little table next to it  The man says I cant wait to see what this is about  The woman replies Unfortunately you cant see it you experience it  Please turn off the lightsThe man was a little disappointed but he did what she asked  The girl called him over and began to give him a blow job  She was amazing the man thought  Easily the best one he ever had  Then she began to sing  It was the most beautiful and breathtaking voice he had ever heardThe man couldnt believe or comprehend what was happening but the experience was taking him to a place he never imagined  But still he had to know how she was doing thisThe second he finished the man desperately ran for the light but the room was still pitch black  He fumbled his hands on the wall for just a moment before finding the switch  The lights when on and he quickly turned back to seeThe girl was gone but there was a glass eye on the table,3,cb9gcv9,1iyaqa,jokes,top_all,11.0,8

takesjokeliterally,This is just unrealistic I mean if the children are old enough to successfully cook bacon and eggs without burning the house down they are probably old enough to be considerate enough as to cook for her as well as themselves  Most small children are introduced to the concept of breakfast in bed early on especially for mothers day so its unlikely that they would just cook for themselves and forget about her  And unless they planned on doing all the dishes associated with cooking a meal themselves they really didnt do her a favor assuming that shes the one who would have to do the cleaning  What do you think they did with the bacon grease  Do you think they poured it down the sink like some irresponsible inconsiderate idiots or did they appropriately pour it into a jar or can As thoughtless as they appear to be I dont have much hope in this regard    And what kind of parent raises inconsiderate little monsters like that anyway  She doesnt even deserve breakfast in bed if she has so poorly reared her offspring  Im starting to doubt that this even happened at all,19,cbnt2ad,1kcddj,jokes,top_all,42.0,23

TheDudemeister,This is kind of like the opposite of the husband storeA store that sells husbands has just opened where a woman may go to choose a husband from among many men The store is composed of  floors and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights There is however a catch As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor but if you go up a floor you cannot go back down except to exit the building So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband On the first floor the sign on the door reads Floor   These men have jobs The woman reads the sign and says to herself Well thats better than my last boyfriend but I wonder whats further up So up she goes The second floor sign reads Floor   These men have jobs and love kids The woman remarks to herself Thats great but I wonder whats further up And up she goes again The third floor sign reads Floor   These men have jobs love kids and are extremely good looking Hmmm better she says But I wonder whats upstairs The fourth floor sign reads Floor   These men have jobs love kids are extremely good looking and help with the housework Wow exclaims the woman very tempting BUT there must be more further up And again she heads up another flight The fifth floor sign reads Floor   These men have jobs love kids are extremely good looking help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak Oh mercy me But just think what must be awaiting me further on So up to the sixth floor she goes The sixth floor sign reads Floor   You are visitor  to this floor There are no men on this floor This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please,28,cbwk1j5,1l6kf4,jokes,top_all,151.0,123

iamthefrogprince,A Royal Canadian Navy Sailor and a Canadian Army soldier were touring Mt McKinley The sailor in his Navy Staff car started up the single lane trail towards the top of the mountain The soldier having already ascended the mountain began his track down the mountain in his army jeep Slowly inexorably they made their way closer to one another until they both reached a particularly narrow part of the trail near the middle of the mountain  The sailor seeing the Army jeep assumed the soldier would pull over to the side to allow the less manoueverable staff car to pass The soldier seeing the less manoeuvreable staff car asumed the sailor would pull over and wait for his jeep to pass so that the staff car could have the whole road to itselfThe crash left them both stunned momentarily however both drivers recovered quickly and began to quarrel over who was at fault and who should have given way to whom The argument became more and more heated Just as it seemed that it would come to blows the sailor threw up his hands and said Stop please I cant stand it any more WEre both professional military men Were brothers in arms and this isnt worth fighting overThe soldier sheepishly agreed with the sailor and reached out his hand in friendship The sailor reached behind the drivers seat of the Staff car and pulled out a bottle of Navy issue rumI was saving this for a special occasion said the sailor but this seems like as good a time as any and he cracked the top of the bottle and handed it to the soldier as a peace offering Lets toast to our brothership in arms said the sailorThe soldier polished off a healthy portion of hte bottle and handed it back to the sailorThank you brother said the soldier thats very generous of youThe sailor smiled said youre welcome and placed the top back on te bottle before carefully stowing it back in the trunk of the carThe soldier confused said arent you going to have anyThe sailor winked and said You bet I am brother but Ill wait until after the police have taken my report,9,cc0xuls,1ln2d1,jokes,top_all,34.0,25

appropriateusername,gtIt is prejudice Sharks do not circle in the water before they attack it is simply their way of trying to form an image of what they are confronting in the water According to my own numerous observations this motion is a sign of pure curiosity and not an incentive to circle its prey and feed Most shark species must engage in permanent swimming maneuvers to breathe for they cannot pump water past their gills to extract oxygen as other fish with skeletal systems can In addition a swimmer or diver in contrast to a shark remains almost immobile so the shark can only choose between two available forms of behavior circling or swimming a figure eight  moving up and down around the object of interest Circling has the advantage that the shark need not continually change the direction of swimming while being able to remain at a constant distance to the object However when the object is not located in open waters for example in a reef the shark cannot circle without risking the loss of eye contact In such case the shark has to swim a figure eight around the swimmer or diver and in so doing will make sure to always keep his back towards open waterTIL Though IDk how trustworthy the sourcehttpwwwsharkinfochSIecirclinghtml is,5,cc2hc2o,1ls9fu,jokes,top_all,9.0,4

conundrumu,This actually reminds me of a story I read long ago about a WHO group in Northern India teaching birth control and providing supplies in remote villages They would get the tribal elders who in turn would show the others together in the town hall and during the instruction would roll a condom out onto a broomstick The World Health Organization group went back to one village to check on things a year later and the birth rate was higher than ever They asked the Elders what they were doing to cause such a jump after the previous visit and they replied they did not know  they all  rolled the condoms out on the broomsticks just as instructed before having sex with their wivesbut it just didnt seem to be working,2,cc46plv,1lyn09,jokes,top_all,15.0,13

carinishead,My grandpa told me a version of this type of joke once mice are sitting around drinking at a mouse bar and start talking about how tough they each are  The first mouse slams down a shot and says Im so tough every morning I wake up and go around the house take the cheese from the mousetraps and bust out  reps on each one  Second mouse says ahh thats nothing slams a shot and proceeds Im so tough that every morning I go around the house and collect all the rat poison pellets and crumble them up and sprinkle that shit on my breakfast cereal  The third mouse just sits there quietly drinks his shot then starts to leave  The other two look at him and pry well what about you  Not man enough to hang with us  The third mouse casually replies I dont have time for these childish games  I have to get home and fuck the cat,76,ccbvvoq,1mqog8,jokes,top_all,406.0,330

FriarTuck,The idea of being a feminist is a somewhat sexist thing in its own An egalitarian is for basic explanation someone whom thinks that everyone should be equalA feminist is someone whom thinks that there is a patriarchy that needs to be battled Not someone who wants equality The best example of this is the male rape fiasco Many radical feminists refuse to believe that men can be raped They have protested and cause some serious issues over speakers whom believe this Instead of increasing the care for people ALL people whom have been victims of sexual assault they fight to hold male rape care down and raise female rape care That makes no damn sense gain equality by lowering men Why not gain equality by raising women up to an equal plat formI am an egalitarian though i am subbed to mens rights rfeminisms banned me for asking for their side of the story I didnt want to just beleve one side without hearing the other side i am not an MRA i am an egalitarian whom sees MANY different groups who need help,15,ccfi0vp,1n3j0l,jokes,top_all,15.0,0

Urasquirrel,Heres a comment way to serious for this post lol Yesterday I was looking at a picture the army has up on my local university campus and they ALWAYS have people of darker skin in the picture and sometimes leave out many other races I dont have a problem with this one bit but it sparked a thought into my skull I was once in the ROTC at my university For  years I worked with people and realized that people of color were treated special They were given jobs that others were more qualified for because why       numbers Equality is not fairness and when equality is shoved down our throats to this point that the ones who protect our country are given jobs not because they are the best but because they deserve what others have worked harder for THIS IS THE REASON OUR COUNTRY FAILS stop bitching and get work We need to stop trying to group things by vaginas and penises and color just to get yourself a piece of pie that you truly do not deserve tldrI love people of all races and genders and I love people of all countries I dont even say these things because I want the US to be better than the next country I live in this country and Im just tired of all the bitching that we do I wish our attitudes could change on a massive scale stop bitching and get work,1,ccfod2l,1n3j0l,jokes,top_all,2.0,1

GoldenGlobe,Hmm The version I know is a bit longer It goes like this   Sitting on the side of the road waiting to catch speeding drivers a state trooper sees a car puttering along at  mph This driver is as dangerous as any speeder he thinks to himself So he turns on his lights and pulls the driver overApproaching the car he notices that there are five elderly ladies two in the front seat and three in the back wideeyed and white as ghosts The driver obviously confused says to him Officer I dont understand I was going the exact speed limit What seems to be the problemThe trooper trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that  was the route number not the speed limit A bit embarrassed the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error But before you go maam I have to ask is everyone in this car OK These women seem awfully shakenOh theyll be all right in a minute officer We just got off Route At that point what appeared to be the youngest of the five women Dolores resumed rubbing her clit in the back seat using a tightly gripped novella The officer couldnt make out the name of the book the spine had cracked and the cover was folded back Maybe that was a picture of Bucky Showalter on the rear floorboard He couldnt be sureHe suddenly realized he had been staring at the book and picture for quite a long time and looked up to see all five women staring directly at him Well he thought this is nothing that is any of my business He waved them on and returned to his carHe felt smaller somehow as he sat there watching them pull away And for a long time he thought about them and their inability to read signs Were they a danger to the public Or were they just being girls Did they need wood shampoos Or just some flowers and a listen The world truly was a mysterious riddleThe radio squawked something indistinct and he resolved to put them out of his mind,14,ccut20s,1oqt44,jokes,top_all,2.0,-12

DrSAR,My favorite Tribal Wisdom joke copied from the Washington PostIt was autumn and members of a Native American tribe asked their new Chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild Since he was a new Chief in a modern society and had never been taught the old secrets of Nature he looked up at the sky and had no clue what to do To play it safe he replied to his tribe that the winter could definitely be cold and that they should collect firewood early just to be prepared So the members began gathering woodBeing a practical leader he figured he should also use the resources available to the modern society He went to the phone booth called the National Weather Service and asked Will this winter be coldAs of now it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold the forecaster saidSo the Chief went back to his tribe and told them to collect even more wood A week later he called the National Weather Service again and asked for an updateYes the man at National Weather Service again replied based on incoming data this winter is looking to be colder than we expected The Chief was surprised but again went back to his tribe told them that this might be a very cold winter and asked them to collect every scrap of wood they could findOne week later the Chief called the National Weather Service yet again hoping for a new answer Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very coldPositive the man replied Its going to be one of the coldest winters everReally the shocked Chief exclaimed How can you be so sureFirst the forecaster replied The Indians are collecting firewood like crazy,140,ccvstrl,1ou8qf,jokes,top_all,871.0,731

MrMcshiny,ExplanationC E flat Eb and G form a Cminor chord technically a triadThe interval between C and G is a fifth or perfect fifthIf you change G to Gb G flat the perfect fifth becomes a diminished fifthF is not high enough in pitch sharp enough to create an augmented intervalD is the second note of the C scale major or minor and the interval between C and D is a nd A is the relative minor of C meaning that the A minor scale and C major scale are the exact same notes they just start in different places The interval between a C and a Bb B flat is a minor th A rest is pause in the music Diminished diminution and minor are both qualities of chordsscales used here just as punsDS Dal Segno means go back from this point to the segno symbol and repeat A coda typically marks the end of a piece or movement Feel free to critique its been a few years since music school ,5,cd5nvzo,1pse92,jokes,top_all,11.0,6

SigismundFreud,In this joke the horse or stallion straying from its owner represents an unbridled male sexual energy  Repeated references to bars and the horses long face or head  its identifying feature  reinforce the phallic nature of the initial sequence  The handler is eventually able to subdue the horse in the way a hand might subdue the male organ but not before it spills its fluid and those of several other men  The outwardly homoerotic nature of this public display is shamed by society causing the horse to be cast out while the bartender which we understand to be a closeted homosexual himself attempts to sanitize his establishment and therefor his public imageForgiveness and understanding arrives in the form of jesus christ but as the bartender has closed his door for the time being he strays from his intended visit encountering the receptionist  This as we know is a traditionally female role  Christ being the illusory father figure and as such needing to retire offers his metaphorical son the instrument of his destruction in exchange for a modicum of hospitality  The receptionist not recognizing the words of the lord but seeing the nails as miniature phallic symbols given their shape and their ability to be used for both creative and destructive purposes is further emasculated  He expresses his desires meekly and without a voice of his own  Christ unable to make his message known departsA duck which is understood in many cultures to be a symbol of fidelity and sexual intimacy has been questioning for some time whether the receptionist has any grapes  an obvious reference to that part of the male anatomy in which seed is stored  Today however perhaps after witnessing the horses literal outburst he inquires after the size of the mans organ  Ashamed and infuriated he leaves for the place where he knows another man with similar selfdoubts to be  Unable to enter through the front  he discovers and forces his way albeit with some difficulty into an alternative entrance  Two other father figures this time considerably less illusory and who presumably speak the language of these other gentlemen witness this impromptu sodomy and attempt to correct the situation but in their eagerness follow the receptionist into the same shame  The bartender who in his attempt to remain clean in the eyes of society has found himself involuntarily penetrated by not one but three figures puts aside his chore so that he may wonder aloud at the supreme absurdity of the human condition,3,cdde7ei,1qhuze,jokes,top_all,5.0,2

quinnclever,I heard a very similar joke So a news reporter was doing a story on homeless people and wanted to find out what type of interesting things they found on railroad tracks So he visited the local soup kitchen and found a table of three homeless men sitting down He asked to sit down and said he was doing a story on cool things found on railroad tracks He asked the first man what the coolest thing he has ever found Once while wondering the track I found a twenty dollar bill and came back here with cheap wine and drank with my palsThe next man said Last week when I was crossing the tracks I found a hundred dollar bill and came back here a with lots of liquor and got drunk with my friends The news reporter was shocked at how much money he found and asked the last guy what the best thing he has found the man replied Last weekend I found a beautiful women tied to the tracks so I untied her and had the best sex ever all day and night we did all kinds of thingsThe news reporter was astounded that a women would have sex with this homeless man The man siting beside him leaned over and asked if he gotten head The homeless guy said unfortunately I could not find it,1,cdm9ufa,1rcg2l,jokes,top_all,4.0,3

SeriesofAccidents,Reminds me of this oneOnce in a land far far away there lived a group of people called Trids The Trids were happy except for the huge ogre that lived on the mountain The ogre would periodically terrorize the TridsThe Trids tired of the ogre and sought to reason with him They thought one of their religious leaders would be a good intermediary So a group of Trids and their minister went up the mountain and before they could even say one word the ogre kicked them down the mountain Not being dismayed the Trids thought that maybe the ogre was Catholic so they sent another delegation this time led by the local priest But alas as they approached the ogre he once again kicked them all down the mountainThe Trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the ogre was Jewish Unfortunately no Trids were Jewish so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a Rabbi to help them with the ogre The Rabbi arrived and led a delegation of Trids up the mountain The ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them except for the Rabbi down the mountain The Rabbi having been told of the previous expeditions wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain so he asked the ogre The ogre laughed and repliedSilly Rabbi kicks are for Trids,1,cdn0nla,1rfkud,jokes,top_all,7.0,6

Pthaos,Still looking for a new bellringer the monks renewed their ad in the paper and another man came along claiming to be the first mans brother This second man demands a chance at the job that his brother had applied for The monks see no reason to doubt that the two were brothers as they look similar enough and agree to give him a chance for his late brothers sake without consulting the head monkThey took him to the top of the tower and asked him to demonstrate his bellringing skills hoping hed last a little longer than his brotherThe man stretches but stumbles backwards on a loose tile and straight off the edge of the tower There is a sickening thud below them and they all peer down just as the head monk himself appears breathless from climbing the towerDear Lord Who was that man he asksTo which another monk repliesIm not sure but hes a dead ringer for his brother,23,c50nbbm,v1xst,jokes,top_all,65.0,42

pjhollow,Needs to be way longer and more pointless Heres Crackeds take on it in their most annoying jokes of all time Annoyer So as everyone knows two different species flavors of cheerios cannot mate right That is if one is honeynut and another is blueberry they cannot mate Anyway there is this one normal cheerio that is in love with a blueberry cheerio Unfortunately he cannot mate with her He cant even communicate with her because they are of different species So he invents a machine that changes all of his CNA Cheerio DNA into whichever type of cheerio that he wants However this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful because that sort of thing would hurt Anyway He does it and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio Unfortunately this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamonapple cheerio just so she can avoid this creeper So she does it The boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her So he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her and becomes a cinnamonapple cheerio She then changes to a honeynut cheerio He decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type He does it and she changes one more time into a normal cheerio  the kind he originally was So he says out loud Okay this is really the last time If she changes again I will just stay back with my family So he becomes a normal cheerio again and she doesnt change fast enough for him to put his moves on her So they start dating and he finally asks her to the Formal Bowl ahaha get it bowl instead of ball Anyway they get there and dance intensely for a few hours Finally they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl you know since its a cereal dance they have that and punch He gets there and stands in line for ten minutes Finally fed up at the really long line he looks over at the bowl of punch and realizes there is no punch lineAnnoyee Ill give you a punch lineAnnoyee punches Annoyer in the face causing him to bleed It will be months before he finds out that the cut on his face from the Annoyees punch will leave a scar forever giving him a punch line,5,c55m7qc,vlg6r,jokes,top_all,47.0,42

FormattingLessons,My friend thats an excellent joke Its a bit of a wall of text though EDIT Okay wall may be a bit of a strong word Either way I know it didnt come out how you typed it I for one had a bit of difficulty reading it as it isI can see that you tried to insert a new line every time you had a line of speech but unfortunately Reddit removes whitespace You can get it to appear as multiple paragraphs but you have to do it in a very specific way Okay actually there are two waysFirst of all you can simply press enter a second time This will add a little extra vertical space as you can see Ive already done in this comment twiceSecond if you add two spaces to the end of a line before pressing Enter the text will continue on the next line but it will continue the same paragraph For exampleThis sentence  has two spaces  after each lineThis sentencehas empty spacebetween each lineHere is your joke again with the added spaces so it looks exactly like the way you typed itTwo statues a man and a woman are sitting in a park where they have been for years  One day an angel comes down from the heavens and gives life to these two statues  Angel Ok you two because of the limits of my power I can only grant you  minutes of life  What you do is up to you so go on and be free for  minutes  Man Statue Come on I know exactly what we should do  He grabs the females hand and they run off into the bushes giggling  A lot of rustling of the bush ensues and laughter  The two emerge sweaty hair messy and breathing heavily  Man We are done Mr Angel we can return to the way we were  Angel Really thats it  What about the last  minutes of your life  Woman Ok great  She turns to the man and says Come on lets go back for another round  Man Oh yeah  Lets go but this time You hold down the pigeon and Ill shit on his head,71,c5fw7wi,wrps6,jokes,top_all,40.0,-31

toolatealreadyfapped,Except that youve completely abandoned the concept of human colorblindness   it is EXTRAORDINARILY rare for a human to see only in grayscale Most of us colorblind folk would better be defined as colordeficient I can see color just not nearly as finetuned as you can I need a lot more difference between  colors to determine that they are in fact different  Given the previously described colorvisiondeficiency Im quite certain Id never be able to distinguish  different shades of a single color In large enough increments to be determinable youd get from white to black too fast  This kills the joke ,40,c5l77qp,xcg88,jokes,top_all,125.0,85

Zubairm,You know what I gotta say I have heard many funny jokes about Islam gives me a good laugh But then again even those jokes are offensive to people In this world no matter what you do it will be offensive to someone However making religion jokes race jokes gender jokes etc that actually are completely wrong or extremely offensive in some manners I suggest people to just grow up then and stop hurting others Jokes like blondes are dumb or about black people or whatever falls in the same category Something that you know will widely hurt people or widely will be offensive I suggest you dont make those So once again jokes needs to stay fun and healthy for everyone even if its about someone religion however if a joke is offensive and you know it will be extremely offensive than those types of jokes shouldnt be said If you accidentally made a offensive joke people should calmly tell you why it was offensive and the person who did made the joke then should realize However two wrong doesnt make a right Yeah fighting someone who doesnt know with hate isnt the way to do it either And seriously gender and ethnic jokes really need to stop ,4,c5wmb2g,ykzzw,jokes,top_all,1.0,-3

Zubairm,I didnt sent you death threats and Im a Muslim You need to understand that in Islam we are to respect everyones religion and dogma It states in the Quran translation if you do not want people to talk Bad about your religion do not talk bad about theirs However sending death threats to someone is totally in fact it provides a wrong message about your own religion Matter of fact the ppl who you sent you death threats might not even know about their religion there are over  thousand hadith none of them says to send death threats to someone The best thing would to do was send you explaining why you found that joke offensive in a calm manner There are many hadiths that relates to this issue in none of those hadiths was hate used against someone who disrespected Islam or our prophets Islam has a very big deal about respecting your own religion and the famous of people of it as well other people and their beliefs People sending you death threats go against that But I do believe you were wrong as well and everyone else who makes fun of someone else personal religion and dogma Doesnt matter if its Islam or any other religion Sometime its best not to make fun of other peoples religion thus knowing its a very sensitive topic You can joke around in Islam but there are few jokes prohibited Jokes about god dogma prophets and the Islams ancestors Same about other religions We are not allowed to joke about other ppls religions as well Anyhow I hope people those who sent you wrong messages and people those who make religion jokes get some sense in their head ,8,c5wjvbl,ykzzw,jokes,top_all,4.0,-4

ApoChaos,Jewish people only have the modern racial stereotype of being attracted to money and accountancy because centuries ago they were unable to own land and had to make money through lending and the likes There were Christian mores against setting interest rates at the time thus making the act of lending money something you would only do for a friend rather than for any financial benefit Wealthy Christians had all sorts of avenues for moneymaking while they pushed Jews into a corner But how do you break this kind of stereotype Its hard society is capitalistic as fuck and people in general like currency Confirmation bias is bound to happen as long as the stereotype is perpetuated,11,c5zkj83,ywog8,jokes,top_all,44.0,33
