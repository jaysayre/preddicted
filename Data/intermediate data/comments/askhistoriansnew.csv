Trigorin,Islamic scholars did not really see a distinguish between culture to the same extent that we may do so today There was a concerted and statefunded effort to translate Latin Greek Farsi and Aramaic texts into Arabic Mostly Latin and Greek texts on philosophy architecture engineering science etc were in heavy demand An Islamic architect or engineer would be taught architecture and engineeringprobably using original versions of Greek or Latin texts or the Arabic translation if he did not speak Greek it was typically in Greek He would learn architecture and he would know that it was a Roman Rum thinker or writer but it would not be Roman architecture it would be architecture developed or discovered by Romans Thus this is a different conceptualization of culture in general Roman architecture was not Roman architecture it was architecture that the Romans had developed but which did not belong to them Same with most cultureart forms in the Mediterranean ,3,cdjjsf8,1r3tqm,askhistorians,new,8,5

onthefailboat,There werent all that many incentives to abolish slavery  The planters obviously were against it by and large since they relied on that labor for their welfare  After British abolition the British pushed for other nations to abolish slavery as well which may be what youre thinking of  This added a certain amount of social pressure and Britain may have offered certain economic benefits to islands that abolished slavery  Most nations did repay slave owners for the worth of their emancipated slaves which would have made abolition more palatable  If I recall correctly the only nation that did not repay owners for the value of their slaves was the US  There is a very famous argument by Eric Williams Capitalism and Slavery which basically says that the plantation complex fueled the rise of the industrial revolution and capitalism which in turn led to the plantation complexs demise as slave labor became less profitable than industrialized was labor  This thesis has come under a lot of scrutiny since its creation in the s  More modern research suggests that there was no inevitable reason for slavery to disappear and that it could well have flourished in a modern setting  Theres also a theory that slavery became less necessary as nations increased their imperial power in other continents like Asia  The workers there were not nominally slaves but in practicality worked for almost nothing  Rebecca Schloss Sweet Liberty goes into emancipation in Frenchheld Martinique and claims that the rise of beet sugar in Europe combined with a public perception of slave owners as unvirtuous made slavery less desirable which led to emancipation in its own right  Its still an open debate and theres probably no completely right answer since these factors all played into each other,0,cdjc5k1,1r3vo5,askhistorians,new,3,3
MartijnH,Economic incentives alone are somewhat unlikely As far as I know all countries that abolished slavery did so while it still existed If slavery would be unprofitable slaveowners would probably just set their slaves free and move on but this did not happen governments abolished slavery Therefore social or moral motives are more likely Also keep in mind that slavery is not the same as the slave trade most countries outlawed the crossocean shipping of slaves in the early nineteenth century but allowed slavery to exist for years after that,1,cdjlnqz,1r3vo5,askhistorians,new,1,0
backgrinder,The history of mining is a history of metals being sourced from more difficult to find expensive to extract and less rich deposits The first known prehistoric mines were flint and salt mines and were started as people chipped deeper and deeper from an exposed face into the earth  The first metals were likely sourced on open ground remnants of meteor strikes or geologic action or deposits from glaciers or from collapsed cliff faces that exposed rich ore Since mines were found by happenstance locating them wasnt specialized operating them was done by whoever had the resources to run a mine mines have always been labor intensive and expensive and might to hold the valuable ground  The earliest metal mines were copper mines There are ancient  years BC or BCE whichever you prefer copper mines in present day Serbia Jordan North America Israel and Egypt We are aware of them because smelting was done on site which created plenty of detritus for archaeologists to find The idea of transporting ore to be finished off location is a post railroad invention before that moving bulk cargo like ore was just to expensive  Prospecting for ore until very recently was done on foot Prospectors would trace streambeds or cliff faces looking for signs of ore If they found good sign they would trace it back to the most likely source and start digging looking for a rich vein to exploit Modern techniques are more sophisticated but still use the same basics knowing how to discern a likely location from geological information and history of other prospectors and inspecting it up close Basically as far as certain cultures having specialized prospecting knowledge until recently there was no such thing Then as now finding that you were occupying land with rich ore under it was basically like winning a lottery you hadnt even bought a ticket forKhirbat Hamra Ifdan httpnewsnationalgeographiccomnewsmetalfactoryhtml,1,cdjc3d2,1r3vui,askhistorians,new,6,5

KingofMen,I think this will be almost a matter of taste In chronological order and taking no stance on which one is worst The Boer war is notoriously the last in which the British Army suffered more casualties from disease than from combat Also where concentration camps were invented although this perhaps didnt bother the average infantryman too much  The Great War is perhaps not quite as bad as its reputation but still it was genuinely awful Mud rats charging into machine guns living in the trenches for months on end waiting for the shell that would finish you  perhaps it has been exaggerated but still its all true Also of note for the near impossibility of getting medical help if you were wounded between the trench lines NB No antibiotics lots of muddy battlefields Widespread use of chemical weapons by both sides WWII well what can one say You asked about infantrymen so Ill leave the Holocaust out of it But at least on the Eastern Front things were pretty grim all around Being taken prisoner  and lets note neither side was that keen on prisoners  meant death by slow starvation For the Russians even those who survived captivity could expect some years in the Gulag Something on the order of  of the Russian men born in  died  Korean War I cant think of any area in which this one was plausibly the worst  Vietnam No support from home or at least none that was very obvious in the media Perhaps the first unpopular war in which the soldiers could really feel that the home front didnt have their back  IranIraq war Unarmed teenagers charging into minefields Nuff said Of course this is only a selection No doubt Ive missed some little hellhole in an obscure corner of Africa thats notorious for  of its veterans having PTSD or something of the sort All in all I think I would put my money on the Great War but there are a lot of strong contenders out there ,0,cdjdveb,1r3y2y,askhistorians,new,4,4

Rabbits,With regards to the Americas it generally was because those European settler regimes were quite brutal Theres a few factors that play into this including minority rule tacit approval of nonstate actions a focus on wealth extraction and dehumanization of indigenous groupsTaking these in reverse order there was an underlying question of whether Native Americans were even human or at least fully human If you look at the work of armchair naturalists like de PauwhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCorneliusdePauw or BuffonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiGeorgesLouisLeclercComtedeBuffon they both put forth ideas of Native Americans as degenerate or otherwise subhuman ideas that were widely read and accepted at the time With those concepts in the mainstream it was easier to justify the use of lethal slave labor on plantations and in mines or to say that Indians and wolves are both beasts of prey tho they differ in shape as George Washington put it The native populations were not so much subjects to ruled as they were tools to generate wealth or obstacles to civilizing the land Often this was done not so much as a matter of central state policy where there might have been some mediation of the actions but by selfinterested groups like Spanish Conquistadors or English Puritans who were in the Americans to get rich or build a utopia not establish a sustainable extension of state power Since these groups were so often in the minority you can see a strain of a sort of siege mentality of the ruling groups wherein brutality was necessary lest the dominant few be crushed by riotous massesThere are certainly historical models for absolutely brutal and oppressive regimes that were not White but what happened in the Americas set the template for colonial expansion over the following centuries While the Mongols and Assyrians for example may have committed atrocities in their campaigns for dominance they did so centuries and millenia before the present European regimes are far closer to the present and in regards to colonialism were able to use advances technology in project power on a far wider than previous imperialists and exploiting conquered peoples through new regimens of production which were far more invasive and intensive than past tributary systems This was further backed up by scientific proof of the natural superiority of Europeans over others  even as the philosophy of the time was inching towards universal rights  which justified both the conquest and the brutality in terms beyond simple ethnocentrism,1,cdjtilj,1r3ycc,askhistorians,new,3,2

Nrussg,Note This is not a historical answer but important clarification for understanding the questionYou have to be very careful with the term humanitarian which has a very specific meaning in post WWII politics that is tied directly to the idea of universalism which has its own complicated history but its roots are generally traced to the enlightenment period Why is this important Well it means that describing a premodern conflict has humanitarian is anachronistic Even if a conflict can be reinterpreted as being humanitarian when view through modern lenses we are still discussing it in a framework that did not exist In fact the idea of humanitarian conflict is antithetical to most WesternEuropean conceptions of politics postWestphaliaSo while there may be some examples of warfare that looks humanitarian They generally only look humanitarian to us or through modern reinterpretation rather than being considered humanitarian at the time That being said proving the nonexistence of an even is hard so watch someone come in and give a perfect example    ,5,cdjizam,1r42on,askhistorians,new,23,18

RationalAnimal,This is an interesting question and it admits of several lines of reply   Ill offer the following  One item not emphasized nearly enough in histories of this war is the catastrophic failure of the Soviet Union to prepare properly to defend itself in the first place   Indeed it is possible to say the following with no exaggeration   To the USSR of the mid to lates Hitlers Germany was one of the most obvious and dangerous security threats in the history of the world  Yet the Soviet leadership seemed capable of nothing more than stumbling through this period almost willingly blind to their strategic danger Remember the German government was led by a man whose supreme openly declared political ambition was the annihilation of the Soviet Union  By the late s there should have been little doubt as to the broad capabilities of the German military  By the fall of  after the stunning defeat of France and Britain in the west the mortal danger the wermacht posed to the Soviet Union should have been impossible to ignore    Yet during years when the Soviet Union could have been organizing a capable armed force as a credible deterrent  Stalin squandered precious time and human lives terrorizing the Soviet military  Further the authoritarian nature of the Soviet government precluded the the Soviet leadership from having accurate information about the true capabilities of the red army all throughout this time  The result was the Soviet Union was appallingly unprepared for the German invasion of  and the Soviet leadership was perhaps the only organized political body in the world who did realize this fact   Were it not for the distraction of the history of the war itself  Stalins failure would be  widely acknowledged for what it was  one of historys great mistakes  All that said it is nevertheless true the German invasion was for the Germans a breathtaking gamble  Even by their own lights they did not have all that much room for error  As it happened the Germans badly underestimated reserves of Soviet manpower but even by their reckoning they were attacking a much larger defensive force  Normally of course it is thought necessary for attackers to outnumber defenders for a successful offensive campaign  Further the German strategic objectives required movement across vast distances in a relatively short period of time   Finally the Germans committed the large majority of their total national military capability to the Russian campaign  So defeat would threaten vulnerability to counter invasion and perhaps even to the destruction of Germany itself  Still in the first months of the war events demonstrated that means were better matched to ends on the German side of war planning   The Germans defeated huge Soviet armies in the first weeks of the war and then again they achieved a tremendous victory in the battles surrounding Kiev  Military historians much debate the effect of German diversions in the autumn of  in the Ukraine but even as things happened the Germans came within a hairs breadth of capturing Moscow by December of   Had they done so there is a good likelihood that even Stalin would have had difficulty retaining sufficient control over what would have been left of the Soviet state to fight an organized war  Resourcefulness probably suggests too much in the way of deliberate planning to describe the Russian response to the German invasion  Even if desperation is a more apt name for the Soviet war effort in  the Soviets did barely keep the Germans out of Moscow   The state of Soviet planning had improved markedly by the time of the climactic battle of Stalingrad in  and by then German strength had largely spent itself in the long drive toward the southern Soviet Union   From then on the war was a gruesome Soviet counter offensive and the Germans had no more prospect of achieving victory in the east  So a short answer is that the Soviet Union eventually prevailed in a desperate fight despite its failures in prewar and early war planning  The Germans were much better prepared to fight the war they chose but they had little room for error  The Soviet forces were more numerous and the political system of the USSR was less susceptible to collapse than the Germans had estimated   The fight itself was a closerun thing but we all know how it ended  Thanks ,2,cdjgfqk,1r448i,askhistorians,new,9,7

onthefailboat,We had a broad discussion about suicide among slaves some time ago here in which we mentioned abortion among slaves httpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsphlahowprevalentwassuicideamongstslavesin  The short answer is that they did have access to abortifacients and some did use them though it seems to be more common among slaves in the Caribbean than in the US South  There was a much greater importance placed on keeping and raising children in the South since slave prices were higher than in the Caribbean  In the Caribbean it was cheaper to buy a new slave than raise one from birth so there was less focus on keeping them on the part of the owners and the conditions were so terrible that many mothers did not want their children to grow up in that environment  The US South had a much greater focus on family both among the slaves and slave owners  The slave owners wanted the slave to have kids so that they could have more slaves while the more equal gender balance among the slaves as opposed to Caribbean slaves meant that it was much easier to create a family  You might want to check out Sweets Domingos Alvares and Jason Youngs Rituals of Resistance for a more detailed discussion  Stephanie Camps Closer to Freedom also goes into the problems that female slaves faced in the South,0,cdjuut6,1r4gg9,askhistorians,new,1,1

tenent,This is question ties nicely in with my thesis research so Ill try my best to give a brief rundown As the other post noted it very much depends on the time you are talking about Below I will try to give an extremely broad overview of partisanship amongst military officers For a frame of reference I will discuss particularly the US Army officer corpsThe early American military establishment was distinctly Federalist in character founded as it was by Alexander Hamilton who served as the first Army Chief of Staff and thus controlled officer commissions an important source of patronage in the early days of the Republic The Republicans led by Jefferson were decidedly distrustful of a standing military considering it an inherent threat to republican government They looked to the English Commonwealth under Cromwell and the Roman Republic and saw in Hamilton a potential Caesar For his part Hamilton himself greatly admired Caesar and believed in a strong military as a key defender of the new nation and as a potential vehicle to drive his own legacyAfter Hamiltons death in a duel in  and the disintegration of the Federalist Party as an active force in electoral politics the US Army and Navy along with the Supreme Court continued to be heavily influenced by Federalist ideology and staffed with Federalist officers For an excellent study of the early Army partisanship see Richard Kohns Eagle and Sword The Federalists and the Creation of the Military EstablishmenthttpwwwamazoncomEagleSwordFederalistsEstablishmentdp Thomas Jefferson as President worried about the Federalist tendencies of his officers and attempted to counter their influence with his establishment of West Point in  Jefferson also reduced the size of the Army and Navy and emphasized a disengagement from international affairs in the hopes of avoiding military confrontations The War of  and the vast expansion of the military during that time provided the Republican Madison administration with ample opportunities to commission Republican officers which it did to great effect Andrew Jackson mentioned above being a key example of a decidedly nonfederalist officer rising to political power based on his military record Jackson it should be noted however was a General in the Tennessee militia not the standing regular army For all his successes as a political figure Jacksons influence on the partisanship of the regular army officer corps was limited imbued as he was with Republican ideals of citizensoldiery embodied in the state militias and contrary to the Federalist notion of a professionalized standing military establishment As the Federalist Party collapsed and was ultimately replaced by the Whigs many Army officers followed to that camp By this time the small US Army was pushing westward and its officer corps began to develop a distinct identity forged on the frontier With no real continental threat of invasion the main duty of the Army became frontier duty fighting Indians Because of this separation the Army developed a culture almost akin to a priesthood or monastic order Army officers in peacetime almost all West Pointers saw themselves as a separate apolitical caste of professionals Most refused to vote Raised with small r republican ideals they generally believed strongly in their constitutional oaths and were duly submissive to civilian authority however disdainful they might be of politicians in general This standard of professional autonomy and separation continued until the s The Army which matured largely on the frontier was proud of its heritage as an apolitical defender of the Republic George C Marshall was in many ways the embodiment of this ideal refusing to vote and maintaining cordial yet professional and ultimately deferential relationships with his superiors Of course during times of war and mass mobilization this dynamic was tested The World Wars and the Civil War saw the Army balloon by hundreds of percent in the span of months Wartime Presidents such as Lincoln and FDR and to a lesser extent Wilson recognized the political nature of their conflicts and thus were adamant in treating the army as a part of a wartime coalition Lincoln famously appointed political officers representing the different constituencies of the Union Hence the prominence of war Democrats Catholics Germans Irish etc in high military positions These political generals many of whom were military neophytes were of course highly resented by the West Point caste of officers They were varyingly successful but to Lincoln their importance was less in their military acumen then their political value in maintaining his wartime coalition See T Harry Williams Lincoln and His GeneralshttpwwwamazoncomLincolnGeneralsVintageCivilLibrarydp for more However after WWII the onset of the Cold War led to a decision not to draw down the military as was the past American tradition at the conclusion of large wars and the subsequent creation of a much larger military establishment than had ever existed After the Cold War ended this military establishment remained becoming increasingly political following the abolishment of the draft and the abject failure in Vietnam Seeing a distinct need to justify its continued largesse the military from  took on a series of reforms aimed at modernizing and further professionalizing itself The end of the draft led to increasing selfselection among those who would serve leading to an increasing partisanship among military officers The career of Colin Powell Reagans National Security Advisor and later Chairman of the JCS demonstrates the increasing political partisanship as well as political acumen and savvy of these late Cold War army officers Their agenda was to avoid another Vietnamlike entanglement that sapped the army of resources respect and readiness for a major WWIIItype conflict To this end they advocated such reforms as the Weinberger and Powell Doctrines For more on the postVietnam politicization of the US military see Andrew Bacevichs The New American

perceived because looking back twenty years later after a second and much more costly war in Iraq the first war there can hardly be called a decisive victory as it was at the time led the military further towards the Republican Party which began to view the military as a constituent element of their political coalition as well This brings us to our selfimposed  year limit so Ill end the

LordKettering,Not reallyNative American nations had a long history of diplomacy and warfare extending centuries before European contact The idea that separate nations with separate leaders would engage in combat or politics to gain land or crush an enemy was an idea that Native Americans were familiar with and could easily be applied to the colonistsMany Native American nations were adept at diplomacy and could easily outclass Europeans when it came to political manipulation By the eighteenth century many nations were dependent on European trade goods but were losing land to the colonists This required them to strike a balance between deference and resistance Its an incredibly difficult line to walk but historians are largely in agreement that several nations were successful in playing the French and English off against each other in order to gain material or diplomatic advantage Such diplomatic feats couldnt have been accomplished had they been confused about imperial conflictsFor more information on how Native Americans were able to survive between two belligerent imperial powers and why this advantage eventually fell apart read Alan Taylors Divided Ground Indians Settlers and the Northern Borderlands of the American Revolution Another great one that I recommend here often is Joseph Glatthaar and James Kirby Martins Forgotten Allies The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution,11,cdjkvdz,1r4kzq,askhistorians,new,64,53
Reedstilt,uLordKettering already covered the basics so Ill tackle some specific examples of how a few Native American leaders and diplomats viewed the political landscape of colonial North AmericaFollowing King Georges War  what is now northern New England was disputed territory In  the Governor of Massachusetts sent Phineas Stevens to negotiate with the Wabanaki ConfederacyhttpwwwbrownhistoryorgimagesMapsNativeAmericanMapsWabanakiCountryprethCenturyMapjpg at a meeting hosted by the governor of Montreal At this meeting the Wabanaki representative Atiwaneto refused to sell any more land to the Britishgt Brother you are therefore masters of the peace that we are to have with you On condition that you will not encroach on  those lands we will be at peace as the King of France is with the King of Great Britaingt By a Beltgt I repeat to you Brothers by this belt that it depends on yourselves to be at peace with the Abenakis Our Father who is here present has nothing to do with what we say to you we speak to you of our own accord and in the name of all our allies We regard our Father in this instance only as a witness to our wordsgt We are entirely free We are allies of the King of France from whom we received the Faith and all sorts of assistance in our necessities We love that monarch and we are strongly attached to his interests The Abenaki are one of the members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and specifically the ones from whom the British wished to purchase land Atiwenato was Abenaki When he refers to our allies later he means the Wabanaki Confederacy as a whole Our Father refers to the governor or MontrealDuring the French and Indian War Pennsylvanian ambassador Christian Frederick Post went to negotiate peace with the Lenape living in the Ohio Country After meeting with Shingas whom the Pennsylvanians erroneous deemed king of the Lenape and other Lenape leaders Post received this replygt The land is ours and not theirs therefore we say if you will have peace with us we will send the French home It is you that have started this war and it is necessary that you hold fast and be not discouraged in the work of peace We love you more than you love us for when we taken any prisoners from you we treat them as our own children  By this you may see that our hearts our better than yours It is plain that you white people are the cause of this war why do not you and the French fight in the old country and on the sea Why do you come to fight in our land This makes every body believe you want to take the land from us by force and settle itgt Look now my brother the white people think we have no brains in our heads but that they are great and big and that makes them make war with us we are but a little handful to what you are but remember when you look for a wild turkey you cannot always find it it is so little it hides itself under the bushes and when you hunt for a rattlesnake you cannot find it and perhaps it will bite you before you see it However since you are so great and big and we so little do you use your greatness and strength in completing this work of peace This is the first time that we saw or heard of you since this war begun and we have great reason to think about it since such a great body of you comes into our lands It is told us that you and the French contrive the war to waste the Indians between you and that you and the French intend to divide the land between yo this was told us by the chief of the Indian traders and they said further brothers this is the last time we shall come among you for the French and the English intend to kill all the Indians and then divide the land among themselves Brother I suppose you known something about it or has the Governor stopped your mouth that you cannot tell usSide note the Lenape have some of the snarkiest diplomats of the colonial era Also some of the most Properly Paranoid diplomats During the American Revolution Hopocan makes a speech to the British after performing the bare minimum required of him by a dubious treaty he disagreed with and accurately predicts that the British would make a separate peace with the rebels and abandon their Indian alliesAfter the bulk of the fighting in the French and Indian War was over and the British victorious over the French Alexander Henry an British trader traveled to Michilimackinac the political hub of the Three Fires Confederacy the Ojibwe the Odawa and the Potawatomi There met with Minavavana an Ojibwe leader who gave his own perspective on the new political situation As with Atiwaneto and the Wabanaki Minavavana emphasizes that the Ojibwe are independent allies of the Frenchgt Englishman although you have conquered the French you have not yet conquered us We are not your slaves  Englishman our father the King of France employed our young men to make war upon your nation In this warfare many of them have been killed and it is our custom to retaliate until such time as the spirits of the slain are satisfied But the spirits of the slain are to be satisfied in either of two ways the first is by the spilling of the blood of the nation by which they fell the other is by covering the bodies of the dead and thus allaying the resentment of their relations This is done by making presentsgt Englishman your king has never sent us any presents nor entered into any treaty with us wherefore he and we are still at war and until he does these things we must consider that we have no other father nor friend among the white men than the King of FranceDespite Minavavanas declaration that a state of war persists between the Ojibwe and the British he assured Henry that since he came in peace under the misapprehension that the war was over he would be permitted to conduct his busy among them as he had planned ,1,cdjx6uq,1r4kzq,askhistorians,new,4,3

Trigorin,I think it would be useful to briefly chart the development of DaralIslam or the Islamic states as you say Two things to keep in mind  The Roman Empire and Sassanid Empire possessed highly developed political structures with centuries if not millennia of political theory philosophy and culture upholding them These did not disappear And in most cases the original Bedouin or Hejazi Arab Muslims were not the majority of the population in the early Islamic period They certainly spread and migrated and many tribes came to settle in Mesopotamia or Syria or Iran or Egypt but assimilation always goes both ways The Early Muslims were not as organized as we may think There have been some arguments that the yearly tribal raid Ghuz became impossible when most tribes converted to Islam because they were all in the same tribe or family of Islam and one could not raid ones tribe members So they raided the only people they could the ones to the north The early caliphate first  caliphs was essentially a big tribal organization Arab leadership was based on senior tribal leader democracy so the chiefs or luminaries chose among themselves by voting Governors and other administrators were appointed The government was highly centralized The caliph would send someone he trusted to govern and after a period of certain years might appoint someone else etc When the Abu Umayya clan took over the caliphate following the civil war with Ali the government became centralized along Roman lines The capital was in Damascus and the chief bureaucrats and administrators were mainly Romans who had converted to Islam This was a government based on the Umayya and organized along ByzantineRoman lines So the tax collection etc were all given to certain governors who were responsible for getting so much back to the central treasury Things worked out fine enough until they didnt The Abu Abbas took over in th century Their model was based on persian administration Here things get interesting From the th century onwards the Persian practice of appointing subkings  if you will takes root The caliph gives out land to certain dynasties and they rule it on his behalf This leads rise to a sort of feudalism but I am hesitant to call it that This is also the great rise of Islamic science and humanities as all of these little provincial courts try to distinguish themselves by sponsoring the next big thinker European Feudalism is a unique phenomenon I  would not say that the Islamic states were similar to Feudalism but that certain ways of ruling seem to be more or less efficient given certain circumstances and both shared some similarities especially in the th and th century The centrifugal forces in Islamic governance arose from a need to accommodate local reality with state ideals and it did so by using a commonplace tactic that had been developed in Persia thousands of years ago and had probably also been developed in many places namely having someone rule on your behalf European Feudalism is a whole different thing though on a superficial basis it did incorporate this ,1,cdk72nn,1r4qd7,askhistorians,new,6,5

Dirish,Ancient covers a very large time and a lot of cultures so Id have to limit it to one specific era and culture     The Greeks had a classification system of sorts Nothing like the modern Dewey UDC or Library of Congress systems but quite recognisable regardless     We know that around  BCE a Greek called Callimachus who lived in Alexandria created a bibliographical index of the contents of the Library His index was called Pinakeshttpwwwgreeceorghecwwwartsculturealexandrialibrarylibraryhtm and covered  books In them he divided all the books in the library into  subjects  for poetry epic elegy iambics melodrama tragedy comedy and  in prose history rhetoric philosophy medicine law So it is logical to assume that the library itself already used this subject classification system The name of the index Pinakes refers to the index tablets hanging above the pots that stored scrolls so that also indicates that he was working with an already established system   Under each division individual authors were arranged in alphabetical order and each name was followed by a short bibliographical notice and a critical account of the authors writings R Pfeiffer The Pinakes Fragments  I do not know and would love to know how hed have handled new scrolls within the existing index Id imagine that pages would have to be updated regularly,2,cdjpk5v,1r52st,askhistorians,new,15,13
rosemary,It varied by time and place of course but they did have catalogues as others have pointed out Ill leave aside Kallimachos Pinakes tables since other posters have already covered that Two tablets dating to ca  BCE have been found at Nippur with lists of literary works as well as showing that the Sumerians had catalogues they also illustrate that they werent as systematic as modern catalogues the two tablets catalogue the same collection but each has around twenty titles that the other lacks Several tablets have been discovered from the Hittite capital Hattusa from ca  that look a bit more thorough at least they have very detailed lists with information about the number of tablets a text occupies how many are missing the contents of the work and occasionally the name of the authorOne tactic that was widely practised throughout antiquity in practically all libraries was to put a colophon at the end of a volume at the start or in the middle of a series this is a note at the end that points the reader to the next one in the same work For example the surviving texts of Gilgamesh have colophons at the end of each tablet directing the reader as to which tablet comes next The same was done in Greek and Roman collections Often a colophon could take the form of the first couple of lines of the next volume so the browser would immediately know that she had got the right one Some catalogues did this too theres one catalogue of hymns in Ashurbanipals library that gives the first line of each hymnOne colophon from Ashurbanipals library is especially elaborate and tellinggt Palace of Ashurbanipal King of the World King of Assyria who trusts in Ashur and Ninlil whom Nabu and Tashmetu gave wideopen ears and who was given profound insight The wisdom of Nabu the signs of writing as many as have been devised I wrote on tablets I arranged the tablets in series I collated them and for my royal contemplation and recital I placed them in my palaceAs to how you physically find the volume you want we have decent information on this from GrecoRoman libraries Heres a famous th century CE Roman relief showing someone taking a scroll from its shelfhttppurplemotesnetwpcontentuploadsancientlibraryjpg Notice The scrolls arent stacked too high theyre not that light those are wrapped into solid cylinders and surviving papyri show that they were indeed rolled tight and you need to be able to get to the ones on the bottom You have multiple compartments to aid in organisation This would be especially helpful in the case of a large work like say Plinys Natural history which would fill a lot of scrolls Each scroll has a tag attached to it The Romans called these tituli labels  and hence the modern word title These seem to have been made from vellum not papyrus according to a reference in Cicero It seems that this derives from a similar practice in older libraries that contained tablets rather than scrolls in Ashurbanipals library each series of tablets had a tag hanging over it it isnt as easy to attach a tag to a tabletIncidentally this relief dates to the time when the scroll was starting to be replaced by the codex ie the modernstyle volume with multiple leaves bound together By the way unfortunately the relief itself has been lost or destroyed we only have modern drawings of it I believe there is evidence of compartments that were narrower than the ones in the relief which would be helpful for smaller works but I cant pin down the evidence for that just now,2,cdjydsj,1r52st,askhistorians,new,9,7

doublesecretprobatn,I recently finished reading Jeffrey Rosens The Supreme Court The Personalities and Rivalries that Defined America I dont know if youre familiar with it but the book looks at four distinct periods over the history of the Supreme Court and analyzes each of those periods based on the relationship between two justices with ideologiesor more often judicial stylesthat are in conflict In the postCivil War period he juxtaposes Holmes with John Marshall HarlanWhile he offers a lengthy analysis of the two men and I dont feel I could do the chapter justice in a brief paragraph he ultimately reaches the conclusion that Harlan has had a more substantial lasting influence than Holmes Of Holmes he writes he believed little in the supremacy of the Constitution and had sneered throughout his life at the idea of natural rights He may have been correct on the broad question of the importance of judicial deference to legislative minorities but because he could not resist taking his principles to their logical conclusions in most cases the purity of his vision has little constituency today Overall Rosen depicts Holmes as an eloquent Justice and possibly a genius who is nevertheless hamstrung by his unwavering devotion to his own Darwinistic perception about how courts and government should operate Ultimately this led to Holmes to believe that it was the place of the Court to defer to legislative and popular majorities and Im paraphrasing here that if the people wanted to go to Hell he would help them I see in your introduction you say Holmes had remarkable contributions to constitutional law so I assume your views on the Justice differ from those of Rosen How much influence do you believe Holmes ended up having This may be a difficult question but do you see his impact as being more significant than Harlans If youve read Rosens book do you think the conclusions he draws about Holmes which paint a much less sunny picture of the Justice than other sources are fair and accurate Finally a more psychological question to what extent do you think the numerous wounds Holmes suffered in combat in the Civil War ended up shaping his judicial philosophy,0,cdjrgn9,1r5410,askhistorians,new,3,3

Commustar,The first report Western Europeans had of the existence Timbuktu was  following Mansa Musas hajj to Mecca in  King Musas displays of wealth were noteworthy enough that he is depicted on the Catalan atlas of httpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsccMansaMusajpg although he is identified as Musse Melly in the atlas In that image Timbuktu appears to the left of the throne and is labelled as Tonbudy on the atlasHowever European interest in Timbuktu specifically is derived from the account of the Moorish christianconvert Leo Africanus born alHassan ibn Muhammad alWazzan alFasi in his descriptions of the geography of North Africa and West Africa that was included in the Description of Africa published in Venice in In his description of Timbuktuhttpwwwfordhameduhalsallmedleoafriasp Africanus  paints a picture of a city of wealthy merchants gold ingots and brisk trade For the next several hundred years Africanus report was the primary basis for European knowledge of the interior or West Africa It was during this period between  and  that Timbuktus reputation for remoteness and mystery was established However the city also had a reputation for opulent wealth which fired a European imaginations of a city of gold For instance lets take a gander at Tennysons poem Timbuctoohttpsarchiveorgstreamsuppressedpoemsotennrichpageviiimodeup In it Tennyson is making comparisons between Timbuktu and El Dorado and Atlantis and is openly wondering whether Timbuktu is an actual place or is as mythical as the other two By a quirk of fate Tennysons poem was first delivered in  and news of Rene Cailles successful expedition to the city would not reach Europe until  Of course the next logical question is upon discovering that Timbuktu was no longer a West African version of El Dorado why did the city continue to stick in the popular conscious I can only point to the fact that Timbuktu still fit the description of a remote place it still does to an extent and benefited from the notoriety of the early th century race to discover it Thus literary figures seized upon it as real notable location famed for its remoteness  rather than a more generic idea like the middle of nowhereSince I made reference to but largely elided over the race to reach Timbuktu and chart the Niger I will leave you all with a book recommendation  The Race for Timbuktu by Frank Kyrza is a decent nonacademic read about the subject It is an entertaining and mildly educational read focusing on the expedition of Gordon Laing who reached Timbuktu before Caille but died on the return voyage A word of warning though the work tends to overemphasize the influence of Mungo Park and Laing while neglecting explorers such as Clapperton Caille and others,4,cdk37lv,1r54o8,askhistorians,new,34,30

Muskwatch,References to the seasons being flipped extend back at least to Herodotus who was referencing Phoenician voyages from a few hundred years before that circumnavigated Africa however as to who first discovered the reason why the earth has seasons it definitely lies in prehistory  It also depends on the type of season that you are talking aboutFor example say youre in the northern hemisphere  The sun is warm  In summer you see lots of the sun and the weather is warm  In the winter you see a lot less of it and its cold Your creation story explains how the sun goes around the earth on an very wide bridge and that during the summer it tends to your side of the bridge touching the edge around solstice but in winter it drifts towards the other side of the bridge meaning it is much lower in the sky  You attribute the seasons to the amount of sunlight you get and you are  correct Likewise if you ever asked yourself the question as to what life would be on the far side of the bridge the answer is likewise obvious and also completely correct  This doesnt mean that everyone figured this out but doubtless many did and did it many timesNow lets say your somewhere around the equator You have two rainy seasons separated by a few months a long one and a short one  While you can link them timewise to the progression of the sun through the zodiac the obvious cause and effect reasoning that makes the connection so obvious to northern peoples is absent especially without much wider geographical knowledge of prevailing winds and the origin of your weather patterns from distance regionsNow lets say youre in Egypt and you have two seasons flood season and the rest of the year  Theories range from almost correct melting snow to the absurd the river that goes around the earth feeds the source of the Nile  Since the seasons consisted of variations in water flow and the creation of that flow lay several thousand miles away no answer could immediately  be drawn uponNow lets go back to the first group  I lay out how they could have hypothetically described the seasons  The story I referenced comes from the Nuxalk people of British Columbia and seems well put to describe the seasons  Except thats not how they described their seasons  In Nuxalk the year was divided up into months which were described by the types of activities conducted during them  the oolichan fishing month months for various types of salmon months for different storytelling and dances but no reference to seasons as we know them even though they were undoubtedly an important aspect of life  For people who lived off of fish and seafood primarily the seasons  winter summer etc which they could describe so easily werent as significant to fisherman as they might be to farmers In other words in order to discover the reason for seasons you not only have to have an mode of explanation you also have to care what a season isIf you go from yet another perspective and respond that a season is the period of time between two solstices which at least in Canada is officially correct first day of summer is the summer solstice and so on it doesnt take much to figure out why these seasons  Because the sun is highest it is now summer then because the sun is halfway lower it is now fall  When your definition of seasons gets divorced from realworld meaning the answer to why seasons can be as simple as because seasons but thats the world we live in,2,cdk4byd,1r63h8,askhistorians,new,5,3

DasMime,This is an extraordinarily broad question as the specific factors influencing changes in various religions are different depending on what religion locale and time period youre talking about Ill give you an example which is taken pretty much directly from a lecture series by Peter BrownhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvdNGHZJxsamplistPLnUxBxYOsbUrsZVQcjbIBRPYODmDd about the development of two widely disparate monastic traditions in Egypt and Syria During the rd and th centuries monasticism began to be a significant religious practice in Christianity People would forsake their worldly possessions and go to live in the desert or go wandering often shunning most contact with other people in the former case By giving up their treasure on earth they would obtain treasure in heaven Anthony the GreathttpenwikipediaorgwikiAnthonytheGreat is the best known of these and one of the earliest His biography written by Athanasius of Alexandria was very influential to the development of the Western monastic tradition As for the regional distinctions Brown points out that in Egypt monastics generally lived in small groups which would be selfsufficient producing all the food they needed and never having to rely on donations for survival As such it was a retreat involving considerable manual labor in established monastic communities In Syria on the other hand monastics tended to be mendicant beggars wandering from place to place and relying on charity In both cases the monks are seen as being holy or angelic in a certain sense because they have managed to separate themselves from the primary earthly concern One cultural conundrum which must be overcome is how these monks who have taken vows of poverty in both cases can accept gifts which were in some cases rather substantial without being tainted by profane nature of money A gift engenders obligation so the problem was how the holy poor the monks could be the institutional recipients of gifts without becoming indebted to the giverBrown argues that in the Syrian region the human condition as people conceived of it was work The Fall of Adam and Eve had been a fall from workfree abundance of Eden into the present world of toil Christ is often conceived of as a second Adam and this idea was especially present in Syria Brown points out that angels were not conceived of as being distant otherworldly beings but rather more closely present An angel is what an angel does and one thing which an angel does not do is work So for monastics to live as a mendicant without toil makes them angelic in a sense and therefore to be capable of receiving money without being corrupted by it They were engaged in the sacred labor of prayer on behalf of all humans The Syrian monks were similar in many ways to the elect of the Manichaeans a highly ascetic syncretic religion whose monastics subsisted entirely on the donations of the faithfulIn Egypt the human condition was the constant threat of famine Egypt was a society which relied entirely on yearly flooding of the Nile in order to make the land fertile for agriculture If the floods were lacking hunger was not far away Many ancient writings not least of all the story of Joseph and the dream of seven lean years highlight the weight with which hunger weighed on the Egyptian consciousness Egyptian monks in contrast to their Syrian counterparts labored extensively Their monasteries were selfsufficient and often produced extra food providing food to people nearby in times of famine By their industriousness they were freed from the fear of famine Because they needed nothing and could exist entirely on their own they did not have an obligation to the givers which is how it was possible for them to receive such gifts and yet not be touched by the stain of economic obligation Their gifts were largely given onward to the poor Anthony the Great who was in many ways the progenitor of the later Christian monastic tradition gave all his possessions to the poor moved to the desert staunchly refused to accept any alms and usually refused to even see anyone Work itself became sacred to the Egyptian monks The one who is unwilling to work shall not eathttpwwwbiblegatewaycompassagesearchThessaloniansAampversionNIVThese two competing modes of monastic holiness highlight the diversity present in early Christianity The Syrian model of course dwindled in the Christian tradition over the course of Late Antiquity transitioning into the early Middle Ages when organized agricultural monasteries with industriously toiling monks was the norm At the same time Manichaeism which was similar to the Syrian tradition in the element of the ascetic almsdependent monk died out in the Mediterranean region over the same time period The exact reasons why one model won out over the other are very difficult at best to pin down but one explanation is that as the Church became more closely tied in to the Empire and grew in power and organization it found that groups of monks amp nuns living in organized hierarchical communities were easier to keep a handle on than were wandering preachers One of the themes which recurs throughout the history of the Church is the struggle between the Papacy bishops archbishops abbots cardinals and various secular rulers for autonomy or control Many people today think of the Catholic Church as being an extremely centralized topdown organization and in many ways thats true for the st century Church But in say the th century when it might take months to get from Rome to some farflung church or monastery in France or Asia Minor such a level of control was not reasonable and moreover many clergy would not have stood for it Another reason is that after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire population declined especially in the plague outbreak of  cities shrunk and roads became less safe As a result there was less of a support base for mendicant ascetics and wandering was a more dangerous occupation leading to the prevalence of largely selfsufficient monasteries as the primary mode of Christian asceticismMendicant monastics did not disappear from history entirely however they had a resurgence in the High Middle Ages specifically the th century The Franciscans Dominicans Carmelites and others reinstituted the model of the itinerant preacher Im less familiar with the history of those orders the High Middle Ages were a period of significant increases in population wealth and urbanization especially in northern Italy where most of the mendicant orders originated,4,cdkedbo,1r79ls,askhistorians,new,48,44

JamesMcNulty,Iceland is an interesting case because we have actual historical accounts of how Christianity came to Iceland and the effects it hadThe mythos of Iceland by the tenth century was ideal for a peaceful conversion  Norse mythology is one of many gods many of which had dedicated cults the use of cult in this context is in no way derogatory or intended to suggest fringe belief systems  Unlike many other pantheons however the Norse gods were constantly gaining or losing influence  Where you can map basically onetoone from the Greek gods to the Roman gods the hierarchy of Norse gods and their popularity fluctuatedThe peaceful transition for Iceland to Christianity stemmed both from the existing structure of the Norse pantheon and the islands relationship with Norway  Fear of a hostile incursion by Norwegian forces was a strong motivator towards unity within Iceland  The prestige of Norse gods in Iceland by the tenth century was if not fluid certainly not written in stone  It was conceivable that a new cult may elevate their god to a place of honor within the Pantheon  Pressure from the Norwegian crown led to a vote in the year  which declared Iceland a Christian nation and made Christianity its official religion  However private religious practice was left unregulated  Theres evidence that worship of Norse gods continued for hundreds of years,2,cdkij5v,1r79ls,askhistorians,new,5,3
DerpeseSimplex,There are changes and as utiako said it exists as a gradient in history because the ideas behind a religion do not just instantly vanish with a conversion event A good example of thus was when Clovis I converted to Catholicism In that situation you had to diametrically different religions merge You had old Norse warrior religion Thor and whatnot merge with one of the most pacifist versions of Christianity that has arguably ever existed The result was that in the initial period Jesus became more warlike being depicted with swords and in some cases religious art made Jesus and Thor indistinguishable from each other I guess what I am saying as I ramble on here is that while oftentimes conversion events get treated as an on off switch the truth is usually that an amalgamation of the two religions result from the conversion  This is because when a people take on a new religious belief that began from outside that is them absorbing a new culture and generally when that occurs they dont just throw out their old culture and beliefs that had worked for them for countless years they find a way to make the religion fit with them not the other way around   This is why Christianity has things like Christmas trees or Easter bunnies those are old vestiges of the previous belief systems that were simply added to Christianity instead of totally replaced For more information on this topic check out Hardcore Historys Episode entitled Thors Angels ,3,cdkihgj,1r79ls,askhistorians,new,3,0

BeondTheGrave,gtI cant picture the South winning so many battles with just good Generals territorial advantage and moraleNot really true especially in the lower ranksThis is exactly the advantage the South need to win in the east But lets be clear they didnt win They infact lost it just took four years And that is largely due to the competency of Robert E Lee and perhaps the incompetence of Union Generals Robert E Lee is often called the American Napoleon and for good reason He adopted the precepts laid out by Napoleon to his specific situation and repeatedly won battles against a numerically superior opponent It was because Lee hit the Union Army so hard at its weakest points that he was able to repeatedly win victories Not only that but he was a master a repositioning his army to allow him to do so a feat in itself But Lee lost And thats because of the Unions massive advantages which you mentioned They had more men more guns more ships more cannons everything And lets go back to Lee who fights these spectacular but bloody battles And while he wins each time he has to spend some materiel which he will rarely replace So in many ways Lees battlefield victories actually accelerate the destruction of the Confederacy And lets also bring in the Western theaters where the Union consistently won By  the Mississippi River was solidly in Union control armies were invading across the river and down out of Ohio into Kentucky and Tennessee And at sea the Blockade of the South was strengthened and made more complete So while Lee is winning battles up North due to his amazing tactical sense the Confederacy is being strangled by the Union Anaconda Plan  ,1,cdkff0h,1r7dwx,askhistorians,new,5,4

WedgeHead,Southern Mesopotamia changed a lot over the thousands of years of history  Technological and social changes can make a huge difference in the answers to the questions you are posing  Since you mention Nippur Lagash and Marad I am going to focus on the late Third Millennium BCEFirst yes the region is quite small compared to modern settlements but remember that even  miles is nearly a full days walk away and these cities would have been virtually the only major structures on the map  Even in neighborhoods in the exact same city significant cultural differences can appear over time  The ancient world was no different in this respect and remember that we are viewing multitudes of centuries of growth and change when we examine them from so far awayIn the Early Dynastic Period  BCE the various citystates of southern Mesopotamia were diverse and dynamic centers  They probably spoke languages that were different enough from one another to be considered different dialects if not fully different languages  They worshiped different patron deities had different calendars and they had a whole variety of different local religious traditions  How many of these differences before they start to seem well different from ones own home  Who can say  But they were certainly different enough that it was a big deal when Sargon later conquered them and united them into a single administrative unit  And the differences were enough to compel them to keep rebelling against the Akkadian kings throughout their brief period of dominationHorses and dromedaries would not be introduced into Mesopotamia until later in the nd and st millenniums BCE respectively  In this early period the primary mode of daily travel was by foot possibly assisted by a hand cart or by river boat for long distance travel  Heavier loads could also be put on larger fourwheeled carts that were pulled by asses  It is difficult to make precise estimates about travel times because there are so many variables in particular routes and time periods but if we used the trade route itineraries from a slightly later period like the route to Emar document mentioned by uasdjk previously then you could take a very rough guess of an average travel speed of about  miles per hour  Most land travel was at night and most long distance travel was centered broadly around the summer seasonFinally as to your additional question the names for small villages in the third millennium BCE were largely unrecorded  Residents of the various villages would be considered residents of the nearby city templesanctuary really if they traveled abroad so the only time we see names for the smaller areas are in early administrative documents  Modern archaeologists use the modern Arabic names for most of these sites today  But the examples we do have are names for the local minor deities like Eninmar House of the goddess Ninmar or Egalima the house of the god IgalimaFor general reference on Mesopotamian geography with brief discussion on the matters I mentioned here see Michael Roaf Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia   For details on travel and trade see W F Leemans Foreign trade in the old Babylonian period as revealed by texts from Southern Mesopotamia ,4,cdkl819,1r7hfk,askhistorians,new,29,25

CrossyNZ,This is a tricky question because of the nature of World War Two Perhaps in previous wars  in Britain especially  the old might have been sheltered from war in a way that made them observers rather than participants But World War Two didnt really respect the combatantnoncombatant divide and elderly people were as affected by it as the young albeit in different ways For example in Britain with the threat of invasion men above the age of  but below about  could serve in the Home Guard or join up for special constabulary roles with the police People had soldiers billeted with them petrol strictly controlled and things made of metal were suddenly in short supply Think of China where the social fabric of the family with the younger generations taking care of their relatives was radically disrupted by those younger caregivers dying leaving or being taken up into service Imagine rationing as an elderly person  being unable to queue for long periods of time despite it being the only way to get certain basic things having to heat your house with only the fuel allocated  Imagine having an air raid siren sound and how difficult it would be for some elderly persons to physically evacuate In Europe elderly refugees fared poorly on the road Imagine the sudden grief of young family members dyingAs other people have pointed out older people did write dairies and letters about their experiences at war many of these still exist They are perhaps not as famous as their counterparts from the young  those that fought the war claimed the authority to speak about it afterwards and those voices which fell outside that narrative tended to get lost The elderly that talk about the future  generalising from letters  tend to speak in the most longing terms of their family members coming home But then letters have a certain audience yes You are talking to the family member you want to come home From their dairies it tends to be more selfish in the present the pressing concerns of the now almost override the thinking about the future But it is also in the nature of a dairy to reflect on present happenings as they impact on oneselfIts a great question regardless of the wide array of answers presented above I suppose the TLDR of my post would be that the elderly were just as involved in the present as young people were and thus wanted for the future in the same practical way,1,cdkw0a5,1r7km5,askhistorians,new,4,3

zuzahin,I wouldnt say its a widely held belief as much as any photograph nowadays is altered levels adjusted saturation curves contrast brightness all this junk but its definitely a theory that isnt denied or disputed in any major way Lange most likely staged a lot of her photographs but we will just never know The problem with this sort of theory is that most photographs from that day and age were handpicked out of a BUNCH of photographs Recently in a class I had we were watching a documentary called Er Du Mors Lille Dreng Are you mommas little boy that centered around  mentally handicapped people who gave birth to a child and that childs trouble with life both legal and physicallymentally Lars Høj the producer gave some good quotes aswell one that I will share here   I believe its a grown myth that its possible for a TV Crew to become one with the surroundings to become the socalled Fly on the wall Well always atleast be an annoying bee in the room that everyone notices every now and againBasically what you can take from this and what I took from it is that nothing can really be perceived to be what happened during the time it was captured What Lange captured was what she saw and not what you mightve seen in the situation Some say she posed the mothers hand to indicate a hint of worry pondering about the future and their current troubles and others say the reason the childrens heads are turned away is because it removes any fake emotion they might have Also because they were supposedly laughing and playing around when Lange was capturing the photographs but all these are just theories HerehttpbpblogspotcomLBRoOFMNWSjkJmRXUIAAAAAAAAAOkjdkmVCrEshdorothealangemigrantmotherfamilyjpg and herehttpcphmagcomDorotheaLangeDestitutepeapickersinCaliforniaMotherofsevenchildrenAgethirtytwoNipomoCAlgjpg are  images of the same subjects taken consecutively and only the first one would have sort of the same impact as the popular one we have todayLange herself had this to say in  looking back on the photographs some  years earlier I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother as if drawn by a magnet I do not remember how I explained my presence or my camera to her but I do remember she asked me no questions I made five exposures working closer and closer from the same direction I did not ask her name or her history She told me her age that she was thirtytwo She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields and birds that the children killed She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food There she sat in that leanto tent with her children huddled around her and seemed to know that my pictures might help her and so she helped me There was a sort of equality about itI dont know if the government knew what she did but she brought home the job that she was hired to do her main job with the Resettlement AdministrationFarm Security Administration was to show the American government that these people needed help and staging photographs was one such way of going about that Roy Stryker the head of the Information Department of the FSA said that he believed that showing the public the plight of the farmer would lead to support for government aid to the rural poor This means that she mightve staged them Stryker mightve known what she did and she mightve just simply photographed what was there In my opinion Lange is one of the cleaner BW photographers out there Her images seemingly have no trace of being altered and I think this is what owes to her success aswell as her subject matters In any case the reason Stryker hired her was quite simple he liked her previous works with the immigrants in California Maybe he was aware she staged them maybe he wasnt but he had this to say in response to a reporters question about Composition The word composition was never talked about never mentioned It was a taboo word We didnt talk about composition I dont like the word I think its been loaded with all sorts of very spurious things They try and get in the electrical and so on compositions No We had none of this Photographers were intelligent people that worked for us They were communicating They were intelligent enough  some of them had art training  they were intelligent enough to sense what they were doing They were trying to tell us tell the public make pictures that were genuine that recognized peculiar situations whether it be a piece of geography or a human being and recognized the pertinent things in this particular situation They had taken the time to check certain facts or investigate to understand why they were at that place and what they were going to do From that point on ten pictures were taken Of those ten pictures if you looked at them  we never evaluated them in terms of set values We looked at them in terms of what did they have to say about this little group of people this particular village this particular dust area or whatOdds are he knew that every photographer did things differently he would obviously know the inner workings of how photography worked as Stryker was a photographer himself so Im sure he had a very good idea of the cogs and wheels behind the operation but Im not sure if he ever disliked it As for staging yeah every photographer did it Generalizing here the most famous example of staging in my mind is George N Barnard who shot images such as thesehttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsAtlantaroundhouseruinjpg with a doubleexposed sky  photographs stitched together in the darkroom which is as much of a lie as a staged image really is in some respects as that sky would never be present with the lightsensitive emulsions and slow exposure times and limited cameras of that era So I dont know where youd draw the line Robert Capa is another example that springs to mind His most famous photograph the Falling Soldier is also widely disputed and hailed as a fake but I dont know man it brought the message across it shocked people it awed people it touched people just like Langes Migrant Mother serieshttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonseeFlorenceOwensThompsonmontagebyDorotheaLangejpg did However in that last link you see something very important that was omitted from the final take  The children dont seem to be so depressed as you see them in the most famous version of the photograph Dorothea Lange later said As a continuation of the quote in   the pea crop at Nipomo had frozen and there was no work for anybody But I did not approach the tents and shelters of other stranded peapickers It was not necessary I knew I had recorded the essence of my assignmentShe was sent out to show how badly the people in that camp had it and she did what she had been asked to do  and damned if she didnt succeed  supposedly after  of the photographs of the Migrant Mother was published in newspapers the government rushed to ship out  tons of food to the camp and some say it also influenced Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath but these last  arent backed by a source so I wouldnt really hold them

BeondTheGrave,To get a better answer I think you need to differentiate between Revolutions and Rebellion A rebellion or revolt is when a group of people refuse to do something The tax rebellion is the most common of these kinds of revolts and has an obvious cause After the offending tax is removed or the rebellion put down the cause for violence and resistance ends A Revolution on the other hand is the complete overthrow of the government Violence is a major component of revolutions as well  Usually revolutionaries attempt to create a new different kind of government to replace it The French Revolution is the progenitor of most modern revolutions and we can see the general difference between revolution and revolt The French kill their king and establish a new form of government a republic They then battle for several years about what kind of republic France will become until the whole thing falls apart and Napoleon becomes Emperor But the French revolution is one from the left spectrum of politics It ushers in equality democracy and all sorts of wonderful classically liberal policies But in the context of modern revolutions you can also have revolutions from the right This is best shown by the Nazi revolution of the s which destroys democracy in Germany So now weve clarified terms a bit So to answer your question more directly people have rebelled for as long as there has been people Its a natural thing to do especially for young people As for revolutions thats a sticker answer and depends on how you want to play with your definitions The French Revolution created our modern conception of what a revolution looked like and most of the major th century revolutions were in some ways influenced by the FR But thats our modern conception There are revolutions in early history that resemble the French like the Roman Revolution and modern revolutions that dont like the Velvet Revolution Thus because it is so hard to define what exactly a revolution is its hard to figure out what was actually a revolution and what wasnt Some historians will snicker at the American Revolution for example and say it was only an overblown tax rebellion And to really throw a wrench into your thinking there are greater paradigm shifts which are called Revolutions A great example would be the Industrial Revolution which completely changed the world worked Some of these paradigm shift revolutions can go back thousands of years to the Agricultural revolution when people switched from HunterGatherers to agricultural people ,0,cdkf7xs,1r7mul,askhistorians,new,2,2

Bakuraptor,In brief Britain is able to enjoy a dominant position in the slave trade to the Caribbean primarily because of its dominant naval position in the eighteenth century which enabled its merchants to achieve preferred status on many goods but particularly notably with slavery However its contribution to the British economy diminished over the course of the century the growth of the emancipation movement followed a decline in the importance of Slavery towards British commerce indeed in the revolutionary wars of the s the attempts of the French to infiltrate British colonies with free coloureds and incite rebellion almost made it a liability You might want to try Brewers Sinews of Power for the link between the British Navy and Merchant Navy in the th century for the second point about the revolutionary war the chapter about the British empire in The French Revolution and British Popular Politics by Philp may prove helpfulSorry not to offer a direct answer  the question as said below is very broad But as a general trend Id say that slavery becomes increasingly less significant to the British economy as the century goes on,0,cdkig2v,1r7o9f,askhistorians,new,1,1

XenophonTheAthenian,Oh god the question to end all questions Warfare was something the Greeks thought a lot about from Homer on Were going to have to narrow this down quite a bitSo for starters we really dont know anything about warfare in the Mycenaean Period or the Dark Age We can guess but that doesnt tell us a whole lot In reality our first real understanding of warfare comes from Homer who we cant rely on to actually tell us anything about how wars were really fought What the Homeric Poems can tell us however is how warfare was viewed at the end of the Dark Age Modern readers of the Homeric Poems particularly the Iliad often mistake the predominance of violence in Homer as a glorification of war It is in no way such a thing The war of the heroes is considered glorious and noble but its still horrifying Homer frequently gives us very detailed descriptions of warriors meeting horrific deaths Sometimes the purpose of this is to show just how impressive a fighter the victor was but sometimes its there to draw our attention to just whats really happening when these guys are going at it Particularly Homer often points out just how much grief war causesin fact the overbearing grief of battle is one of the major catalysts in Homer acting on Achilles with Patroclus death Priam with Hectors death and even Zeus himself an entire book of the Iliad is devoted to Zeus grief over the fact that his son Sarpedon is fated to die The epic combats over the bodies of the fallen at the same time portray for us the glory of warriors fighting for honor itself and also the pointlessness and the horror of what theyre doingafter all these guys are piling up bodies so that they can strip the dead of their armor and leave them lying there naked and dehumanized And most importantly in Homer Achilles the paragon of war is very ambiguous After Patroclus death Achilles does some very questionable things and leads even his own people to wonder whether hes still really human or whether war and grief have so possessed his mind that hes no longer rational Of course this turns out not to be the case when he entertains Priam at his tent but it betrays a great fear the Greeks had of losing control particularly during something as dangerous as battle as well as the horrific undertones that war had Now as for the Archaic Period things are somewhat different Compared to the late Mycenaean Period and Dark Age the Archaic Period is pretty stable Youve got a middleclass rapidly rising increasing economies everywhere and expansion of the influence of cities But all of this is accompanied by constant warfare Throughout this period as rival states struggle with each other over very limited resources and territory as well as over influence war breaks out pretty much every season But theres something to be understood here By the time hoplite warfare had taken hold in Greece warfare was to the individual soldier not particularly troublesome Youre a guy protected in heavy armor the heaviest armor in the world actually the you purchased yourself And youre surrounded by guys exactly like you This isnt heroic warfare where its just you and the other guy and you have to prove to everyone that youre better than he is by dismembering him No youre operating as a part of a unit and so long as you do your job and keep your shield up youre probably going to come out of this just fine The chances of actually getting hurt if youre not in the front couple ranks is pretty slim So weve got an urban middle class that can assert its own dominance by bearing the responsibilities of defense on its shoulders with relative safety along with a population boom and economic growth of an enormous scale Warfare becomes a major political and economic catalyst from which we get Platos statement that during that period every now and then a city decided that it had to just march out kill some of the men of a rival city and assert their dominance on the field Warfare also becomes highly ritualized with certain rules like the sanctity of heralds which was already a rule in Homer but becomes even more importantso important that a couple centuries later when Alexander assaults Tyre much of his justification for the treatment of the city is that the Tyrians butchered the Macedonian heralds the decision to limit the fighting to a single decisive engagement allowing the defeated to retrieve their dead from the field limits on missile troops and cavalry etc We also see a rise in mercenaries as the population increases and you have a bunch of people without work going overseas to fight for foreign powersfrom this the Egyptians call the Greeks the Men of Bronze and we also get the poetry of the mercenarypoet Archilochus of Paros Attitudes change following the Persian Wars The Persians dont adhere to these rules and theyre foreigners attacking the Greek people who for the first time ever start to consider themselves as a single entity The Persians are willing to do things like mass crucifixions mutilation of the dead and burning of unoccupied cities They are a barbarian menace and Greek attitudes towards war change as it becomes important to fight the Persians by any means necessary even if it means doing things like building a fleet Fleetbuilding means that the rowers the urban poor become elevated in status and in Athens this means that they are basically the major military arm of the state But the Persian Wars are still glorious as we can see from Herodotus Aeschylus and the attitudes that Aristophanes lampoons precisely because the Greek people heroically fought off an insidious foreign power who didnt adhere to any of the rules of civilized menBut the point at which things really get intense as regards Greek attitudes towards war is the Peloponnesian War The Peloponnesian War  is an allout brawl and its aftermath is a century of constant fighting with no real resolution until Philip smashes Greek independence The Peloponnesian War introduces horrors such as naval raids mass slaughters total war light infantry massacres etc If you read through the pages of Thucydides youll find that a point is made to contrast the lofty ideals that both sides claim they are fighting for with the brutal reality of the warthat it is absolute murder on the most pointless scale In particular Thucydides is especially interested in the way that the Spartans are hypocritical in their idea of justice as seen when they commit mass murder of the entire population of Plataea after a phoney trial where the accused were asked a single question Have you ever assisted the Peloponnesian League in any way a question which the Plataeans as staunch Athenian allies could only reply No and the way that the Athenians who profess to despise the tyranny of the Spartans and Persians have become even worse than their enemies all for the sake of surviving The terror of war haunts the Peloponnesian War and its aftermath just take a look at Aristophanes and youll see just how awful it was to the average person This is a total war that lasted about  years and which sucked in every state in the Greek world Following this the Greeks plunge into chaotic warfare as different states each try to take over the old Athenian Empire and the Peloponnesian League which is heavily weakened and eventually collapses Weve also got an entire generation of men who were raised during the war and when the war ends have only known war for their entire lives In fact there are so many of these guys who only know how to fight and nothing else that the Ten Thousand that Cyrus hired to help him usurp the throne of Persia were only a tiny portion of the soldiers roaming around the Greek world And lets take a look at some of these guys starting with the Ten Thousand Xenophon who is himself a part of this generation relates at several points that the Greeks did some questionable things such as mutilation of the dead but that it was alright because they were only doing that because the Persians were doing it to them How unlike the disgust with which Herodotus views the Persian mutilations at Thermopylae Winning and killing become more important than humanity or honor at this point which we see when Iphicrates employs a force of only peltasts in the Corinthian War to wipe out a Spartan force marching up to meet him and then hunts down the survivors mercilessly All this is only broken when Philip defeats the Greeks who have essentially destroyed themselves and puts an end to war between the states of course there are a lot of rebellions but Im not going to get into the Hellenistic Period its too complicated as it isAs to some of your other questions the idea of a diplomatic corps is a uniquely modern one which comes out of the Peace of Westphalia and its aftermath True the Greeks had heralds to relay diplomatic information and often important people would be sent on embassies of the state but they werent viewed the same way Diplomatic attempts frequently fell through although they also often succeeded The difficulty with your questions lies in the fact that they are very widely spread out across a variety of different subjects many of them only relating to warfare in the barest of ways Ive tried to answer some here although Im not sure of how good a job Ive done It may be worth it

Irishfafnir,I find this hard to swallow The United States fully saw itself as part of an Atlantic World and particularly whatever happened in Britain had enormous repercussions in the United States Abolitionists on both sides of the Atlantic stayed in contact and influenced one another ProSlavery advocates frequently cited British abolition in the West Indies in their defense of slavery For instance during  introduction of the first gag rule  which would have gagged any measure regarding abolition politicians who noted that there was virtually no abolition movement of note within the United States were countered by arguments that initially there had been little support of abolition within Britain During the nullification crisis the British West Indies was frequently cited in support of the nullifer camp and at least one prominent nullifer had conducted extensive business in the British West Indies Moral Capital argues  convincingly that the rise of British abolitionism has its roots in the ideological battles of the American revolution as both Americans and the British entered the idea of slavery as a wrong in a large public right The idea became increasingly enshrined and helped end the slave trade for both nations and American abolition within most of the Northern United States In short British abolitionism was too heavily intertwined within the American world for the statement the United States abolished slavery without any outside influence to withstand much scrutiny ,0,cdkkxyw,1r849v,askhistorians,new,7,7

idjet,Heresy in Southern France between Toulouse the Mediterranean and the Pyrenees mountains was extinguished by what we now can see as a three stages of conflict preaching against heresyThe Catholic Church identified the foxes in the vineyard  the heretics in Southern France  in the mid th century The first stage of dealing with this heresy was preaching missions These began with CistercianhttpenwikipediaorgwikiCistercians monks like Bernard de ClairvauxhttpenwikipediaorgwikiBernardofClairvaux who actually travelled south and debated heretics in public in mid th century By  we see the first Papal licensed mendicant preachers in Southern France Dominic Guzman was one of the first and he later became the saint for whom the Dominican order is named These Catholic medicant preachers or the travelling poor preachers were an attempt by some quarters of the Catholic Church to combat the heretical good men and good women bon homes bon femnas who travelled Southern France from town to town living the life of apostolic poverty and preaching Most heresy of the high middle ages carried a spirit of apostolic livingDuring this period the papacy convened several councils to outlaw various heresies named and unnamed Punishments were also prescribed including penances such as forced pilgrimages excommunication confiscation of property prisonMost proper books on the Cathars will deal with this period to some degree or another I recommend these booksA Most Holy War The Albigensian Crusade and the Battle for Christendom Mark Pegg Oxford  The Cathars Malcolm Lambert WileyBlackwell  The Cathars Dualist Heretics in Languedoc in the High Middle Ages Malcolm Barber Routledge see note below about the term Cathar and the related beliefs military operationsAfter the murder of papal legate Pierre de Castelnau supposedly by supporters of one of the greatest counts of southern France Raymond Count of Toulouse Pope Innocent IIIhttpenwikipediaorgwikiInnocentIII was able to gather sufficient momentum for an actual crusade into Southern France While Innocent III sought the involvement of the King of France Phillip Augustus refused on the grounds that the southern counts were his vassals had not been declared heretics and as such he would not march against his vassals and their property However Phillip did permit his northern vassals to campaign in the south should they wish and many did The northern French host was eventually lead in military and political matters by Simon de MontforthttpenwikipediaorgwikiSimondeMontfortthEarlofLeicester and found its religious leader in papal legate Arnaud AmalrichttpenwikipediaorgwikiArnaudAmaury The crusade has become known as the Albigensian Crusade or in some writings of the time the war of Southern France or war against the Southern CountsThe Albigensian CrusadehttpenwikipediaorgwikiAlbigensianCrusade between  and  can be broadly broken into  stages the first stage is the initial conquest of these territories through through siege warfare and few open battles Through this period the most important counts including the Trencavels of Carcassonne and AlbihttpenwikipediaorgwikiRaymondRogerTrencavel counts of Foix and Comminges and Raymond Count of ToulousehttpenwikipediaorgwikiRaymondVIofToulouse were either killed or displaced and the King of Aragon Pedro II died in battle south of Toulouse in Muret This first part of the war of the south closed with the death of Simon de Montfort in summer of  during an over halfyear siege of ToulouseSimons son Amaury proved an ineffective replacement as leader of the southern wars and from  through about  we see second stage in the Crusade the reconquest of southern lands by the son of the Count of Toulouse also confusingly called Raymond Many of the territories which had fallen to Montfort took advantage of the absence of Montforts strong military dictatorship and personality and shifted allegiances to Raymond and other counts local northern garrisons were killed or ousted By the mid s after involvement of relations of the King of France and the final declarations of Count Raymond as heretic Louis VIII took up the crusades directly and marched massive French armies into the south By  the Treaty of ParisMeaux between the King of France and Count Raymond was signed which brought to a close the major military operations in the south During the entire period  there were a number of incidences of burning of heretics in small villages and in cities usually right after successful siegesFor just a military overview of the crusades I recommend  Laurence W Marvins Occitan War A Military and Political History of the Albigensian Crusade  Cambridge   Although he stops with Montforts death it gives a good look at the functioning of the wars  the first medieval inquisitionInto various treaties which resulted from the Crusades were written requirements including towns which were viewed as hotbeds of heresy must erect new or improve and augment existing Catholic Churches taxes were levied which were to be contributed directly to Catholic Church Counts Viscounts and other local lords were required to fund abbeys or schools and this is how the University of Toulouse came to be Counts and other lords were required to politically militarily and legally support the eradication of heresy through the financial and legal support of inquisitions in heretical depravityThe inquisition was not a formalized practice or institution nor was it directed with central authority Various local bishops Toulouse Pamiers Narbonne etc abbots and friars of local orders Dominicans of Toulouse were granted authority from time to time by the Pope to pursue and root out heresy The political authorities through their nascent policing arms bayles were to imprison and at times execute those found by the inquisitors to be irredeemable or to fine the heretics to confiscate property or to apply yellow crosses as a public label or to force pilgrimagesMark Peggs The Corruption of Angels The Great Inquisition of  Princeton  is a very readable introduction to how this early inquisition functioned in Toulouse Rene Wies The Yellow Cross The Story of the Last Cathars Rebellion Against the Inquisition    is good on detail as well although calling it a rebellion is wrongnote bear in mind that the term Cathar was never used as a label for heretics in the south of France before during or directly after the Albigensian Crusades by any northern or southern noble clergy or crezen believer themself The term Cathar was applied likely accidentally by church historians later Furthermore there is very little to substantiate that any heresy in southern France in the High Middle Ages constituted anything like dualism or

ASu,Wow finally a question that is my speciality Wohoo Your question is a bit broad and vague so I will divide it up into three areas of discussion politics economy and culture Also my focus will be on largely structural reasonsPolitically the Yuan unified the geographic area of China Song Jin and XiXia thus unifying a disparate China after    years of disunity depending on what measure you use As a result they bequeathed a lasting territorial benchmark or legacy to live up to for future dynasties nations of China Both the Qing and PRC have claimed legitimacy as the successors of the Yuan regime in a roundabout way to supposed Yuan territories such as Tibet Furthermore Chinese political and military structure in both the Ming and Qing dynasties was heavily influenced by Yuan forms For instance the military rose to a strong position of power in Ming bureaucracy and politics whereas in the Song they were subjugated In addition the Ming enfeoffed rebellious or unwanted princes in far off military districts such as Yunan not unlike Mongol custom Lastly in the Qing dynasty Mongol forms of political legitimation such as descent from Chinggis Khan and his personal vessels were used by the incipient Qing and Aisin Giorio clan to cement alliances Economically the Mongol conquests in short accelerated the decline of Chinas north plain economy in favour of its southern regions Though this decline had been ongoing for centuries the devastation the Mongols wrought on the Jin dynasty left the north poor Also several theories point to an ecological decline of the Mongolian grasslands following the Mongol conquests  most likely due to overgrazing to increase and maintain the supply of Mongolian ponies In addition contacts with the Middle East and the rest of the world were increased both by the land Pax Mongolica or overland trade routes and by sea shipping Lastly culturally the Mongol conquests did change some aspects of Chinese culture Numerous Middle Easterners moved into China and Islam began making major headways into Xinjiang Gansu and notably Yunnan Buttons were introduced which changed Chinese clothes forever New languages such as the Phagspa script and the Mongol script were developed which later influenced Hangul and the Manchu language In addition NeoConfucian thought gained a wider political appeal and support under the Yuan Now that I have summarized some of the effects of the Mongol conquest I shall answer some of your other questionsThe Mongols never did completely assimilate into Chinese society contrary to what a lot of old school PRC scholars believe Many Mongol Khans and nobles  didnt and perhaps couldnt learn Chinese effectively and continued to speak Mongol If anything as the conflict between the Khubilai and Arik Boke attests to a growing divide appeared between the sedentarized Mongols who took the trappings of Chinese culture and the nomads back home A similar situation developed in all of the Mongol successor Khanates with the exception of the golden Horde Despite prohibitions many Mongols intermarried with Chinese and vice versa Some Mongols became Chinese and some Chinese became Mongol But overall the garrisons stationed in China began to acquire more and more Chinese characteristics According to John Dardess in Conquerors and Confucians the Yuan dynasty was undergoing a transition in the ss to change from a conquest elite to a sinifieddynasty but this process was arrested for a number of reasons which will be discussed below Ultimately the Yuan dynasty failed to a combination of bad luck political intrigue and an inability to adapt to a changing political climate As far as bad luck goes the Yuan faced a number of climatic challenges that created famines droughts and storms which wrecked peasant life This in combination with the aftermath of the bubonic plague left large tracts of China devastated economically especially from the s onwards Unlike the Ming which were extremely lucky by dynastic standards the Yuan faced a large number of disasters from which they could not alleviate economically Political Intrigue also weakened the dynasty greatly Aside from Khubilai and the last Khan of the Yuan all the middle rulers only ruled for a few years before being killed or replaced Consequently there was no stable political environment in which all the efforts of the dynasty could be used to alleviate the economic distress that the peasantry faced Also Khubilais expensive and fruitless endeavours in Java Japan Myanmar Daiviet and Champa drained a lot of the wealth and manpower of the Yuan and left the political administration in deficit In response the Yuan admin used tax farmers which only exacerbated their unsustainable revenue problems to make up the shortfall Lastly an inability to change fast enough greatly impeded the ability fo the Yuan to survive Due to sedentarization Mongol armies stationed in China no longer possessed the marital qualities that their greatgrandfathers possed when they conquered China As a result the admin could not easily or quickly put down rebellions such as the Red Turbans which rendered large parts of southern China as de facto independent In addition court intrigue also prevented the installation of far reaching reforms that could have changed the bureaucracy to more efficiently deal with economic problems that weakened the state As a result of the rebellions many of the Mongol elite were undecided to become more Chinese or maintain their Mongol heritage The indecision ultimately prevented them from adapting to be more favourable to Southern China Lastly though the seperation and discrimination of the people of the Yuan into four categories was useful in the initial administration of the country it became a major liability later on Due to its discrimination against Southern Chinese the Yuan were never able to bring them into the political fold and turn them into a bastion of support for the regime Thus a combination of these reasons ultimately prevented the Yuan from maintaining their control over the Chinese populace ,0,cdl3wv2,1r8jga,askhistorians,new,5,5

Irishfafnir,Over reliance on Alexander Hamilton Hamilton and Washingtons relationship is well known and predates his time as President but it was his over reliance on Hamilton during and after his Presidency that greatly increased political tensions contributed to the rise of the Republican party and contributed to Adams loss in  Initially Washington had leaned very heavily on James Madison who was the most effective politician in the house but Washington eventually turned to his cabinet largely out of constitutional reasons His cabinet was initially a good mix of geography and political persuasion  The political arguing between Jefferson and Hamilton is known well but initially Washington was far less biased than one would think for instance he very nearly vetoed BOTUS I As political tensions mounted Washington increasingly relied on Hamilton at the expense of the moderates and what would be Jeffersonians within his cabinet For instance the negotiations between Jay and the British were run through Hamilton the secretary of the treasury and not state Edmund Randolph the secretary of state was left almost entirely in the dark and consequently so was the ambasaddor to France James Monroe Jay and Hamiltons working around of the ProFrench Virginians  put both Monroe and Randolph into the near impossible position of attempting to explain the Jay Treaty to their still nominal allies in France which contributed to the more famous hostilities of Adams presidencyAfter Jeffersons departure there was no remaining Republican leaning members of Washingtons cabinet only Randolph and mostly high federalists In  a letter written by Edmund Randolph to France had been seized by the British who turned it over to Alexander Hamilton who informed Washington that it contained treasonous material to the United States Washington never actually read the letter nor did he have someone else read it relying solely on the opinion and word of Hamilton He confronted Randolph in a cabinet meeting forcing him to resign Within the th century society of honor Washingtons actions were highly offensive made evident by Randolph taking the unusual steps of publicly attacking Washington in his A Vindication of Mr Randolphs ResignationhttpbooksgooglecombooksidJzZcAAAAQAAJampprintsecfrontcoverampdqEdmundRandolphvonepageampqampffalse at about the same time Monroe was also removed from France These removals meant that there was now no Republicans holding high office within the United States and only one moderate FederalistLee Jefferson and Madison in particular saw the removal of Randolph as the last straw and any lingering sentiments towards reconciling with the Federalists was highly unlikely Jefferson in a pained letter even wrote to Washington telling him of how dangerous he felt Hamilton was to Washington Adams too many problems during his presidency to get into at any length but one of the ones not of his creation was because of Washington Adams had expanded the armed forces of the United States either to oppose France or as some Federalists hopped to stop domestic violence ie Republican At this highly partisan time Adams thought that only Washington could be offered command of the army to ensure that the army held the support of all Americans Perhaps showing the severity of the time Washington actually accepted but refused to have anyone other than Hamilton as his second in command Adams huffed and puffed but was left with little choice but to accept Hamilton Hamilton was not the man to bring the nation together especially at the head of an army one of his best friends Gouvernor Morris wrote of HamiltonOur poor friend Hamilton bestrode his hobby to the great annoyance of his friends and not without injury to himself He well knew that his favorite form of government was inadmissible unless as the result of civil war and I suspect that his belief in that which he called an approaching crisis arose from a conviction that the king of government most suitable in his opinion to this extensive country could established no other wayHamiltons appointment panicked Republicans even more so many who now openly thought that the armys purpose was to crush the Republican movement Jefferson sent out letters to Republican leaders imploring them to avoid giving the Federalists any reason whatsoever for using the army against them In doing so Jefferson allowed the public to arrive at their own conclusion regarding the army which contributed to his victory in  Adams had planned to appoint moderates in Pennsylvania and New York to high offices within the army the two states he needed to win to secure his election but Hamilton ensured that only high federalists and no Republicans were appointed to command again reinforcing the Jeffersonian fear It was at this point that Adams realized he had lost complete control of the Federalist party and he attempted to reassert his authority through sacking his cabinetminus Lee and negotiations with France causing a civil war within the partyHad Washington continued to rely on moderate Republicans like Madison and appointed a bipartisan cabinet much of the political infighting that resulted in the two party system could have been lessened or delayedoutside of that Im not sure what else you can really hold Washington accountable for major political mistakes Ellis in American Creation holds the entirety of the founding generation responsible for failing to find a solution for the natives and slavery However Ellis notes in the book for the Creek

AmericanGraffiti,Adolescence as a Social and Cultural ConstructionA quick note first in case someone is confused about how adolescence can come to be  concepts like childhood adolescence and adulthood are all social and culturally constructed identities which give meaning to but are not defined by the process of human growth and development  There have always been children and children have always developed physically mentally psychologically in more or less the same way that they do today  But much of what we think of as natural for children and adolescents is actually culturally defined  In the past most children and youth did not spend  years attending school full time and they did not live the kind of protected carefully supervised life that they do today  In western society prior to the twentieth century the vast majority of young people worked from a very young age and their status and role in society was defined by more by their race class marital status and occupation than it was by their age  The Origins of ChildhoodIn western society children werent really considered a distinct social group who experienced a specific life stage called childhood until the seventeenth century and its not really until the late eighteenth centuryearly nineteenth century that modern notions of childhood as a time of innocence growth and learning  during which children needed to be carefully protected and nurtured  really catches on  Even then it primarily catches on among middleclass and upperclass people while workingclass black and immigrant children still spend most of their time working and in close proximity to a lot of talk and behaviour that we would consider adults only stuff todayThe Roots of Adolescence Social Change in the th Century and G Stanley HallAdolescence as we know it only originated in the late nineteenthearly twentieth century  Officially the term was invented by an American psychologist named G Stanley Hall  He published a book in  called Adolescence Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology Anthropology Sociology Sex Crime Religion and Education which coined the term  But the origins of adolescence really lie in the nineteenth century in broader economic social and demographic changes like urbanization immigration and the industrial revolution  One key factor was that the American economy got more and more complex over time and there began to be a growing demand for well educated skilled workers who had spent a few years in school and were well suited to run an increasingly technologized managerial state and economy  So young people started to stay in school for longer  But theres another consideration too  As immigrants and rural migrants poured into large cities during the late nineteenth centuries young workers who were working on the street and in factories for wages started to find themselves with a lot more independence that theyd had in smaller towns and rural communities or when theyd worked in close proximity to their parents or other adults in a shop setting  Middleclass people like Hall started to notice a lot more young people running around in the streets unsupervised and engaging in misbehavior theft fighting prostitution sex etc which made them worry about the future of American society have you seen what the kids are doing these daysThe Child Study Movement and Halls Recapitulation TheoryHall was one of the founders of the Child Study Movement and of child psychology as a scientific discipline  He spent a lot of time just observing children in the process of growing up during the late nineteenth century and ultimately decided that in a modern industrialized society children needed more time to develop into adults than they had in the past The easiest way to explain this is through Halls theory of recapitulation  Like many nineteenth century Americans Hall believed that human societies and civilizations developed over time from a state of savagery into a state of civilization gradually become more and more civilized complex and rational Each of these stages in this theory had to be worked through in turn like a series of steps and if societies didnt go through the steps in the right order or didnt develop properly theyd get stuck somewhere along the wayWhen he looked at developing adolescents Hall thought he saw a similar process at work there he thought there was a single set developmental path that children followed on their way to becoming adults and he observed what he interpreted as a lot of savage and tribal behaviour in adolescents this might sound familiar to parentsteachers who are reading this  Halls ConclusionsWhat Hall ended up concluding in the end was that the urban industrialized environment of the late s was making young people take longer to work through all of the different statesstages of psychological and moral development that they needed to go through in order to become healthy adults  So he advocated giving young Americans more time and more space to grow up and permitting them to act like little savages for a while so that they could get that out of their system and move on  The big danger as he saw it was that forcing them to grow up too fast would get young people stuck in one of those stages where they would continue acting like uncivilized people violent poor impulse control etc through their whole adult life  So he advocated giving them space but in a carefully monitoredcontrolled environment  Hall also subscribed to Victorian morals after all so it was very very important to him that young people be supervised and directed toward expending all of their savagery and energy on wholesome pursuits like sports being outdoors exploring nature etc  Like many other childrearing experts around this time he was kind of obsessed with masturbation and teaching young people sexual self control Adolescence after HallSo thats it Halls idea made a lot of sense to people at the time and really caught on as a means of explaining and justifying the new roles delayed entry into the labor force extended schooling that young people were taking on around that time  His ideas lead directly to rapidly expanding school enrolmentshttpiimgurcomJHmWLWpng organizations like the YMCA and the boy scouts and a whole host of other institutions and practices that helped to define and spread the concept of adolescence over the course of the th CenturyNote that most of his ideas like the recapitulation theory were discredited pretty quickly though  his importance really just lies in his invention of adolescenceSourcesSarah Chinn Inventing Modern

Irishfafnir,The idea that the Whig party is the Federalists rebranded has been on going for a number of years and was one employed by the Jacksonians during their own time as a means of slandering Whigs However in the capstone book of Whig History The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party forever slams shut the case that Whigs were Federalists rebranded if anything Whigs could claim a stronger connection to Republicanism than Democrats But lets look at the three things that made up the American system which is commonly viewed at the center point of Whig political economic ideology Support for a national bank On the surface this seems like a slam dunk in favor of Federalism but a looker close reveals otherwise Hamiltons bank was smaller and designed to give large loans for ninety days to wealthy merchants and to prevent the formation of state banks Hamiltons designs for the bank reveal the Federalist desire for a world that looked East towards a mercantile republic dominated by aristocratic men BOTUS II by contrast was aimed at managing the already numerous state banks who primarily secured credit for western farmers Perhaps most revealing Federalists voted against BOTUS II  Internal Improvements Internal Improvements arent really a party issue in the early republic Both Federalists and Republicans called for internal improvements However Clays internal improvement program was based on Albert Gallatins  report while serving as Thomas Jeffersons secretary of state Moreover Republican and Whig internal improvements were aimed at improving the vast interior in contrast to the Federalist outlook of looking East Protective tariff The protective tariff is clearly a Republican tariff Hamiltons tariff proposals were not actually protective but were for revenue during his time the price of foreign manufactures had declined he believed that additional duties would not seriously affect customer prices Hamilton offered no protection to established industries threatened by more efficient foreign competition only new manufacturing Moreover Hamilton wasnt a big fan of protective tariffs considering bounties and direct government payments to business stating they were the best and most efficacious means of exchanging manufactures  moreover we know now his policies encourage exported items rather then goods for domestic use Madison and Clays tariff was a true protective tariff aimed at protecting domestic manufacturing and only giving free rates for those goods which Americans were incapable of producing which even had the support of Jefferson goods that could completely satisfy American demands had very high tariff rates and those that could only partially fill had  rates Moreover the Madison tariff reflected a rejection of British domination of the world and is a reflection of American foreign policy in the years leading up to the war of  Federalists voted for the tariff  Fear of Executive Power Whigs were brought together as much because of Jackson than because of a shared economic policy In this regard Whigs express hallmark Jeffersonian fears of executive power In practice this is often reflected in Whig candidates offering to only serve one term or refusing to veto legislation While Federalists often attacked Jefferson for being a hypocritically strong President you dont see the same fear of executive rule during the first party systemThe Military While Whigs preferred a strong military they supported the army over the navy whereas Federalists had supported the Navy over the army This is a reflection of Federalist ideology which sought to build a nation as a mercantile republic similar to Britain Especially post  Federalists often offered Lukewarm support for the army as it was increasingly viewed as a means of enforcing the embargo or preparing the nation for war against Britain  The Community One of the strongest similarities between Federalists and Whigs is the emphasis on the community in the development of an individual Both parties thought that it required a well developed and inter connected community to develop a republican citizen By contrast democrats tended to emphasize the individual over the community Respect for the rule of law Both Federalists and Whigs believed that the established rule of law had to be recognized Revolutions were  often met with alarm or welcoming caution at best For the Whigs this meant that Dorrs Rebellion and the revolutions of  were not embraced in the same way as Democrats triumphed the sovereignty of the people For Federalists the upper members of society had to be respected and any social revolution had to be put down  IE Alienamp Sedition ActsMost other issues tended to be more regional rather than party in origin or involved parties flip flopping ,0,cdkrocs,1r8tex,askhistorians,new,3,3

EdwardJamesAlmost,Garfields assassination was by a frustrated man looking for a post of federal patronage As Speaker of the House Garfield had assailed the practice of large scale uprooting of civil servants as reward for campaign support For whatever reason his assassin then blamed the new President when he did not surprise largely uproot civil servants and put him for example in comfortable federal posts Politicians became fearful of the implications and federal appointments became much less strict than the standards Garfield wanted to impose Simultaneously many of the previous patronage jobs became more and more subsumed by municipal machines and a single national figure was less likely or at least never was assassinated for this stated reason to take full public anger But patronage prior to Garfield had been an incredibly partisan and resentful affair leading to many of the local notables who campaigned one way or another to have incentives to do so Melville and Hawthorne even wrote about the system as a given in American business and politics in the sMcKinleys assassination was different He was shot by an ideological anarchist at a time when anarchism was ascendent on the American political fringe Labor riots had taken place commonly in the previous  years and in the following  other groups like the US Communist Party began to agitate The specter of McKinley really blew back in the Wilson administration after the Great War when Wall Street was bombed and the Bolshevik revolutions led to a Russian exit from the eastern front Major crackdowns against these distinct but seen as aligned political movements notably the Palmer Raids and the imprisonment of Eugene Debs as he mounted his futile th campaign for the presidency from the internationalist left,4,cdksg1x,1r8ulz,askhistorians,new,16,12

LIPCSB,The belief in some primordial Aryan Master Race came to prominence a short time after the IndoEuropean language family was discovered  Analysis of ancient sanskrit texts revealed that linguistically the peoples of Europe India and Iran draw from some cultural progenitor  This discovery was most clearly articulated in the late th century by Sir William Jones who reached this conclusion through his study of the Rig Veda  German romantics leaped onto the idea in their quest to find some mythical Pure Germany uncontaminated by foreign ways  The Germans Herder and Von Humboldt in particular propagated the idea that language and cultural identity were inseparable ideas  These ideas were further mixed with the ideas of Social Darwinism after On the Origin of Species was published  If the purest sense of Germany could be derived from the peasants folktales then the purest Germans must surely have been the first uncontaminated by mixture with lesser races  Thus was born the idea of the Aryan Master Race  The Rig Vedas authors described themselves as Aryan and so this was obviously the name of the oldest Germanswho obviously were blond blueeyed tall brilliant and generally the best people who ever lived  What was once a generally neutral field of cultural study mutated into a nationalist struggle to justify their own superiority by claiming the purest blood of Western Civilization  Jones and his contemporaries said the Aryans must have originated somewhere between Iran and the Himalayas  By the early th century German archaeologists were insisting that the Aryan homeland was obviously in Northern Germany  This is the basis for the idea of the Aryan race  Hitler might not have given the occultists the time of day but the idea of the Germans and Nordic people in general being of some superior unmixed stock was pretty mainstream  You didnt need to buy into occult claptrap to subscribe to the idea of German superiority by virtue of ancestral birthright  Source The Horse The Wheel and Language by David W AnthonyThat explains the terminology Aryan and why people cared because these were the first Germans obviously  The symbolism follows from thatswastikas were found in a lot of archaeological sites including Troy and are notoriously common in India  Obviously its a symbol of great importance to the Aryans  Its influence on German foreign policy comes down to a pseudoscientific belief in racial struggle between the Aryans and the nonAryan groups Slavs are obviously Asianyou can tell by their skulls was a common line of reasoning  German Aryans could only survive according to this narrative by wiping out their neighbors and taking their land  ,1,cdktaz3,1r8z41,askhistorians,new,5,4
EdwardJamesAlmost,I understand if this isnt a worthy top line response but the premise of measuring something amorphous like patriarchalism across time and geography seems to invite over generalizationsYes the Romans were strongly patriarchal However their female citizens retained a strong degree of influence and legal protection  immunity even from the standards of Europe  years later Meanwhile if you were to compare the Romans to say the Mongols of Genghis Khan I think you would find that the wife of a Senator or the daughter of one of the first families of Rome would have significantly more status than chattel  even if many maneuvers might have to be executed through a politically orchestrated marriage or other relatives and friendsI think the bad rap Rome has gotten compared to all societies ever in terms of patriarchy might owe more to the heavy documentation of their society rather than their oppressively punitive views of sex and gender roles,2,cdksset,1r8z5t,askhistorians,new,7,5

SamuelI,Yes there most certainly wereOne of the easiest ways to demonstrate this is by looking at the Battle of Hastings in  The army of Harold of Wessex had just made it to the south of England after fighting off a force sent from the Kingdom of Norway at Stamford Bridge His army was comprised almost entirely of infantry with the housecarls as his elite backbone They were a type of landedman that typically fought with a kiteshield and a large twohanded axe The majority of his forces however would have been levies armed with spears and shields The Normans under William of Normandy were a mixed force He had command of standard levy infantry various ranged units such as archers and javelinmen and cavalry The Gesta Guillelmi and the Bayeux Tapestry are two of our most important sources for this battleHarold of Wessex chose to implement what we now call the shield wall His troops stood in a tight formation and locked their shields together in order to better absorb an enemy attack thus making it easier for his housecarls to counterattack when his foes floundered William used his mixed force by applying his three types of soldiers intermittently in order to gain their maximum effectiveness Ranged units to begin infantry to assault cavalry to break them or should the infantry fail recoup losses on the field In fact it is commonly suggested that Harold of Wessex himself died of an arrow to the eye as the Bayeux Tapestry would seem to suggestIn the end William was victorious It was not because he possessed superior equipment that Harold did not have access to but rather because the military traditions and necessities of his army gave him an edge namely his mixed force Why they differed so much is a difficult question to answer We have multiple accounts from Bede to those of Alfred the Great that describe AngloSaxon battles and the way they were fought The shield wall and housecarl were ingrained into their culture and were how they were accustomed to fighting battles However Normandy and William produced something different Horseman and archers were apparently more necessary to his success in securing Normandy under his rule In doing so he found a set of strategies and soldiers that were sound against most armies of the day largely static infantry armies He found something worked and he implemented it Culture and necessity came together to generate a winning combination,0,cdkz3wt,1r91wv,askhistorians,new,7,7

riskbreaker,ukoinelingua was absolutely correct in that other thread and there is a very simple answer to your question No we dont have anything that survives which can authentically be attributed to MuhammadWith that said the early Arabic historical tradition attributes all sorts of letters or statements from Muhammad to other rulers or leaders in the Near East during his lifetime But there are numerous problems with these early Arabic sources namely that none of them are written down until centuries after the lifetime of the Prophet Thats not to say that we dont find material that is very likely authentic in this tradition  we certainly do But it does mean that we dont have any actual letters that were written by Muhammad or his scribes which survive Edit To talk just a bit more about this why would a letter be falsely attributed to Muhammad In some instances like the letter in the initial question it would be in order to gain benefitshttpwwwredditcomrChristianitycommentsrwmforgottenhistoryprophetmuhammadsawletterstocdlxo when it came to taxation protection or similar Sometimes the Arabic tradition also records things like Muhammad writing a letter to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius inviting him to embrace Islam and no harm would come to the Byzantines Depending on the source Heraclius can react differently to the letter My favorite reaction is one found in alAzdīs Futūḥ alShām where he personally wants to convert but his advisers suggest he shouldnt Once the Byzantine army is crushed at Yarmūk Heraclius is deeply angry at his advisers since he didnt want to fight them anywaySo why create a story like this Because it presents the Prophet very positively and these authors who are writing so much later than the lifetime of the Prophet present him as they imagine he must have been like deeply religious fair saintly  a paragon of virtue He is their final Prophet after all And thematically including a letter like this suggests that the conquests were only necessary because the true message was ignored Fighting didnt have to happen  Islam was open to everyone who committed to its tenants and the Byzantine and Sasanian rulers ignored the call and were punished for it ,1,cdl3sv5,1r9aog,askhistorians,new,21,20

modeled upon traditional hunting methods from Northeast Asia in which  hunters would surround a large mass of forest and slowly drive the encircled game to the center In essence the system grouped the many diverse peoples from Nurhacis rapid conquests of Northeast Asia into cohesive loyal military units Previously Nurhacis armies were plagued by factionalism tribalbased loyalties and old family feuds The Banner System cut through these traditions and placed each soldier in a military unit ruled by headsman that was unwavering in their loyalty to Nurhaci alone In this way Nurhaci overcame tribalism to create an army over whom his command was absolute A soldiers position in his Banner was permanent and hereditary It expanded beyond the military and into his daily life as the families in a Banner provided soldiers to fill the unit so too did the Banners bureaucracy provide for the familys daily needs The system in those early days created a highly militarized and decisively loyal military in a time where Nurhaci might otherwise have been plagued by crippling decentralization and lineage based command structuresInitially there were only four banners the Yellow White Red and Blue In  Nurhaci expanded the system to include a total of Eight Banners having added the Bordered Yellow Bordered White Bordered Red and Bordered Blue Banners In the s Hong Taiji Nurhacis successor separated the Banners along ethnic lines As a result distinct Mongol and Manchu Banners were created By  after the conquest of Liaodong Han Chinese banners were created as well often called the hanjun or martial Han banners As a result By  when the Qing seized Beijing the Eight Banners were actually  different banners the Manchu Red the Mongolian Bordered White the Hanjun Blue etc etc etc In terms of numbers the Hanjun Banners were the largest by far and the Mongolian units were certainly the smallest The Banner System caused the three ethnic groups to grow ethnically and culturally closer over the course of the dynasty and fostered within all of them a common Manchu identity despite their respective Han Mongolian or Jurchen originsThe size of the Banner System was surprisingly large During the conquest beginning in  The Manchu Armys adult male population not including slaves was around  By the early th th century the total Banner Population including wives and families who were also important member of the Banner Systems social structure numbered at least  million and perhaps as high as  million Geographically the Banner population was concentrated in Beijing  Northeast China  and throughout the garrisons of their Empire Despite their impressive size and growth the Banners were too small to maintain security within their domain As a result the Qing relied on the Green Standard units to maintain stability This was possible owing to the units immense size Throughout the Dynasty the Green Standard armies were about three times the size of their Eight Banner counterparts Ethnicity was a primary difference between the Green Standard and Eight Banner units Although there were exceptions the soldier in the Green Standard units were almost exclusively Han Chinese Bannermen could become officers in Green Standard units but almost exclusively soldiered for the Eight Banners Whats more the Green Standard were simply an enlistment based unit This was in contrast to the intricate Banner System which went far beyond just a military unit Whereas the Banners were a hereditary socialmilitary unit that managed every aspect of its members lives from cradle to grave the Green Standard were simple term based enlistment unitsEDIT I should clarify that there is a distinct difference between the Han Chinese that filled the ranks of the Green Standard infantry and the Martial Han or Hanjun members of the Han Banners The Hanjun were descendants of the large populations of Han outside the Ming state that were integrated into the Manchu state prior to the conquest of the Ming Their early entrance into the Qing at a time when manpower was sorely needed spurred the creation of Eight additional Hanjun banners After there entrance into the Eight Banners these Hanjun increasingly diverged from the cultural practices and identities of the Han Chinese throughout China proper As stated above Hanjun naturally forged a common Manchu identity with the members of the Mongol and Manchu banners over time though they forever remained second class bannermen in the eyes of the Mongols and Manchus The Han Chinese throughout China would also label the Hanjun as ManchusBibliography Mark C Elliot The Manchu Way The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China  Ibid  Ibid  Ibid n,3,cdkxq1g,1r9bmg,askhistorians,new,22,19
backgrinder,Fire ships Its borderline for you since its really a tactical innovation But fire ships could be a massive leveler Henry Morgan used fire ships and deception at Maracaibo when he was trapped in an inland lagoon by a Spanish fleet He was laughably outgunned the Spanish fleets tender a  gun ship had as many cannon as his flagship Morgans vessels were small and configured to carry men and loot not weapons platforms The Spanish had  heavy galleons that should have destroyed him but he turned his flagship into a fireship and destroyed the Spanish fleet  As far as your other examples they are all good but they all probably require a little context None of them are super weapons in the sense of using machine guns against cavemen armed with rocks and sticks The Macedonian phalanx was strong but in battle after battle it was Alexanders cavalry that broke the Persians Stirrups and bows were useful inventions but the Mongols were able to defeat enemy after enemy by their aggressive and innovative use of mobility and flexible battlefield tactics The longbow at Agincourt deserves its reputation but that battle may have turned as much on weather as the bow torrential rains so soaked the field that the French could not maintain their standard combined arms doctrine and had to advance piecemeal with their cavalry uncovered by their own bows and infantry For super weapons to work they have to be paired with ingenious new tactics developed to maximize their advantage and used effectively in battlefield conditions ,2,cdkwwpi,1r9bpm,askhistorians,new,14,12

Tiako,As unemtrif says Marcus Aurelius was actually the first of the emperors to have a legitimate heir All the others were forced by sheer biological necessity to adopt a son and perhaps because all of them were really rather clever men they tended to favor other rather clever men It was an enormous stroke of good luck for the empireRemember that as much as it is often said that Rome had no clear line of succession it tended to give very clear favoritism to biological descent This makes for a rather complicated dissonance with the rather pragmatic ideology of the empire that tended to emphasize the emperor as an individual suited to the post by his individual qualities This tended to lead to a great deal of murder and civil war and the like but at least there were only a handful of boykings,2,cdkzlaq,1r9clu,askhistorians,new,21,19

reddripper,I think you are mistaken There are plenty of similar fortifications in other places apart from in EuropeIn Arabia we have city fortification usually topped with a stronghold called alqasr which survived as placenames in Iberia as Alcazar In oasis local Arab clans built castles called qasbah as a secure living place that function exactly like European castles as it was used as refugee in times of nomads raids The Arabs also build fortified caravanserai to secure trade route the best surviving of them are in Jordan Fortifications in Arab worlds both built by local families or by ruling dynasties is today an important tourist destination in Morocco Yemen and OmanIn China apart from the famous Great Wall all major cities had fortification The city wall in Xian is now one of well preserved In Northern China as most population during premodern era lived in big cities local strongholds are rare as the fortifications efforts were mostly directed toward the building of city walls However in Southern China where many people lived in hard to reach villages and where conflict between clans or ethnic groups were common for example HakkaPunti war the local clan built rounded communal houses which provide protections against rival clans attacks This rounded houses are called tulou 土楼Also I dont suppose I need to mention the well documented prevalence of Japanese castles that is used by the local daimyo during the shogunates  The Japanese also built several of this type of fortifications in Korea during their failed invasion,0,cdky79t,1r9ine,askhistorians,new,12,12

Rabbits,Thanks for the gold whomever I do appreciate the sentiment but theres betterhttpwwwnahaincorg useshttpwwwprojectcureorg for your moneyTo take your questions in reverse orderSan Juan de Tenochtitlan as it was known in the early colonial era was not fortified during the early period of Spanish rule It was in fact widely depopulated and almost abandoned in the first few decades after the Conquest Notably Cortés opted to base himself in nearby CuauhnahuacCuernavacahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPalaceofCortCAsCuernavaca Tenochtitlan at the end of the  month siege by the combined forces of the Tlaxcalans Texcocoans Spanish and other indigenous groups was virtually destroyed In part this was a result of the Mexica themselves tearing up the city to build barricades and breastworks as the siege wore on but was largely a result of the SpanishIndian tactics during the latter part of the siegeThe SiegeThe Siege of Tenochtitlan really had two phases a long hard slog across the causeways onto the city proper and the subsequent advance of the allied forces across the city forcing the Mexica back into a defensive position in Tenochtitlans sister city Tlatelolco Heres a maphttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsthumbeeTenochtitlanmediumpngpxTenochtitlanmediumpng to help with the making of sense of thingsThe causeway portion of the siege was mostly typified by a catandmouse game between the brigantines the Spanish shipbuilder Martín López had put together that such an expert was on the expedition at all was a huge boon to the Spanish see their attempt at building a catapult The Mexica used ambush tactics and placed stakes in the shallow waters of Lake Texcoco to restrict the movement of the deeper draft brigantines Bernal Díaz del Castillo who accompanied Cortés and ended up writing what is the definitive Conquistador account best describes the early part of the causeway slog thuslygt When we left a bridge or barricade unguarded after having captured it with much labour the enemy would retake and deepen it that same night and construct stronger defencesEventually though the combined forces of the Spanish and the numerous indigenous allies ground down the Mexica and the Spanish reached the outskirts of the city The problem the Spanish faced in the streets of Tenochtitlan was that they were unable to effectively deploy their most powerful weapons cavalry and they were also open ambushes and attack from the rooftops of buildings They solved this problem via the tactics they had developed on the causeways filling in canals and pulling down buildings Essentially the Spanish and their allies systematically destroyed the city as they advanced across it This passage again from BDdC is from when the Spanish were still advancing across the causeway but contemplating how to further their advance into the city It shows the debate of tactics and which ones were ultimately adopted since Cortés ended up suffering a huge defeat and almost getting captured by not following the advice belowgt  Some of us said it was not good avice to or a good idea to intrude ourselves so entirely into the heart of the City but we should remain as we were fighting and pulling down and levelling the housesQuick PostSiege WrapUpAfter Cuauhtemoc was captured the immediate war against the Mexica essentially ended though resistance by both Mexica loyalists and groups not wishing to transfer the allegiance continued The twin city of TenochtitlanTlatelolco however was devastated The main aqueduct into the city had been cut early in the siege a smallpox epidemic had ravaged the population and the siege itself took place during harvest time which meant that the urban population of Tenochtitlan was unable to get the rural agrarian products on which it relied The city was a starving thirsty razed and pestilent wasteland in other words Heres BDdC againgt I have read about the destruction of Jerusalem but I know not for certain if there was a greater mortality than this for the greater number of the warriors from all the provinces and towns subject to Mexico who had crowded in to the city most of them died and as I have already said thus the land and the lake and the palisades were all full of dead bodies and it stank so much that no one could endure itThe Spanish would eventually rebuild the Chapultepec aqueduct only to let it fall into disrepair and make some other efforts to restore the city but it would be centuries before it achieved the population level it had during the PreHispanic period Part of this had to do with the destruction andor abandonment of indigenous hydraulic controls which in the seasonally flooded Valley of Mexico led to some catastrophic events that almost caused the city itself to be abandoned I wrote a little more indepth about this in a previous posthttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsjxsqwhatwasthenativemexicanreactiontothecbjulsThere was really no threat of invasion though While the final battle between the Mexica and the NativeSpanish forces is often lumped together as the Siege of Tenochtitlan there were skirmishes and battles happening around the Lake Texcoco basin The fall of the concentrated Mexicaaligned forces in Tlatelolco however was a significant enough blow to the loyalist forces both in morale and real terms to make resistance to the imposition of a new regime moot Cuitlahuac who preceded Cuauhtemoc for a few weeks before succumbing to smallpox had actually made it a policy to condense the leadership of tributary states into Tenochtitlan There are some interesting political reasons for this which are beyond the scope of your questions but suffice to say that the fall of Tenochtitlan marked the end of real resistance The Spanish had allied themselves with enough indigenous powers that they jointly controlled a significant amount of the Valley of Mexico even before the SiegeThere were no Chichimec invasions or even a threat The Aztecs themselves were really the result of Chichimec migrationsinvasions in the centuries after the fall of Teotihuacan By the Aztec Imperial period though early th Century the region had sufficiently stabilized and urbanized to make the introgressions of seminomads from the North a moot point Far more pertinent were the surrounding state actors like the Tarascans and Mixtec who focused on their own sovereignty following the collapse of the political order and widespread pestilence rather than devising plans to conquer the Valley of MexicoPreHispanic FortificationsI actually wrote an entire post about PostClassic Mesoamerican siegeshttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentscoefsiegewarfareinprecolombusamericashowcixzh The takeaway is that siege warfare was not a particularly prevalent part of the Aztec period and its immediate forebearers Wars were instead fought with vast numbers of troops drafted from the general population on a kind of seasonal basis When the dry season ie Winter rolled around armies would march When the wet season resumed those same troops would be needed for agricultural work Siege warfare did occur as I note in the previous post but the real duty of prolonged warfare fell to professional warriors ie the nobility during xochiyaoyotin Flower Wars These more ritualistic and governed combats allowed the professional warrior classes of the nobility to hone their skills achieve status and honor through taking captives and slowly grind down less extensive enemies just as in a siege For further reading on this since its a bit of a tangent at this point I would recommend Hassigs Aztec Warfare which is literally the book on the subject Answering Your Question FinallyTenochtitlan was guarded not by walls but by men and lots of water One thing to keep in mind about the rise of the Mexica is that is was explosive In the early s they were vassals to the Tepanecs on the Western shore of Lake Texcoco By the mid s they had subjugated or allied with the entirety of the Basin of Mexico and were expanding outward That the Aztec Empire was truly an alliance between the dominant group on the Western shores of Texcoco the Tepanecs and the dominant group on the Eastern shores of Texcoco the Acolhua with an upstart military power on an island between them explains a great deal What it explains in this case is the lack of massive fortifications in Tenochtitlan proper The city really expanded only after it had already secured the support of the biggest military and political powers in the region its threats were beyond the Valley of Mexico not necessarily within it And even when domestic conflicts arose the fact that Tenochtitlan was located on an island accessible only by canoe or causeway and that it grew to be the largest polity in the region by far meant that routes to attack it were limited and its best defense was its people Note above that Cortés main obstacle was simply making across the causeways to the city which had been ravaged by disease dehydration and hunger This is not to say the city was completely defenseless The causeways themselves had sections would could be removed and towers and strong points which could be manned by troops Tenochtitlan however was a city of canals not walls It was surrounded by both allies and a lake It was the combination of regional revolt along with introduced diseases that worked to bring it down Carrasco trans  used throughout People who selfidentified as sharing a common homeland in Aztlan which includes both the Triple Alliance of the Mexica Acolhua and Tepanecs as well as other

Astrogator,That is an extremely convoluted and complicated question if simply for the fact that the Romans conquered a ton of native civilizations over more than five centuries First your question is already making a few assumptions for example that the Romans were being less advanced than the civilizations they conquered They were evidently more advanced militarily if they could conquer as many of them as they did just for a start There are so many cultural and social differences between the people that became part of the Roman Empire that it is really useless to make such a claim in the first place Then how would you measure advancement How would you measure destruction of advancement Knowledge in general doesnt easily get destroyed And the Romans were pretty good assimilators The most amazing thing to me is that they managed to mold it all into an Empire in the first place The institutions were simply not there when the Empire expanded as rapidly as it did during the two centuries around the year  They had to find new ways of administrating the conquered territories and to integrate them and in the beginning they often failed evidenced by the countless local revolts The Pannonians then part of Illyricum after being freshly conquered revolted every year for ten years straight until the Romans could pacify them Generally established political and economic structures where they already existed were kept after conquest integrating the local established elite into the new provincial organization quickly making them Roman citizens and thus depriving possible resistance groups of leadership ideally of course Those leaders could in time rise to equestrian or senatorial rank Others acquired citizenship by service in the auxiliary troops and many did Being part of the Empire meant a rise in opportunities for a lot of people particularly as soldiers or traders The amazing thing is that by the end of the second century AD all these natives had become Romans after a fashion some more some less quickly and by  every freeborn inhabitant of the Empire became a cives Romanus by decree of the Emperor The nature of this process is debated It has been seen as a process of Rome imposing her values on newly conquered natives making them Roman stressing the active Roman part Other interpretations influenced by postcolonialism have put the natives in the foreground stressing the process of emulation and mutual influence of the different cultural traditions evident for example in Religion where Romans added local deities into their pantheon interpretatio romana The debate has not ended and there are a lot more nuances to consider To the matter of improving lives Ill again talk about Pannonia Before the Romans came it was the place of devastating wars and tribal feuds When the Boii a celctic tribe who had carved themselves a little empire on the lower Danube around modern Bratislava and Vienna were defeated by the Dacian king Burebista in the first century they were defeated so resoundingly that their empire vanished they became subject to the neighbouring Norii and their lands became known to Pliny as the boian desert deserta boiorum The Boii themselves had only come to Pannonia from Bohemia after evading the pressure of Germanic tribes from the north This is an example of Rome really bringing pax romana a measure of stability Those people had been roving around Central Europe for two centuries I think they might have welcomed a period of safety and prosperity There is the simple rise of material culture during Roman times in the archaeological record that directly shows a rise in prosperity Houses cities being built coins hoarded decorations made beautiful villae being built in the countryside and so on Theres no saying whether it generally improved the lives of the conquered Many died during the conquest many more died in revolts There was a lot more social mobility and while evidence for upwards mobility is easy to come by there is circumstantial evidence for downward mobility as well The trend to set messages in stone soared during the first and second centuries possibly marking a desire to set ones achievements in stone as well showing a sense of insecurity guarding them against possible future misfortunes People were proud of having become Roman citizens proud of having become successful soldiers traders priests mayors magistrates or otherwise members of the local elite Others were proudly showing off their cultural heritage in a new Roman context wearing their traditional clothes or ornaments women often more so than the men In some places the Romans learned new technologies and cultural practices from those they conquered in some they brought things that had never been seen before In the East Latin never replaced Greek as the lingua franca and hellenic cultural tradition was always dominant over Romes But Id say they surely improved the lives of some maybe the majority After reading your question again I think your discussion partner might hace been talking about the myth surrounding the burning of the library of Alexandria since that one is pretty popular Hereshttpwwwredditcomrbadhistorycommentsnqrlcarlsaganthelibraryofalexandriaandthe a pretty amusing deconstruction of a particular version of that myth In short there was no major loss of knowledge in

KingofMen,gt apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order what have the Romans done for us I know joke answers are not permitted but Im making a serious point as was the movie The Romans really did build a lot of infrastructure In Britain their roads were still in use because after some centuries of entropy they were still the best ones around as late as the reign of King Alfred Infrastructure tends to be underrated but its really important They also put down bandits and pirates and made the Med plus Britain into a single trade zone for the first time consider all the benefits of globalisation without the problems caused by it happening in a single century and not giving people time to adjust Its true that the Romans were unlikely to introduce much technology per se to a conquered people but thats not the only form of being advanced There was a hell of a lot of capital investment going on which likely would not have occurred in the patchwork of tribes and cities that you presumably get in the counterfactual world where Rome did not exist I suggest that in measuring improved lives scholarship tends to be highly overrated partly because the people doing the rating are themselves scholars The average peasant was perhaps not likely to care whether the Romans introduced a lot of new philosophy or not in fact he was unlikely to hear about it if they did On the other hand a road that would let him bring his produce to the big market in town for a much improved price  not to mention participating in a money economy so he could buy stuff from the other side of the Med  that was a big visible improvement ,0,cdldndx,1r9mqu,askhistorians,new,2,2

Irishfafnir,The movie is generally speaking taken accurately from the book Many of the scenes that are added are for sake of time or for Hollywood  the stabbing on the slave ship for instance The only major change that I disagreed with is in regards to Fords character In the movie Solomon reveals to Ford that he is a freeman which Ford character does nothing about In reality Solomon never revealed his former status to Ford and in fact says something to the fact that he later thought Ford would have freed him had he been aware Personally I think the actual version of events would have been better even for Hollywood especially because of the sharp contrast with Epps Outside of that just keep in mind that slavery differed wildly from locale to locale,0,cdl01tc,1r9orx,askhistorians,new,7,7
bettinafairchild,I recommend you check out the version of  Years a Slave that is edited by Dr Sue Eakin This is a historian whose lifes work was studying this book She researched and fact checked everything and provides a lot of backstory to events So about  extra pages are in that version  The book is extremely close to the movie Most of what happened was verified A few things the scholars questioned was that they didnt think that slaves in that area were regularly whipped to the extent described in the book since it would detract from their value and decrease the amount of work they were able to do But this doesnt mean they werent whipped really severely even being whipped to death The severe whipping that the slave Patsey is subjected to in the movie is straight from the book and theres no reason to doubt it is true as described There are plenty of instances of slaves being whipped to death in the historical record and weve got lots of photos of slaves whose backs are covered in whipping scars Far crueler though was the separation of family members such as are seen with the slave Eliza and her  children Randall and Emily in the movie In real life the mother never saw her children again and died of grief around  years after separation ,0,cdl2l59,1r9orx,askhistorians,new,3,3
lukeweiss,What stuff are you referring to What kind of manufacturing and whenFrom the th Century onward China was the single largest manufacturing economy in the world with Porcelain and rawfinished silks leading the way The silk industry was mostly household but the Porcelains were often produced in massive factories and could be gathered easily for export as exemplified in the Zheng He voyages If you are referring to any of the intervening time andor the modern day the answers stem from the Song Dynasty period referenced above   So how do we answer your questions Well here goes    Population to make a lot of stuff you need a lot of people Chinas population has been the largest under one organized government for about  years with small interruptions that grew lesser over the centuries By  CE the population was around million  we are talking twice that Some dips due to plague and wars only delayed the inevitable  th century Ming populations were around million and the Qing began their reign over a population of roughly million from  this population as much as doubled Thats right the population of China in  was pretty close to that of the US TODAY So lots of people lots of potential   Commerce ingenuity entrepreneurship  China underwent what several economic historians have described as not one but two commercial revolutions The first took place under the Song in the thth centuries The Song were the first to successfully use fiat money which didnt last forever but still cash money in the th century One of the other elements of most dynastic governments was lowtax relatively laissefaire economic policy Sure there were occasionally government industriesmonopolies but they were fewer and fewer as time went on For instance Ming officials set up a taxation depository for all salt produced in the empire Salt would pour in to the depots then would be picked up by private distributors the government pulling in their tax haul in the process This was no small endeavor with all but three provinces producing salt in some form or another at the time   Anyway most industries were small and nongovernmental many untaxed andor regulated What this meant was an explosion with the population bursts in all three of the last dynasties of commerce In the Song the big new thing was Champa rice and the big cultural thing was book culture printing and champa rice were introduced around the same time at the end of the th century In the Ming there was the burst of international trade and later the influx of new world crops The Qing saw the full flowering of new world crops and also saw the malthusian rise to  or so and fall  crisis that inevitably followed   Throughout all this you have this incredible ingenius flow of new goods and technologies from mining to fired goods to arms and artillery to paper household furniture etc etc etc With low government oversight and the emergence of national markets for goods we are talking about lots and lots and lots of diverse stuff made by lots of diverse people   This is the smithian dream A government that focuses on infrastructure and lowtargetted taxation An economy dominated by small businesses with national market outlook Pretty incredible   Anyway that leads us to the last  years What happened to China that we think the last  are anomolous    Well there was the major crisis of about   loss of crops wars famine bad policy lost wars with Britain and Japan several times etc etc etc Then there was some upsurge quickly knocked to the side by Mao and the great leap This caused the famine that informed all of our opinions about china who grew up in the ss  poor starving china   But then a funny thing happened  the party decided to revert to dynastic economic practices to a certain extent They unleashed the economic forces that lay dormant for almost two generations The result  you guessed it  lots and lots of stuff,1,cdl59wp,1r9wht,askhistorians,new,4,3

Spinoza, Stunned to be given such importance Most people dont think historiography really matters I think to a considerable degree the reverse is true A living person is guaranteed a certain minimal level of scrutiny and care while a person dead especially long dead can be used to tell whatever story youre trying to tell regardless of the exact facts of his life Sometimes a person can have so many secrets that it might be safer to write a true history of them later without fears of repercussions So there might indeed be a chilling effect of litigation and prosecution that people would try to avoid But the problems of looking back through time in my opinion are more severe than that And in the digital age anonymous publication should not be a problem  It definitely has had an effect As a teacher I was often conscious that my statements should not be too controversial regardless of what I believed But political interpretations way heavy on some events of the past as well Topics like the holocaust crusades labor union movement in the US the Civil War are as capable of stirring up political controversy as the life of a living figure like George BushAltogether I think its a cop out whether he is aware of that or not If any human can judge his fellow man fairly and accurately its his contemporaries If we had the choice of another contemporary biography of Charlemagne or another book written a hundred years after his death surely all of us would choose the new contemporary source in a heartbeat,0,cdl4xmc,1r9ys7,askhistorians,new,12,12
rakony,He makes an interesting point While complete objectivity concerning history is impossible proximity to events especially events which are heavily politicised and still affect many living people massively increases the historians bias Thus something which happened longer ago can be judged more impartially although bias can never be completely eliminated and we usually face documentary constraints which could create unconscious bias if certain sets of sources are gain undue weightThat said I we can still make our own judgements about him now although we must also try and examine our possible motives for reaching the conclusion we do Also I still think hell be judged as a disaster,1,cdl5icz,1r9ys7,askhistorians,new,6,5
Dominicanes,This may not be the type of response youre looking for but your inquiry reminded me of a moment from my undergrad years  My professor a Dominican priest was discussing the canonization process  He said that the Church waits to start the process until the subject is safely dead  So he was approaching the topic from a bit of a different angle  Basically their legacy could not be determined until they had no more opportunities to screw up  Personally I have never really been concerned about objectivity  Basically since we are each raised in a particular culture we have certain cultural blinders that are nearly impossible to remove  Even if we could you cant be able to look at a subject with all of the viewpoints possible  My view is that disclosed backgrounds and biases is the way to go  If a historian does good research and provides their sources I can do the work of determining how much his or her argument is influenced by their bias,0,cdl4vx7,1r9ys7,askhistorians,new,5,5
rosemary,Here I was imagining Ambarenya was going to answer this and then I see youre the one that posted itTo get a really authoritative answer to this youd probably need to ask someone like Geoff Horrocks directly Until I started reading up on this question my understanding had been that from late antiquity onwards the phonology of Greek was essentially the same as Modern Greek That would make  κατάφρακτοι  kaTAfraktee Ῥωμαίοι  roMEHeeBut for each diphthong it turns out you need to do a separate check to see how and when its pronunciation changed Allens Vox Graeca has this to say about οι p gt οι ampnbsp Here also a diphthongal pronunciation is clearly indicated at least until Roman times At a later date οι became confused with υ thus c  AD ποιανεψιωνα  πυανεψιωνα indicating a pronunciation ū for bothThis reduces the question to how υ was pronounced in any given period At p  Allen tells us that confusion between υ and ι started fairly early on  they were already confused in IndoGreek coins by the nd century BCE but only because IndoAryan didnt have a rounded front vowel and even in the th cent BCE we find ἥμυσυ for ἥμισυ in one inscription But he finds these to be isolated cases and concludes that υ was still not fully equivalent to ι until at least after the th cent CE because WulfilaUlfilas was still using y to transliterate Greek υ at that date He goes on p gt Confusion of υ with ι is first occasionally found in Egyptian papyri of the  c AD but this is probably a regional peculiarity and the eventual change of ü to i seems not to be general until around the end of the millennium The Byzantine naming of the letter as ὗ ψιλόν still suggests a pronunciation ü for ψιλός is commonly used by Byzantine writers as the opposed term to δίφθογγος and so in this case to distinguish the spelling υ from οι which had come to have the same phonetic value cf p  on ἒ ψιλόν and not from ιSo the upshot seems to be that perhaps until the time of Photios or thereabouts οι was pronounced identically to υ but both were still distinguished from ι That is ι was unrounded but οιυ was still at least somewhat roundedEdit Ive taken a look at Horrocks Greek a history of the language and hes in good agreement with Allen though his book is a lot harder to find your way around because its arranged chronologically rather than by topic At p  he mentions in passing the merger of οι and υ in the Roman era and at p  he writesgt The shift of y gt i already apparent in some substandard varieties in the ancient world was probably completed for all speakers of mainstream dialects by the thth century see Macharadze  for the evidence of Georgian loans and cf Browning   The major exception is provided by TsakonianEdit  The above only deals with one part of your question of course Can I leave it to you to look at the books I mentioned for the other points In particular Ill mention that the phonetic value of β in Byzantine Greek is a bit hazy it was used to transcribe Latin b of course but sometimes also v eg Malalas is already writing Vergils name as Βεργίλλιος by the th century cf Οὐαλέριος for Valerius perhaps this really reflects variance in the Latin pronunciation of v though I dont know when it lost the value b in Modern Greek b is usually represented by μπ,2,cdl4kra,1ra00f,askhistorians,new,10,8

archaeontologist,The huge stores Target Walmart etc that we all know and love today are the offspring of the department store which as a phenomena really began to appear in Great Britain France and the United States in the s and s Huge stores need both  relatively cheap mass produced goods to fill them and  a growing social class with the means and patterns of consumption to support them The first of these requirements was enabled by the industrial revolution and novel technologies for producing and distributing goods at remarkable pacesprices The second is a result of the rising bourgeois society of midth c Western Europe a class whose disposable income and consumption habits concerned not only with necessity but also with fashion amp novelty enabled the retail revolution of the department storesThus the rise of the department store was both an economic and a social development beginning in the midth century centered around W Europes new practices of production distribution and consumption Thats about all I know  I wish I could tell you more as its a really fascinating subjectI can however recommend a work of fiction that can give you insight into this period Émile Zola The Ladies Paradise Berkeley University of California Press This novel published in  is a story of commercial triumph chronicling just this topic  the rise of the Parisian department store Zola is well known today for his more political naturalist works on coal miners etc and his role in the Dreyfus affair However this lesserknown novel has recently gained a healthy amount of attention for its depictions of consumer capitalism and bourgeois life in the midth century  this latest edition from the University of California Press has a fantastic introduction written by Kristin Ross the literary critic and French cultural historian also the author of the excellent The Emergence of Social Space Rimbaud and the Paris Commune and Fast Cars Clean Bodies Decolonization and the Reordering of French Culture both of which I thoroughly recommend  ,1,cdl7a5a,1ra0wg,askhistorians,new,10,9

LordSariel,Hi As I am flaired in the subject I figured I would chime in Despite the upper comment having over  karma it misses the deeply ideological justification of Napoleons exile and the subsequent implications that had on the development of both Europe and France in the th CenturyQuite frankly Napoleon was exiled because the execution of monarchs was taboo Exile was the most common form of punishment for aristocrats since the Middle Ages simply because it avoided the messy political problems of having to kill someone important Galvanizing any resistance movement creating a martyr establishing a dangerous precedent etc However both of Napoleons exiles mark a diversion from the surety with which this taboo was enforced Improved technology and increased speeds of communication had begun to invalidate the distance and thus security and effectiveness provided through exileIn the case of Napoleon this is an especially important note because his exile is a tacit admission of his status and clout However it is always a controversial topic because he technically was not a noble by birth or blood and could have been killed like any other insurrectionary leader However he was crowned emperor by the Pope So it leads into understandably complex waters about his political status and whether or not he meets the requisite protections of the ruling statusquoIn deciding his fate the Congress of Vienna was very conscious of the implications that his legacy would have upon the development of France so recently removed from their Revolutionary Spirit of the s They ultimately decided to try and avoid making Napoleon into a martyr and exiled him In doing so however the European nations essentially reaffirmed the values of meritocracy by which Napoleon rose to the title of Emperor when they treated him as an equal instead of as a lowborn peasant As a result Napoleon did not simply fade from memory with distance but rather became enshrined in the glorious memory of the revolutionary era that remained a pervasive ideology in French Society until the start of the th century,24,cdlbgtd,1ra1oe,askhistorians,new,218,194

vonadler,Generally things were in Malmö as they were in the rest of Sweden  tense at times relaxed at timesAt the time there was no brigde and few that worked on the other side of the Sound Those that did were mostly involved in ferry traffic coastal shipping or fishingHow would life look in Malmö Lets take a lookAs the war broke out on the rd of September  Sweden declared itself neutral and the Prime Minister PerAlbin Hansson of the Social Democrats declared in a speech on the radio that our readiness is good Which was a lie concerning the military but true regarding food and raw materials Generally most people in Sweden expected a repetition of ww which had left the Nordic countries with exception of Finland towards the end untouched The problems facing Sweden then had been the British blockade a lack of food and raw materials creating hunger and unemployment combined with a political fight for universal suffrage and parliamentarism that almost ended up in a revolution  the situation was much better The framework of neutral shipping through the blockade had been agreed upon with both the British and the Germans and a small number of merchant vessels  in total were allowed through bringing in much needed meat and grain from Canada USA Brazil and Argentina primarily oil from Venezuela and a small amount of tobacco from USA and some other goods  ships were sunk by both sides mostly by mines during this traffic There were also large stockpiles of food raw materials and other goods in storage in SwedenMalmö was and is the rd largest city of Sweden and an industrial and economical centre Malmö was also the centre of the fledgling and pretty pathetic Swedish nazi movement Gunnar Sträng social democrat and future Minister of Finance recounts meeting a bunch of nazis at a hotel and noting that when making death lists while rowdy and quite drunk prominent social democrats ended up on the list AFTER prominent nazis of the competing party The various nazi groups gathered  of the vote  which was the best result they managed to get Generally the city was dominated by the social democratsGenerally the Swedes never forgave the Germans for their invasion of Denmark and Norway and the willingness to defend the country against a German invasion was very highThe rationing was hard during the war and dropped to its lowest point in autumn  when it consisted ofPer day allowanceg meat and porkg sugarg cheeseg fat oil butter cream etcg coffeeg flourOne also gets  eggs per monthVegetables milk  fat potatoes wild game fish fruit and berries were never rationed However vegetables are impossible to get out of season and mostly consists of what can be grown locally  turnips cabbage and carrots with some cucumbers and tomatoes thrown in Milk and potatoes are readily available Wild game is only available during the hunting season and in limited supply  you had to know a hunter to get any Fish was available as long as the sea was open which was  months a year depending on if you were in the Baltic or North Sea and which of the hard war winters it was and you were reasonable close to the coast Fruit was available during the season and only locally grown  mostly pears and apples but also some cherries Berries you had to pick yourself in seasonScania would have decent access to Baltic fish and to fruit pear and apple orchards are common but far less wild game and berries than other parts of the country Noncoupon food became common Eating badger fox or crow stew at the restaurant since it counted as wild game and was not rationed was not uncommonHaving a friend at a farm could allow you to buy meat and other food that had been sneaked away from the ration system  the black market thrived There were also a substantial market for trading rations  thsoe that did not smoke often traded away their tobacco ration to those that did for clothes food coffee or other rationsAll rubber and petroleum products were reserved for the military and most cars were confined to storage Some ran their cars on produced gas burning charcoal and using wooden tires So did much of the army and the air force ran its older planes on a  ethanol  gasoline mix and castor oil for lubrication I have met a ground technician who worked on the light bombers running this mix and he stated that the castor oil fermented in the hot engine and smelled so bad the pilots puked in the cockpit His laconic statement was Those planes were no fun to work onAlcohol was rationed since before the war A man could get up to  litre of brännvin vodka per month Weak beer  could be had at shops or restaurants while stronger beer was only available by doctors note from a drugstore At a restaurant one could only have strong spirits with food two whites and a brown which meant two cl vodka shots and cl of cognac with the coffee Weak grog was also available cl of vodka or cognac mixed with cl of soft drink or fizzy water max two per visit It was common to send the food called the paragraph sandwhich back and get the money back after ordering It is said the same portion of food could be served hundreds of times during one evening Women had half the ration on everything compared to menPeople biked and walked far more and the city was under curfew or blackdown meaning that accidents were more common Crime also went upSocially it was a time of upheaval The unemployment which had existed before the war dissapeared practically overnight To replace coal and coke which could only be had in limited supply from Germany as opposed to liberal and cheap from Britain before the war charcoal was made in enormous quantities and the cities filled up with large piles of firewood  armies of men and regiments of women to handle cooking and cleaning for a work team travelled to the forests to cut down the trees needed for this Large amounts of men were called into the army  In May    men were in the field in September    The army never had less than   men called in during any time of the war Add local defence meets small exersises for the older soldiers home guard training and the requirements of the military for production and the civilian market suddenly experienced a lack of labourHouse servants had been common before the war paying a miniscule pay and providing food and boarding were enough to have several young girls applying for a maid position However with Lottakåren the womens auxiliary services regular work with the men absent office work with the huge administration around rationing etc young women could find other positions House servants pretty much disappeared during the war and never really returned afterwardsAnother group that pretty much ceased to be during the war was statare a position of farm labourer where the pay was had in goods from the farm where contracts were signed for a year Generally these people could not save up had deplorable living conditions and only a single week per year to switch estate at which they were employed  with the lack of savings this was usually impossible making this position eerily like that of a serf However during the war other jobs were available and when paying in produce was forbidden in  the group had already almost ceased to exist with many of them movin gto the cities to take jobs in the industry or to the forests to work with lumber both of which

whitelightking,Navigation meaning specifically finding where you are and how to get where you want to go at sea was rather difficult but the book learning involved in navigation wasnt extensive  You might think of th century navigation as having three skill groups Book learning which would comprise the ability to read ability to do arithmetic geometry and a specific subset called spherical trigonometry used for celestial navigation Practical techniques for navigation  How to take a sun or star sighting to determine latitude how to measure speed with a log line  How to read a nautical chart and how to make one etc   Seamanship understanding currents leeway weather how the sea and land interact and so forth  This would help a navigator estimate how much error could be introduced into his navigation from real world stuffJames Cook went to sea as a teenager in colliers ships that carry coal off the English and Scottish coast  I believe before he went to see he had already received enough education to read and do arithmetic  He spent five or more years picking up the practical elements of navigation points  and   Picking up the book learning was relatively easy given Cooks interest and aptitude because its not really all that much math  In modern times its basically just what we call high school math  In the th century it wasnt often taught as a matter of routine so itd require a selfmotivated curious student who could afford the books and had the spare timeSo to sum up the book learning part is relatively easy if you had a basic early education  The practical techniques are relatively easy and would be taught to promising sailors routinely as an apprenticeship  But mastery requires a good amount of experience of all the things that can go wrong At Sea  This would be difficult to acquire except by long time spent sailing in varied and sometimes hostile conditions,2,cdl9r22,1ral9v,askhistorians,new,7,5

TimberBeast,The answer to this question is going to differ at least slightly from battle to battleIn the battle of Stalingrad some civilians escaped or were evacuated before fighting reached the city but the vast majority were not allowed to leave until the battle was well underway This caused thousands of civilian casualtiesThe presence of civilians added some interesting elements to the battle for Stalingrad While many did remain in hiding as much as possible they still needed to leave for food water and other necessities Some were forced into serving the German attackers Others fought against the Germans as part of irregular forces At least one German soldier actually used the presence of the civilians to gain a temporary tactical advantage he dressed up as an old woman in order to gather water at a stream each day while gathering water he observed Soviet positions which allowed him to serve as a sort of spotter for German artillery Once the Soviets discovered this ruse they shot the old womanIf you want some history of the Battle of Stalingrad from a groundlevel perspective Id recommend Edwin Palmer Hoyts  Days The Battle for Stalingrad as well as Reina Penningtons Women and the Battle of Stalingrad although I must warn you that the latter work is heavily cherrypicked in its narrative and thus lacks integrity,31,cdlawta,1raq7d,askhistorians,new,161,130

Qweniden,Lets look at wine firstWine for most of history was not aged per se  Though there were some exceptions the goal for most producers of wine were to get the product to market and sold before the harvest of the next year  This is because before the advent of the combination of the glass bottle a cork stopper and sulfites as a preservative wine would simply spoil within a year  So aging was a bad thing for most of wines historyIn the th century the above mentioned technological advances all came together and people particularly the British started developing a taste for aged wine  But it was the consumer who would age the wine after purchasing so that there were no large capital costs borne by the growers or middlemen merchantsSo TLDR growers and merchants did not have to age the product when that style was desirablepossible It was the consumer who would age their own winesWhiskeyAs popular tastes transformed and the consumers wanted whiskeys that gained the flavors colors and concentration that barrel aging brings there was already an existing base of manufactures that were turning out whiskeys to be drank young  Since they were existing companies backed by wealthy families with cashflow already coming in it would not have been too difficult to capitalize the aging process  When distilleries did need more capital than they could get via salesdriven cash flow there would have been banks to lend the money for operating costs just like any business would have access to ,12,cdlb5r0,1raqa1,askhistorians,new,72,60

Desperada,Plans over what to do with Nazi leadership were debated between the Allied leadership and shifted throughout the course of the war I dont believe its truly possible to definitively state that any single course of action would have been planned and followed through had Hitler been taken alive While the Moscow Declaration of  did state that punishment for crimes with no specific geographic locale would be handled jointly by the Allied powers this could be open to interpretation As the Red Army reached Berlin significantly before the other Allied powers if Hitler were alive he would have surely been under Soviet custody Whether Stalin would claim that the extreme Soviet losses in the course of the war gave a specific geographic locale for many of Hitlers crimes and thus allowed themselves to take charge in meting out punishment is a highly likely possibility it cannot be positively concluded As for what the specific punishment would have been as I previously mentioned the thoughts of the Allied leadership on the matter of general postvictory punishment shifted as the war progressed and concluded There was disagreement over how to punish Nazis generally upon the wars conclusion at the Tehran Conference in  The intent of Stalin who would have had custody of Hitler at the conference can be seen in his suggestion to simply summarily execute roughly  German officers A simple summary execution whether under official Red Army auspices or more akin to the fate of Muammar Gaddafi is certainly one likely possibility Although the other Allied leaders were somewhat less bloodthirsty than Stalin in their thinking regarding the punishment of Nazi leadership immediately executing Hitler and definitely ending the war in Europe is a likely scenarioOn the note of trials it is highly unlikely that Hitler would have been prosecuted by the German people The judiciary of Germany was comprised just about exclusively of Nazi party members The only Germans who could even theoretically prosecute Hitler somewhat reliably would have been those with communist leanings which simply puts the ball into Stalins court regardless Were a trial to be held under strictly Soviet custody there is absolutely no doubt that the event would be a show trial in Moscow leading to inevitable execution If Stalin were instead to abide by the previous arrangement for joint decision making on the punishment of Nazi leadership Hitler would have been tried jointly by the Allies at Nuremburg or potentially separately at a unique trial for himself alone It should be noted that essentially all roads lead to execution Any plans for the Denazification of Germany would have been seriously hampered by Hitler still being alive The risk of Hitler returning being freed or acting as a living figurehead for a potential resurgence of Nazism would simply be too great The only real questions are the exact method leading up to execution and the extent of involvement from Truman and Churchill in itThe TLDR Postwar plans for the Nazi leadership in general differed between the Allied leadership Given that Hitler was not captured alive it cannot be definitively said that the potential road map for Allied leadership jointly dealing with Nazi leadership would have even been followed in Hitlers case The only thing for certain is the conclusion inevitable execution,15,cdljuhr,1ratf7,askhistorians,new,94,79

cubshound,There is little evidence that there was an actual threat to Stalins rule despite the fact that associates of his such as Molotov would insist that Stalin took only necessary action  Molotov in late years would frequently defend the policies as essential to the ultimate success of the Soviet Union in WWII though given the intertwining of the twos legacies this is hardly surprisingWhether or not Stalin acted out of paranoia is an open question that is subject to a great deal of debate  Stalin was an exceptionally savvy politician and many of his horrific acts directly led to him accumulating more power  The dekulakization led to the extension of Soviet control to rural areas and the diminishment of traditional powerbrokers like Priests  The Great Terror eliminated Bukharin and the wing of the party which held differing goals than StalinThe best case for paranoia is in the purge of the military which partially stemmed due to a German intelligence operation to discredit high level military officers  The doctors plot towards the end of his life is another good example of paranoia influencing his thinking but his ill health is another explanationOverall I would lean towards Stalin as a sociopathic pragmatist who pursued his own power and Soviet national interest to the exclusion of all else including basic humanity  This does not in any way shape or form excuse him crimes as he was by any definition a monsterThere are lots of great additional materials on this Id recommend looking into the works of Sheila Fitzpatrick and Lynne Viola in particular  Norman Naimark also wrote an interesting fairly short piece on whether or not Stalin was guilty of genocide that covers a lot of this,7,cdlppes,1razkx,askhistorians,new,18,11
kmjn,This kind of conflates two different questions which have fairly different degrees of uncertainty Do the Great Purges have a primarily psychological and personal explanation stemming from Stalins paranoia Were the stated reasons for the Purges combatting various military andor capitalist conspiracies against the USSR or against Communism the genuine motivationThere is quite a bit of debate on  but pretty much no debate on  nobody seriously believes the official charges were anything but inventedOn  though one can distinguish something like three positions possibly more and there is some shift in their relative strengths since the s or so A decent capsule summary of the fairly large literature can be found in Alex Bellamys Massacres and Morality Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity starting on p  A firstperson account of the posts developments can be found in Sheila Fitzpatricks article Revisionism in Soviet History History and Theory  The first view is the one you allude to that it was indeed primarily Stalins personal paranoia leading him to attempt to liquidate any perceived threat or alternative source of power In this view it was primarily a topdown affair coordinated by Stalin a series of irrational violent rages and seeing plots behind every corner A second view is that it was indeed mainly planned by Stalin but for more deliberate rational and less psychological reasons this view holds that Stalin viewed terror as a key tool in building the industrial state maintaining order and maintaining his control over the party Among Soviet dissidents Roy Medvedev and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn are classic exponents of these two views Medvedev ascribed Stalinism in large part to Stalins personal paranoia while Solzhenitsyn instead saw Stalin as a coldly rational methodical planner of totalitarianismAgainst those two classic viewsStalin the paranoid madman and Stalin the ruthless dictatora third view has gained more prominence among historians since the s revisionist  work of Sheila Fitzpatrick Moshe Lewin etc It argues that there was not one single phenomenon but rather a number of different events with somewhat different explanations and somewhat downplays the omnipotentomniscient role of Stalin though only somewhat as he clearly had enormous power For one thing this school sees the showtrial purges of Old Bolsheviks and the much larger liquidations and deportations of mass populations such as the Ukrainians and the kulaks as considerably different phenomena and also tends to emphasize the role of social and bureaucratic forces in the latter This group of historians tend to see Stalin as a bit less cynical perhaps and more interested in actually strengthening the USSRnot against the actually stated conspiracies but against Stalins and the bureaucracys view of weaknesses in the system that could be corrected Hence the purge of the Old Bolsheviks is seen by Fitzpatrick as in part a genuine attempt to replace old idealist revolutionaries with a new generation of scientifically trained cadres trained in the Soviet academies And both Lewin and Fitzpatrick see many of the mass liquidations and deportations as attempts to reshape Soviet society by simply ruthlessly removing elements that didnt seem to fit into its visionIn short nobody really doubts that the various conspiracies were invented pretexts to carry out purges but whether the real motivation for these purges was Stalins paranoia or something else is more debated Revisionist in the study of Stalinism just means revising the pres understanding not necessarily defending Stalin Lewin in particular is vociferously antiStalin but thinks previous historians were antiStalin for the wrong reasons,2,cdlrv4d,1razkx,askhistorians,new,14,12
bitparity,Reddit tends to go through phases with regards to The Dark Ages depending upon what political point youre trying to make with that period which itself is a microcosm with how The Dark Ages is wielded in actual academic historiography  I think I saw a recent ratheism post where they were actively trying to revive that term for reasons that are rather obvious Christianity leading to ignorance etc  On the opposing side people also take the tack of Crackedcom which enjoys a certain contrarian streak in some of their articles with the whole the real truth behind X thus the idea of the dark ages as not dark at allProfessionally The Dark Ages is not used to define the era historiographically  However that does not stop that term from being used academically even if for no other purpose than as a frame of reference that the historians are seeking to clarify  A good example being famed historian John Haldon describing the most chaotic period of Byzantine history The seventh century in Byzantium traditionally belongs to the Dark Ages in the fullest sense of the phrase a period when both the sources available to the historian are fewer than in earlier or later times and when the exigencies of the struggle to survive made the production of a widely based secular literature both less relevant to the cultural identity of the dominant elite and subordinate to the demand for political and theological certaintiesYoull notice despite the fact Haldon puts Dark Ages in quotes its still usefully illustrative of his point In many ways its similar to the nomenclature of byzantineroman empire  Is it misleading  Is it a perjorative or a useful categorization  As well both of these terms are argued fiercely in both the academic and the lay specifically the computer wargaming communities which is a microcosm of the debate regarding how dark were the dark ages  Its true the dark ages were not as dark as traditionally thought  But as I pointed out in another post the thoughts on that period of time boil down into  statements The era was as bad as everyone thought it was The era wasnt as bad as everyone thought it was The era wasnt bad at allYoull notice the one position missing from this list  The era was in fact great for everyone  The best that people argue for is a semirelative neutral position from the late Roman era  Which should be as good as any indicator that some kind of traumatic transformation occurred in this periodSo given this framing and going back to your question youre asking if its wrong to call the period The Dark AgesHeres an unsatisfactory answer You do what you like   Ultimately what matters is you understand why youre using or not using the term  Are you using it for a convenient shorthand for a particular period in history that everybody knows  Are you trying to indicate your belief in that period as one of socioeconomic and technological regression  Are you NOT using it because you believe that the need to acknowledge the advancements made during that age outweigh the convenience of its use  And so ontldr  You call it what you want  Everyone including the academics is still arguing about the fundamental question of that term how dark was it really  There is in fact no answer  Thus you do what you want with that term  Just understand why you use it  ,1,cdlh7mr,1rb1lj,askhistorians,new,17,16
Gadarn,One of the main problems is that dark is meant as a pejorative term that is not only not helpful  it sets up a damaging connotation  but it isnt very accurate in a number of ways  There is simply no reason as historians to use the term Dark Ages when we can simply label that same period Early Middle Ages and avoid making a value judgementBeyond that Europe between  CE and  CE wasnt necessarily quite dark compared to the Roman Empire before it rd century Rome wasnt exactly ideal when it came to political stability  by comparison many Early Medieval kingdomsregions were far more brightDark Ages also ignores the learning and cultural advancement taking place Ireland was a beacon of learning from the th century on and I would argue that the Book of Kells speaks for itself when it comes to the cultural works created during this period We owe much of our knowledge of Greek and Roman literature to the Carolingians and they were doing their own work too including attempting the first public school system hardly simply a bright spotSo when it comes down to it it isnt helpful to use a pejorative term to blanket such a large period that simply cant be described in such a way It is much more useful for historians to use more neutral language that ensures the reader isnt making a value judgement right from the start,1,cdlgi27,1rb1lj,askhistorians,new,12,11
TheVitruvianDan,I had Faramerz Dabhoiwala as a tutor last year and he was in the middle of a huge tour promoting his book The Origins of Sex in which he explores differing conceptions of this kind of stuff over time One of his points was that in the Middle Ages in England female and male bodies were seen as the inverse of each other ie the ovaries were internal testes the vagina an inverted penis Tied to this was the belief that therefore just as a man had to orgasm to release semen in order to conceive a woman had to reach orgasm This was problematic in cases of rape obviously as if the woman fell pregnant it was assumed she enjoyed itHow this changes later on is less clear but it seems that eventually the opposite view came to be held  women were entirely different from men and consequently there was no reason to assume that they even COULD orgasm And certainly that they shouldntThis is a very general outline of Dabhoiwalas views I was not actually studying this topic and this came from conversations with him nor do I know how accepted they are I recommend you find his book and read that,0,cdltepy,1rb290,askhistorians,new,3,3
youngdick,I will only answer part of your question from what knowledge I have  My family has resided in far eastern Kentucky for over two hundred years  They fought on both sides for very similar reasons really  The reason the people in my family joined the army wasnt because slavery taxation or a crooked election  In these small back woods towns there were no large plantations only family farms Most of these people lived in object poverty so having the option to buy a slave was impossible  As for the elections Appalachia has a history of mistrust of the government in general they are clannish and self sufficient people  Many did not or could not travel the miles into town to participate in elections even if they could they were ill informed So this mattered little to them  My family and I could assume many others in the Appalachian region fought in the war because of a sense of outsiders coming into the region  At the idea of these ides of war and outsiders coming in some men left to fight and defend their homes and towns  After the war those who returned it was the same they had always lived  Isolation and poverty  There were few slaves to be set free because blacks have always been an extreme minority in Appalachia This is one account and perspective from my family Not a complete answer,1,cdll3dz,1rb3zw,askhistorians,new,5,4

pharmaceus,I think that everyone is addressing the problem from the wrong angle Switzerland did not emerge as a significantly richer nation until after both World Wars And the wealth of the country is quite relative  it comes as the result of a high purchasing power of Swiss Franc relative to other currencies For the length of duration of Bretton Woods agreement  the USD had a much higher purchasing power and thus you get the higher GDP ration The Swiss franc was considered a much more stable currency  more stable than even the west German Mark  the US Dollar was not so stable as it was considered fundamental for global economy It was in the most recent years that Switzerland skyrocketed to insane levels of nominal wealth  compared to Norway  but that is all in relative terms Once you take purchasing power into account it becomes evident that high prices translate to much lower real wealth within the country Switzerlands riches werent backed by any significant resource supply or industrial base  the Swiss were simply careful not to waste their wealth and capital away on wars like other countries  Compare those listsHistorical nominal GDP per capitahttpenwikipediaorgwikiListofcountriesbypastandfutureGDPnominalpercapitain  Switzerland has GDP per capita of approx  USD  while Canada has USD the US USD and Sweden  USD  In comparison France has  and UK   that is not a huge difference for countries devastated by warHistorical GDP per region  adjusted for purchasing powerhttpenwikipediaorgwikiListofregionsbypastGDPPPPCompare the number between Switzerland Sweden and  Germany France UK starting from  You can clearly see that while both Switzerland and Sweden have a steady growth in GDP other countries have large fluctuations depending on the growth of population Unification of Germany in  and warsTo sum things up from strategic standpoint Switzerland is not worth the effort because once you get rid of their relative position in the world economy by invading them you wipe out most of their wealth which in case of Sweden and Switzerland was significantly boosted by their neutrality which allowed for financial and other vulnerable industries to find a safe haven during wartime and shortly afterwardsEDIT Reddit formatting sucks,0,cdm2fez,1rb5q3,askhistorians,new,2,2

WinterWolf,The Ottoman Empires participation in WWI directly caused its dissolution as an empire but the end of the Ottoman Sultanate as an imperial power was likely an inevitable occurrence as a result of its loss of strength relative to other world powers  Its total destruction as a political entity occurred in  after the war and was done arguably because the leader of the Turkish nationalists Mustafa Kemal Ataturk just wanted the Ottomans gone  For this topic I wont get into the details of Ataturk In very short and simplified summary he blamed the Ottomans and Islam for what happened to the Ottoman Empire in World War IAfter the reign of Suleiman the Magnificentthe Lawgiver    the Ottoman Empire began to suffer a steady decline although some historians would have my head off for using that word A more accurate way to describe Ottoman decline would be to say that its strength economic military political etc relative to its top competitors France Russia Britain became weaker and weaker  In terms of technological military and geopolitical impact European imperial powers began to hugely outpace the OttomansBeing outpaced in these fields by another power isnt necessarily a guarantee of a political entitys destruction the Vatican is a good example the state of Italy has held a decisive military advantage over the Vatican for a long time but the Vatican is still around  However the Ottomans geopolitical position made them an important target for imperial powers  Talk to any historian of Russia long enough and theyll eventually tell you about Russias historical obsession with obtaining a Mediterranean port  The easiest way for them to do that was to go through the Ottomans There were numerous other reasons why the Russians and Ottomans clashed almost constantly throughout their history but this port issue is particularly relevant because it worried France and Britain who really didnt want another imperial power sailing around the MediterraneanThe Crimean War  had the Ottomans fighting the Russians again but with the French and British assisting the Ottomans directly As long as an imperial tug of war continued between the European imperial wars the Ottomans served as a useful buffer state a sad state of affairs compared to the s when they were considered the terror of all EuropeWorld War I is hugely significant for the Ottomans because it ended the tug of war  Russia France and Britain found a reason to stand united and they no longer needed the Ottomans as a buffer state  The Ottoman government ruled by a group called The Young Turks saw WWI as a chance to stop the Empires steady decline into irrelevance More desperately the Ottomans HAD to join Germany If the Ottomans didnt ally with Germany and beat the Allies then the Empire was likely to be forcibly dissolved by the Allies  This is particularly reflected in the failed Gallipoli Campaign    of World War I where the French and British attempted to knock the Ottomans out of the war Ataturk made a name for himself in this fightingDid Ottoman participation in WWI lead to their downfall Absolutely This war ended their empire  But their empire had been coming to an end for some time now To an extent they were forced to fight in WWI or perish as an empire  If WWI had not happened would the Ottomans still be here  Nobody knows of course but the Ottomans had been trending towards disintegration for a long time when WWI rolled around They werent called the sick man of Europe for no reason,0,cdm6p3f,1rb6p1,askhistorians,new,2,2

Astrogator,What is meaningful dissent and resistance Where does opposition end and dissent begin Where does active resistance start Is the woman standing in line at the bakery telling a joke about Marshal Görings incapacity to protect the Reich from allied air attacks just voicing dissent Is it an act of defiance and resistance against the regimes claim to totality What about someone deserting from the Wehrmacht because he disagreed with the regimes aims What about someone deserting because he was afraid Its a murky field Its a field that has been a battleground for German political for a long time One of our former chancellors Willy Brandt was as Herbert Frahm a member of the socialist resistance and the resistance in Norway This got him branded as a traitor by his political opponents The deserters from the Wehrmacht about two  were long denied official recognition and pardon and hat to fight the stigma of traitors as well The members of the Rote Kapelle resistance group were hailed as heroes in the GDR and the Soviet Union presented with the Hero of the Soviet Union medal and unjustly branded as a th column from Moscow and forgotten in the west Its really murky What is resistance in the face of a regime that has at its core the goal of total control over the private and the political Or the other way around what is notThere was quite a bit of what one could reasonably call resistance spanning the whole field from passive opposition to armed resistance But German resistance faced difficulties the resistance groups in occupied countries did not face Firstly resistance meant treason There was no way around it and for many that was an obstacle too difficult to overcome Secondly there were not only a few Quislings and cooperators like in occupied countries there was the majority of the German people that could denounce you act as informants for the regime or would oppose you Thirdly many of the resistance fighters were complicit in the crimes of the regime as well This was particularly a problem for the resistance among the officers Many of them had not only seen the war crimes on the Eastern Front but hat participated in them in some form Von Boeselager for example was involed in the brutal and inhuman warfare against the partisans in the back of the front That doesnt mean that there was no meaningful resistance But there was considerably less than in other countries One oftcited example is the church Groups like the Bekennende Kirche or the names of Bonhoeffer or Niemöller are well known But the church was also mainly concerned with keeping the doctrinal and organizational integrity and sovereignty of the church intact in the face of NS encroachment This was particularly successful in the case of the catholic church and the regime never managed to get control over the catholic unions and many of their churches But the catholic church was more interested in a defensive and reactionary defense of their milieu they were interested in peaceful coexistence with the regime albeit on their terms and they were indeed afraid of Bolshevism The resistance that originated from the church was not a platform for the organization of political resistance and it could not be that was clear to Bonhoeffer too There was of course resistance that was motivated by religious principles but the church as an organization did not practice political resistance It was pastors and ministers that acted on their own like Theophil Wurm with his sermons against the Euthanasia or the murder of the Jews or Bishop Count von Galen who was convinced of the duty of the church to resist against a destructive regime but who didnt find much support for active resistance among his colleaguesThen there were the Jehovas witnesses who were probably one of the most practically effective resistance movements Their members due to their faith were opposed to serving in the army and practiced conscientous objection in the face of the active conscription And even after their religion was outlawed they kept practicing and also kept up a network of information printing pamphlets and keeping up their organization Most of them were not broken not even in the KZs There were a few other conscientous objectors who were punished by death but the Jehovas witnesses were by far the most numerousOther religious groups also practiced forms of resistance The Quakers built up a network to help politically and racially pursued persons tried to help individual prisoners by intervention on their behalf with the authorities or by sending packets with the support of the American Quakers The SeventhDaychurch practiced conscientous objection and refused to make the Hitler salute Individuals like the Mormon Helmut Hübbener practiced religiously motiated resistance on their own He spread foreign news that he listened to illegally and spread pamphlets to enlighten people about the true character of the NSregime and the nature of German warfare imprisoned in  All this religious motivated resistance was in general not political in nature it didnt aim to throw down the regime but it was an act of defiance against a totalitarian regime that didnt leave them room to practice their faith freely There was also the resistance of youth groups like the Edelweiß and KittelbachPiraten the different Meuten the SwingYouth and so on Youth resistance is also a difficult field Youths are notoriously rebellious against authority This is of course more prominent in an authoritarian context There is an interesting area of tension there between dissent and consent between embracing the new ideals of the new man the cult of masculinity and adventure on the one hand and the desire for cultural autonomy on the other hand between not being like everybody else Some might have just been in it for the music or the dream of a freer world There was Jewish resistance many young Jews featured prominently among the communist youth organizations like the group around Herbert Baum or the dj  of Helle Hirsch who planned a bombing of the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg but was imprisoned and executed Another Jewish group was the Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens central union of German citizens of Jewish belief who put up a defiant propaganda campaign against the defamations of the Regime  fe they published a brochure against the allegations of Jewish ritual murders tried to help other Jews emigrate and cooperated with the socialdemocrat Reichsbanner SchwarzRotGold Other groups continued circulating and publishing illegal material and pamphlets trying to leak inormation to the public about the plans of the regime An estimated  German Jews were active in the resistance from  to  many of them with communist groups fighting amongst Titos and the Italian partisans and participating in other resistance groups in Germany itself  There were countless small and individual acts of individuals hiding and saving one or two Jews many of whom died during bombings since they couldnt go into the public shelters alone and independently of others helping people escape across the border to Switzerland  some did this out of conviction for strangers others for close friends others in turn to make some money off the refugees There are cases of women protesting in front of the police station until their Jewish husbands were released of soldiers refusing to participate in executions of officers refusing to carry out illegal orders others collecting information about crimes and war crimes But all these individual acts are hard to generalize since the motives are so different and personal Ive written a lot about the resistance among the communists and why it so horribly failed which was numerically the most important the socialists Georg Elser and lastdays resistance herehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsmuijrinwwiigermanyweretherecitizenbasedantinazi and about some of the difficulties the military resistance faced herehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsniowhydidntthegermansjustshoothitlerinsteadccfues To reiterate something I wrote earlier on the same

koliano,Ottoman History is not my field of study so Im sure someone else will be able to give a more comprehensive answer but I can tell you that a key concept in addressing this question is the Millet systemThe Millet system gave a very effective sort of selfgovernment to nonMuslim citizens of the empire Living in a millet one would abide by the religious communitys own laws pay taxes to their own representatives and generally live in peace without interference from the Ottomans as long as one recognized the political power of the empire or depending on where and when you were the power of the ayans petty but sometimes quite powerful regional lordsThere were millets for Christians of many different types mostly divisions that skirted the line between sectarian and ethnic Armenian Greek Syrian etc The Jews had millets as well and unfortunately for the minority Muslims Druze and Shiites and the like they ended up lumped in with the majority SunnisI have never heard of Pagan millets That doesnt mean there were no pagans in the Ottoman Empire just that they werent numerous and wellorganized enough to receive religiopolitical autonomyThus while Islam was supreme as in if your dispute involves a Muslim you have to go through the Islamic legal system and not your millets everything still worked pretty well After all it had to The Ottoman Empire was the bridge between the East and the West It included a mindblowing variety of peoples and religions and culturesAs for how effective the millet system was well one of the funniest quotes from the late late Imperial period comes from a disgruntled leader of the Greek Orthodox church responding to the new reforms which sought to establish universal equality regardless of religion The State has made us equal with the Jews We were satisfied with Muslim superiority What this illustrates is that despite living in a state ruled by what was for centuries the wellspring of Islamic authority nonMuslim communities felt surprisingly comfortable and unrestrainedAs for converting people to Islam you may be referring to the Devşirme system the process by which mainly Christian youth would be forcibly recruited or stolen depending on your perspective at a young age into the Janissary Order over time a cadre of elite warriors who became a dominant political force in the EmpireThe system had its ups and downs Obviously nobody wants their child to be taken as a glorified slave soldier on the other hand the Janissaries were really really glorified slave soldiers Boys who likely had no chance at being anything other than Balkan peasants would instead have a chance to become politically significant all the way up to the position of grand vizierThe principal source for this post including the quote is M Sükrü Hanioglus brilliant A Brief History of the Late Ottoman EmpirehttpwwwamazoncomBriefHistoryLateOttomanEmpiredprefsrsbooksampieUTFampqidampsr a great primer on the time period and the empire itself,0,cdlriq1,1rbdvf,askhistorians,new,4,4

BeondTheGrave,I assume you are talking about strategic air power the bombing campaigns of Germany specifically as opposed to operational or tactical air power And the answer to your question probably the Red Army Their constant grinding battle with the German forces occupied over  of all German divisions for the entire  conflict and most Germans were killed by Soviets not Allies to lump together the Americans Commonwealths and other westfrontersThe major problem with the Strategic Bombing campaigns is a question of how useful were they The main aim of the bombing campaigns especially the American ones the British focused primarily on Dehousing was to grind the German economy to a halt This was mainly accomplished  by first destroying all factories but then transitioned to destroy bottleneck factories These would be places that produced goods critical for all other industries like ball bearings Cut off the ball bearings and everything from tank turrets to plane engines to heavy machinery grinds to a halt right Wrong It was discovered that the German economy had the annoying tendency to decentralize distribute and regenerate otherwise destroyed production And this regularly happened so quickly that the German economy or war effort never ground to any serious halt While there were certainly disruptions the German economy regularly produced more weapons and in greater numbers than it had previously So the American strategy of economic destruction generally failed But then we need to Ploesti and oil In  the Americans began to bomb the Ploesti oil field in Romania This was the major oil supplier for Nazi Germany By  the Americans had shifted their major focus to attacking oil refineries and oil production as a part of the bottleneck strategy Aside from a brief respite during the transportation bombing phase of Operation Overlord the Americans kept up series pressure on both Ploesti and the German oil refineries This had a massive effect on German oil production and by  they were experiencing major shortages So the Strategic bombing campaign had a tremendous effect on Germany The problem was it took a really long time and nobody realized what worked until it was already over But by  even by  the Red Army had already won the war It was merely a question of what the world would look like afterwards On the other hand the Bombing Campaigns did distract a major amount of Luftwaffe squadrons and flak batteries remember that that dreaded mm was originally a flak gun Imagine how Germany would have fared if more of them were in Tigers instead of guarding Germanys skies On top of that keep in mind that Germany had basically stripped the Eastern Front of aviation by  with most of its fighters going to defend the against bomber raids This gave the Soviet air arm air superiority So its a really complicated issue and requires a lot of hair splitting and debate on what was really important If I had to come down on one side or another to solve your debate Id say the Red Army but thats what kind of guy I am But that is not to discount the impact of the air campaigns against Germany I just have deep problems concerning Strategic Air campaigns ,1,cdlmxo2,1rbqih,askhistorians,new,4,3
panzerkampfwagen,The bombing campaign itself was less effective than people seem to believe  Studies during the war showed that barely any bombs hit their targets and when they did they tended to do less damage than expected  This was one of the reasons for the decision to start the Dehousing bombing campaign also known as Terror Bombing in which it was decided to destroy the majority of houses in dozens of German cities  It was hoped that blowing up their homes would so demoralise the German population that theyd basically give up  According to Ian Kershaw the Germans ability to produce war goods which actually increased as the Allied bombing increased didnt collapse until the Germans lost the territory where they got either their resources from or the factories were located  ,1,cdloslu,1rbqih,askhistorians,new,2,1

GeorgyKZhukov,Baseball evolved over much of the th century but if you want to pick any one point of origination the American Civil War is where what we think of as baseball really started to appearBat and ball games had been around for ages being played in Great Britain for centuries and they no doubt came to America from there Cricket baseball and rounders all have their origins somewhere back thereNow with baseball specifically we start to see regional variations that kind of sort of resemble baseball being played in America in the first half of the th century The Knickerbocker rules  which date to   were the dominant set of rules being played in the area of New York but they were by no means the only set of rules The game would be kind of recognizable to a modern observer but rules such as making an out on a catch after one bounce would be pretty weird now It also lacked balls although three strikes was a ruleNow as I said the Civil War was a key component of the rise of baseball When the war started hundreds of thousands of Union soldiers from all other the country found themselves camped together and with a lot of downtime Baseball became an exceptionally popular game for them and with New Yorkers everywhere the Knickerbocker rules found themselves to be the most popular used essentially becoming the de facto rules for Union Army baseball When the war ended and the Army disbanded most of its men soldiers headed home bringing with them either a new game or else a new set of rules for one they had already playedIn the wake of the war amateur athletic clubs started sprouting up all over and within only a few years the first Professional club was founded in Cincinnati in  More clubs followed and in  the National League was founded It was not the first league though as there had been a prewar association the NABBP that governed amateur clubs in the New York Area The rules continued to evolve beyond that point  here is a handy listhttpwwwbaseballalmanaccomrulechngshtml  but by  or so with the introduction of four balls It had been as high as nine in the past I would say the game very much resembled what we have todaySo there you go as with most games Basketball is the only one I can think of off hand that was essentially created out of thin air it was a slow evolutionary process from earlier ones That being said the most important point in its development was the American Civil War which not only helped to speed up standardization of the rules but created a nation wide network of fans and players,1,cdltumo,1rc005,askhistorians,new,6,5

GeorgyKZhukov,Not that Im aware of It was coincidental That being said though Russia and the United States had particularly good relations in that era and Lincoln and Alexander II had a great deal of correspondence and a documented friendship or at least as near as what one can call friendship between two heads of state who never met in person There are  known letters from Alexander II to Presidents of the United States the majority of them going to Lincoln Many people like to draw parallels between the twohttpwwwarccforgexhibitionshtml both being Emancipators and both meeting their death by assassination although for different reasons Now that being said there is zero reason to believe one actually had any influence on the others actions in this regard Alexander II began the process of liberating the Serfs in March of  before Lincoln had even been inaugurated and before it was known just what he was going to end up doing in regards to the slaves While he was privately opposed his public position was to stop the further spread of it not totally abolish it in one fell swoop and the Emancipation Proclamation was a reaction to the situation of the war not something Lincoln could have passed in peacetime Note I ran this by my girlfriend who was involved in the exhibit I linked above to ask if there was anything I was missing According to her and I cant find anything to support this so Im presenting it as a questionable but interesting aside the wording of the Emancipation Proclamation had a number of echoes to the Krestyanskaya reforma  goda the document that began to free the Serfs which would indicate that Lincoln had read it  well a translation of it  and was at least influenced by the wording although I dont think you can say that it had any influences on the actual passage And again I stand by the first paragraph but take this with a grain of salt,0,cdltky6,1rc0i4,askhistorians,new,2,2

archaeontologist,Although I cant speak to the specifics of the Estonian situation I feel the need to intervene here seeing as the only other comment is an ahistorical polemicThe notion of foreign conquest bringing civilization and prosperity has a long transEuropean history of justifying imperial expansion It is firmly rooted in a th century political and intellectual climate  the age of imperialism where older and younger empires expanded their colonial holdings Intellectual conceptions of an advanced Europe at the vanguard of historical progress were both formed through these imperial encounters with nonEuropean subjects and informed how empires negotiated the positions of these others Belief in technological social political and moral progress supported hierarchical understandings of nations where different peoples could be plotted on a singular linear path of development In this vision lessdeveloped peoples were situated on a path towards modernity at the forefront of which was of course Western Europe and colonial intervention could beneficially lead these children of mankind down this pathThis is NOT a particularly Russian view  its intellectual origins can be located in Enlightenment thought and its political origins in the imperial debates of lateth c England And for all its reactionary connotations today understandings of colonialism as a civilizing mission was NOT limited to conservative demagogues  recent scholarship into colonial politics and th century political culture has stressed the ties between nascent liberalism and apologetics of empire particularly fascinating are the imperialist doctrines of James and John Stuart Mill as well as Tocquevilles justification of the conquest of Algeria Furthermore the development of the social sciences of Sociology and Anthropology in the lateth century can be tied to this drive to understand and aid the uncivilized colonial other For the latest scholarship on liberal imperialism and justifications of imperial conquest in the th century see Sankar Muthu Enlightenment Against Empire Princeton Princeton University Press  Jennifer Pitts A Turn to Empire The Rise of Imperial Liberalism in Britain and France Princeton Princeton University Press  Karuna Mantena Alibis of Empire Henry Maine and the Ends of Liberal Imperialism Princeton Princeton University Press Of course Ive painted a rough and quick picture of this period  the notion of empire and civilizing the colonial other was a thoroughly ambiguous one perpetrated in political projects scientific discourses and literary productions but also contested and debated in these same mediumsIts even more complex in the Eastern European case where the Russian Empire justified its own th c expansion in the east as a civilizing mission while Western European political and cultural thought portrayed Russia itself as a backwards nation itself in need of civilization I find it incredibly alarming that the poster below me ruthlessly criticizes Imperial Russia for using a discourse of backwards others in need of civilizing while he uses the exact same discourse to look down upon murderous Russian barbarians In fact there is a long history of what can be called Russian Orientalism in the Saidian sense where W European cultural and scientific discourses have constructed a backwards uncivilized E Europe against which to define their own Europeaness For recent works on this topic see Maria Todorova The Balkans from Discovery to Imagination Slavic Review     Milicia BakićHayden Nesting Orientalisms The Case of Former Yugoslavia Slavic Review     Larry Wolff Inventing Eastern Europe The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment Stanford CA Stanford University Press   Against his comment as well as th century imperialism and its modern intellectual influence seen in the interview you describe above unfortunately certain th c notions have yet to vanish from the public consciousness it is not the task of historians to rank peoples and nations in a hierarchy of progress or wield a binary lens of civilizationsavagery  the goal is instead to historicize these discourses and their lingering effects and ask how this particular vision of the world was constructedIn the particular instance you site above it seems to be a naive modern expression of this civilizationbarbarism binary with roots in the th c and unfortunately still latent in much popular thought to this day probably with the added influence of the Soviet nationalities policy If youre interested I would be more than happy to recommend some books on Russias historical engagement with its multiethnic polity up to and including the Soviet periodAnd one last thing the quote by Noxchi below on Russias engagement with the Caucasus is entirely inaccurate In writing the xenophobic and bleak Russian could only discern savages and blacks the complex variegated history of interactions between Imperial Russia and these southern neighbors is entirely erased Leaving aside shifting imperial political mechanisms of negotiating difference th century Russian culture saw complex strategies of understanding this region  from the nobel savage of romantic lyrical poetry and travelogues of the first decades of the th century exemplified in Pushkins A Prisoner in the Caucasus to Tolstoys incredible novel Hadji Murat published posthumously in  which superbly examines the conflicts of colonial empire and whose richly presented Caucasian protagonist who is the furthest thing from a savage is used to direct a withering critique against the imperial policies of a far more barbaric Tsar Nicholas I For a history on th c Russias rich engagement with the Caucasus see Susan Layton

Tiako,Im assuming the question is for the Imperial periodRoman recruitment is something of a complex topic and one that has a fair amount of difficulty around it The best answer is probably that there was no single way of getting recruits that applied in all situations all times and all places The process was probably not terribly formalized and seems a bit ad hoc A theory that was once popular was the idea of the Roman army as a selfsustaining institution that the pool of recruits was drawn largely from the various orphans and children legitimate and illegitimate that any military fort is going to accumulate This is probably not correct although undoubtedly was part of the story both because it has no real evidence for it an because legionaries proper who were increasingly a minority within the army as a whole were citizens a category that doesnt include orphansConscription did happen although it was never a leveeenmasse affair implemented across the empire Rather it would be targeted for specific regions and specific circumstancesthe Romans tended to view certain people as producing better soldiers and they werent above coercion as a strategy of getting recruits from them Most notoriously the Batavian revolt of  CE was triggered by overly heavy handed recruitment methods as Batavians were seen as some of the best material for soldiers Probably the majority of soldiers were willing recruits fleeing from rural poverty into the fairly solid and stable military institutionAs for how they maintained it it is best to remember that the Roman army actually wasnt that large That is the amount of money required to maintain it was significantly less than the aggregate amount of money required for the preRoman military situation of multiple competing polities This is an important principle behind certain views of the Roman economy,0,cdlwkkn,1rchua,askhistorians,new,11,11
Spoonfeedme,Expanding on Tiako and dawbles comments it also really depends what period we are talking about exactly The Republican period was far different than the Imperial period that followed and recruiting practices differedIts also important to note that as Tiako mentioned the army wasnt actually that large by modern standards for a population that might have reached almost sixty million the imperial army had less than thirty legions under arms for most of its existence which would have been approximately   regulars and about an equal number of auxiliaries so we can say roughly  men under arms The auxiliaries would have come from both inhabitants of the Empire as well as neighboring territories We have to make a distinction between themThe Legions themselves were theoretically manned by Roman citizens while the auxiliaries basically took the role of the allies of the Republic The idea that you would receive citizenship after your term of service was actually directed towards auxiliaries The Emperor Caracalla made every free man in the empire a citizen in  to possibly to offset falls in recruitment among current citizensThat possible fall in recruitment probably had something to do with money Lets talk about economics Rome itself and Italy had a high slave population that continued to grow into the Imperial period This meant a high percentage of people in Italy would be basically urban poor Rome itself could have had a population approaching one million in the early Imperial period for example The legions offered an attractive and stable career choice If one had familial connections one could leverage those into even more attractive postings most officers would have been men who basically bribed their way into such postings I think we can probably safely assume the majority of the Imperial legion at least under the Principate was thus simply recruited under the idea of a decent job for decent pay However the costs of maintaining a standing army is incredible The army itself was basically the budget line for the Roman Empire Not only was it costly to maintain in terms of regular financing each successive emperor was obliged to pay donatives to the army Legionary pay itself was increased over time inflation likely in order to continue to be able to recruit However these increases were highly irregular the first increase came a century after the Imperial period started the second a century after that When factoring in the likely levels of inflation caused by economic growth and the not so irregular devaluation of coins by debasing them in absolute terms it would likely be that legionary pay actually fell over time Finding money to pay the army was a constant challenge and some think that the faillure of the Roman economy to be able to support the army was one of the main reasons for the Empires downfall Peter Heather is one notable proponent of thisBut there are also those auxiliaries I mentioned This is a far more complicated answer because they could have been recruited in many different forms because the units themselves came in so many different forms Some auxiliary units were levys from conqueredsubject tribes Some would have been freely recruited men from noncitizen areas looking to gain citizenship and a job These units still received lesser pay so there would be some who would be attracted by the status of citizenship Because auxiliaries also generally receive less attention from writers less survives from letters and fewer inscriptions remain we unfortunately know a lot less about them in many waysIf youd like to know more about the economic theories of Romes decline Peter Heathers Decline of the Roman Empire is a good place to start In terms of more info on legion recruitment Adrian Goldsworthys Complete Roman Army and Pat Southerns The Roman Army ,0,cdm4vv3,1rchua,askhistorians,new,2,2

dualmanias,By the time the attack on Fort Sumter began the Confederacy was still forming and shaping its self The simple answer is no war could not have been avoided Here are some of the factors why    South Carolina was the first state to leave the union on the th of December  A little over a month after President Abraham Lincoln had been elected  up to this point many in the north had been anti slavery but it was not an overall major point in the agenda of the administration nor did Lincoln run on a serious antislavery platform Many prominent voices pushed for its abolition but it was still an issue that was easier to ignore than address as a whole    By the start of February  several more states had seceded from the union and joined the confederacy A constitution was drawn and adopted on the th of February and its elected president the following day    In the few short months from an American President to a northern and southern presidency a lot of rhetoric scheming plotting and reinforcing of positions and causes came to the forefront Slavery became a prominent issue Lincoln had argued as tensions grew that he would not abolish slavery but would not allow the nation to be divided either This was a major talking point in his inaugural address on March th You could view this as the first absolutely clear public stance Lincoln held on the whole affair However privately the administrations thought process could have and perhaps was very different In any case it was a direct attempt to avoid war but also a clear assertion that secession would not be accepted You can essentially view it as a promise of war rather than a deceleration of war if all other options have been exhausted and the nation could not be preserved    South Carolina leading the charge so to speak towards secession knew that a conflict was unavoidable Unlike many of the other states that had left the union SC had a large presence of Federal troops on its soil Most notably the sea forts which protected American commerce and its shipping lanes Fort Moultrie which was commanded by Major Robert Anderson responsible for all of the harbor defense and all of its related garrisons  was the initial headquarters but fearing attack Anderson switched his command to Fort Sumter    While the politicians debated Anderson had already prepared as best as he could for the coming fight Interesting fact because SC had already left the union Federal troops had no means for resupply Food and munitions had been blockaded from the forts since January The first shots of the Civil War actually happened on January th when SC vessels enforced their blockade and turned around northern supply ships    The growing situation of the forts and the blockade of SC waters from the north became the hotbed issue that directly escalated it into an armed conflict Despite repeated calls to abandon the forts and remand control to the Confederacy Anderson refused meanwhile his men grew closer to facing starvation Knowing that many of the Forts would be out of supplies and rations soon Lincoln ordered a small fleet to attempt to sneak past the blockade and resupply the forts    Numerous attempts were made to find a way out of the situation but in the end Anderson would not leave nor surrender and why would he it would meant treason and surrendering to even bigger traitor in a way    Long story short with union troops stationed on their soil refusing to leave and an increasing number of Union ships attempting to force their way in the south had little choice On Friday April   in the wee hours of the morning they opened fire    Shortly after war was officially declared by both sides  Easy Timelinehttpwwwdigitalhistoryuhedulearninghistorysouthsecedetimelinesecessioncfm,4,cdm0l3w,1rcqm1,askhistorians,new,13,9
JarlGrimnar,There was a very serious concern that some of his higher military command especially General Curtis Lamay were too eager to get into a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union Lamay had been pushing aggressive policies before Kennedy with having modified air force bombers loaded with signals intelligence equipment fly right along the Soviet Border antagonizing them and advocating for preemptive nuclear war Lemay during the Cuban Missile Crisis was also a strong advocate of bombing Cuba and opposed the naval blockade going so far as to advocate invading Cuba even after the crisis had ended and the Soviets agreed to withdraw the nuclear missiles As far as a actual fear of a coup attempt I cant quote or cite any actual historical documents but from what I know and read of a lot of the higher ranking members of the military at the time the fear of the domino effect of communism the idea of monolithic communism Cuba having become so friendly to the Soviet Union and the fact that many of the higher ranking military in Kennedys administration had been hardened by World War Two experiences all helped to create a highly unstable and dangerous atmosphere during that time of the Cold War ,5,cdlyjtp,1rcqrn,askhistorians,new,14,9

tobbinator,During the Spanish Civil War it was used not only by the Left wing elements within the Republic but also by some of the Right Opposition in the Republic Orwell in Homage to Catalonia describes it just as the antifascist salute implying that it had become a symbol of those in opposition to Franco who was seen as a fascist by those on the Loyalist side As for why it seems to have become a strong emblem of the Spanish Civil War Id say that would be because of the strength and size of the left wing militias the CNTaligned Durruti Column alone had  militiamen in  as well as the very ideological nature of the war as a whole internationally it was seen as a defence of democracy and freedom fighting against a fascist menace due to the attraction the Republic had towards many intellectuals and journalists including Hemingway Picasso and Orwell who were heavily involved in the conflict In addition theres the very romanticised view of the revolutionaries who were met with surprising success but crushed and International Brigadiers who went to a foreign land to fight an ideological enemy voluntarily ,0,cdmduqi,1rcv5e,askhistorians,new,2,2
thebullfrog,TLDR No not how the alliance worked wouldnt make sense for Japan impossible to pull off Formal military plans no In fact it would be very unlikely for the two Axis powers to discuss any such plans as an important part of NaziJapanese relations was that the two empires did not overlap From the Nuremberg trials we have this copy httpwwwholocausthistoryorgworksimthtmthtmsize of a Nazi Order outlining what cooperation would mean The two realms would remain entirely separate working together economically and its important to note that nowhere in the document is the Middle East or even India a necessary precursor to Japanese intervention in the Middle East mentioned Two other major reasons why this plan wouldnt be considered is the strategic goals of the TriPartite Pact and the feasibility For Nazi Germany Japanese involvement was crucial in that it tied down British colonial forces which it did quite successfully in its invasions of Burma and Singapore By invading Burma Britain was forced to maintain a garrison within its important territory of India limiting the amount of reinforcements it could send to fight in the Mediterranean theatre This actually worked by  India Command had mostly stopped sending forces to fight in the North African campaign or to defend the Middle East and were focused entirely on defending India from an invasion from Burma which they successfully repelled two years later Japans conquest in SouthEast Asia particularly within Burma were focused on accomplishing both the goal of hampering the British ability to attack Japan in the Pacific Theatre but also for the strategic resources particularly the oil fields that could be obtained in Burma Regarding feasibility this has as much to do with timing as anything Japans invasion of Burma was complete in  With the Pacific Theatre beginning it would be imprudent of Imperial Japan to devote further resources to attack India not to mention the subsequent garrisoned British lands in Persia and then Iraq In addition on the Nazi side a linkup would require devoting more personnel to the North Africa campaign to win the Battle of ElAlamein thereby gaining access to Egypt and through it the Middle East Greater cooperation between the Nazi and Japanese militaries could have proved beneficial to the Axis war plans but were never a major focus for either country For a while joint attack on the Soviet Union on both fronts was an option but never occurred and Japan was not included in the Operation Barbarossa planning or execution Any such action would have likely changed the face of the war between the USSR and the Nazis as the Soviets were able to bring in reinforcements from the East that had been protecting against such a threat The absence of this threat was confirmed repeatedly through espionage In the end any such plans would have been highly unfeasible and if the situation was changed such that they could actually link up in the Middle East it would probably be tactically unsound to do  ,0,cdmjufc,1rcwqk,askhistorians,new,2,2

xiyangyang,At the time China had a very large population of lower class people and Communist ideas were very appealing Many people were drawn to the idea that the bourgeois were evil because they were on a higher class Thus the idea of removing such evils grew into the huge movement it became because of the idea of total social equality and its appeal to the lower class Doctors teachers scholars etc were persecuted because of their higher education and class Eventually religion art etc was attacked not only because they were seen as superstition and an instrument of the ruling class but also because it was reminiscent of the old society In addition the removal of any sources of culture and ideas other than the Communist Party helped solidify their hold on China Children were taught from an early age that Communism was the greatest and this brainwashing created the idea that anything from the old society was bad and they were encouraged to work hard for this new utopia NonCommunist people and ideas were foreign and threats to Chinese society so they were destroyed So to answer your question many people were taught that Communism was the only way as well as a sign of hope for the lowerclass The increasing fanaticism for Communism as well as the intensifying view of culture and religion as instruments of rulingclass power and also as foreign threats created the increasing need to destroy all signs of it,6,cdm4j7u,1rd4yf,askhistorians,new,11,5

Maklodes,Monarchy as a system of government predated Christianity in Europe and existed in places where Christianity and monotheism in general never had much influence Macedon and the diadochi successor states were all monarchic well before Christianity Rome basically became a monarchy thirty years before Jesus was born and was a monarchy for about  years before it became Christian Some of the Germanic kingdoms that arose in the west after the collapse of Roman authority created their kingdoms before they were Christianized such as the AngloSaxons and the Franks The Goths though were Christian albeit a somewhat heretical variety Arian before they conquered significant territory Outside of Europe of course kingdoms like Japan and Thailand have had monarchic governments without Christianity or any other monotheistic theologyThe interaction between religion and politics has been very complex in Europe A Europe that retained its old pagan beliefs or which had embraced some Eastern faith not rooted in the Abrahamic tradition such as the Mithraic mysteries would have been a very different place in unpredictable ways However I see no reason to think the institution of monarchy needed Christianity to survive,0,cdm5mfw,1rd9xe,askhistorians,new,6,6

Maklodes,Well of course theres the fact that the conquest of Gaul enabled Caesars political career to reach the level it did both in giving him money for bribery and such and in giving him a popular reputation as a war hero Depending on your view this might have lead to the destruction of the Republic and the creation of the Principate You could argue that the transformation was preordained from the time Sulla crossed the Rubicon and Marius reorganized the army to have a structure favoring loyalty to generals more than loyalty to the state or you could argue that there was nothing inevitable about it even after Caesars death until Octavian actually started using the title of princeps but many people see Caesar as having a pretty big roleOne argument from William McNeills History of Western Civilization that I found intriguing is the claim that the Roman conquest of Gaul ultimately lead to deterioration of the rural Roman economy Gaulish vineyards drove Italian vineyards out of business,0,cdm5aua,1rdei0,askhistorians,new,2,2

LordSariel,I cannot comment on the exact number of Union vs Confederate memorials in the country but Ive recently been scholastically exploring the concept of History of Memory Its especially relevant in French History but I actually got started on the subject based on the Lost Cause Narrative that arose following the American Civil War and relates to your topic about how the war is remembered in terms of physical statues or monumentsIt has been noted by Historians like Caroline Janney that the Civil War is the only war in which the losers have written the History instead of the Winners The socalled Lost Cause Narrative sought to attach a justification to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people for a cause that ultimately proved unattainable Janney points especially to General Order No  issued by Confederate General Robert E Lee which was read to his troops the day after Appomattox  The speech hails them for being brave survivors of so many hard fought battles and ultimately concludes that his army was compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources fielded by the North Basically the origin of the claim that Southerners clung to roughly summarized as we had fought valiantly and we tried but we were overrun One that deliberately ignored many of the much more structural problems of the Confederacy and their racialized goals Her book which is incredibly fascinating and titled Remembering The Civil War goes on to unpack the development of the LostCause Narrative and highlights how the Civil War came to be remembered as the War of Northern Aggression by the Southerners A brief summary of her argument is that the Northern policies during reconstruction actually framed and favored the ultimate renegotiation of the Wars legacyCaroline Janney Remembering The Civil War Also read Drew Gilpin Fausts This Republic of Suffering to better comprehend the sheer amount of death and destruction that was wrought by the conflict and why both sides needed to secure a justificationHope some of this answers the question as to why there may be more Confederate statues ,7,cdmcsdz,1rdjfq,askhistorians,new,66,59
tinyshadow,This is a very interesting question As a starting point it should be noted that many Northern battlefields and Northern towns did not allow any decorations or memorials for the Confederate cause or Confederate dead For example at Gettysburg the first Confederate monument was erected in  to the nd Maryland Infantry CSA and met a great deal of resistance from the battlefield commission authorities After this monument the next seems to have been in  and after that Confederate veterans stop doing regimental monuments and started doing state monuments at Gettysburg SourcehttpwwwgettysburgstonesentinelscomConfederateMDphp Likewise only until  after the SpanishAmerican War did Arlington National Cemetery make a section for Confederate war dead SourcehttpwwwarlingtoncemeterymilvisitorinformationMonumentMemorialsConfederateaspxBut what is certainly true about the South is that those who carried its legacy were tenacious and absolutely reveled in marking and memorializing the Lost Cause By  three organizations the Ladies Memorial Association the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the United Confederate Veterans had undertaken a movement across the South to honor Confederate veterans They dotted the entire South with markers and monuments These range in size and material they can be as big as state buildings or as small as a plaque they can be marble fieldstone bronze iron etc As one encyclopedia notes The most common style is a shaft supported by a pedestal and topped by the figure of a Confederate soldier but other styles include obelisks columns boulders arches tablets cenotaphs fountains benches and even one totem pole SourcehttpwwwgeorgiaencyclopediaorgarticleshistoryarchaeologyconfederatemonumentsMany monuments to the Confederacy were built immediately after the war in the s and s They did not stop building then however and continued into the th and now st centuryTo use one state as an example lets take Georgia and show the breakdown for Confederate monumentbuilding   monuments     monuments    monuments   more monuments Now these dont include smaller works such as plaques or simple memorials Instead these are large monuments SourcehttpwwwgeorgiaencyclopediaorgarticleshistoryarchaeologyconfederatemonumentsAt Gettysburg many of the Confederate monuments were built around the reunion years think anything ending in  and the big centennial in  This suggests that while the North has perhaps eased off its Civil War memory the South continued to push ahead and try to get more monuments and memorials for the Confederate deadThese are the inchronologicalorder dedication dates for the Confederate monuments at Gettysburg Virginia    North Carolina    Alabama    Georgia   South Carolina   Florida    Texas    Arkansas    Louisiana   Tennessee   Mississippi   Maryland  In contrast the seemingly most common time period for Union monuments built at Gettysburg was around  West Virginias seem a little late in  All in all this proves the point the North finished most of its memorial making early on but the South continued for a long long long time and in some places even continues today,4,cdmdi0v,1rdjfq,askhistorians,new,36,32
Shartastic,Finally something I can answer I dont have the concrete numbers but I can state with almost positive certainty that yes this is trueThe interesting thing is that most of the Confederate monuments didnt go up until the ss The most prominent groups erecting these monuments were womens organizations like local Ladies Auxiliary Clubs and the most common group after their organization in  the United Daughters of the ConfederacyThe early monuments which went up immediately after the war were small plaques and such that were put in cemeteries Especially in areas under heavy rule in Reconstruction some of these monuments tried to divorce the soldier from the war praising him for his courage without mentioning the cause But for the most part there were few of these early monuments as the aid organizations for the veterans again mostly organized by women had the dilemma of bread or stone  that is they could either spend their money to put up monuments for the dead or they could feed the living veterans Most opted to spend more on the living veterans so this early period  sees only small muted monuments mostly in cemeteriesAfter the failure of Reconstruction which is another topic in itself but for the point of this Ill generalize with just that there was another push for national unification in spirit Most of white America was able to reform a common bond while trying to put the issues of the past behind them but of course this new unity just further cemented the racial hierarchy present in the nation So it was during this nadir of race relations  when most of the monuments were erected praising the Confederate dead There was a spirit of nostalgia that swept the country and veterans from both sides would often meet to reminisce over their shared experiences There was a new mythology of the Confederate cause that began to emerge during this time which was now being permanently erected on the landscape in granite The monuments of this period were often grander had plaques not only honoring the Confederate soldier but offering some explanation of why he fought generally using the kind of vague terminology that means something different to whoever is reading the plaque The key difference now though is that these monuments were also now being placed in public spaces In front of city halls in downtown parks in front of court houses state capitols etc The memory of the war is no longer something that you would go to a cemetery to reflect on in private tranquility Now its a matter of public celebration Not only that but its meant to instruct the community as to how they should feel about and honor the Confederate deadcause This last point is the most salient especially in areas with large black populations Not only were they already being oppressed through Jim Crow laws and lynchings but now they had to regularly view monuments to the soldiers who fought for the country that wanted to keep them in chains The Confederate memorialization impulse mostly died off after World War I I dont quite remember why right now but I can recommend a few books that cover these topics succinctlyTo end though Ill cite some of my favorite UDC monuments First as I mentioned with the monuments not only honoring a white supremacist past I use this loaded term loosely to mean a past in which whites were dominant over blacks the monuments also served as active tools for white supremacy as well The UDC put up many water fountains in Southern city parks each with its plaque honoring the Confederate dead as well as them always being placed in pairs one labelled ColoredMy favorite is the one in Union City TN only because most monuments use vague terms honoring the brave sacrifice of the soldier in the most noble cause or protecting the values that he believed in never actually defining the cause or values but they were wellknown in the mind of the Southern reader The one for Obion CountyhttpiimgurcomdEEoUiOjpg on the other hand is quite explicit in exactly what it means It honors the soldier who was killed in battle who was starved in federal prison and who has preserved AngloSaxon civilization in the South er Ive done extensive research on the topic of Confederate monuments and the memory of war so Id be happy to answer anything else if I can Or provide more monument pictures since Ive got thousands that I took during the course of my research Or just provide books if youd like to read about it yourself ,1,cdmdbdt,1rdjfq,askhistorians,new,24,23

panzerkampfwagen,The Germans never transitioned into a total war economy  According to Ian Kershaw it was just political rhetoric by Goebbels  Women were never really seriously put into the work place  Even when Goebels and Speer were fighting over how many men to remove from the factories there doesnt seem to really have been any discussion on replacing those men with women  In regards to bombing it turned Germany into a living hell  The Dehousing Bombing Campaign Terror Bombing destroyed a majority of houses in dozens of German cities  A huge  of Germanys population ended up homeless and the bombing was pretty relentless  However again according to Ian Kershaw the bombing didnt cripple the German economy  The production of war goods increased as the bombing increased and it wasnt until Germany lost the lands in which they gained resources and the factories sat that their production crashed  ,1,cdmap6a,1rdyon,askhistorians,new,16,15

gnomemania,Good afternoon Dr PottsI am interested in the idea of restoring and displaying art that is uncovered via noninvasive xray imaging For example earlier this year the Getty had a mockup of Rembrandts Old Man in Military Costume transported and scanned to see if they could obtain a better image of an underlying portrait If the hidden painting was such that it could be recreated or restored somehow do you feel that preliminary work has a place in the museum too or only the finished product And what causes a museum to look for hidden works behind an established painting other than noticing the under layers during restoration I think the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam did their entire collection and found a good percentage contained underlying works  would the Getty ever do the same if it hasnt already Thank you for doing this AMA I hope youve enjoyed your first year at the Getty ,0,cdms06d,1re3pm,askhistorians,new,3,3

gingerkid,Because they werent starting from scratch  Its a very common misconception that Israel was willed into existence by the Western powers and UN but thats the final chapter of how Israel came to exist  Thats what I suspect youre talking about when you say that it popped into existence and immediately had independence declared upon it though I think you have a typo in there which I corrected based on what I think you meant  Independence had been hoped for for decades and the Jewish community declared it  Granted it was with the international goahead kindof but it wasnt externally controlledAs a consequence the Jewish community had various paramilitaries which had previously been involved in circumventing British restrictions on immigration fighting the British and fighting the Arabs  JewishArab violence had been ungoing since the s  The largest and most mainstream of these the Haganah essentially became the IDF with the other more radical ones eventually folded in though not without problems  This meant that there was a significant proportion of local Jews who already had a command infrastructure and weaponsAn additional smaller point is that the war of independence didnt begin overnight  Violence had been escalating for the decadeish prior  Once the UN voted to partition the British essentially stopped being one of the sides in the conflict and the JewishArab violence intensified  While the nearby Arab countries didnt invade until independence the war was very much under way  It wasnt just various guerilla attacks either though neither side was fighting with a recognized or even declared state  See herehttpenwikipediaorgwikiECivilWarinMandatoryPalestineOn the political end things were controlled by the Jewish National Council together with the Jewish Agency which was sort of a representative body for the Jewish community in Palestine during the British Mandatory period  It functioned as sort of a protogovernment and became the provisional government of Israel until elections were held postwar  There were other national institutions around such as the Histadrut the Jewish labor union in Palestinetldr military and political ,2,cdmehg2,1re4ru,askhistorians,new,11,9

caffarelli,I think we have a couple of cooccurring influences on the history of American education that will help explain the relative lack of uniforms in public schools The main reason is because we have a long standing history of poor children attending school in America without a consistent source of funding for their schooling and their families could not afford uniforms  Schools are local affairs in America and essentially always have been and receive relatively little overarching influence from either a state or a federal level Modern American schools are organized on a school district level which is loosely by county but not strictly limited to that boundary In my hometown we had  major school districts who were pretty different in terms of policy but neither had uniforms and a private school which did have uniforms Decisions about uniformsno uniforms are made on a local district level Funding for schools was historically sort of cobbled together from taxes subscriptions from parents sliding scale and charitieshttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentshdswwinamericabeforethetrueestablishmentof If uniforms would have been adopted by an early school in th century America funding for these special school clothes would have had to fall on the parents and many on the low income scale couldnt have afforded it Most clothes for poor children in the th century would have been cutdown from used adult clothes a poor mother would have had to buy fabric and make a uniform for each child which was just not viable Cheap readymade clothing wasnt available to most people until the beginning of the th century  So weve got the possibility for uniforms with cheap readymade factory clothes at the start of the th century or so but where are they Now we must look at Americas widespread rural poverty Im talking the classic walkeduphillbothwaysinthesnow working on the farm in the summer one room schoolhouse s Depression schooling going on in this rural poverty This might be a bit of a mindbender but current school children maybe  year olds in many parts of America are only about  generations away from a oneroom schoolhouse So the greatgrandchildren of people who went to school in a oneroom schoolhouse Either my grandparents and their generation people now in their ss would have gone to school in their normal clothes or they wouldnt have gone at all Families in my area in the Midwest which is relatively rural simply could not have afforded school uniforms prior to maybe the s and old habits and cultural memories of poor times die hard  The first public school district to adopt uniforms in the US was The Long Beach Unified School District in httpenwikipediaorgwikiLongBeachUnifiedSchoolDistrictSchooluniformsandsinglegenderclasses Its almost  so Ill squeak it in with the yearrule but it very well demonstrates that public school uniforms requiring a relatively high amount of disposable income for the majority of school families PLUS a good readymade market have only been a viable option pretty recently in American history  WorkingClass Dress Barbara Burman Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion Ed Valerie Steele Vol   Detroit Charles Scribners Sons  p ,2,cdmsrbp,1re57d,askhistorians,new,20,18

Commustar,West Africa   Everything I have read suggests that Roman trade on this front consisted of exchanging goods at Roman trading posts with berber traders of the Garamantes kingdom centered in the Fezzan region of southwestern Libya       There seem to be two schools of thought on the Garamantes One school of thought as expressed by Katya Schorle in Saharan Frontierss Space and Mobility in Northwest Africa in chapter  Saharan Trade in Classical Antiquity holds that the Garamantes were a centralized kingdom that established well regulated trade routes spanning from the Roman frontier to the Middle Niger region This theory naturally lends credence to the idea of merchants making the entire trek from the region of Carthage all the way across the sahara to DjenneDjenoOn the other hand Sonja Magnavita presents the view in this articlehttpafriquesrevuesorg that trade was downtheline That is that trade items were carried from oasis to oasis where they changed hands many times Thus the merchant that brought the beads found at Kissi in Burkina Faso would be far removed from whomever first brought these beads south across the Roman frontier Whatever is the truth there is no written evidence that would suggest that a Roman trader would have made it deep into the Sahara Although an inventive explanation for that advanced by some scholars is that Roman and Byzantine merchants did not write down such travels in order to maintain trade secretsBarring an extraordinary discovery of a written testimony we wont be able to say conclusively that a Roman either did or did not travel deep into the SaharaEast Africa We are much more fortunate in our sources here The Periplus of the Erythrean Sea is a travelogue that discusses the coasts of the Red Sea Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean focusing on the ports cultures and trade items likely to be encountered The Periplus most likely dates to the midst century CE and its author seems to from Roman Egypt The Periplus describes ports beyond the horn of africa and down the coast of East Africa which the author locates as Azania It is somewhat difficult to be certain where the locations referred to are located now Unfortunately there has been a decided lack of archaeological research about this time period in Eastern AfricaHowever some circumstantial support for the Periplus is the fact that there have been finds of Roman trade items along the western coast of India and even some indications of Roman contact along the eastern coast of India So it certainly seems feasible that the Romans may have reached the coast of East Africa perhaps as far as Mogadishu or even further,0,cdojayb,1rek43,askhistorians,new,2,2
SamuelGompers,First taxes do not equal communism One can support all sorts of leftwing ideas and not be a communist in fact you can be virulently anticommunist There is no transitive property in public policy as useful a propaganda tool as that idea may be There are many examples of groups within the postwar American liberal coalition fracturing over the issue of Communism such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations and more specifically the United Auto Workers To look more politically the Democratic Party split three ways in  first over the issue of race leading to Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats and second among many reasons over the issue of how the United States should deal with communism and the Soviet Union leading to Henry Wallace and the Progressive Party Second American public policy changed drastically during World War II There are several ways to pay for a war which includes borrowing money raising taxes and printing money During WWII the US government preferred the first two options relying on significant hikes in marginal tax rates and borrowing money from the American public through War Bonds Remember also that there are multiple types of taxes not just the income tax they talk about in Mad Men my favorite show by the way Corporate taxes also went up during the war both as a method of funding and as an attempt to prevent profiteering Many of these taxes remained in place in some form or another after the war in an attempt to bring down the debt the Government had incurred To another degree these taxes were also used to fund the expanded programs of the postNew Deal state though signature programs like Social Security often had their own dedicated taxes outside of the standard income taxAdditionally it is important to bear in mind the difference between the marginal tax rate and to know what marginal rates mean and the effective tax rate Basically though someones income may have put them in a bracket where part of their income was taxed at above  percent through various deductions and loopholes as well as the fact that marginal rates by definition only apply to part of ones income the effective total rates were much lower than the highest marginal rate was It is even more important to know that there were many more income brackets as far as personal income taxes were concerned For example in  there were seven tax brackets in  there were twenty four Additionally the vast majority of these tax brackets were well above the median income incomes in the highest brackets were also very rare  In  this is as early as Census info goes median income was approximately  This would put the median family in the second tax bracket again out of twenty four the marginal rate of which was  percent The vast majority of Americans were not affected by the tax rates which the elite class which Mad Men for the most part portrays paidNow there was always resistance to this type of policy from a traditional conservative movement within the Republican Party which opposed such taxes and programs on principle though would begrudgingly accept them to do things like pay off war debt This faction of the Republican Party however was out of power for most of the midth century For a good history of the changing nature of American political coalitions see these two comments herehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsnolzzwhywastheresuchahugeshiftinthecorecckrkh The key was that conservatives also favored decreases in spending New ideas in economics however namely E Cary Browns concept of a full employment budget led to a push to cut taxes from the left There is very bad trend of polemic history which calls John F Kennedy conservative for example because he cut taxes Kennedy did indeed pass the largest tax cut in decades but the motivation was to fix what he called a growth deficit IIRC I can pull out an econ history notebook if I really have to by stimulating consumer demand while maintaining levels of government spending I think it was Paul Samuelson who Kennedy sent to Congress to plead that taxes be cut without commensurate cuts in spending This type of demand side Keynesian tax cut however focused on the lowest brackets and not only kept a large number of brackets but kept rates within the top ones at high levels If you really want me to talk about the way Reagan type conservatives cut taxes with supply side justifications though Reagans rhetoric if not policy often echoed demand side reasoning I will consider it That period of time is the genesis of modern attitudes about taxes as well as the drastically reduced number of brackets ,3,cdmpy0l,1ren5a,askhistorians,new,44,41

MootMute,All historians are bound by their own biases of course no matter if theyre Western or not Its true that much of Western historiography on Communist leaders like Stalin or Mao are very little more than propaganda pieces  intentional or not but not very accurate all the same Upon realising this some people look towards nonwestern or nonmainstream views on the subject  but these often just swing in the opposite direction Ive actually got a book here called A different view on Stalin While it does dispel some of the myths about the man propagated in mainstream historiography its also blatantly written by a Stalinist looking to whitewash history While Im not saying the answer is in the middle its not when reading about Mao youll have to be acutely aware of the controversial nature of pretty much every work about him Look for works by authors that dont have a point to prove either way  a good rule of thumb is to look for the most boring works Historians that are devoted to the Rules of Historiographytm tend to pay close attention to their personal bias even though they are problematic in their own right And finally know that one workbook will never be enough to paint an accurate picture,1,cdmjjqu,1reokh,askhistorians,new,8,7
ggorillagorilla,With China and especially with the Cultural Revolution an equally appropriate question is whether Chinese sources can be trusted  The current Chinese leadership after all is militantly antiCultural Revolution  The very people who were targeted are now in a position of power economically and politically  The idea of harmony which explicitly disallows any classbased attacks on wealth and privilege is basically the new state ideology see the recent trial of Bo Xilai  So this is not to say that the many accounts of the excesses of the Cultural Revolution are made up but rather that there is a definite bias in both China and the West towards viewing the period as unmitigated disaster and chaos  ,0,cdmqpyc,1reokh,askhistorians,new,1,1

backgrinder,There are lots of great answers here covering the advent of the  and  workday My first thoughts on reading the question were on the alternatives particularly in medieval Europe and Rome where days off were governed by a complicated calendar of feast days I know in medieval Europe the weekend started with a half day on Sabbaths eve followed by a day of rest for the Sabbath Day Church services would often be that evening with the following full day off dedicated as a day of rest There were also around  Feast days each year with work ending early the day before and the Feast day itself being a day off Around  days off and  half days versus a modern  full days off for weekends plus any vacation time Medievals also worked a lot less in winter The shorter weekend probably sounds harsh to many modern people but when I think of how many busy activities most of us try to cram into a weekend versus a full day of rest Im not sure the medievals didnt have a lot more actual down time The Romans didnt have a weekend but they did have a lot of feast days so many that some months were essentially half months They also had longer festivals like Saturnalia The Apollo Games Cerialia Parentalia and others that lasted up to a week at a time The Romans had ample time off and plenty of fun and free leisure activities to fill it with Better off than moderns in that respectA website with a list of Medieval English Feast Days httphistoryofenglandtypepadcomblogfeastdaysinmedievalenglandhtmlA website with a list of Roman Feast Days httpwwwunrvcomcultureromanfestivalsphp,1,cdms2rh,1rf0lb,askhistorians,new,18,17
throneofflies,From my understanding ancient Romans would work every day starting at dawn but most would be done with work by midday or so At least in the later imperial period this was both a pragmatic reaction to the heat and a cultural urge to hit the bathsgames The cooler months might see more afternoon economic activity especially for merchants Some market festivals lasted days would go through the night and merchants would pack in as many hours as they could to maximize profitsOne of the most consistent working environments was the court Courts were ubiquitous popular to observe and in operation year round They lasted from dawn to late afternoon They were probably the most consistent sources of hourly drudgery outside of the  hour shift in an Andalucian mine perhaps but even the courts ended at sunset Everyone would be home and their door would be secured by night fall Almost no one but the cart drivers  deliverers would work past sunsetImportantly Holidays were so frequent and the observance of them was so fluid that there was no formalized structure as to which days of the week were working days and which days were definitely not working days During the early imperial period there were just as many holidays as regular working days Working in ancient Rome in short no consistency a few days ona few days day off,0,cdmvtwy,1rf0lb,askhistorians,new,3,3

Spinoza,The liberal turn of the British Quakers was quite a reversal In the s and s the British Quakers had started to move towards a more Evangelical position Members who questioned the importance of the Bible or of Jesus resurrection were censured or sometimes removed from the Society Meetings that had been mostly or completely silent for years or decades were stirred up by inspired speakers who refocused the Quakers attention to the Bible and the figure of JesusBut by  the British Quakers had completely turned this around For many Christianity became not much more than heritage and the British Yearly Meeting as a whole began to accept that such a view existed within it Quakerism became more of a way of life than a message This stunning reversal of fortunes of the liberals and the evangelicals can be explained by a third group which switched its allegiance the traditionalists Early on the traditionalists had supported the evangelicals fearing that the liberal criticisms of Bible and Jesus would destroy the Quakers as a Christian organization The evangelicals support of reading the bible in meeting and other forms of more programmed meeting might be constructed as innovation but if it would ensure that unsound doctrine would be compensated by sound and Christian religion then so be itBut the evangelicals overplayed their hand In  American Evangelical Quakers had made a joint statement the Richmond Declaration In  this statement was submitted to the British Yearly Meeting where it met with resistance The declaration was seen as a creed and as giving too little recognition of the inner light This marked a turning point for the traditionalists who came to see the evangelicals as a greater threat to the Quaker identity than the liberals Over the next thirty years British Quakerism would be modernized spectacularly and completely change its relationship to the rest of Christianity and the wider worldThe question remains whether this movement would have happened without the Richmond Declaration as well The modern world was challenging all Christian denominations which meant that sooner or later all of them had to choose to either accept modernity or contrast themselves to it That the British Quakers chose to largely accept it is surprising and that they largely rejected the evangelical spirit of the third great awakening is altogether baffling The discussion of the Richmond Declaration really seems to be a turning point,3,cdmxvxw,1rf8su,askhistorians,new,11,8

LordSariel,Many people dont know this but the initial FrancoAmerican Alliance of  was not a planned eventBenjamin Franklin and his fellow diplomats Silas Deane and Arthur Lee were sent to France with a Model Treaty draft that was ratified by Congress in  This draft and the orders that accompanied it explicitly stated that the Commissioners to Paris were to seek a commercial alliance with France In the minds of Congress this commercial diplomacy would infuse the American cause with some much needed money and simultaneously increase American credit abroad Ideally this would allow for money to build and crew ships to protect an increase in shipping as well as allow the United States to purchase supplies on their own in Europe To compound this Congress deliberately tried to avoid any entanglement in the complex web of European affairs hoping for a purely capitalist allianceHowever upon arrival in France the Commissioners were woefully unprepared to meet this steep task and the virtually nonexistent US navy was scarcely a match for the British domination of the High Seas So in an unprecedented change of tact Franklin pursued and successfully negotiated a political alliance in addition to the commercial one This explicitly brought France into the war on behalf of the United States but was on friendly terms and without sacrificing too much autonomy of the nascent American Union More importantly Franklin did this without the knowledge of the Congress who had not received any of his dispatches  months prompting some historians to call the diplomacy the great improvisation,3,cdn8eae,1rf8su,askhistorians,new,8,5

earthpresidentnixon,I apologize if this reads as a bit cobbledtogether but I hope its at least in the direction of what youre looking for My main sources are Nicholas Sammonds Babes in Tomorrowland and Steven Watts The Magic Kingdom but most criticism of classic Disney films usually has a lot of interesting history as well I also recommend Richard SchickelThe image of Disney that both he and his company worked so hard to perpetuate is that the man embodied essentially American values Sammond includes a very interesting quote from Fortune magazine in  which profiled Disney and described him as combining Abraham Lincolns humble origins and work ethic Horatio Algers entrepreneurial determination and Henry Fords industrial efficiency and management His early animation here Im referencing everything from the s until  is characterized by a number of conventions particularly sentimentality and the satirization of high cultural signifiers Essentially the themes of Disneys films were populist Disney was one of us he didnt go in for the highbrow and elitist his interests and preoccupations were folksy humorous and common and the sources of much of his stories were popular folklore Even the phrase Silly Symphonies suggests highbrow entertainment being brought to a popular level Consider the role of the movie theater in s and s America this was a cheap form of entertainment that was not only accessible by but hugely popular with every class The most popular stars of the era were those who frequently played downontheirluck characters Mary Pickford Charlie Chaplin Shirley Temple a bit later This was a format that was constructing Americanness while simultaneously perpetuating it selfdenial and delayed gratification hard work consistent humour supplemented by emotional depth However early films were immoral the lives of movie stars famously dissolute Fatty Arbuckle in  the introduction of the Hays Code in  and there was a tremendous debate about the role and influence of these films on the minds of young people a particularly influential study from  compared the effect of movies on the minds of young people to the effect of World War I on the minds of combatants Whats important here is that people believed that the types of films children saw would influence the type of people those children would becomeEnter Disney who provides reliably moral genuinely entertaining film that quickly becomes very technologically sophisticated and appears to perpetuate real American values not only of the success of scrappy underdogs and the virtues of thrift and perseverance in his films but also through the image of himself perpetuated through a staggering amount of product licensing even in the midthirties Disney characters were mischievous certainly but they were clean and happy romantic yet sexless Mickey Mouses eyeballs never popped out of his head when big titted Minnie sang jazz for example Basically if your kids went to see Disney films they might grow up to become like him so you were quite happy to let them spend their afternoons at the theater Magazines like Photoplay profiled him quite breathlessly It also really is hard to overstate his influence on film and animation technology but also on the general shape of film narrative if you take a bit of time to watch pre animation on Youtube   the release of Steamboat Willie it really is astonishing how well primitive and even amateur it appears compared to even Disneys earliest work Tex Avery and Chuck Jones who worked on Looney Tunes for Warner Bros in the thirties did great work but in general it was a case of other studios desperately trying to keep up with Disney Max Fleischer Betty Boop is pretty much the only person who could come close and he didnt have the marketing strength of the Disney Studio behind himAlso the image the studio perpetuated of itself in the thirties played a significant role in the public perception of Disney the man The studio workers were simultaneously depicted as Im borrowing Sammonds words here models of industrial efficiency and members of one big happy family with Walt as their avuncular leader The Fordist philosophy of manufacturing was of course still very much the ideal at that time so imagine the significance of the Disney Studio during the Great Depression a success story both in terms of industrial output and the warmth and sentimentality of family life The release of Snow White sort of cemented everything too it was a huge artistic gamble and still remains one of the most successful animated films of all time in terms of artistic influence Sergei Eisenstein and Orson Welles both cited it as an influenceBasically what you have so far is Disneys concept of himself as a quintessential American artistmanufacturer relentlessly marketed He undoubtedly believed it himself and for the most part it was trueContinuing briefly into the fifties and sixties when the Studios animated films were uneven and sometimes floundering Disney himself hosted tv shows like The Wonderful World of Disney His various nature shows were testaments to the ideas of the Wild West and the American frontier helping cement Disneys image as a real American treasure and his Buckminster Fullerful vision for the future of America geodesic domes everywhere were popular and people believed only a matter of time Disney intended to be at the forefront of that development He was both visionary and traditionalDespite his apparently populist thematic preoccupations however people like to talk about Disneys antiunion leanings To be sure he was very antiunion After the success of Snow White Disney didnt promote or give raises but gave salary adjustments to the animators he considered the most exceptional In  his animators went on strike after but not because he accused the union leader of being a Bolshevik After the strike was finally resolved Disney the individual largely gave up on pushing the big happy family picture of the Studio everyone knew it wasnt true but mostly Disney didnt feel like he could trust anyone anymore Later fulllength films arent directed by him instead he later committed himself to television Theres no question that he was immensely unpopular among the animators that left after the strike although a few of them eventually came backWhat is interesting to note here is that despite the glee of the other studios at the apparent crumbling of the Disney Family the animators union was first formed when Max Fleischer fired every one of his staff animators who had signed with an artists union Warner Bros was also very unhappy with the new union and tried to lock them out but failed Disneys animators preSnow White were among the best paid in the industry but the production of Snow White was so risky and bloated that they all had to take large paycuts and work overtime when the film was successful they were understandably bitter that things werent put back to rights Being antiunion was pretty par for the course in the late thirties and forties sadly Disney was not the exception to the ruleAnyway thats all I can tell you about the man himself I havent read Neal Gablers biography which is supposed to be fantastic but I do know that his daughter was infuriated by its publication and the negative image of him she believed it portrayed Insofar as he can be judged good or bad Disney was one of a breed of American industrial capitalist comparisons to Henry Ford and Rockefeller are apt ruthless but determined I dont know if its true whether or not hed go around randomly accusing his dissident workers of being Communist but its certainly true that he was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in the s along with prominent film industry right wingers like John Wayne and Clark Gable and Hedda Hopper and Ayn Rand which was extremely antiCommunist and a big support of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee the blacklist I think its important to judge him independently of what the Disney Studio has become you can chalk up a lot of the evil commonly associated with it now to Michael Eisner who arguably was trying to follow in Walts footsteps but obviously was about sixty years out of dateHope that helpsEdit breaking up the wall of text but also in response to charges of antiSemitism and racism Ive heard the antiSemitic stuff before mostly that he and Leni Riefenstahl were good friends and that he was bitter because a Jewish producer had stolen his Oswald character both of these are unsubstantiated although he did like Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will pre but Neal Gabler denies that he was any more antiSemitic than his contemporaries As for racism again all the evidence Ive read or seen doesnt suggest tendencies any more racist than his contemporaries People point to Song of the South and the crows in Dumbo but these works seem to me to be motivated by a obviously woefully misguided attempt at humour rather than to denigrate Blacks In many ways Walt was way ahead of his times in others he was very much a product of them,8,cdmwfdt,1rfd7h,askhistorians,new,62,54

ArtemisSolie,The best book I can recommend you on Walt Disney is Neal Gablers Walt Disney The Triumph of The American Imagination Within it Gabler goes into extensive detail on every aspect of Walts life drawing on first hand sources as well as second hand account of what it was like to live and work with Walt From my understanding of Gabler Walt Disney was a product of not only his time but his upbringing Raised into a distinctively religiously conservative family Walt was likely discouraged from interaction with people of different skin colour sexual orientations or even religions I also recall Gabler commenting on the extreme discipline that Walt faced from his father perhaps pointing towards why he was a controlling or somewhat forcefully organized person His upbringing coupled with the extremely racist era in which he lived his prejudice is quite obvious Perhaps you should ask yourself thenWas every white person precivil rights movement a bad person The answer would be No They were simply ignorant and unaware Walts extreme influence on the American way of life and public media can perhaps be used as an argument against the answer here but the fact remains that Walt was merely a product of his upbringing and times ,0,cdmwge7,1rfd7h,askhistorians,new,4,4

ArtemisSolie,The where and how is a bit difficult to pinpoint as religious art of martyrs has always been popular In my own expirence of the Catholic faith my first answer to this would be to think of St John The Baptistbut when we look at imagery of him he is oftentimes not in fact shown holding his own headrather it is on a platter as told in the story We then should look to other saints whose beheading helped define them in the history of saints It could be argued that the popularization of St Denis of Paris as noted by Butler in The Lives of the Saints was the patron saint of France and Bishop of Paris and perhaps serves as the answer to your question It is I would say St Denis whose figure popularized the cehpalophoric images youre referring to St Denis preached the word of Christianity and was ultimately beheaded for it but before dying he walked a substantial distance while holding his head or so the story goes thanks to his religious purity and divinity With a following dating to  AD it would be King Dagobert who would take St Denis sainthood to a nationalistic levelhttpwwwnewadventorgcathenahtmthis popularization from AD onward of course would mean the production of religious imagery corresponding to St Denis figure The popularization then of not just St Denis figure but the Catholic church in general we can see continued right up until the Reformation and the religious civil wars in France in the th century The St Denis Basilica today remains as a testament of his popularity in the th century  Imagery of St Denis holding his head date back to these times and is shown in the Notre Dame the St Denis Basilica and many other places in Paris such as Montmartre Cehpalophorism can also be seen referred to in literature such as Dantes th century Divine Comedy Sir Gwain and the Green Knight dating again to the th century and even more recently in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in which the black knight is reduced to no more than a talking head Overall I would say that the cehpalophoric saints depictions originated thanks to the popularization of St Denis between  AD and the th century in France ,0,cdmw3br,1rfllc,askhistorians,new,7,7
MarcusDohrelius,In  Pope John XVhttpiistockimgcomfilethumbviewapprovestockphotopopejohnxvjpg was the first pope to officially make someone a saint Until that point it had been a more localised veneration That doesnt mean that there was not some bolstering that took place from official recognition just that it wasnt a formalised process Cambridge Medieval history volume St Martin is a good place to start Saint Martin was not martyred nor did he ever carry his head around Why him Sulpicius account Sulpicius was his biographer And man did he sensationalise It almost reads like Martin of Tours was some sort of super hero Martin deflects fire Martin calls storms to raze idols Martin deflects a tree some pagans dropped on him etc there are dozens of examples like this dozenshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvlKievgUGdI  Scholars have different takes on Sulpicius account You have to take into account genre what is the truth is not always true and the historical context and purpose Clare Stancliffe has an excellent book called St Martin and his Hagiographer that is a very fair treatment Others like TD Barnes who is brilliant and at times divisive in the field seems to

Why is Martin relevant again The sensationalism The Edict of Milan in  changed everything Or at least it symbolises the great change brought on by Constantine This lead the way for great councils like the one at Nicaea in  Constantinople in  and Chalcedon in  Already in the early th century there is a sense of reverence for those that survived and were martyred in the great persecutions This usually is referring to the Diocletian persecution This lead to veneration and what better reminder of a blessed new age than a tangible reminder of the saints sacrifice Thus the rise of relics and things attributed to them Perhaps this was a workable model for a worshipful piety but things could get out of hand You have to remember that as literacy the spread and exchange of writings and the economy went downhill in Western Rome in late antiquity people reverted much more to an agrarian sustenance and localised way of life I am not arguing for a complete catastrophist way of looking at things only saying that there was a notable decline In many ways it is clear there was a decline even if there wasnt a fall Thus many of the fertility harvest maternity etc deities were replaced The god of the patron saint of This does not mean that saints were worshipped like the Christian God but just that their function may have in some instances replaced earlier pagan tradition This is not an

would remain a really popular genre even into later medieval England with the Carolingian renaissance reintroducing Latin accounts This is probably where accounts like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

converted Pantaleon implored heaven to forgive them for which reason he also received the name of Panteleemon the allcompassionate It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead himNicasius Bishop of th century RheimsNicasius was beheaded by the Vandals It is said that he was reciting Psalm  when he was then decapitated as he said My soul is attached unto dust But then his

spanktruck,The answer is depends who you askOne theory is that people misunderstood burial customs that placed the skull on the torso which ehhhhhh There is a strong connection cephalophores with the miraculous deeds of martyred saintswaking up grabbing their beheaded head and going about their way In this way they follow the tradition of saints who survive against all odds lions quiet executioners take pity chains are loosed to the point that the saint in question was briefly able to overcome death cf Acts of Paul and Thecla If this is the case then the cephalophores are an extension of the martyr cult elaborated to such an extent that they manage to cheat death for a time to further devote themselves to the word of God As a subquestion of this was St Denis patient zero of this or was his headholding depictions merely the earliest known example of a train of religious thought that was known or gaining currency at the time especially in the symbolism of conquering deathAnother theory by Montgomery in the book Disembodied Heads in Medieval and Early Modern Culture links cephalophores and the practice of gathering parts of saints in reliquaries Thomas Aquinas was apparently beheaded after death th century so as to gather relics from his body Montgomery links cephalophores with the rise of relics and reliquaries which itself seems to date from late antiquity as this article on Victricius stateshttponlinelibrarywileycomdoiabstract and which itself leads to the cult of the saints famously explored in Browns The Cult of the Saints  For Montgomery then cephalophores in the model of St Denis who walked and not in the model of those saints that simply spoke the gospel without moving from place to place were an attempt to legitimize relics and locuses of power by imbuing their burial places with the spectre of their choice I find this unconvincing because Polycarp has people feasting at the graveside of martyrs so it already seemed relatively legitimate But I do like his idea of relicscephalophores being linked but perhaps not as causally as that According to Wendy Meyers introduction to her translation of the works of St John Chrysotom believers might attempt to be buried next to a martyr by the third century itself documented in the Life of Polycarp a noncanonical tale of a martyr Mayer argues that the cult of the saints is a distinctly nonChristian set of practicespilgrimages some works on violent death Maccabees engagement with the dead etc To quote Mayer gtIn association a distinct theology of relics and the resurrection arose which held that relics neither made a place impure my note a common belief at the time nor had a neutral impact but in fact purified the place where they resided a reversal of traditional beliefs which paved the way for the placement of relics initially inside places of worship and ultimately within churches located inside city precincts It is possible that St Denis was the first cephalophore saint alternatively cephalophore saints originated with martyrs including but not limited to Denis holding their heads as a symbol of their spiritual triumph over death since one of Jesus powersand a key component of the messianic eschatology seen in some but not all gospelsis the defeat of death For more Rosalind C Love has some excellent footnotes on the historiography of the question in her Three EleventhCentury AngloLatin Saints Lives  page  See also Boyarin Dying for God on how the martyrs sacrifice was interpreted as as an expression of Christian and nonChristian faith ,0,cdmx0a9,1rfllc,askhistorians,new,4,4

onthefailboat,There were a number of laws to try and limit the punishment of slaves to something fairly reasonable  If youre looking at Spanish colonies you have to start with the indigenous labor of the sixteenth century  Bartolome de las Casas wrote several tracts opposing native labor on religious and humanitarian grounds and instigated several laws like the New Laws and the Laws of the Indies  It should be mentioned however that he suggested African labor instead of native labor so how humanitarian he was is debatable  Spanish laws called cedulas were supposed to protect slaves and make sure that they converted to Catholicism but they were only occasionally enforced at the best of times  In Spanish colonies slaves could bring cases before courts andor the church against their master if they were being abused or not brought into the church which was very important to the Spanish  In fact there are examples of slaves using religion as a defense  My master is so abusive that he made me renounce God and go to the devil sort of thingThese laws were not terribly effective however  Many plantations were far away from the city where the courts were  Though an official was supposed to check out the plantation the fact of the matter is that they rarely did or could be bribed by the owner  Even in the city where slaves might have had access to the courts it was likely that the master would be believed over the slave unless there was overwhelming evidence of cruelty  During the th century the Spanish seem to have backed away from stopping the owners cruelty in favor of receiving more profit  Cuba had become their main source of sugar which was highly profitable  To keep sugar production high they let the owners do what was necessary to keep the slaves working  The mortality rate for sugar slaves was phenomenal because of the cruelty and drive of their owners but also because sugar production is destructive regardless  You can check out Kristen Blocks Ordinary Lives in the Early Caribbean or Manuel Barcias Seeds of Insurrection if you like for more detailed views,1,cdmvnxx,1rfmsi,askhistorians,new,6,5

FlavoredCrayons,Spains involvement in the Revolution proved to be very important Before officially joining the war in  the Spanish secretly supplied the rebels with much needed resources such as gunpowder This was conducted mostly via Spanish Louisiana When Spain actively joined the war in  they immediately played a key role The entrance of Spain as well as France gave them numerical advantages especially at sea The proximity of the French and Spanish threat to the British West Indies forced the British to stratify their military even further In addition the entrance of Spain in the war bolstered the threat of a mainland invasion of BritainThose factors can be described as passive sideeffects of the Spanish entrance in the war Spain did actively accomplish several objectives which directly aided the war effort One of the most successful ventures was the conquest of forts in the Mississippi valley and British West Florida  Bernado de Galves who you eluded to was the governor of Louisiana at the time He and many other Spaniards sought to recapture Florida which had been ceded to the British after the Seven Years War British Florida was a loyalist haven during the revolution as many loyalists flocked to the territory to avoid the conflict and persecutions It also served as a strategic stronghold and supply line of the Gulf Coast With this in mind Galvez sailed to the capital of West Florida Pensacola and captured it in  effectively gaining Spanish control over all of Florida East Florida was not as populous and considered an afterthought and the entire Gulf Coast This paid great dividends as it eliminated any chance for the British to use the Mississippi River not only for supplying troops by also denying them the chance to perform a western invasion So as we can see the Spanish did play a role in the revolution Did they effect the eventual outcome of the war Possibly but it can be safe to assume that French support outweighed Spanish in terms of significance This is not to say the Spanish efforts were not necessarily important Spanish support greatly diminishes British presence along the Gulf Coast and severed their access to the Mississippi As for Bernardo de Galves I know he was promoted to general after his capture of Pensacola so that may be the reason he marched by the side of Washington as he was an acting Spanish general However that is speculative and I dont know for sure    EDIT Grammar ,0,cdmunc8,1rfog1,askhistorians,new,6,6

pharmaceus,In what period From BC to AD American capitalism had absolutely nothing to do with it  in particular that I doubt that Aztec Maya or Inca cultures had capitalism let alone any contact with AsiaAlso regardless of whether you look for definition of capitalism to lassezfaire or marxist sources there is no such thing as American capitalism Capitalism is an economic system that can be and is applied almost anywhere Because there are cultural differences we can speak about x economic model or y economic model but it is largely incorrect to say Chinese capitalism American capitalism European capitalism To answer your question as I think you meant it  no American capitalism is not the result China for example had arguably in many ways higher standard of living than Europe until it got closed off from the rest of the world by Ming emperors in th century The standard of living in most of Europe was just as high as in America throughout most of XIX century and up until WW and Western interventions in China and Japan in XIX century were not just American interventions The British had much larger influence than Americans in ChinaThe comparison of standard of living of an average person in Asia and in America is difficult for a number of reasons and requires an indepth study that could fill a book There were some factors that made Asian societies a bit more backward socially  most importantly more archaic government and social class systems  but in any other sense they caught on very quicklyIt was WW that put a stop to that advance because of the eruption of civil war in China and then WW that had a devastating effect Most Americans are taught about how far more destructive the war was in Eastern Europe but rarely it is mentioned with respect to Asia The SinoJapanese war cost  million lives and war in the Pacific cost another  million if you count native populations of Philippines and Malaya   After that only some countries were blessed by American capitalism and those were Japan  which was a large and rapidly developing economy before WW Taiwan  which was in essence old preMaoist China on a small island South Korea  which was largely a copy of TaiwanJapan in a different culture Singapore  which became a citystate with its own economic model based on old British capitalism HongKong  which remained British territory with old British economic model until Those countries were pretty much responsible for their own standards of living regardless of American influence and their own choices affected how well they did develop As for the other side of American capitalism I would point out to Vietnam Laos Cambodia Philippines Indonesia and Malaysia which for the next  years after WW were under very strong influence of American capitalism but without introducing any reforms of their own They kept Americansupported dictators which killed millions of people or were bombed to dust by bombs made in American capitalist factories It wasnt until late s and s that some things began to change but still it is a far cry from any capitalism  let alone American oneHowever if you are asking whether capitalist economic solutions improved the standard of living in places where they have been introduced as opposed to noncapitalist solutions  yes But it has little to do with America and everything with economic efficiency and other things that a Scotsman called Smith wrote about in ,1,cdneerb,1rfrwi,askhistorians,new,1,0

DonaldFDraper,Hello this is a question that was somewhat asked by someone elsehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsqujnwasnapoleonachildoftherevolutionWith what I had said earlier in respect to Napoleon being a child of the Revolution I still asert that Napoleon is a more moderate continuation of the French Revolution He pushed reforms throughout the Empire and created many long lasting inovations like the Napoleonic CodeAgain it must be noted that Napoleon was a devout Jacobin and was arreste following the fall of Robespiere for being too Jacobin as the Directory was looking to purge the more radical elements of French politics Despite the royal titles I still see Napoleonic France as a continuation of Revolutionary France When Louis XVIII sat on the French throne he allowed people to purchase Legion of Honor medals and military commands Quickly the people were alienated and the constant warfare that Napoleon had endured seemed better than the Ancien Regieme Thus Napoleon was able to rally most of France behind him during his Hundred Days campaign desptie the fact that France was exhausted from over twenty years of nearconstant warIf theres anything to say what might give the best example of the spirit of the French Revolution in Napoleonic France it would be the Legion of Honor It could only be awarded to soldiers whom have shown extreme bravery and merit and was approved by Napoleon himself It couldnt be bought or awarded for no reason it was for the bravest of the braveIn the end I will argue that Napoleon was the moderate but final phase of the Revolution One where royality existed but anyone could become a noblegtOn a side note for a popular view of this look toward Les Miserables The father of Marius Pontmercy was awarded with a the title of Baron by Napoleon for retreiving five enemy standards and throwing it to The Emperors feat While a Colonel in the story the view is that Napoleon gave titles to those whom deserved it not because they were born into itgtA second side note most of the titles Napoleon handed out were victory titles not actual noble holdings Some were given thrones Bernadotte was Prince of Pontecorvo Berthier was Pince of Neuchâtel and Murat was King of Naples All three were French Marshals and shown their skill in battle but most of the titles were simply Prince of the Moskova Ney which entitled the holder to a heritary pension of a certain amount of money There are still people whom hold these titles the great grandchild of Massena wrote the introduction to Napoleons Marshals a collection of essays edited by David ChandlerEdited to include more information on the second side note,0,cdmu0cv,1rfv9q,askhistorians,new,5,5

Tellaris,DisclaimerSince this keeps popping up Im going to put this here Please do not try to discuss exactly how much alcohol during pregnancy has what effect or isis not safe It is a contentious question and is best not discussed here on a history focused subreddit This is a question that is better asked on raskscience It is also a somewhat a contentious topic in the science community as well Asking it here will get your post deletedEnd DisclaimerI want to start with saying that its very dubious to try and diagnose mental disorders based on historical writings take these with a grain of salt at bestFirstly lets start with a discussion of FASD itselfThis particular disorder has several particularly major symptoms to it Deformities of limbs deformities of the heart deformities of the face vision difficulties and hearing problems Ancient and middle aged medical science was so underdeveloped that the most severe expressions of this disorder would die outright as well as probably most moderate cases The high mortality rate of children during these eras well up to the s would do the sufferers of this disorder no favors It is quite possible the severe expression of it would have contributed to the infant mortality rate over time in ancient peoples though this is difficult to determine Possibly the high death rate may have acted to reduce the incidence of the disorder while the disorder did not significantly contribute to the death rateFASD does not occur in all pregnancies when alcohol is consumed What I mean by this is it may have an effect but be so completely unnoticeable as to be undiagnoseable The factors that interact with it are many and complex and we really dont have any particular idea as to why it affects some but not others at varying amounts Time of consumption IS important though drinking with in the first  months of pregnancy is MUCH more destructive to the fetus than it is in the nd and rd trimester This is simply because much of the critical neurological development is occurring in the first  months and alcohol has the greatest effects on these structures at this time Note that alcohol consumption does not affect the embryo in the first two weeks of conception it doesnt do any damage until the blastocyst has implanted into the uterus and resource exchange occurs more directly Research is ongoing and is focused on mice and rat analogies no one really wants to put actual kids through the problems and disability associated with FASD so a true clinical study of this is difficult You have to find mothers willing to not only be a part of the study but also willing to drink while pregnant It is important to note that FASD only is expressed as an environmental condition much like most teratogenic activity in the uterus It does not impact the persons genes as a result a parent or both suffering from FASD will not produce an FASD baby unless the mother drinks while pregnant The mental disorder occurs ONLY when the fetus is exposed to alcoholFinally a major effect on this disorder is severity which I touched on earlier but didnt really go into much discussion on A textbook example of the disorder is understandably severe and might have difficulty surviving even on modern medicine depending on complications A minorly affected FASD person may be nearly indistinguishable from the general population except by those who deal with and experience the disorder daily and know exactly what to look for in behavior and appearance These persons function in society just fine and will probably live a perfectly normal life for whatever time they exist inA moderately disabled person is already at a severe disadvantage Many of them would probably die to various causes depending on their abilities to cope some may be able to live a seminormal life in their time period Many will probably live in destitution even by the standards of the time Severely afflicted persons are unlikely to survive owing to lacking medication and a complete inability to survive on their ownFASD is a major problem today due to the mass production and ready availability of alcohol It is also strongly correlated with poverty though it is present at all socioeconomic levelsAnd as to the historical perspective since we havent nailed down the requirements as to how much alcohol creates how much FASD its difficult to say how prevalent the disorder may have been in ancient populations Since interactions such as time food intake amount of alcohol consumption and good ol genetic resistances all play a role its difficult to nail down an answer Chances are that yes it did occur in the past its prevalence would be somewhat dependent on alcohol availability in ancient times A quick search brings up some sources that suggest alcohol was readily available However one key factor still exists Specifically how much alcohol are WOMEN consuming and in how great a quantity per session A small amount of alcohol every now and then might not give most children diagnosable FASD though there is still a chance it willThe website httpwwwpotsdameduhansondjControversieshtmlUpPZsTUDz claims that drinking to the point of being drunk was actually fairly rare If this is the case then chances are youd have mostly light and moderate expressions of FASD these persons would be able to cope and survive reasonably well You would probably notice deviations from the norm among afflicted individuals depending on prevalence they would still have a harder time functioning than most would Interestingly if the majority of persons are FASD those that are normal might learn to act like an FASD person to an extent without actually having the disabilityTLDR Yes FASD likely occurred in the past It is not expressed at the genetic level it only occurs if the mother drinks while pregnant Final Note The most critical point for fetus vulnerability to alcohol and other teratogens is the first trimester Second trimester will still have some risk of strong effects but they will be somewhat muted Third trimester is mostly about weight gain and finishing off development alcohol exposure here is not as damagingSourceshttpwwwmayocliniccomhealthfetalalcoholsyndromeDSDSECTIONsymptomshttpwwwpotsdameduhansondjControversieshtmlUpPZsTUDzGood generalized non scholarly

Gadarn,Here is my response from a similar question asked recentlyAL Martin writes in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in Europe  A Review of Data on Alcohol Consumption and a Hypothesis in Food and FoodwaysgtMy research on drinking behavior in late medieval and early modern Europe between  and  focusing on England France and Italy revealed that people consumed enormous amounts of alcohol as a matter of course Then as now women did not drink as much as men but they drank enough for me to wonder if fetal alcohol syndrome might be one of the contributing factors to the high rates of infant and child mortality in preindustrial European societiesShe concludes that it is incredibly difficult to determine if fetal alcohol syndrome played any part in infant mortality but that there may be some signs that it was not unknown to people including facial deformities in portraiture and traditional wisdom that drunk parents even men during conception lead to weak or ill or even female childrenOverall while FAS may have been prevalent I think it was likely lower than we would expect considering the amount of alcoholic drinks consumed While alcohol was consumed regularly the actual amount of alcohol per drink was usually lower than today and drinking to excess was more constrained to feastdays This would help to limit the fetus exposure to dangerous levels of alcohol,0,cdn5xfs,1rfwwf,askhistorians,new,4,4

Vincenti,The conquest of Russia was to be brutal and total Franz Halder chief of the German OKH Supreme High Command of the Army took some very accurate notes during a briefing by Hitler to the chiefs of the three armed services and some other highlevel commanders in March gtThis struggle is one of ideologies and racial differences and will have to be conducted with unprecedented unmerciful and unrelenting harshness    The commissars are the bearers of ideologies directly opposed to National Socialism Therefore the commissars will be liquidated German soldiers guilty of breaking international law    will be excused Russia has not participated in the Hague Convention and therefore has no rights under it    I insist absolutely that my orders be executed without contradictionFrom a directive issued by General Keitel May  dictated by the FuehrergtRussians suspected of criminal action will be brought at once before an officer This officer will decide whether they are to be shot With regard to offenses committed against enemy civilians by members of the Wehrmacht prosecution is not obligatory even where the deed is at the same time a military crime or offenseAnother from July gt   forces available for establishing security will be sufficient only if all resistance is punished not by legal prosecution of the guilty but by the spreading of such terror by the occupying forces as is alone appropriate to eradicate every inclination to resist amongst the populationSo Hitler had directed for a brutal invasion where a largescale application of the piercing tactics used in Poland would be matched by subjugation of the native peoples His commanders were told to encourage outright brutality and that soldiers who committed acts typically seen as war crimes would not be punished Such would the large expanses of Soviet land be initially seizedAnother directive of Hitler from May  outlined that Heinrich Himmler head of the massive SS would be given immense administrative power for the execution of special tasks independently of the Army and under his own responsibility for the sociopolitical transformation of Russia Occupied areas were to be cordoned by the military keeping even the highest personalities of the Government and Party from infringing on the SSUndoubtedly most of these tasks would focus on the eradication of certain undesirable Slavic peoples It was envisioned by Alfred Rosenberg one of the original thinkers of the Nazi Party when it was just a handful of antiSemites meeting in pubs and a bit of an idiot that Russian territory in the European continent be divided into Reich Commissariats In the Baltic some Germanic peoples would be assimilated most others especially in Latvia and Estonia would be banished and replaced by Germans probably war veteransThese local governments would basically be vassal states under complete control from Berlin formed to give some semblance of native representation and government structure Poland was to be the protectorate of Ostland Ukraine some sort of independent state of course allied to Germany Caucasia ruled by a German plenipotentiary All throughout his rise to German political power and the bloodless conquests of the early Reich Hitler preferred a veneer of legality however thin to honesty about his subjugation of weaker statesHitler had long envisioned and even laid out in Mein Kampf that the large territories of Eastern Europe should one day be used as farmland for the Reich Rosenberg espoused with savage honesty on what this would mean for the remaining Russian peoples in a meeting just a few days before the invasiongtThe job of feeding the German people stands at the top of the list of Germanys claims on the East    We see absolutely no reason for any obligation on our part to feed also the Russian people with the products of that surplus territory    The future will hold very hard years in store for the RussiansThats putting it mildly since the populations would be forced into agricultural labor and given no thought for their own sustenance Goering makes it cleargtAny attempt to save the population there from death by starvation by importing surpluses from the blacksoil zone would be at the expense of supplies to Europe It would reduce Germanys staying power in the war and would undermine Germanys and Europes power to resist the Allied blockade This must be clearly and absolutely understoodHad the German invasion and occupation gone off as planned a secret German conference concluded that many millions of persons will be starved to death Russia was to be brutally seized and its population terrorized and liquidated when they had outlived their usefulness to the ReichAs an aside the highlevel German planners seemed to view possible Russian emigration positively thinking some may move to live in Siberia To answer your question about the Asian elements of Russian territory the Nazis did not seem to much care they wanted the farmlands oil fields and population centers not frozen wasteland with nobody in it Germany was soon to cozy up to Japan who had designs on East Asia the Reich wanted Eastern EuropeThe emphasis is in the original directiveIts easy to give Nazi leaders a hard time in retrospect but Rosenberg truly does seem pretty dim His crackpot ideas helped solidify the early

DonaldFDraper,There are a few reasons as to why Caesar was able to fight the barbarian horde that we see in Gaul First it is a matter of equipment A Roman soldier of the Late Republic was simple but effective Wearing a strong bronze or iron helmet that covered his head but gave him a  good view that isnt restrictive The armor a chain shirt called the lorica hamata covers most of the chest and protects from slash attacks and arrows from a distance The scutum is a tall shield that would he able to cover  of a man on a full standing stance crouch a little and the entire body is covered up Finally the gladius hispanolis is twenty eight inches of steel that is meant for the stab from behind the aforementioned shield This is a standard set of equipment that every legionnaire was given by the StateCaesarThe standard Gaul could have anything It could range from primitive plate armor from the rich to being naked swords spears and clubs were used shields to would vary to size shape and purposeRoman d there is a political situation to consider At the time up until Vercingetorix Gaul was fragmented and tribal They were eager to see each other come to ruin so Caesar exploited this in order to defeat a lot of small enemies in several battles rather than one giant army that could overwhelm him Caesar had the advantage of being the only Roman in the province to give orders making him the central command with a strong armyThird is the main reason for Roman victory training and organization If there is anything Rome is best known for it is their training In battle a single Roman soldier against a single Gaul the Gaul would wipe the floor with the Roman however the more Romans you add the more they work together and can overcome armies much larger than themselvesThe most important thing for a Roman legion is how well they work together They twin and fight together they understand that the shield beside them is also helping protecting themselves So the real skill for Romans isnt fighting but fighting together they could conquer the worldThe Gauls didnt train in the same way Combat was focused on individual skill rather than as a team This feeds into the Roman method of battle They didnt fight together but rather attacked the enemy with little local tactical control This is why Rome won because of training and skillI am sure that there is more but I cannot think of more ,31,cdmvnrc,1rfylf,askhistorians,new,232,201

onthefailboat,Well the really big change occurred after the US took over in   The first change in  wasnt all that much of a deal as far as slavery was concerned  Most of the citizen brought over by the French were prisoners or very low class people without the capital to purchase slaves  The colony was kind of a backwater and neither nation could really control the smuggling and extralegal activities that were the colonys primary source of profit  There were certainly slaves but the underpopulated areas of the territory gave them plenty of room to develop their own lifestyles relatively free of interference  This led to a very African creole cultureFurthermore as Catholic nations Spain and France shared many cultural similarities regarding their slaves  Free people of color and manumitted slaves were both more common in French and Spanish colonies than in English colonies  This high proportion of free people of color persisted after the US took over but it slowly decreased over time until the Civil War  Before the Civil War Louisianians often kept the distinctions between the various degrees of blackness such as quadroons and mulattos  After the Civil War the one drop way of looking at AfricanAmericans began to dominate though former slaves and free people of color frequently ran into friction between each other  Weve also come to realize when looking at slavery in the western hemisphere that the laws that the imperial power passed bared little relation to what was happening on the ground most of the time  Both Spain and France passed laws that were pretty nice to slaves but slave owners rarely obeyed those laws  Slaves in the area may not even know that the territory had changed hands for a good while afterwards  And once sugar began to dominate southern Louisiana owners did whatever was necessary to squeeze the most profit out of their farmsSources Gwendolyn MidloHall Africans in Colonial Louisiana and Dawdys Building the Devils Empire,0,cdmxknw,1rg64n,askhistorians,new,5,5

pwfd,Different historians will give you many different answers to that question  For one of the better analyses of what fascism is I would consult Stanley Paynes A History of FascismIn short fascism is a radical authoritarian rightist response to Communism and liberalism  A fascist regime will espouse a fervently ideology in its political culture bordering on a religious zeal  This zeal is espoused by a charismatic leader that reinforces his really has to be a man extreme nationalism with romantic symbols  The regime will enforce this ideology with a mass mobilization and militarization of the population leading to an emphasis on masculinity and the vibrancy of youth  Fascism emerged from the Italian futurism of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti  FuturismhttpenwikipediaorgwikiFuturism took hold as the ideology of several political figures in Italy before being adopted and molded by Benito Mussolini  It would later be adopted by Adolf Hitler and taken to even greater extremes of militarizationIs it bad  What defines a bad regime  Technically one might be able to see a nation prosper under fascism depending on the leader in question  However it might be difficult to see fascism as a longterm regime in a political system  Mussolini maintained fascism for quite some time but he did so with great subjection of his people and countless rights abuses  The historical conditions necessary for fascism to emerge tend to make one consider it as a bad system I suppose but with the right charismatic leader one could probably see benevolent fascism  I am a graduate student currently taking a course on the history of fascism so if you would like any elaboration please feel free to ask Im running out of the office now,5,cdmxkpk,1rg6xc,askhistorians,new,13,8
depanneur,The fundamental roots of ideological fascism lay in the changes caused by industrial society on traditional hierarchies and social institutions It was philosophically based in a th century critique of liberalism and positivism as well as the writings of Gustav Le Bon and George Sorel who wrote of the importance of mass movements led by a leader and myth which would direct mans chaotic tendencies into constructive avenues through some sort of dynamic activism  The assumptions of these authors were based on a widespread fin du siècle attitude towards the challenges imposed by an industrial society which alienated man on one hand their individuality was robbed by industrial society but at the same time they sought an avenue to assert this individuality Fascism was consciously constructed as a response to the theories put forward by Le Bon Sorel and others and was meant to not only expunge industrial alienation through mass participation in an organic society but also to provide a quasireligious alternative to Marxism which would overcome the inherent dichotomies of industrial society individual v society private v public etc through a powerful state Fascisms solution to industrial alienation was mass participation in an organic state led by a charismatic leader Mussolini believed that a totalitarian state would be able to multiply an individuals abilities and creativity if he submitted to its authority  It was also an openended ideology which allowed it to attract a whole spectrum of dissatisfied individuals from conservative antiBolsheviks to more radical socialistic corporatists It must be emphasized that the aims of fascism were meant to produce a sort of national rebirth and was thus inherently nationalist Paradoxically because all fascisms are tempered by their nations historical and social particularities there can be no monumental fascism just a fascist minimum that has to be generally defined It was necessarily brutal as well because fascist activism took on a militaristic aspect due to the fact that most members of fascist squads were veterans of the First World War their leaders were frontline officers during the war and both viewed the postwar world embodied in liberalism socialism and sometimes conservatism as an enemy to be destroyed Fascist activism could take the form of rural antisocialist campaigns in Italy SA streetfights with communists and arguably the SS role in the attempted eradication of European Jewry On less philosophical level fascism was a movement of the bourgeois class meant to protect traditional hierarchies from social revolution and also to organize societies in ways which would continue its social advancement  Indeed fascist traditionalism always coincided with bourgeois values and prejudices fascism always thought of itself as a cultural rather than socioeconomic revolution which made it attractive to the upper classes  Fascism was an outlet for bourgeois frustrations and anxieties that would simultaneously protect their treasured hierarchies and private property Corporatism fascisms sole contribution to economic thought was meant to reorganize economic and social relations into guildlike structures of workers and bosses that in practice amounted to a façade which hid a complex system of public and private bureaucracies  Fascists believed that society and the economy should transcend class divisions perceived as a Marxist invention and be organized into a collection of corporatist bodies united under the allembracing stateFascism as has been described was fundamentally antisocialist because of these bourgeois prejudices In Germany and Italy both regimes came to power largely because of their physical antisocialist campaigns and because conservative elites wanted to eliminate the Left in parliament who had institutionalized their power through the recognition of union rights not because of their ambitious plans for cultural revolution  As well fascisms antiliberalism had no small part to play in its popularity Liberalism during the interwar period had become associated with Wilsons Fourteen Points and consequently the results of the Paris peace treaties which gave resonance to the ideology in revisionist countries like Italy Germany and Hungary Fascism was also antiConservative in the context of a generational conflict between old conservative and younger fascist reactionaries In reality fascists always cooperated with conservatives to some extent and fascist leaders most notably Hitler preferred conservatives to other

adimwit,I think Corporatism is essential to Fascism but few people really understand what that means and there are quite a few terms that people misinterpret so Ill start by defining themLiberalism Today we generally use this term for the Left but back then it was a broad term for Liberty We could probably call it Libertarianism but still back then this term was typically applied to AnarchistsCorporatism Sometimes called Corporationism Its an expanded form of Syndicalism Rather than it being the organization of strictly Labor it was the organization of Management as well A Corporation was basically a confederation of Labor Unions and BusinessManagerial Associations that were oriented in a specific industryfield So a Transportation Corporation would be comprised of Train workers unions and all others like buses planes etc and the managers of these businesses Together they would manage the Transportation industry together like decide wagesState Capitalism This is what we would probably call Corporatocracy if we didnt mistakenly call it Corporatism The Fascists believed that too much Liberty would inevitably result in interests groups seizing control of the State If Business Interests exploited the State it was State Capitalism If the People exploited the State it was Socialism They opposed both conceptsgtWhat is Fascism   Basically Fascism was a system that rejected Class Warfare meaning they rejected Capitalism Liberalism Socialism and Communism as all of these perpetuated class conflict Liberty was seen to be the underlying ill that facilitated the expansion of these groups Like I said earlier they believed too much Liberty and Democracy gave various interest groups the ability to exploit the StateLiberty was also seen as an offspring of Capitalism They did not think it was a natural right that people were born with or possessed Mussolini said that Capitalism Liberty and Democracy could work fairly well until the businesses got too big When they got too big the dogmatic Liberals would refuse to regulate them allowing the State to be exploited by Capitalists The Great Depression seemed to prove this for the Fascists The same could be said of Socialism If the people gained too much power they could exploit the state gradually leading to SocialismThe solution was the rejection of Liberty in all its forms ie Democracy Capitalism Free Markets independent Unions alternative parties etc The State was supreme Everyone had to be a member of the Fascist party to receive the benefits of the State They implemented Corporatism as their alternative to Capitalism and Socialism They forced businesses and unions to cooperate for the nations wellbeinggt    and is it badThis depends on your beliefs Communists and Socialists rejected it while moderate Socialists supported it Capitalists early on supported it then rejected it The New Deal was partly but briefly influenced by Corporatism Even the Weimar Republic and preRepublican Spain experimented with Corporatism Fascism was also praised by people from different political backgrounds People like Mises Orwell Churchill and RooseveltPrior to  Fascism was seen fairly favorably  was the year Italy became imperialistic  years after Mussolini came to power and this was largely because of the Great Depression In  Mussolini established the Corporate State by enacting the Labor Charter which expanded Labor Rights Despite their best efforts the Fascists did not really improve the economic conditions but through propaganda they led the world to believe that Fascism was a great success This led to investments and loans from foreign nations Eventually the banks wised up and cut off funding by  The last option was empire and warThere are a variety of reasons why we generally think of Fascism as strictly rightwing and antiLabor and this is understandable considering it was the Fascists themselves who wanted the West to believe this Before Mussolinis propaganda many Westerns journalists went to Italy in  believing another Bolshevik revolution was imminent Although the Fascists at the time were supporting some strikes while breaking up others the journalists believed this was an antiCommunist movement that had saved Italy from Bolshevism Early on Mussolini truthfully said this was not true but then later used this to gain support and funds from westerners Once he gained power he portrayed Fascism as an antiCommunist proCapitalist system to the west and became popularAt the same time the Great Depression was proof to many that too much economic liberty was dangerous and as a result many intellectuals began studying Corporatism The most prominent Fascisminfluenced American was Hugh Johnson who was appointed to administer Roosevelts National Recovery Administration The NRA was undoubtedly Fascist Corporatism Another was Lawrence Dennis who was actually persecuted by the administration Father Coughlin seems to have been some kind of social corporatist rather than a nationaliststatist corporatist These three were the only American Fascists who seemed to understand Corporatism There were a large variety of groups that became prominent but simply believed Mussolinis propaganda that Fascism was an antiCommunist movement,0,cdovegz,1rg6xc,askhistorians,new,1,1

Oxenboxen,gtWhat started WWA number of things The formal event was Germany and the USSR partitioning off Poland Western allies didnt necessarily like the Soviet Union but they still had contractual obligations and treaties to fight with Poland and Germany was the new kid on the block I think everyone at the start of WW figured that if they had to fight anyone itd be the Germans and not the Soviets that would be easier to deal withBut you need to go a lot deeper than that First you need to appreciate WW Now where most countries funded the war by taxes Germany took the unusual route of paying it off via loans Which wasnt traditionally a bad idea Countries dont go bankrupt in a conventional sense Once Germany took itself off the gold standard the value of its currency was in effect a guarantee to German labor rather than a concrete concept like gold But then the Germans lost the war Which both stuck out as bizarre to the Germans not one set of enemy boots stepped into German territory and insulting They were made to look like the bad guys when they were fighting on behalf of allies who were dealing with states who were endorsing terrorism Archduke Ferdinand had been assassinated by a state funded terrorist organization Not to say Germany wasnt looking for an excuse to flex its military muscles it had already thumped more than one state who reasonably should have been doing the thumping not being the thumpee but Germany wasnt in a position where it could just sit on its laurels it was late to the colonization party Too late North America was colonized South America was colonized Asia had been colonized Africa too There was essentially nothing left to claim Whats more itd take decades to roll out a fleet thatd stand up to the likes of the British empire or any other major players If Germany wanted to prosper it would essentially have to be on the corpses of its European rivals At any rate after this huge humiliation in WW which felt like it was more a consequence of grossly incompetent politicians domestically and vindictive ones abroad they got handed down the Treaty of Versailles Aside from asking that a ludicrous amount of money be paid in reparations most estimates have it being more than the country was even valued at they were still out for the debt accrued to pay for the war in the first place And the way the reparations would be payed would be a flat rate plus around  of the money they profited off exports Essentially Germany was wedged between massive war debt war reparations and their export economy which they were obviously dependent on got slapped with a  tax So three things happened Germany went off the gold standard the quality of goods took a nose dive because no one wanted to pay a premium for something which fundamentally hadnt changed and the value of the Reichmark imploded Hyperinflation ensued because Germany had to make good on its reparations and debt but couldnt afford to cover it on the gold standard Once off it everything became a selfperpetuating cycle As Germany spent money the value of it decreased which caused them to print more Eventually it got to the point where France and Belgium threw up their hands and said enough German currency was beyond worthless at this point people would express money in logarithmic functions rather than write out    zeros and demanded raw goods When Germany could make good on these there does seem to be an argument that some elements in the Wiemar republic did this on purpose France then occupied sovereign German soil For reference on just how inflated reich marks would get look at the wikipedia article on German hyperinflation So now we have Germany with a crippled economy worthless currency and with foreign soldiers occupying sovereign German territory in the Ruhr Now well add in the other terms in the Treaty of Versailles First Germany had to turn over land to Poland Whom they hadnt lost to and hadnt really fought either In fact Poland hadnt even existed Despite being a state which had been constantly traded between the Russian Empire historically the Austrians and the Prussians it was only Germany who really got stung by this Additionally the Germans were basically told they couldnt maintain an army at all Thisd become a major player in Hitlers early propaganda to justify action in Poland and the Battle of France while being told to disarm no one really bothered following through The Treaty of Versailles told everyone to take their hands off the trigger for the guns they all had pointed at each other but in all reality their other hand behind their back was doing something else entirelySo WW was kind of a swift kick in the nuts for the Germans and they were reasonably aggravated by it They were the victims of rival nations in Europe and subjects of what they saw as incompetent politicians domestically and it was their quality of life that was getting obliterated as a resultAnd then Hitler shows up To be certain while he was popular he wasnt that popular Hitler didnt get elected into office so he kind of had to browbeat his way into it Cheat if you will He tells everyone it wasnt really their fault He throws out the treaty of Versailles He modernizes the German army ok lets be frank The panzer  and panzer  were awful designs and the Germans had a poor understanding of forecasting where tank development would go while dramatically overspending to fight what would come from it and goes after the real enemies within and restoring German dignity abroad Hitler actually got Chamberlain to balk at the idea of standing up to Germany But there was an eventual end to Germany being able to politic their way around things First there were the Bolshiveks who were ideological opposites to the Nazi party whod now basically thrown out any pretense of republic and democracy Hitler wanted a nation that chose a sort of middle path not pawns of capitalism but not mindless cogs in a grand communist machine either Furthermore there was that whole issue with Poland while it may very well have been political rhetoric to keep folks at home happy Polish leaders had said a couple of times they werent going to stop with just the land they won from Versailles Hitler used this as pretense to war which hed further use to justify fighting France and the British Youll notice the French and British declared war on Germany but not the Soviet Union Its not like Germany took all of Poland some of it went to the USSR under a treaty no less In other words the short answer is that WW started because Nazi Germany needed something to colonize and needed political fodder to justify itself The state wouldnt have been selfsustaining under Socialism without making value come from somewhere A lot of this was extracted from minorities and whomever they happened to conquer gtwhy did the Nazis really hate the JewsAs for the bit about Jews its complicated The were a victim of circumstance and convenience Hitler needed to sell his concept of the German monoculture and it just so happened that either through willful disinterest or ostracism Jews werent a part of that And a number of wealthy Jews happened to own some compelling businesses Jewish bankers helped fund the allies in WW Jewish media This was a feature of Germanys propaganda I dont know to what extent the Jews owned media rings in the early th century In short the Nazi party wanted to call out the Jewish media for being a bunch of spin doctors turning a country like the US which still was fairly distrustful of states like Great Britain due to their large populations of Irish and German immigrants helped draw the US into WW and portrayed the Germans as monsters where they were previously just fighting another European war Hitler basically sold Germany the idea that the Jews were ruled by some sort of hive mind and that the actions of one Jew or a group of Jews in the US was doing was the sin of the whole race  religion Its a classic missuse of correlation and causation being misunderstood The Nazi party could plausibly demonstrate that some Jews happened to be in positions where they could fund efforts to make sure Germany lost the first world war ergo all Jews were a problem for the state Add some pseudoscience making them see subhuman and boom public enemy number one When you hide a lie or two behind a truth or three your average person is never going to know the difference If you dig far enough you can make any group look bad Thisd only be further fueled by a willful disinterest in establishing what to do with the Jews Krystallnacht had been orchestrated by Goebells Goerning to impress Hitler At some level initially the Nazi party had even talked of simply deporting all Jews to Palestine The reasoning behind what is probably the most core reason behind all of this is actually in how they proposed to pay for it the Nazi part was to seize all property of these Jews and compensate them in machinery Which of course would be done at a rate that favored the State Basically the Nazi party needed a political scapegoat to justify themselves they needed money because the ghosts of wars past still haunted the German economy and it just so happened that if everyone hated an entire minority or several groups they would be far more willing to turn a blind eye when they get shipped off to labor camps Making the Jews a band of minority villains covered all three bases Did I miss anything ,0,cdmzn4i,1rgbec,askhistorians,new,4,4

i,A lot For our purposes well begin with the Russian Civil War There were understandably some people who were sort of upset about the abdication of the tsar and the events of  Those people are known as the Whites The Whites put up a pretty good fight but the Bolsheviks ended up defeating them The Bolsheviks were now running the country out of Petrograd which became Leningrad in  after Lenin died and the USSR was beginning to sort of be recognized as a legitimate state abroadIn the meantime it had been discovered that state ownership of the means of production was causing severe economic hardship so Lenin developed the New Economic Plan NEP which allowed for limited private enterprise and pretty crucially mostly left the peasants alone collective farming was a really unpopular idea but Ill talk about that in greater detail once we get into the s under Stalin Basically NEP held the Soviet Union back from famine economic collapse and open revolt for most of the s But in  Lenin died and a power struggle ensued Stalin managed to come out on top abolished NEP in  and embarked on a very ambitious destructive plan to bring the entire Soviet economy under state control Chaos ensued Stalin started by taking everything away from the peasants and establishing massive collective farms The peasants were really really not into this to the point where they start slaughtering their livestock rather than surrender them to the state At the same time Stalin was on a ruthless campaign against kulaks wealthywealthyish peasants around this time most of whom were shot or exiled to Siberia Collectivization was also one of the factors that contributed to the Holodomor a famine in Ukraine that killed somewhere between  and  million people So thats what was going on with the agricultural sector There was trouble afoot in other spheres of Soviet life as well Stalin was embarking on a massive campaign of executions known as the Great Terror That went on on roughly from  although theres a lot of disagreement on that Its almost impossible to overstate how absolutely nuts the Great Terror was Theres an apocryphal story about a man who put his coffee mug down on a picture of Stalins face in the newspaper leaving a wet ring that a passing KGB officer happened to notice and arrested him on the spot for That particular story is probably not true but it gives you a sense of the prevailing tone in Soviet life during that period Everyone was listening toinforming on everybody else Forced migrations of ethnic minorities Tatars Kalmyks Volga Germans and many others were happening on a massive scale People were being arrested for literally nothing tortured forced to sign confessions and either executed or sent to the gulag an enormous system of prisons spanning the entire countrywere still not completely sure how many there were People usually never came out of the gulag but some people did and lived to write about it the most famous is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn but the work of Varlam Shalamov is also highly recommended if youre at all curious about the gulag Basically what Stalin was doing was using a climate of paralyzing allencompassing terror to consolidate power at home It was effective Devastatingly effective Im doing my thesis on the legacy of Stalinism in Russia and Id argue that it still informs contemporary Russia in a MAJOR way but I digressI gather from your question that youre primarily curious about domestic developments in Russia but there is one foreign policy thing that I should probably mention the MolotovRibbentrop Pact which is signed in  and guarantees mutual nonaggression between Germany and the USSR in the event of another European war In  Hitler completely breaks this treaty and invades the Soviet Union and that takes us up to the beginning of Soviet involvement in WWIIThat was a very longwinded and simultaneously simplistic account of what happened Stalinism is far more complex and horrifying than can possibly be expressed in a Reddit post but I think this more or less covers the major events If youre curious I can point you towards some further reading on this period,4,cdn3bou,1rgfb6,askhistorians,new,28,24

RedPurpleBlack,The top comment is really good but Id like to add a few more things The SovietPolish War happens between  and  The Poles are able to fight them to a standstill and it ends in the division of disputed Belorussian territory This is important because it ends the idea of global revolution and makes the Soviet Union into a belligerent power expanding for its own sake After the MolotovRibbentrop Pact the Soviets started to reach out and take control over their sphere of influence They invade Finland in the Winter War are stopped by winter and fierce resistance and only win by having the bigger army They take some disputed territory and a naval base but Im not sure if they thought theyd take the whole country The Unions weak performance in the Polish and Finnish war contributed to Hitlers belief that it would quickly collapse when the Axis invaded The Finns would fight again after the start of Barbarossa in the Continuation War which they planned together with the German action Russia gives an ultimatum to the Baltic States to accede to the Union They give in and Moscow later demands that Romania cede a region called Barbarossa This and the earlier Vienna Dictate which forced it to transfer Transylvania to Hungary brings about a rightwing coup Romania joins the Axis and participates in Barbarossa  While the Pact was in effect there was a lot of SovietGerman economic cooperation The Russians would provide oil ores and grain in exchange for technical information and industrial and naval hardware  There were a series of border clashes between Soviet Union and its puppet Mongolia and the Empire of Japan and its puppet Manchukuo in what is now northeastern China They dont escalate but it showed how ineffective the Japanese could be fighting a professional military on land This ends the plans some army factions had to expand into the Soviet Far East,2,cdn4gkq,1rgfb6,askhistorians,new,6,4

snickeringshadow,Excuse the laziness but Im cannibalizing earlier posts Ive made on this topic This is a very complicated topic and your question doesnt have a simple answer Theres a nugget of truth in this relating to events described in the primary sources but popular perception of what happened has been heavily distorted in a way that bares little resemblance to the truth Essentially a number of factual events misunderstandings and outright myths have been confused with each other over time This has ultimately produced this elaborate but largely inaccurate story that Cortés was an incarnation of QuetzalcoatlMesoamericans calling Europeans GodsTheres a common tendency for European conquest sources to describe the natives referring to the Europeans as gods Most of the Spanish accounts just take this for granted The only firsthand account Ive been able to find that seems to hint at what the natives might have actually thought is this quote from Bernal Diaz del Castillo Bit of context Cortés had just told the local Totonac people to imprison an Aztec tribute collector They explained this was effectively a declaration of war to which Cortés replied that he would take responsibility for it The Totonacs were shockedgtThe act they the Totonac nobles had witnessed was so astonishing and of such importance to them that they said no human beings dared to do such a thing and it must be the work of teules Therefore from that moment they natives called us Spanish teules which means gods or demonsAfter this the conquistadors start calling themselves teules and the natives apparently do tooTheres a few issues with this though First Teule isnt a word Teotl is but it isnt a word in Totonac Its a Nahuatl word The Totonacs translated their word into Nahuatl and then from there it was translated to Mayan and from there to Spanish where it was rendered as gods or demons Its hard to know what the original context of the phrase was because we dont know how it was used in the Totonac language When later people continue calling the Spanish teotl its unclear if they actually thought the Spanish were divine or if theyre just calling them that because the Spanish are calling themselves thatPossible MeaningsThe other problem comes with different concepts of divinity The Mesoamerican concept of a teotl is not the same as the GreckoRoman concept of a god Its probably closer to the idea of a kami in the Shinto religion in that its not necessarily omnipotent or immortal To put it another way if you were to try to translate the major figures of the Christian religion into the Aztec world view God the Devil all of the saints all of the demons all of the angels and all of the prophets would be rendered as teotl For that matter so would elves goblins fairies or other creatures of Germanic folkloreSo when the natives were calling the Spanish teotl they could have meant gods or they could have just meant nonhuman Or they could have meant that they were human but simply had the backing of supernatural powers For all we know the Totonac lords could have meant it sarcastically We only have the interaction recorded in Spanish so theres no way to know Either way the Spanish thought that the natives thought they were gods and they began claiming divinityThey continually referred to themselves as teules When the Spanish arrived in Tenochtitlan Motecuzoma put a stop to this immediately Diaz del Castillo  pgtCortés I know very well that these people of Tlaxcala with whom you are such good friends have told you that I am a sort of God or teotl  I know well enough that you are wise and did not believe it but took it as a joke Behold now Señor Cortés my body is of flesh and bone like yours  that I am a great king and inherit the riches of my ancestors is true but not all the nonsense and lies that they have told you about me although of course you treated it as a joke as I did your thunder and lightningIt doesnt take a PhD to see that while Motecuzoma is talking about himself here hes also talking about Cortés Hes letting Cortés know that he knows hes just a human being so he should stop claiming to be something else Now during the early colonial period the Spanish didnt have the nuanced understanding of this that we do now and this Spaniards as gods thing was accepted as historical fact for a whileCortes as QuetzalcoatlAfter the conquest this myth got conflated with another myth the returning godking Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin Some time likely in the th century AD there was a king of a city called Tula named Ce Acatl Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl IIRC he was probably a real person as his name is carved on a pillar at the site of Tula but much of his story has obviously been mythologized He was basically like a Mesoamerican King Arthur and is closely associated with the god Quetzalcoatl for whom he is named Often the two are equated with each other Mesoamerican concepts of divinity are complicated and it wasnt uncommon for kings to associate themselves with gods The story goes that his nobles were jealous of his power and so they tricked him into disgracing himself and forced him into exile Before he left he cursed those who betrayed him and vowed one day that he would return to reclaim his lost kingdom He then got on boats and went east across the ocean If the story is true he likely went to the Yucatan Peninsula which is due east from the coast nearest to the Basin of MexicoDuring the Early Colonial period this story got conflated with Cortés Supposedly the Aztecs believed that Cortés was a reincarnation of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzin  supposedly because he arrived in the year One Reed One Reed was the calendrical portion of Quetzalcoatl Topiltzins name Ce Acatl However most modern scholars for example Mike Smith Matthew Restall etc consider this to be one of these posthoc prophecy attributions Cortés does not mention it in his letters to the King of Spain and Bernal Diaz del Castillo only makes vague references to a prophecy about white men with beards who would rule over Mexico However Diaz del Castillo was writing decades after the fact when this legend of CortésasQuetzalcoatl had already been established It seems more likely that the prophecy was attributed to Cortés after the conquest as a means of explaining what happenedEDIT As others have pointed out the attribution of the Quetzalcoatl prophecy to Cortés is discussed by Sahagún who is writing decades after the conquest but largely pulling the account from indigenous informants However as Restall  demonstrates this version of events was popularized by Christian missionaries like Motolinía in the late s as a conversion tactic  it helped if the natives saw the conquest as divinely ordained And as uRabbits pointed out referencing Brumfiel many of Sahagúns informants were Christian Nahuas who would have been influenced by these early missionaries So yeah just because its mentioned in a colonial era source doesnt make it true Diaz del Castillo Bernal  The Discovery and Conquest of Mexico AP Maudslay translator Smith Mike  The Aztecs Blackwell Publishing Malden MA  Restall Matthew  Seven Myths of the Spanish

BeondTheGrave,Im having a little trouble understanding your question I think youre asking why people stop being incensed by atrocities Or maybe why do conquered peoples eventually assimilate The answer to the first question is simple who still cares Take the Carthage example youll be hard pressed to find a Carthaginian whose incensed about those Italian upstarts And those Italian upstarts have been conquered and reconquered so many times that their ancient culture has been virtually annihilated So why would I get upset about itAs for why cultures seem to assimilate instead of carrying that beef with them forever is one day it becomes better to be a say Roman than a Carthaginian Your country was destroyed you certainly cant rebel the Romans will discriminate against you if you selfidentify as Carthaginian or if they identify you as a Carthaginian so at some point it just becomes too hard for the common person to resist And children especially who are taught by the conquering culture taught in a foreign language raised with foreign children eventually see themselves as a foreigner Its just natural But these are ancient examples I think if you look more recently youll find that these acculturation processes take many generations Look at the American Natives some have assimilated but an equal number are still angry about their conquest And the Russians they still celebrate the Great Patriotic War their expulsion of a conquering German army So there are a lot of these passions still boiling in modern society which many people still have not forgotten and are still outraged over Armenian Genocide Bay of Pigs American Revolution US Civil War World War One and the other aspects of World War Two just to name a few hot button issues The subtext here Im picking up is a general question as to why people arent more outraged by wars especially older ones And aside from the previous comments on conflicts in cultural memory I would like to point out that war is natural We humans for whatever reason really like to kill each other Weve been doing it a while and were getting quite good at it So the process of conquering and being conquered is fundamentally part of human experience The people of the past understood this a lot better than we do now assuming you are American or European given our prolonged period of peace So on a fundamental level its hard to get upset over somebody being conquered Its a natural fact of life and it has gone on millennia its even in the Bible In fact Id bet itll go on for millennia more Thats not to be Mr DoomandGloom over here we humans have a remarkable ability to operate above our own genetic hardwiring its just that war is a historical constant ,0,cdn4eza,1rgt2b,askhistorians,new,2,2

Muskwatch,Questions of matriarchy are tied up in questions of authority  Within a western context when we think of patriarchy or matriarchy its often with the idea of male or female leadership with significant authority to give orders make important decisions and so on  Within most Indigenous North American cultures this view doesnt really hold water entirely Many of the nations in my area of North America British Columbia are matriarchally organized so in that sense at least matriarchy was commonly practiced  However that matriarchal organization might not have the same sort of power that you might think  Power  the ability to influence others at least in this area was heavily tied in to obligations developed through the potlatch system  You cement connections with people you build up your name and as a result build up influence  The matriarchal nature of your community would determine who you saw as relative who your primary obligations were to and there were often separate father side obligations as well as mother side  Women did have a lot of power they often controlled a lot of wealth territory rights but it did not match up to the idea of a political leader as we might see it today or as it is sometimes portrayed  At the same time the very egalitarian nature of many communities often meant that the division of labour between men and women was much more equal  families that make their living off the land generally work together and value each other in a different way than agrarian societies and spiritual leadership has almost always been with women in any community Ive interacted with,0,cdngykt,1rh3gw,askhistorians,new,3,3

dianamn,Japan set a fairly unique course in its interactions with Western nations from the start Even before Japans famous opening to the West in  they had observed a succession of Western powers militarily and economically defeating and humiliating China Their main fear in their own relations with the West was that they might suffer a similar fate Their initial interactions with Western powers seemed to confirm these fears as a succession of nations forced acceptance of treaties granting themselves access trade and certain extraterritorial rights for their citizens within Japan itself While military encounters never broke into open war as they had in China the threat was persistent and Japans leaders were keenly aware that they were in no position to conduct a full scale war with Western powers in its current stateThe failure of the previous government the Tokugawa lead shogunate to resist the Western powers soon lead to its overthrow under the popular rallying cry sonnō jōi revere the emperor expel the barbarians However the new government resisted a reactionary approach in expelling barbarians Instead they undertook a thorough study of the Western powers in order to understand what made the worlds great powers so successful The prime symbol of this effort was a famous aroundtheworld expedition lead by Prince Iwakura Tomomi The Iwakura Mission had two main objectives The first was to gather information about the modern world to inform Japans own decision making about necessary reforms The second was to renegotiate the unequal treaties Japan had been forced to accept under the prior regime The mission was a huge success in meeting its first objective The information brought back and the relationships forged with Western nations fired the imagination of Japans reformminded leaders and gave many examples in technology government education and commerce upon which to model their efforts However when it came to the second objective  renegotiation of the unequal treaties  the mission utterly failed It was such a failure that certain leaders within the mission were blamed for having even attempted such a thing before Japan had sufficient leverage at the negotiation tableThe insight that Japan gained from this failure was that Western powers like the United States United Kingdom and France did not view them as an equal power Until Japan established itself as a peer to the worlds great powers they would forever be treated as an inferior The motivation to correct this was the overarching goal of Japans policy for the next several decades It not only fueled helpful reforms like democracy universal education industrialization and free markets but also lead Japan in an increasingly aggressive militaristic direction So to recap Japan embraced Western ideas about modern government economy and technology as a direct response to Western intervention in Asia in general and Japan specifically Their relations with Western nations were hugely affected by their desire to be seen as an equal to Western powers understanding this to be the key to being treated as an equal in diplomatic affairs The wrenching changes required were in large part palatable under Japans reformminded Meiji government because the prior regime under the shogunate took the blame for getting Japan into its unequal mess in the first place ,0,cdnirla,1rh684,askhistorians,new,3,3

Pramoedya,I am definitely not an authority on this but I did a project on the symbolism behind the swastika a few years ago and looked into this a bit I was interested because I have Indian heritage Essentially Hitler etc viewed the contemporary Aryans in India as not fully Aryan That is to say they are descended from Aryans but their purity was diluted into the general south asian dravidian population By the term Aryan he was referring to the ancient white protoeuropean conquerors that settledinvaded the subcontinent and much of asia Although as far as I am aware they originated somewhere near Iran I always thought it was weird that Hitler always banged on about Aryans and then in the same breath held blonde hair and blue eyes in such high regard This was because all the people I had met who identified as Aryan were south asian ie blackdark hair darker skin etc However I think the problem is in the semantics By Aryan Hitler meant the old school horseriding peoples from east europewest asia who bandied around conquering and settling much of europe and asia Whilst many south asian people or people who are more familiar with that culture than western culture view the word Aryan as denoting a current population who through years of intermingling became largely intertwined with the indigenous population In contrast Nazis viewed the european breed of Aryan and purebloodI think the one thing both Hitler and Indian people can agree on are that the Aryans were fair skinned In hitlers mindset I think this translated into the blonde hair blue eyes thing whilst in the Indian mindset this translated into simply a fairer complexion in comparison to other ethnic groups in India such as the darker Dravidians  a skin tone similar to say Iranian peopleWhat I think is interesting is that in both cultures the notions of being Aryan is linked with superiority Whilst we are all very familiar with Hitlers ramblings it is important to also note that skin tone is very important in India with society having a preference for lighter skinned people Hence this translates into people of Aryan descent them being fairer skinned as being seen as superior A cousin of mine when I asked her why she prefers men with lighter skin even said it is because it makes them look more european when you actually think about the implications of that view its pretty fucked up Sometimes I think India is having some kind of postcolonial withdrawal issue Anyhow in conclusion Hitlers opinions of the Aryans in India was probably not very good He would have been aware that the Aryans settled and colonised vast swathes of the asia and europe    The Nazis viewed themselves as pure bred Aryans while they saw the Indian Aryans as being simply descendents of Aryans To be honest it is very difficult to think of any objective rhyme or reason for any extremist view and if you try to find one you will probably be looking for a long time Extremist philosophy and politics is steeped in biased views of history and unscientific science Hence its not surprising that Hitlers views on who the Aryans wereare end up equally as hodge podged  Hope I have been of some help Again Im no authority just have way to much time on my hands today sorry for the long ass monologue ,0,cdnd335,1rhb20,askhistorians,new,2,2

MarcusDohrelius,In  in the Early Roman Republic there was a secessio plebis or plebian revolt as part of the ongoing conflict of the orders with the patricians who at the time were still closely related to the advisors of the recently deposed monarchy  BC Slave debt was a big issue where in a simplified explanation Roman farmers who were full citizens would have their farms fall into disarray during wartimes and they would be forced to be indentured servants to pay it back There was sense of honouring the veterans So in BC soldiers were exempted from this practice That eased some tensions but outrage at underrepresentation and exploitation amongst the plebeians was on the rise This maphttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsaRomanconquestofItalyPNG is phenomenal and shows Romes neighbours and its expansion during the Republic The Volscii were a particular threat and in  the Plebs seized the opportunity and retreated to the Mons Sacer and refused their military service This caused a panic and their demands were met with the creation of the sacrosanct office of the Tribune of the Plebs Another revolution to check led by Tribunes would be the grain reforms of the Gracchi brothers in the late Republic All of the accounts of the Plebian Seccessions can be found in Livy Ab Urbe Condita and Appian on the Civil Wars for the Gracchi ,0,cdnctk7,1rhj6t,askhistorians,new,4,4

lukeweiss,It is absolutely the case from as early as we have reliable history The Han conflict with the Xiongnu saw much mixing along the northern borders of the imperium but was not the first such northernification my term just thought of it In fact we are pretty comfortable with the image of the earliest dynasty not an appropriate term for them as they werent ruling over an empire of any consequence the Shang as that of a seminomadic or at least peripatetic horse dependent chiefdom This characterization is more like the later northern nonhan peoples than that of the Han So and the work of Victor Mair among others has especially driven this point home the influxmixing of northern peoples with han peoples strikes to the very roots of chinese society  Flash forward to the post Han dynasty period and we have a north dominated by invading northern peoples for the better part of  years This period was capped off with the Tang Dynasty CE onward a dynastic household of notsothinlyveiled mixed blood The Li family were  clearly of mixed barbarian decent but worked extremely hard both to hide that fact and to legitimize their ancient family creds They did this in two major ways   By literally rewriting the list of great families A list that formerly gave primacy to the old guard families of the Shandong area The power structure of the Tang was wrapped up in this change as the Tang were eager to shift the familial power structure to the northwest from the centereast It is not clear how seriously the change was taken but no matter the answer to that question both sets of aristocratic groups wouldnt survive the Tang   Aligning themselves with that great ancient philosopher Laozi This was an astute move the old master sharing the surname Li with the imperial house gave them instant credibility as potential holders of the mandate of heaven a tenuous grip that could always be relinquished Again it is not all that clear how seriously this was taken but the early Tang rulers drove home the connection time and again   After the Tang we see another influx of northern seminomadic peoples this time upping the ante significantly Chinese historiography for generations tried to minimize their importance  for example the period is known as the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms a title that gives credit only to the areas ruled mostly by Han chinese It ignores the significance of the northern regions under the Khitans Shatuo Turks and Tanguts who all held power pretty solidly until Mongol expansion a few centuries later     These regions were full of Han chinese and the new states of the Xi Xia and Khitans clearly modeled themselves politically after the Middle Kingdom Many adapted and adopted new official scripts that their imperial edicts could be read far and wide  a very chinese thing to do  So the mixing continued and continued The Mongols tried desperately to maintain their nonHan status but this only isolated the upper strata of the Mongol power structure FW Mote mentions in his history of middle period china Imperial China  that the Mongols in Han China became destitute by the th century because they had no official status and a shrinking share of the imperial booty Isolation was therefore bad for longevity   The Qing brought a massive influx of Manchus who also tried to maintain cultural isolation But again this wasnt sustainable and many mixed in with Han China A small group mostly those closest to the imperial family remained ethnically isolated and were on the long train back to Manchuria in    So TLDR  Mixing of northern ethnicities with Han chinese is as old as chinese civilization itself It only increased as time went by Interestingly it seems the only successful invaders NOT to stay for a while and mix it up in China were the Tibetans whos th century invasion did not involve sticking around for breeding ,0,cdnnrzt,1rhk4n,askhistorians,new,3,3
skyanvil,Ethnic mixing happened far more often in Chinese history particularly in Northern China than most people think more than even some modern Chinese thinkThe short answer is YES Northern Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the North  Even before that Western Chinese mixed a lot with various tribes of the West  And Southern Chinese also mixed with various tribes of the SouthAncient Chinese maps indicated that China was surrounded by Barbarian tribes in North West and the South  Border region people mixed a lot and the Chinese had no prohibition of that  Indeed early Chinese partly spread out on the concept of civilizing the Barbarians by mixing with them and attempting to IMPRESS the Barbarians with Chinese culture Chinese agricultural technologies Chinese customs and virtuesWhen China was occupied by Barbarians and even subsequently when China overthrew those dynasties Han Chinese encouraged mixing with the Barbarians which formed mixedethnic vanguard troops and mercenaries for the Chinese to guard their frontiersFor example after Ming Dynasty overthrew the Mongol Dynasty of Yuan Ming Emperors employed vast numbers of Mongolian mercenaries by promising them stable salary and land for them to settle in China  This was very attractive offer to the Mongols who traditionally only got paid well when they managed to take spoils in battle  And in contrast the Chinese were willing to pay them well to be on guard dutySo slowly the Mongol mercenaries settled in China and mixed into the Chinese population  Those who didnt settle in China remained Mongolian nomadsBottomline   of Chinas strengths is the ability to attract nonChinese to mix into its population with its riches of culture and technology,2,cdner2a,1rhk4n,askhistorians,new,3,1

thebullfrog,TLDR Structural Engineering Sources are fairly nonexistent I go through a pretty fringe argument at the end  it is useful in that it draws on common similarities and allows me to address each in turn The pyramids that are so widespread are the Step Pyramid variety which were built throughout the world Although overshadowed by the Pyramids of Giza Step Pyramids were the predecessor for these massive structures Short answer similar to why arches became ubiquitous its the best way to build large and tall structures that dont fall down and remain stable over a long time Without access to lighter building materials that would allow for greater vertical height such as wood and metal Step Pyramids were by far the most feasible tall structures to build The more ambitious Great Pyramid of Giza remained the tallest structure in the world until a new m spire was added to the Lincoln Cathedral in England although that spire did collapse after just over  years Im not sure if youve tried to do any research on this yourself but you will find yourself quickly in a realm of pseudoscience and pseudohistory that has come to dominate the topic Ill go through one below  This piece argueshttpthegreaterpicturecompyramidshtml that the pyramids around the world were built to honor aliens using as evidence these common characteristics some that are very common when looking at pyramid pseudoscience and are the ones that on the surface make a connection seem cleargtThe triangular form with a square basegtEngineering like above the best way to build a sturdy structure one that is also as tall as possible Having a cube structure would require more material for less height  gt The sides face the cardinal directions preciselyThis claim only works with the Mayan step pyramids and the Egyptian Great Pyramids it falls apart when dealing with the Temple of the Moon in Mexico and Borobudur in Indonesia Both the Mayan and Egyptian cultures placed importance on solsticeequinox days and worked to align their major largescale religious structures accordingly gt They lie around the celestial equator  the line that would be gtour equator if the Earth axis wasnt tiltedThe Jared Diamond hate is mostly justified but it was the place I encountered the counterargument to the Europecentric theory of geographic determinism whereby a countrys success is greatly affected by its distance from the equator Prior to European advances the reverse holds just as true with numerous vast empires arising on this celestial equator closer to the equator than geographic determinism would account for The climate allows for substantial agriculture and the pseudoscience would extend to Mesopotamian and South East Asian civilizations if they worked with the arguments gt They contain all types of corridors and chambersThey were religious buildings with the exception of Egypt meant to be used regularly and Egyptian mythology provides the explanation for why large chambers filled with supplies would be necessary in their construction  gt They are made of stone though most Chinese pyramids are made of gta type of hard earth and some are even made of ironSee available building materials above various types of stone were used as they were around and provided durable structures gt They are built the same way on a base of large uneven stone blocks gtthat fit together seamlessly This ground plane is extremely resistant to gtearthquakesThis point argues that they all build a strong base and without pointing to the Inca touches on the idea of mortarless structures Although Im a layman in engineering mortar degrades and is still a major cause of old buildings being destroyed in earthquakes Considering that earthquakes were a part of Egyptian mythology prior to the construction of the great pyramids at the very least part of a gods attributes see GebhttpenwikipediaorgwikiGeb its not unlikely that the design of buildings which took over  years to build involved tens of thousands of laborers and were made as tombs to their rulers and godstobe would take into consideration such destructive forces   gt Underground passages link the pyramids with each otherThe Pharaohs pyramids were linked with the similar socalled Queens pyramids not with each other As these were tombs rather than temple complexes which easily explain the use of tunnels between structures it is a popular point gtThey are oriented on starsigns especially Orion Sirius the Pleiades and Cygnus SwanThis comes off as similar to the argument that interempire contact must have necessary because of the ubiquity of sunmoon worship Features of the sky particularly when they represent in the mythologies of these empires the heavens would make sense Further much of the arguments behind the specific alignments and the importance to Egypt of these star constellations has been debunked Drawing parallels to constellations that come from another civilizations

BentNotBroken,They were never really considered bomb shelters but rather Fallout Shelters  Properly stocked you could hold out as long at your stocks held out and your water supply lasted  There was no convenient bottled water at the time so the usual fall back was to be a cistern either in the shelter structure or under a sheltering structure for that purpose nearby  All of this took money tme and a great deal of forethought and constant upkeep to have a successful outcome  Nature was included into the equation because it was expected that the first rain after the events would wash away some of the fallout  One did not want to have contaminated rain water to flow to the cistern so some provision had to be made for diversion of flow in the immediate aftermath of any hostile event  Holding out  For what  If the major cities were destroyed and the usual flow of commerce depended on the cities the surviving population was then back to huntergathering or subsistence foraging Bomb Shelters were the opiate of the people at the time  There was a bluster having to do with a bring it on to the rude bridge that arched the flood mentality  We have our guns RED DAWN ,8,cdnbmm8,1rhld6,askhistorians,new,19,11
restricteddata,The technical goals of fallout shelters were twofold To help protect people from the effects of blast and fire This would require advance notice of impending attack and would rely on the shelter itself not being too close to ground zero Civilian shelters were not designed to withstand a direct nuclear detonation certainly not of the yields that became common in the later Cold War Even militarypresidential shelters could only take so many megatons directly This sort of thing becomes more important in the suburbs than it does the areas of direct targeting  ie in the vast regions where the blast effects are enough to collapse civilian structures and break windows eg  psi overpressure and the thermal effects are enough to burn flesh or start small fires Protection from radioactive fallout Nuclear weapons that detonate on or near the ground mix with debris and dirt and the result is that highlyradioactive byproducts fall out of the nuclear cloud within a few hours to a few days of detonation The initial radioactivity of these byproducts can be very high  enough to kill you give you radiation sickness or dramatically increase your lifetime cancer risk However things this radioactive do not stick around long The more radioactive something is the shorter its halflife and the less time it sticks around The consequence of this is that for the first week or so the area immediately downwind of the blast can be incredibly radioactive and dangerous If you stay inside for that amount of time then you avoid most of the radiation After a week or so the radiation drops to levels safe to travel through though not necessarily to live in Note that airbursts which are used against soft targets like cities do not create the same level of contamination at allFallout shelters were never intended to save everyone What they were intended to do was to increase the total survivability of the population Even just making sure people dont walk through the contaminated areas in the first week or so can in various simulations and models save hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives Now one can look at this and say well Youve saved several million people but were still talking about many many millions dead That doesnt seem like a great success to me And there is something to that On the other hand if you are a government bureaucrat and your options are dont do anything to try and save lives versus do what you can even if it is inadequate you can see why they went with the latter approach And hey a hundred thousand or a million saved lives is nothing to sniff at I will note that my reading of the FCDA files indicates that most of them were boring hardworking bureaucrats assigned a kind of impossible job under terrible conditions including the fact that they were not cleared to know a lot of weapons effects information or information about the composition of the US or Soviet stockpiles I have never seen anything that indicated to me that they were really trying to hoodwink the public or anything like that Whether that was an inadvertent or inevitable consequence is a separate question but the notion that these people were trying to pull a grand shuck doesnt seem right to me The reason fallout shelters get such a bad rap is that their purpose is often misunderstood they are not meant to protect you from a direct hit they are not meant to be inhabited for months or years and because survivability is a grim business Civil Defense in general is easy to criticize There is something to the notion that a nation that thinks it can survive nuclear war might be more eager to get into one but Ive never seen evidence that US civilian officials were actually was that keen on getting into a nuclear war A lot of the criticisms of Civil Defense however are just rooted in a criticism of the broader Cold War nuclear context Which of course one gets But given that everybody just play nice and get rid of nukes was never really on the table in a realistic sense I dont really see what that gets us either as an understanding of the past or a prescription for the present ,3,cdnkvkj,1rhld6,askhistorians,new,13,10

akyser,First to slightly correct the myth at least as told by Virgil Aeneas son Ascanius founded Alba Longa and then roughly ten generations later Romulus and Remus found RomeDespite Heinrich Schliemanns supposed Death Mask of Agamemnon none of the characters of the Trojan War cycle have been identified as being based on real historical people  Roma was one town out of a number of Latin towns  They wound up conquering the whole Latin people including Alba Longa and spreading out from there to the other people on the Italian peninsula  There is no evidence of this Trojan foundation either in modern times or in ancient  Livy the greatest ancient historian of the early history of Rome tells us the whole myth of the foundation but even he admits he just likes the story and it probably isnt true  However its really hard to do this sort of archaeology given that theyre looking for a really small town underneath what has been one of the great cities of the world for the last  yearsHowever the Greeks did come to Italy to found colonies  They founded cities all over the Mediterranean but there was such a concentration in southern Italy that it was known as Megale Hellas Magna Graecia Great Greece  Ancient Greece may have started within the modern political borders of what we know as Greece but the cities of southern Italy and western Turkey Troy Philadelphia Ephesus could make claims to be as impressive as Athens Sparta Corinth or Thebes Naples as a city name doesnt sound Greek anymore But the adjectival form shows its roots better Neapolitan nea new polis city  There was also Tarentum on the southern coast and Syracuse on Sicily to name a few of the major ones  But this colonization of southern Italy happened around  BC several hundred years after the probable dates of the Trojan War after the Greeks went into a dark age without writing and then got it back again adapting the Phoenician alphabet  There are a couple places in southern Italy that still speak a very different dialect of Greek though its debatable if that really had its origins in Great Greece or in Byzantine timesThese large Greek city states so close to Rome during its foundational period are probably why the gods map so closely but have different names  The early Latin religion appears to have been animistic and largely based on contracts with these spirits  If you didnt get what you wanted from the gods you must have broken the contract in some way  The god or spirit of motherhood for example was Juno and all of Heras stories and traits were mapped on to the name Juno  But there was no overarching sky god to be in charge of everything  So they adopted Zeus whole only adding father after the name  Zeuspater gt Jupiter See koinelinguas correction belowSo the Greeks did come to Italy to found cities but it almost certainly wasnt Rome and it was centuries too late to be Aeneas or anyone else from the Trojan War if they existed at all,4,cdnftcr,1rhtyy,askhistorians,new,23,19

Snickerdoodled,Crime and Punishment in Eighteenth Century England by Frank McLynn has a chapter on women that addresses this  In short for capital crimes other than murder women were reprieved from execution much more than men Also women were more likely to have charges lowered and  less likely to be sent for transportation than men for non capital larcenies McLynns explanation is that women were generally perceived to be less dangerous to the communityauthoritysocial order and the deterring effect of the death penalty didnt work so much for women as the hanging of a women was more likely to excite pity for the victim than reinforce confidence in law and orderAlso the concept of coverture might relate to your topic Since a feme coverts legal standing was eclipsed by her husbands a married women who committed crimes with their husband were assumed to be acting at their husbands behest On the flip side of this wives who killed their husbands were not guilty of murder but petit treason which was a more serious offense and was punished with burningInterestingly The rates of execution for people indicted for willful murder were the same for men and women about  Women charged with homicide were more likely to be accused of murder as opposed to manslaughter than men which may relate to the higher chance of a womens murder victim being an intimate rather than a stranger,0,cdnpxpt,1rhum8,askhistorians,new,3,3

Tiako,Unfortunately the historical sources are confused and far too late to allow us to use them as a guide towards the sixth century political order with any confidence Generally the most fruitful analyses attempts to see Rome within the context of an Iron Age climate of political multiplicity and loose vertical bonds within a community basically the elites would not feel themselves particularly tied to lower orders in a community This allows us to structure a series of useful comparisons to better understood societies such as Archaic Greece certain Central Asian groups and even Medieval Europe although that carries a series of complicationsBasically the idea is that these kings were more the leaders of diverse and noncommunal war bands who could form and serve as a result of endemic regional conflict Particularly succesful warbands could even take over cities not unlike Francesco Sforza in Milan,0,cdnn71l,1rhv7u,askhistorians,new,1,1
Nrussg,edit after looking at uidjet and uqed s responses I wanted to modify this comment I put the edit at the front so people see this before reading the passage and retained the wording of the original post to maintain the record But I was a bit hasty in writing this and didnt pay close attention to the period being specifically asked about My response should be viewed as a later evolution of the evolution of the system described by the two others rather than an argument against what they said as it was originally intended uqed s answer is slightly misleading regarding how the inquisition actually functioned While part of the function of the Spanish Inquisition which was actually two separate branches of a larger system did have a mandate to convert and later expel Jews and Muslims in the Iberian peninsula However this was only one facet of what inquisitional courts did this makes more sense when you look at the other larger inquisitional courts in Venice and Rome which didnt have the same religious diversity as Iberia In truth inquisitional courts were just courts that handled religious issues at the allowance of the secular power in the region Theyre strength and mandate were variable for example in the Kingdom of Castille central Spain basically the inquisition did not handle cases of sodomy while in Aragon think Barcelona the inquisition did handle cases of sodomy Going over what specific cases were handled by the inquisition would be too much but Christians were prosecutedNow for the why Inquisitional judicial systems were based off a different divergent idea of how courts should work We are generally use to the broadly English derived legal system huge simplification but this is the type of court with defendants witness prosecutors etc Inquisitional justice was based on confession as the primary way for establishing if the accused was guilty and confession at times necessitated torture In truth threat of torture was way more common than actual torture theyd kind of just show them the devices as an implicit threat but at times torture was used the rack thumb screws and leg screws were most common along with water torture anything else was rarely or never usedTorture as part of inquisitional cases is well documented sense the inquisition took fantastic notes and their trials serve as great if biased primary sources They also liked to spy on people in their cells and write it down seriously usefulSources Sherry Velasco Criminal Lesbians Kathleen Long Jacques Duval on Hermaphrodites I can link more if there is interested These ones deal with the inquisitional courts and case of homosexuality but thats just cause theyre from a class focusing on sexuality in Early Modern Europe     ,1,cdnhr2p,1rhwav,askhistorians,new,7,6

XenophonTheAthenian,Oh boy oh boy naughty words I think Ill share one of the nasty phrases I know and its one of the tamer ones We find in Aristophanes Birds the phrase Hes gone to the crows Thats an idiomatic expression thats difficult to translate into English Whats usually said is that Go to the crows means more or less the same thing as modern English Go to hell But its not really that good a translation Go to the crows doesnt have a meaning quite as strong as Go fk yourself but its not a very nice thing to say To go to the crows implies death and not just death but that your body will be lying out in the fields for the crows to feast on Maybe thats not a big deal to hear these days although there still is the phrase Go die in a hole even though its meaning has been pretty significantly blunted but in the ancient world thats on nasty thing to say to someone It means that not only do you wish the end of his existence but by expressing that wish youre actually cursing him Plus youre cursing him with a death without proper burial and funerary rites doomed to be the food of the carrion birds cursing his soul to torment forever since the Greeks like pretty much everyone else believed that lack of proper funerary rites led to various forms of netherworld unhappiness Not a nice thing to wish for someoneWith curses in mind lets also recall some of the Athenian curse tablets Curses are a frequent feature of tragedy and in Greece curses more or less take the form of an invocation of the god or an oath to the god that takes a negative form So instead of invoking the god for the purpose of blessing you or allowing an action to happen youre asking him to harm somebody else The curses were written on lead tablets and read aloud These curse tablets arent insults per se but a lot of them say some very nasty things about the victims of the curse and ask the god to do some pretty evil things to them A lot of these have never been published or translated but they ask the god to destroy peoples livers and lungs and other organs to inflict them with poxes to chill their minds and spirits to make them deaf mute and blind to go die in various ways including many tablets that have been buried under houses or just underground with the inscription Here I have buried soandso etc Sounds an awful lot like Go die in a hole you SOB In a similar light we see that many of the graffiti inscriptions at Pompeii are pretty insulting They rarely actually insult people with swears or anything like that but they frequently point out very embarrassing things or make fun of people for certain things So we find that theres a famous graffito that says in polite terms Lesbianus you defecate here and write Hello everyone A similar graffito on a different building actually writes a curse out To the person defecating here Beware this curse If you look down at this curse may you have an angry Jupiter for an enemy There are a lot of things about taking dumps in Pompeii and the Romans were big fans of making fun of defecation rather like the Greeks who seem to have found farts and penis jokes extremely funny We also get ones that say things like Secundus screws boys and Phileros is a eunich and funny things like that just as a side note my favorite graffito at Pompeii of those that have been published so far reads A person who buggers a fire burns his penis Wise words,7,cdnfb65,1rhwm4,askhistorians,new,49,42

myrmecologist,In understanding the tumultuous last days of the British Empire in India it becomes convenient to focus on specific personalities The cult of Gandhi or Jinnah the tact of Patel the dynamism of Mountbatten  such epithets may have some validity but they are largely unable to help us consider the events leading to the break up of the Indian subcontinentThe anticolonial struggle was at least at the height of Gandhian nationalism primarily a political struggle Jinnahs positioning for greater minority rights was not too illogical in such an environment Ambedkar too was struggling to garner political representation for the backward castes We have to thus be cognizant of the fact that the reach of the Congress while expansive and entrenched could not be totally representative of the whole of British India There were far too many factions with many diverse demands that jostled for space in the anticolonial movement of the th century British IndiaThe demands of the All India Muslim League Muslim League in short were largely couched in the language of electoral politics The Leagues fundamental demand was for a more equitable presence in the quasirepresentative measures that had been initiated by the British Government particularly in the s The League purported to represent all Muslims in the subcontinent But such a claim just like Congresss claims of allencompassing representation was limited and extremely provincial The League had a massive presence in Bengal presentday Bangladesh and a fair hold of Punjab Its presence in the United Provinces too was sizable Yet it could not contend with the organizational might of the Indian National Congress As such the bargaining tools at the Leagues disposal were limited And this is crucial  most of the demands that Jinnah presented were strategies of negotiation The demands were meant to garner a few crucial benefits for the Muslims While there was legitimate concern amongst the Muslim community and not just among those who identified with the Muslim League about the extent to which their rights would be safeguarded or violated under a Hindu majority regime there was no concerted effort to channelize those demands to the idea of a separate Muslim nation As late as  with the Cabinet Mission Plan about to be bludgeoned under the weight of contestations the League had no idea what exactly it meant through its recurrent threats for a separate Pakistan Jinnah too was a product of the nationalist politics which birthed Tilak Gandhi et al His faith in representative politics was steadfast and there is not much in his actions for us to consider him directly responsible for the Partition By  in fact Jinnahs hold over the Muslim League had considerably weakened The absence of a definitive idea of what exactly it meant to want a separate Muslim nation is suggestive of the inchoate nature of the idea Jinnah was the Leagues ideologue and he seemed to regard the twonation idea as a mere tool to ensure the safety of the Muslims and better representation in administration The ground reality however seemed more brutally in favor of the twonation theory The  HinduMuslim riots in Calcutta seemed to ironically legitimize the idea of an unbridgeable divide between the two communities As the historian Ayesha Jalal contends there is enough evidence for us to doubt this hypothesis What is more likely is that other divisive factors like the divide between the zamindars and laborers the animosity between traders and merchants and of course the presence of various Muslim petty gangs seeking to profit from the chaos magnified the HinduMuslim divide of the riots The Congress safe in its hold over the government formed by the Cabinet Mission plan quite likely overestimated the extent to which the League commanded power at the ground level The majority opinion among many in the League too favored a break once it became clear that the Congress was less inclined to negotiate with them Jinnah one could argue was stuck between an uncompromising Congress a hesitant British Government and an impatient set of followers Converting the twonation idea into a veritable reality seemed the only way to break the deadlockJinnah thus is to be blamed if we understand history from the lens of nationalist Indian historiography He could be blamed for highlighting the societal fault lines of the Indian nationalist imagination Jinnah could be blamed for stoking the fires of HinduMuslim animosity Jinnah could be held accountable for the hundreds who were killed on the streets of Calcutta or for the many millions who were butchered on both sides of Punjab Jinnah could be blamed giving birth to Pakistan for its illegitimate child of Kashmir for making the subcontinent a nuclear war zone The QuaidiAzam could be held responsible for all this But if we do so not only do we judge the man unfairly we also accord him an influence much higher than what he wielded For if he was indeed responsible for all the ills of the Indian subcontinent he had to be man of immense influence right Jinnah could be blamed for Indias partition to the extent that we consider the demand for a separate Muslim state of Pakistan illegitimate ,0,cdnv2wc,1rhz3e,askhistorians,new,4,4

Spinoza,Youre talking about a number of different things here which Ill try to break downsex before marriage This has of course always existed but the discourse about it has changed It is true that in many places it used to be such a break from the norm that it probably was less common But probably in some cultures it used to be relatively common In Groningen the area my family is from Ive heard it said that traditionally people would not get married before there was a pregnancydating ie romantic connections before marriage This was much less controversial than the item before Indeed the discourse about this has changed much less As long as connections were socially acceptable to the parents and contact between the lovers happened in a controlled environment that precluded any inappropriate physical contact most western societies found some form for this The differences then existed mainly in how strict control should be and what contact would be inappropriatechoosing your own marriage partner This has changed rather dramatically indeed The main force that pushed this change has been the Industrial Revolution In an industrial society people are much more mobile and interacting with more powers other than their parents compared to an agricultural society In an agricultural society many parents have economic power over their childrens future but not in an industrial one The future of a farmers son depended mostly on if he could inherit his fathers farm The future of a factory workers son did not depend on his relationship with his father who had no control over the factory and probably didnt even own the house the family lived inIt should be noted that this is all a very Western point of view But so is the question in itself as concepts of marriage and dating still vary wildly from culture to culture,8,cdnilve,1ri0sb,askhistorians,new,83,75

apeunit,I cant speak comprehensively on every portion of this but I have a background in linguistics and a particular personal interest in the languages of the period so might be able to help with thatHowever its worth noting that it can be complicated to distinguish science from pseudoscience when youre talking about Sumerian linguistics At present linguists do not regard Sumerian as being demonstrably linked to any other known language although some hypotheses about possible linkages are more credible than others So what there is to say about it would depend a great deal on what youve seenAlso rlinguistics can be a great resource for that kind of information,0,cdnj1ue,1ri82c,askhistorians,new,1,1

idjet,Before answering this question Ive reviewed the chapter to refresh my memory It is very dramatic with multiple players speaking like an episode of Law and OrderWe are very fortunate to have transcripts of actual inquisitions of this same time period and so we could go through a comparative analysis But this would be fruitless Umberto Eco needed to serve a story before anything He made the choice to treat a session of inquiry an inquisito more like a trial for his dramatic effect Inquisitos were not trials during the medieval period they were question and answer between inquisitor and subject mostly a dialogue that was lead by inquisitor We have no evidence that there was neither some broad audience nor multiple subjects for these sessions a lot of the transcripts have marginalia notations like ask soandso follow up question and other manuscript indicators that suggest if there were other subjects in the room they might have eventually said something that would be recorded So we gather the inquisito was inquisitors scribesnotaries perhaps nobles as secular witness to proceedings perhaps Bishops monks or other clergy watching and listening Certainly we read stirring conversations stunning displays of logic and argument but not high theatricsUmberto Eco modeled his Bernardo Gui after the real Gui Here is an example from Guis own manual about dealing with subjects who attempted to doublespeak or use the inquisitors own language against himgtWhen one of them has been seized and is brought up for examination he comes as if without a qualm as if conscious of no wrongdoing on his part and as if he felt entirely safe When asked if he knows why he has been arrested he replies quite calmly and with a smile Sir I should be glad to learn the reason from you When he is questioned about the faith which he holds and believes he replies I believe all that a good Christian should believe Pressed as to what he means by a good Christian he answers One who believes as the Holy Church teaches us to believe and hold When asked what he calls the Holy Church he replies Sir what you say and believe to be the Holy Church If he is told I believe the Holy Church to be the Roman Church over which presides our lord pope and other prelates subordinate to him then he responds That I do believe meaning that he believes that I believe this Practica officii Inquisitionis heretice pravitatis Conduct of the Inquisition into Heretical Wickedness cEco is a medievalist a trained historian and philologist and so his work would be accurate  he likes to put his medievalist knowledge on display in The Name of the Rose His portrayal of Gui matches with what we know of him smart clever and a rigid determined dogmatic Catholic Reference Inquisition and Medieval Society James Given Cornell ,0,cdnule2,1rib5l,askhistorians,new,2,2
TheTurk,Hitler was known for having a very loose management structure much unlike Stalin in this regard Hitler was bad with scheduled meetings was sporadic and left a lot of the actual governing work to his administration and trusted Nazi officials He gave the government direction and government followed He was always open to new ideas and innovations in military technology and tactics He gave his generals a surprising amount of autonomy compared to the French case and point de Gaulle with the use of armour and Stalin pre about Needless to say this had many benefits for the German military and some downsides such as Goering pushing to allow his aircraft to bomb and finish off the FrenchBritish at Dunkirk which he failed to do rather than letting the army move in and crush them You have to remember that Hitler was largely disliked by the Prussian military aristocracy that had been led by Hindenburg before his death To make up for this among other things he gave a lot of autonomy to his generals and as most military books were being written in German throughout the s he had a wealth of knowledge to choose from This changed for Hitler on the Eastern Front as the war against Stalin in Southern Russia began to stall as Moscow was about to fall he decided to take full command of all military operations in Operation Barborossa in a mad attempt to secure the entire south and the Baku oil wells which failed spectacularly Very famously he denied Guderian the chance to seize Moscow but instead turn southwards This allowed Stalin time to regroup and push back against the Germans and her allies At the same time might I add on the Eastern Front Stalin began to relax his grip on the military and allowed his generals most importantly Zhukov to have a greater say in the running of the war and battle plans Stalin gave in eventually and decided to trust his generals especially Zhukov Cant pinpoint a date Im afraid TLDR How much autonomy a leader gives to his gifted generals and its for sure a fine balance can change a lot the outcome of a war Foolish decisions for personal glory usually end in vain defeat Even Stalin had to swallow his pride to allow Zhukov command ,9,cdnrex8,1ribha,askhistorians,new,25,16
OiBoi,You may want to consider tweaking your question just a bit and replacing tactician with strategist In the modern military use of the word tactics refer to troop engagements battles or parts of battles Im assuming you mean more the big picture or the Operational and Strategic tiersThere is some level of disagreement among historians about Hitlers brilliance was he just lucky or was there actually some genius behind his moves That being said Im just going to outright support the former notion with my response until someone more knowledgeable shows up Overall Hitler made bold gambles at critical times which often paid off for him His decision to march into the Rhineland for example seems like keen calculation in hindsight but at the time Hitler could not have been assuredly confident that the French would yield so easily Similar successful gambles that paid off were the annexationoccupation of Austria and the handling of the Sudetenland first getting the Sudetenland at the negotiating table and then essentially taking the rest of the country by force afterwards People have a tendency to look at men who took big gambles and won as having genius Caesar at the Rubicon for example When you consider the successes of some of Hitlers gambles its easy to understand where the myth of his genius comes fromBut not all of Hitlers gambles were successful the failed Putsch in Munich and the invasion of Poland come to mind The latter one ties in nicely with your question of advisers as it was Ribbentrop Germanys then foreign minister who played a role in convincing Hitler that France and England would again try appeasement Instead WWII was started in earnest The notion of Germanys success in WWII being largely due to the competence of the men who advised Hitler or carried out operations under his general orders has some merit Germans quick victory over France was largely due to the result of plans made by the German General Staff primarily the Manstein Plan in combination with successful implementation of Maneuver Warfare aka Blitzkrieg not unlike a doctrine practiced by the modern US Marine Corps  The presence of a frontline commander of Erwin Rommels caliber should also be worth notingThis brings us to the BattleMiracle of Dunkirk  By the end of May  Several German tank divisions had roughly  allied troops trapped near the port of Dunkirk But on May nd a halt order was given to the encroaching Germans Ultimately the Germans gave the British an additional  to days to organize a mass withdrawal of some  men  William Shirer stipulates in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich that Hitler gave this order under the advice of Hermann Göring who wanted an opportunity for the fledgling Luftwaffe to annihilate the British and gain prestige  It would later be revealed that the order to halt was initially given by Von Rundstedt the German Commander and was confirmed hours later by Hitler However even if Shirers point is ignored  the mere fact that Hitler allowed for this delay and the escape of so many British forces essentially keeping Britain in the war is IMO at the very least strong anecdotal evidence that Hitler did not possess the military genius often misattributed to himObviously there are mitigating circumstances with Dunkirk in particular the mechanical state of the German Panzers and whether or not the evacuation on that scale could have been reasonably foreseenIm dead tired so Im going to stop here My sources are primarily military history courses Ive taken as a Military Strategic Studies major and Shirers Rise Im well aware of the faults people have pointed out in his work but I dont think his adherence to the Sonder Wegtheory much affects this question Lastly when referring to a military genius Im using the term as defined Clausewitz Good night,1,cdnrytj,1ribha,askhistorians,new,15,14
vonadler,Ill recap my earlier posthttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsmnhowwashitlersmilitaryacumencxaa on Hitlers tactical and strategic acumenHitler was not a great general far from itHis good sides He was prepared to sidestep seniority and adapt a good and innovative plan when it was required See for example Mansteins Fall Sißelschnitt plan for the invasion of France He was a risktaker and would bet hard on small chances and narrow margins Especially early war this paid off quite a bit He bet that the French would take more than two months to assemble a serious offensive to relieve Poland and defended the west with a motley collection of second and third line divisions that lacked much of their equipment The campaign in Norway was also a prime example of thisHowever this is where his good abilities stopHis bad sides He was unable to organise the high command and the war in a unified way instead encouraging infighting between the OKH Oberkommande des Heeres High Command of the Armies and the OKW Oberkommande der Wehrmacht High Command of the Armed Forces and intriguing between officers for command his attention and the spotlight which gave them more resources he had this fault when it came to politics as well and encouraged infighting to ensure that noone fought him for the supreme position He was unable to take criticism feedback or in any way take the blame for any failure That way he would not learn and would not improve as a general In the long run it also meant that he appointed yesmen and commanders with political skill rather than skilled generals to conduct the war All others were simply removed He was unable to see skill in defeat Some German generals did miracles kept their armies together and delayed the enemy and caused him massive casualties but were eventually driven back  Hitler saw this as a defeat and would remove the general He was unable to keep himself from the details losing overall focus and oversight He would often study things in extreme detail and berate generals for not knowing where their battalions were exactly which was the duty of the regimental or divisional commander not the army commander or industrial owners for not knowing details of armament Generals soon had to spend hours reading up on the exact positions of individual small units under their command before a briefing with Hitler time better spent on other things Hitler would also place battalions and move them around with no regard for the knowledge on the ground the strength and readiness of the battalion the local terrain line of sight and enemy dispositions etc He believed in fixed defence and placed troops like they had been placed early ww  with all firepower to the front preferably in fixed positions to blunt an enemy attack directly This is an amateurs view of war as much firepower as possible and in reality a flexible defence with small outposts up front and most of the firepower further back with a large reserve will allow you to blunt an enemy attack late ww or in ww much better Line thinking which goes back to the first village pallisade all through warfare until early ww was obselete  you needed to think along the lines of hedgehogs outposts and large fields rather than lines and Hitler could and would not He placed much too much focus on morale Ordering that veteran tank crews that had been defeated should not get new tanks first as they would be demoralised so they should go to newly trained crews with high morale instead In large area warfare from ww and onward morale was fed by food sleep and getting arms and ammunition needed Then the men used their training and fought for their comrades rather than consider any defeat or grandiose statements or signals sent by high command Hitler believed in these grandiose gestures and morale and was heavily mired in late th century romanticist ideas of morale nationalism and a national will He firmly believed his not a step back order during the  winter Soviet counterattacks saved the German army and that it was Napoleons order to retreat that had doomed the French invasion of Russia Most likely if the Germans had used flexible defence they would have lost less men and caused the Soviets massive casualties during the winter fightingHitler was disregarded as a General by the German officer corps He had not gone through officer school he had not been a cadet he had not been promoted to a staff position and done staff work and he had not played any kriegsspiel realistic board games the Germans used to play through potential battles at all levelsI use a rule guide to a generalOrganisation Can the general organise troops so they fight welland the civil society to provide him with more troops supplies and other things needed to fight Can he keep himself involved only at a level above and a level below his own to have focus on what he needs to do Does he understand logisticsHitler was a lousy organiser He inherited a strong officer corps and a good military tradition and a fantastically organised army but did nothing to improve it Indeed when it resisted his attempts at controlling it he expanded his bodyguard Waffen SS to a full army and that army was exceptionally crappy except for  divisions midwar He got involved at too much detail concerned himself about signals sent and much moreTactics Can the general win battles under different circumstances against differing and sometimes superior opponents Can the general delay superior opponents and keep his forces together under dire circumstances Can the general handle a guerilla insurgency as well as a line battleHitler used amateur military tactics and early ww thinking and refused to learn He was a lousy tacticianStrategy Can the general see the big picture can he use his victories to knock out enemies of the war can he follow up on successes and not go headlong into pursuits where he will be stranded Can he get allies and improve his positions without fighting Does he have an understanding on how to undermine the enemy ability to fightHere I would actually give Hitler something He was good at this He knew the need for strategic terrain knew the need for allies and knew the importance of raw materials However he lacked the planning for a long war which brings him down from an excellent gradePolitics Can the general keep in position despite others trying to remove him Can he get allies can he work with those allies Can he secure resources from himself work with his seniors juniors and equals Can he drum warring tribes together against a common foe Can he build a legacy that lasts Can he appoint the right men to the right place and promote competent peopleHere Hitler fails again He was unable to take criticism and removed anyone who opposed his ideas filling the OKW with yessayers He got into power and remained there but that is also all he managed to do in this area His legacy is destroyed and mere mentioning of it is an insultSo  good  failures Not a very good general I say If I would place Hitler anywhere it would be as a Staff Major at an Army Command,0,cdo0re0,1ribha,askhistorians,new,9,9

falafel,Interesting question complicated answer A little history on both men could probably help illuminate the answerLets talk Malcolm X first Born into urban poverty son of Garveyites exconvict member of the Nation of Islam until the last year of his life when he converted to Sunni Islam Malcolm Little as he was born had a deep hatred of racism inequality poverty and the social conditions surrounding him He lived mostly in the north so the racism he saw was not necessarily Jim Crow Separate but equal but institutionalized racism through discriminatory housing practices voting discrimination etc Therefore he advocated a militant resistance to white racism and separation from whites BUT the Nation of Islam prohibited political engagement so Malcolm X only preached it until the last year of his life when he founded the panAfrican Organization of AfroAmerican Unity which worked to reach out and make connections to other similar organizations like SNCC The last year of his life though through his exile from the Nation of Islam his conversion to Sunni Islam and his international travels Malcolm Xs rhetoric and political advocacy turned more toward cooperation with the civil rights movement though he advocated human rights healthcare housing employment etc rather than just civil rights voting representation etc For more on Malcolm X see Manning Marables Pulitzerprize winning biography Malcolm X A Life of Reinvention Alright lets talk Martin Luther King Jr Born into a religious family his father was a reverend too King promoted Christian love and nonviolence as the answer to racism Though King was critical of American politics he ultimately believed that the road to freedom was through social organization that confronted racist civil policies like segregation Therefore we have the Montgomery Bus Boycott as an example whereas with Malcolm X we dont only have one indication of him protesting publicly King was willing to engage directly to bring attention to the issues Towards the end of his life King turned more radical seeing how embedded racism was in the country part of this was influenced by his travels north where he didnt see the KKK or overt racism but like Malcolm X became aware of institutionalized racism He started to challenge underlying issues of racism like housing and employment issues of human rights not necessarily civil rights Sound familiar Historians have recently noted how at the ends of their lives King and Malcolm X seemed to approach an understanding of the deep roots of racism and began to challenge the traditional ways of the NAACP or the NOI Does this mean had they survived they would have agreed completely Probably not but identifying their late in life turns shows a remarkable similarity in ideologies Yes Malcolm X was a Muslim and King a Christian but ultimately they found strength in their faith to fight the roots of racism in America Heres what King wrote to Betty Shabaz Malcolm Xs wife after Malcolm was assassinatedgtWhile we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a raceSo I guess I would encourage you to rethink the divide between these two mens ideologies The history of African Americans resistance to racism is often framed King vs Malcolm X nonviolent vs violent when in reality the truth is much more complicated as it always is But if you want to look at factors that separate them look at their personal history and religion  For further reading Nikhil Pal SinghBlack is a Country Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy Robin D G Kelley Freedom Dreams The Black Radical Imagination Clayborne Carson Martins Dream My Journey and the Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr Martin Luther King The Essential Martin Luther King Jr I HAVE A DREAM AND OTHER GREAT WRITINGS  ed Clayborne Carson Malcolm X The Portable Malcolm X Reader ed Manning Marable,0,cdnnd3q,1rien4,askhistorians,new,3,3

SplendourFalls,I studied this in quite a lot of detail so Ill be happy to answerWhat was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of EnglandThe political situation was tense Following the Spanish Armada a hundred years before England had become fanatically antiCatholic legislating heavily against the religion and generally subverting it until by  it was a tiny minority  around  of the population In the seventeenth century your political allegiance was often predetermined by your religion and Catholicism was associated with absolute monarchy whilst Protestantism became associated with parliamentary or constitutional monarchy and the rule of law a lot of this is due to the propaganda surrounding the religious wars in Europe and the fact that Members of Parliament were generally devout Protestants I always like to use the analogy that Catholic meant to an Englishman in  what Socialist meant to an American in   there was very much a Catholic scare So when James II a Catholic inherited the throne in  and began overriding Parliament going over their heads and using his royal powers to enact proCatholic policies without the consent of Parliament things began to get ugly and Parliament feared James was planning to implement a Catholic tyranny an absolute monarchy of the type that had caused the Civil Wars a few decades earlier Even the Pope was wary of what James II was doing and urged the king to be cautious The tipping point comes when James II produces a son a Catholic heir Several highprofile figures conspire and sent a letter inviting James IIs soninlaw who would have become king had James not produced a son the Protestant William of Orange to take the throne with Parliaments blessingHow was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasionJames II had been allied to fellow Catholic the King of France and archetypal absolute monarch Louis XIV When William is crowned king  England joins the antiFrench bloc of states fighting in the Nine Years WarhttpenwikipediaorgwikiWaroftheGrandAlliance in EuropeHow was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasionI dont know much about this Im afraid They had warred in the past but James II did marry his daughter to William and they were big trading partners and Parliament would hardly have invited someone hostile to take the throne Even if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes England was actually conquered by The Dutch RepublicIt would be very difficult to argue that I certainly wouldnt recommend you make a statement like that in any academic work Its best to see it as a coup thats was justified at the time by portraying it as a glorious event Conquest certainly has far different implications and connotations that arent suited to describing the events of Now this is the interesting bit At the time the British Isles werent united under one crown but were three separate kingdoms that happened to have been governed by a single person since  Now William didnt conquer England in any meaningful sense but he certainly had to fight for Ireland in a war that lasted for several yearshttpenwikipediaorgwikiWilliamitewarinIreland There was also no guarantee that the Scottish parliament would offer William the crown though they eventually did in  and should the Scottish parliament have refused him the crown William might well have had to conquer Scotland  At this point I should also explain a little about the term Glorious Revolution Revolution only acquired its modern meaning violent overthrow of authority after the French Revolution of  but as early as  the events of  were known as the Glorious Revolution in England Its because revolution in this context is more literal  its a restoration in the coming full circle sense This is because those involved saw themselves as as restoring the ancient rights and liberties of Englishmen that came from Magna Carta in  rights they believed James II was infringingIm assuming this has answered the bit about why England didnt become a part of the Dutch Republic but basically thats easily answered by a quick look at the definition of a personal unionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiPersonalunionHow was the invasion successful with only  menJames II had no support whatsoever in England In July  before James produced his Catholic heir the Royal Navy mutinied after a Catholic captain had Mass performed onboard his ship and James had to pacify them in person which emphasises the tension of the situation in England at the time After William landed in England James was hesitant to engage the Dutch army and simply sat his troops in camp in the southwest of England his men deserting in their thousands having no intention of fighting for James It was a total capitulation and the army dissolved almost without firing a shot Interestingly enough the complete collapse of the

darthnick,Ill just add my two centsWhat was the political situation like at the time before the invasion of EnglandThe British Isles had just faced the British Civil WarsRevolution and Restoration This period of twenty years from  completely changed society within Britain It had deep implications for the government the monarchy and even the peasantry James II was a Catholic king of England prior to the Glorious Revolution There was widespread fear and disgust that he was taking influence in his rule by his Stuart ancestors as an absolute monarch This would have undone all the progress made since How was the political situation in Europe changed by the invasionThe Glorious Revolution is largely seens as the only successful peaceful revolution I say peaceful only in relative terms There were some very minor military conflicts but when compared to other famous revolutions where regimes have fell or changed there was very little blood shed This was a very positive aspect of the Glorious Revolution and there was far less shock when compared to the earlier events of the regicide at the end of the British Civil Wars William of Orange was generally accepted partially due to his marriage with Mary an English princess This helped to legitimise their coupHow was the relationship between England and The Dutch Republic before and after the invasionThe English and Dutch relationship was generally amiable During the Dutch Revolts in the sixteenth century England offered help unofficially It was unofficial help in order not to escalate a war with the Spanish Although the Spanish did eventually declare war on the English think Spanish Armada their was a concious attempt by the English to not officially escalate a war but also to help others which were politically and religiously alligned After the coronation of William and Mary the Dutch Republic certainly became less of a priority to manage This may be an offhand comment but it has been raised at other points in history particularly with the coronation of James IVI of EnglandScotland James I sought England as it was larger wealthier and far more influential A similar case could be made about William and Mary seeking England over the Dutch RepublicI read that a result of the invasion was that the dominance of world naval trade shifted from the Dutch Republic to England How did this happenI would disagree Although the Dutch naval trade was very prosperous so was the English England had strong trade links to most of Europe The addition of a further naval network simply benefited both countries Although I am not a specialist in this area I would imagine that this was simply a benefit to both countries rather than an amalgamation of the two networksEven if England remained England by name and it was touted as a revolution in England Would it be fair to say that behind the scenes England was actually conquered by The Dutch Republic If so why didnt England just become a part of The Dutch RepublicI completely disagree with this sentiment I see it as the English parliament allowed William and Mary to take up the English throne They were invited because a they had a legitimate right to the throne b they were protestant c they were malleable compared to James II Parliament could have raised another Civil War if they wanted to There certainly was a similar level of distrust towards James II as there was to Charles I Instead they saw a different avenue they could take I think your question relies very heavily on thinking the Dutch Republic had a superior military advantage and that is how they succeededHow was the invasion successful with only  menLike the answer above success depended upon the relationship between the English parliament and William and Mary James II had little to no support He could not muster a real defence The  men were to mop up the small protest made against the Dutch and to parade down the ThamesHope that helps,0,cdoermr,1rik13,askhistorians,new,2,2
lmack,Im speaking from a largely Canadian context  and most of the literature that Im familiar with revolves around the mining industry  but I think that there are some parallels that can be drawn between child labour in mining and child labour in textiles Notably I think I can address  to an extent  your main question regarding compensation Child labour in Canadian coal mines occurred extensively during the th century and petered out in the early decades of the th century In Cumberland County Nova Scotia for example they accounted for  of the mining workforce in the s  in the s and then  at the turn of the century  Boys in the mines generally gave their pay to their parents to dispense with  this became less common as the boys grew older but while they were living under their parents roof it remained common to contribute substantially to the family fund That said even young boys could often expect an allowance to be doled out by their parents out of their earnings Children in the pits often working alongside an older family member could contribute to the family economy in nonwage related ways also For example a boy in the mine could work alongside an older family member  allowing for the allotment of an additional coal tub that the older worker could help to fill to boost their production of coal higher than normal and ensure greater compensation These contributions  both in terms of additional wages and onthesite benefits ensured that childrens contributions to the family economy was often substantial For this reason it would be economically  as well as emotionally  devastating to lose a child to workplace injury or death Workers compensation plans spread unevenly In Britain for example the Employers Liability Act was introduced in  to provide some modicum of support to bereaved families Liability acts were also passed in several Canadian provinces in the lates  but these were not compensation acts they merely placed the possibility of liability for workplace injury at the feet of employers Workers families would still have to take the employer to court to receive compensation In Canada the first actual compensation act was passed in Quebec in  while Ontario and Nova Scotia followed suit in  and  respectively  In the US this type of legislation began to spread throughout the states after s  In terms of child labour until these pieces of legislation were passed the only recourse would be for the family to take employers to court Unfortunately social pressures would sometimes be enacted against families who opted to go for this option Ian McKay writes gtThose who had not understood the tight bonds tying families to the mines easily condemned the families who sought compensation for children killed in the Explosion of  in Cumberland County or other mining accidents inferring sordid profiteering from petitions more likely motivated by the desire of families to survive after the loss of an important breadwinner That said sometimes these cases did go forward Robert McIntosh describes the  legal action between collier John OHenly and the Acadia Coal Company regarding the death of OHenlys young son Endnotes Ian McKay The Realm of Uncertainty The Experience of Work in the Cumberland Coal Mines httpjournalshilunbcaindexphpAcadiensisarticleview Acadiensis   Autumn   Robert McIntosh Boys in the Pits Child Labour in Coal MininghttpbooksgooglecabooksidnGErYbmMqICampprintsecfrontcoverampdqboysinthepitsamphlenampsaXampeiuRiVUtTAYOTyQGYHQBQampvedCDAQAEwAAvonepageampqampffalse Montreal McGillQueens   Alvin Finkel Social Policy and Practice in Canada A HistoryhttpbooksgooglecabooksidmnXzPtWNcLECampprintsecfrontcoverampdqsocialpolicyandpracticeincanadaamphlenampsaXampeiJhyVUuaWBqWyygHnHIDAampvedCDAQAEwAAvonepageampqampffalse Waterloo Wilfred Laurier University Press   Price Fishback and Shawn Kantor A Prelude to the Welfare State The Origins of Workers CompensationhttpbooksgooglecabooksidBloQscCampprintsecfrontcoverampdqapreludetothewelfarestateamphlenampsaXampeihmVUvyLujyyAHXuYHDgampvedCDAQAEwAAvonepageampqampffalse Chicago University of Chicago Press    McKay  McIntosh ,1,cdnplix,1rikev,askhistorians,new,20,19

Skolman,Forgive me for the lack of citations and specific details as my materials on the topic are currently in a storage locker but I shall attempt to give you the basic answerYes and no By the final year of the war the south as a whole was in a state of near destitute as inflation was rampant and most of the labor force was engaged in supplying the confederate army in manner similar to Germany and Japan in WWII So yes life was pretty bad as a whole This may just be my uninformed opinion But I believe there are two roots to the Yankee brutalityLucifers Legions first you have the major parts of states and whole cities that were pillaged by Shermans March that were then burned to the ground as its their citizens were still in their homes but theyre were other cities towns and villages across the south which suffered near the same fate secondly you have the Prisoner of War Camps such as the famous Andersonville GA Prison Camp which were filled over capacity and downright filthy and putrid places and claimed the lives of  soldiers or approximately  who were sent to them Approximately  died in German POW camps and not by starvation typhoid fever etc But to simply stop there is to not pay the conditions of the confederacy the honor it is respectedSustaining the Confederate Army was no easy task when the majority of the Pre laborers were involved in the war themselves The popular belief that most southerners owned slaves is a myth rather the number is something like  in  families owned slaves and the average was  to  slaves and that something like  of slave holders owned more than  Prior to the Civil War nonslaveholding white southerners and even those who owned slaves were often doing the same type of labor and living a slightly better life than that of slaves as  of the nation was in poverty They were often sharecroppers and or practiced subsistence agriculture meaning life was pretty bad This life style only worsened as the war progressed when the men who didnt own plantations were drawn from their families and land to the battlefield This often left mothers and women to try and run the entire household so farming even worse than their husbands often did while simultaneously raising an average of  children As things worsened for the family the confederacy as a whole suffered from what Ill term regional specialization Correct me oh apathetic southern scholar if you would please that is there were distinct regions in which certain things were produced in each region ie cottonriceindigoother stuff if any extra was managed to be produced besides subsistence requirements and often only those As the War surpassed the expected end date of  year may of been  months these regions struggled to transition to support the needs of a nation instead of exporting its products to the North and Europe Combined with the Union Blockade and EgyptianIndian Cotton providing Europe its needs the South had little to no economic capacity Inflation thus grew steadily with the help of speculators who would purchase and hold what wheat and grains were available until it raised in price even more reaching near  by  after which it spurned to  during the last year of the war Yes those are thousand percent interest rates and items such as coffee and bacon were quite literally at  by the wars end Bacon was an important staple in th Century life because of its fat contentThus a vicious cycle was born Families could often barely sustain themselves without the paternal figure of the household yet they were expected to produce sustenance for the Confederate Army Those who did produce for the Army were then payed in sums which had no competition with the rising inflation thus they had to try to sustain themselves all the while being worked figuratively while sometimes literally like a mule to the point of exhaustion and death This cycle grew larger faster and more vicious each time it returnedWhile the Southerners were being picked and prodded like cattle by the CSA Government they were often at the whims of Union Armies and their smaller components As with any war the invading Army often used the cities and towns they approached and occupied often for months at a time remember this was a slow war compared to modern wars When Union supply lines were destroyed or running low they would often use what was in the housetowncity they were occupying as a their personal kitchen pantry and alcohol cellar Some commanders prevented this some turned a blind eye some instigated it This was a process that occurred throughout the war on both sides but as the situation for food and supplies worsened the war also entered its more southern phase thus putting the brunt of the Union Armies needs on families and towns which struggled themselves I believe at one point near the end of the war I believe it was some time near spring  Generals and field commanders would instruct their soldiers to not leave anything that would be of use to the confederate war effort This often entailed a complete destruction of grain stores cattle and anything such as guns and jewelry which the soldiers wanted Im not informed of the nature of it but I assume that there were instances of rapemurder among the occupied areas Shermans March is well its Shermans March There have been countless pieces written covering every aspect of it Did Sherman sadistically burn most of his way to the sea while there were citizens inside No For the most part Sherman gave the townscities advance notice of their approach and informed the larger and strategic ones to evacuate because he was going to burn it down I think he gave Atlanta two or three warnings and wait  days but a CSA leader said not to evacuate the city was impenetrable or something similar Georgians as a whole were told to stay put and fight which made the situations worse upon themselves Smaller towns and nonstrategic cities were often just pillaged as Sherman had no supply lines on the MarchAn anecdote that should be noted as that both the North and the South participated in the pillaging process and the treatment of prisoners so some of the actions taken were retaliatory also of note is that the first phase of the war was initially fought outside the deep south primarily border states and northern states so southerners often knew little of what occured and what the south did to the north which was as equally disturbingWas southern life bad during the last year No doubt but as bad as some say it was Ill let you decide,2,cdnpoal,1rindw,askhistorians,new,11,9
seangt,The South had a great deal of suffering because of their horrible economic conditions which was then compounded when Sherman came through and committed total war especially in Georgia and South Carolina The stories of raping and pillaging had some truth to them but they were greatly exaggerated in many cases Sherman left many houses like the Henderson House in Dallas GA stand along with many others David Williams that teaches at Valdosta State University in Georgia wrote an article about women who rioted for food and supplies because inflation was so bad The Confederate Government was also not reigning in the Planter class or speculation because those people ran the government A judge from Paulding County named WA Foster wrote a county history for Paulding and according to the sources he used prices for boots coats and pants were into the hundreds of dollars Meat was nonexistent in markets Bacon was  a pound All in May of  These prices would be absurd for us in  so you can imagine what this looked like to the citizens in  Now when Sherman came through he did burn and destroy a lot and many people who had fled their homes to avoid the fighting came back to nothing heading into the winter of  Citizens were suffering greatly but this was a combination of internal issues along with Sherman marching into the south Sources WA Foster Paulding County Its People and Places            Robert Lucien A History of Paulding County             David and Teresa Williams The Women Rising Cotton Class and Confederate Georgias Rioting Women httpwwwjstororgstable,1,cdnnlns,1rindw,askhistorians,new,9,8
QVCatullus,The Romans had indeed done precisely that  breaking up barbarian nations and incorporating them into areas that were short on manpower Sometimes they were left somewhat cohesive but transported far from home to limit their ability to side with their former countrymen against Rome  hence everyones favourite Sarmatians in Britain for example By the end of the empire though they had suffered tremendously in their ability to dictate terms the best example of that would be the admission of the Goths into the empire under Valens and Valentinian that led via brutal mishandling of the Gothic immigrants and poor handling of the situation in a military sense to the battle of Adrianople After that battle the goths in particular were more or less a presence in the Empire that the Romans were unable to completely subdue so it became necessary to treat with them  consider that after the fall of Rome to Odoacer the Ostrogoths took over Italy ostensibly on behalf of and with the consent of Constantinople due largely to the fact that there simply wasnt much that Constantinople could or would do about itIts important to realize that after Marcus Aurelius the shift of the role of the Roman army and the imperative of the emperors became much more at most but not all times through the remaining history of Rome about defending against other Romans than it was about defending from foreign foes The collection of heavy forces into the comitatenses had a great deal to do with the emperors ability to keep an eye on the troops rather than a strategic imperative to have a strong centralized reserve By the late empire the emperors had reasonably effectively pinned themselves into defensive positions in Italy like Ravenna and were more concerned with their fellow Romans and the threat of the the Vandals against the Italian interior than they were with whether the Franks were on a leash in Gaul The Visigoth entry into Spain for example applied pressure to the Vandals so very little was done about this by the Romans until Justinian I,8,cdnqgw0,1rio7f,askhistorians,new,18,10
Jazz,Well the reliance was partly due exclusively to the urgency of the surrounding events After the Battle of Adrianople the crisis of the incoming barbarians had become so large that Valentinians son Gratian panicked and made the son of his fathers Master of the Horse Augustus This new Augustus whose name was Theodosius realized that something drastic had to be done to prevent even more tribes from moving into imperial territory Theodosius took a step which was to have grave consequences though it was necessary at the time  And of course as you already know what Theodosius did was bring in barbarians to the army which will sooner or later transfer the power away from roman handsSources The Age of Justinian The Circumstances of Imperial Power Pg ,0,cdnwrtq,1rio7f,askhistorians,new,5,5
LDPotter,Agree with QVC and also the process of incorporation of tribal armies into the Roman legions occurred over many decades  Stationed far from Rome the local culture and the Roman culture were always in tension  Moving troops meant moving entire communities  complex expensive work  so incorporated tribes were left in their homelands and gradually Rome was absorbed not the reverse as was the plan  This was all exacerbated by the focus of Rome itself on maintaining the capital region which was huge rich and not particularly productive  The focus of the worldview was extracting from the empire to feed the center This didnt facilitate Roman leadership seeing the beggar picture,0,cdnr8di,1rio7f,askhistorians,new,2,2
Grombrindal,It was mostly due to funding The Roman Empire had a very large border to guard from Hadrians Wall to the Rhine to Mesopotamia and needed a certain number of soldiers to man these defenses which slowly became a higher and higher amount as the foes on the outside got more powerful Say what you will about economic decline within certainly that played a part as well though I am not as familiar with the economic side As Rome needed more soldiers it was simply not possible to guard the border with primarily legionaries they had to be paid more had more significant pensions and generally used more expensive equipment so the balance started tipping towards auxiliary forces which became the majority sometime in the third century As for your statement about breaking up the armies of potential foes this was done at least initially to provide the Roman Army with something it did not possess especially cavalry And in general foreign warriors would be more likely to join the Roman army if they could maintain some semblance of their own culture in units of their own tribesmenBy the time that the Romans were relying on their allied kingdoms to supply most of their armies it was already too late the border too long and porous ,1,cdnzjh7,1rio7f,askhistorians,new,2,1

koinelingua,Wed have to analyze each instance individually And also note the caveat of uhusky But for the sake of convenience in my answer Ill sometimes refer just to homosexuality where I really mean homosexual sexual acts The Levitical laws legislate against samesex intercourse  and in line with the general worldview behind the legislation in the books of Exodus through Deuteronomy are almost certainly aimed at the preservation of purity and a notion of natural order There is very little ancient Near Eastern legislation to compare these laws with whereas usually many laws in the Hebrew Bible can be compared with these  the other relevant ANE laws dealing mainly with nonconsensual samesex relationshttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentshonhowdidtheancientbabyloniansviewcawbvf However as an interesting corollary to the homosexual acts vs homosexual identity debate there may be slight evidence that the Hittites could conceive of homosexuality as an quasiorientationhttpwwwredditcomrAcademicReligionMythcommentszkoahittitepathologizingofhomosexuality Or to be perfectly accurate an illnessMoving on youll sometimes hear that the primary offense of the Sodomites was a failure of hospitality  not of homosexuality While this is absolutely a crucial part of  the narrative how they violated these norms matters a great deal The particular nature of their attempted violation is perhaps double transgressive it was of course against angels  those who in a way are more exalted than humansnot the other way around obviously Also as the other ANE laws seem to consider samesex rape to be particularly shameful this might have been considered to contribute to the gravity of their offense also in Egyptian mythology see Sets sexual violation of Horus where its said that he has done a mans deed to him shaming himOf course in early Jewish interpretation the story of Sodom is indeed clearly singled out for the attempted homosexual offense This is evidenced in Jubilees f and Philo De Abr f among other places quotations of both these found herehttpwwwredditcomrAcademicBiblicalcommentsglsodomandgomorrahwentafterotherfleshjudecahsl This is also most likely the perspective taken up in the New Testament itself  the epistle of Jude reads that Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities   indulged in sexual immorality ἐκπορνεύσασαι and went after other flesh There is a strong connection with these other traditions  and Ive written at some length about all this herehttpwwwredditcomrAcademicBiblicalcommentsglsodomandgomorrahwentafterotherfleshjudecahslThere have been allegations that the relationship of David and Jonathan was homoerotic Im honestly not very familiar with the issue though there have been quite a few studies of it in recent years Heacock  Harding  Williamson  Ackerman  was basically an entire monograph dedicated to itNext we come up against Paul in his epistle to the Corinthians specifically  Corinthians  Here we have a classic vice list  or rather a list of types of people who engage in unrighteous acts thieves the greedy drunkards revilers etc An enormous amount of ink has been spilled on two of the named types here in Greek malakoi and arsenokoitai for relevant scholarship see Wright  Petersen  Wright  Its perhaps easier to start with the latter first This term arsenokoitai in fact appears to be a Pauline neologismhttpwwwredditcomrAcademicBiblicalcommentscyappaulsneologismsincorarsenokoitaimalecdrg and is composed of two elements arsen which means male and koitē which means bed  and together bedder of men But this word actually connects back to the Levitical laws mentioned earlier The earliest Christians used the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible the Septuagint and in the relevant laws on homosexuality we also see these two words together arsenos koitēn Leviticus  So Paul appears to have coined this neologism based on Septuagint Leviticus But of course a very long time had passed since the original writing of Leviticus and Pauls time Different time different culture One question is what sort of act or configuration did Paul understand the Levitical law to signifyhttpwwwredditcomrAcademicBiblicalcommentsiwiupaulstermsforhomosexualpracticeinThe other term that Paul uses malakoi is also problematic Its root μαλακός has a range of meanings from soft to sick etc Ive argued before that with Pauls consecutive use of arsenokoitai and malakoi he intends to respectively refer to the passive and active male partners of a homosexual acthttpwwwredditcomrAcademicBiblicalcommentsiwiupaulstermsforhomosexualpracticein However I think its entirely possible that with the active partner Paul meant to refer to the erastēs  the pederast who he viewed as engaged in an exploitative institution But this was an institution that obviously had legitimacy in the Greek world In order for the passive partner to be ethically culpable this would obviously have to require some degree of consent Theres ample precedent for the criticism of this passive partner  as being sort of overeager to please  for example by Pauls Hellenistic Jewish contemporary Philo of AlexandriaOne of the less ambiguous passages that addresses homosexuality can be found in the first chapter of Pauls epistle to the Romans Quoting from NASBgtFor the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness  God gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error,0,cdns1im,1riuwq,askhistorians,new,17,17
narwhal,It can be a bit tricky to understand what makes someone a historian vs a theologian the reason being there are historical disciplines within theology Effectively what you would call a historian of the Bible will often be titled as a professor of theology and will often speak of themselves as such despite having identical if not far more intensive training in history than those otherwise called historians The task here in terms of identifying history related credentials is unfortunately obscure without looking more closely into someones background than their titles viz that they be in subfields related to Biblical StudiesIn terms of your question the matter has less to do with a consensus by historians regarding what the Bible says about homosexuality and far more to do with the creation of disciplines like psychologypsychiatry which from my understanding is where the current conception of sexuality comes fromBy current conception of sexuality I mean a somewhat bimorphic sexual orientation The Bible in its original context and its interpretation until this concept emerged was unencumbered by such a notion and the extend to which it is imposed on the text actually imparts a worse reading on todays reader than a reader would have had of the text in the Middle Ages To oversimplify things a bit historians cant really work with modern categories on this issue because it is anachronistic To ask historically whether or not the Bible is for or against homosexuality is akin to asking if the Jesus was a feminist This isnt a question that really fits into the historical study since it requires a leap in terms of interpretation and equating of concepts unavailable to a historian in this case it is actually the theologians that need to parse such things outA historical question and one thats come up here not infrequently is how the understanding of homosexuality has evolved including through ancientbiblical times and you might find other threads which cover that,0,cdnrma2,1riuwq,askhistorians,new,7,7

Celebreth,Alrighty cause I just noticed this thread Im going to go ahead and do a writeup on this Im going to try to address all of the questions already asked in the body so bear with me barring the question thats outside the purview of my specialty First Im going to confirm a simple fact Roman soldiers were not allowed to get married That changed depending on rank but the rank and file were not legally allowed to get married  so there werent any wives at home that had to get that painful letter for the standard legionaries However men are men and people are people and the vast majority of the time a legion was just garrisoned in a province People in that situation naturally develop relationships and those relationships were tactfully ignored by the officers who totally understood the situation these men were in They werent allowed to get married but they WERE in love  the great rock and hard place argument  The thing about being in the Legion Im assuming were talking about the Principate here  that would be ca ish CE was that once you were in it was a  year commitment While you got great benefits those  years could be hard on a man  especially when that man wanted a family So the natural solution Civil unions Those civil unions were essentially the same as marriage just without any of the legal entitlements that they would otherwise have so pretty much it was marriage Just without the government recognition Confusing eh One big issue with this was that many of the women that the Romans took to wife were natives of the area they were garrisoned in or even former slaves The soldier would buy them and promptly free them Those families would of course also go on to have children  and those children called themselves in castris  or born in  the camp They generally went on to join the military just like their parents and theres a tombstone outside the fortress of Legio II Augusta that commemorates a woman her soldier son and her husband The monument itself was erected by her daughter Howeverthe unfortunate bit is that there are always those damn legalities We have evidence of seven cases that deemed children born during their fathers terms of service to be illegitimate Didnt matter if they were citizens or anything  if they were in the legions or auxilia that child had no claim to be the heir of their father his will etc Same with the wives  except the wives also couldnt get their dowries back Legal wives could Now on to the husband dying Its hard to say exactly how they were informed  however if they were one of these quasiwives it would have fallen to the mans tent group contubernium  who would have known about the quasimarriage  to let the woman know The wives either lived right outside the fort in the canabae or even in the room with the rest of the contubernium A quick note here  privacy wasnt such a huge deal until recently most especially regarding situations with large families All in one room or in these cases  men in one crowded room  it would have been relatively common for at least one to have a woman in there with him I do want to stress though regarding another question in this thread that the legionaries still maintained strong family ties with both their quasiwives and their illegitimate children The vast majority of tombstones near military encampments are commemorations by the wife or unrelated heirs coughchildrencough We have multiple declarations by these soldiers declaring these children to be their heirs the children are explicitly mentioned in the wills and provided for them As for notifying family such as parents siblings etc I have no source on that one  I can only speculate that the contubernum would send a letter to them as wellFinally onto one last question that was addressed  Could officers and commanders be married The answer to that is yesish The senatorial and equestrian officers were certainly allowed to be married Legionary centurions were also exempt however we have no sources regarding the auxiliary centurions or the decurions  we can assume that they would also be exempt but its no guarantee Their wives and children would also have accompanied them but they The senators and equestrians at least  the centurions could and did were forbidden from marrying local women The senatorial and equestrian officers also spent far less time in the military  it was generally just a step in their career Now finally on to what happened when a soldier died One of the many deductions from the soldiers pay was a contribution to a burial fund that was organized per century It wasnt much  it would only cover the costs for a basic funeral  but it was something Ill go ahead and just quote straight from Goldsworthy for the next bitgt A funeral procession carrying the corpse on a couch would leave the fort or camp for like many contemporary societies the Romans insisted that burial take place outside the settlement Once outside and often on a site running alongside the main road leading to the fort the corpse would be laid on the couch on top of a funeral pyre There it would be burnt and once consumed by the flames the ash of both corpse and pyre gathered into a funerary urn made sometimes of marble or metal but most often of glass or pottery which was then buried Around the grave site the mourners took part in a funeral banquetgt  The chief mourners were a mans comrades and as the practice of taking an unofficial wife became widespread his family It is doubtful that the burial club paid for more than the most rudimentary of markers for the grave but many soldiers set aside money to pay for expensive stone monuments Many tombstones state that they were erected by a mans heirs in accordance with his will I sincerely hope that helps  If you have any more questions please dont hesitate to ask themSourcesGoldsworthy Adrian  The Complete Roman ArmyScheidel Walter  Marriage families and survival in the Roman imperial army

Vincenti,To put it bluntly theres just no evidenceIs it possible a lost society could have flourished sometime in prehistory Technically yes but extremely unlikely All current evidence builds a picture of Homo Sapiens existing for  years transitioning from small huntergatherer communities and nomads to the development of agriculture animal domestication and eventual industry Its telling of our lack of understanding of human prehistory when we cant be  sure when modern humans began and events of only a few thousand years ago have already descended into myth and legend let alone hundreds of thousandsIf metal tools or similar were found at a site or geologic age our current explanations would say is impossible that would require some rethinking of our timeline But currently an overwhelming amount of evidence points to the current picture of human existence being correct,27,cdnwwlh,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,171,144
coffeeinvenice,Not a professional historian but a background in earth science and its occurred to me as an intriguing possibility as well To put it simply As Vincenti points out theres just no evidence Its possible that it happened but no archaeological evidence has been found yet With advances in archaeological techniques this is increasingly unlikely Even in Geology its been possible to demonstrate ice age events as far back as  million years ago To the best of my recollection there havent been any lost civilizations Every civilization has passed on some elements of its culture to subsequent cultures or evidence of its culture whether they had cities or not Even the Minoans and Indus Valley civilizations seem to have left some trace of their existence in Mycenaean sp culture and Egyptian historical records and in Dravidian cultures respectively Lets assume for the sake of argument that vanished pre years BP civilizations could have developed and subsequently disappeared with all evidence gone well call these Group A civilizations Given that every civilization since the end of the last ice age lets call these Group B civilizations has left at least some trace of their culture in subsequent cultures one would have to provide a plausible explanation why the Group A civilizations disappeared without a trace and the Group Bs did not Its intriguing to think that the last interglacial the Eemian lasted from  YBP to  YBP with a climate closely resembling the current climate During that  year interglacial Homo Sapiens could have gone from the Neolithic to the Space Age but there is absolutely no evidence of any civilization during that period,16,cdo073k,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,78,62
cahamarca,This is a great question because we know so little about the distant prehuman past  Humans have been on the planet for such a short amount of time only a few geological seconds that its quite compelling to imagine another species arose to high technology long ago and snuffed itself out a few thousand years later only to be forgotten by the world  In fact I asked this very question on AskScience last yearhttpwwwredditcomrasksciencecommentsbrvwarewesurehumanswerethefirstanimalonearth and got a lively response  From what I learned there and elsewhere since I think we should break the question up into several questions Could another nowvanished Earth species have developedspaceaged technology  No  We would have encountered their remaining artificial satellites in orbit when we first put ours up and found geological layers with clear evidence of nuclear testing  Imagine if the Apollo program had encountered a millionyearold lunar lander and flag when they visited the Moonmodern metalworking and industrial technology  Again no  It seems perfectly certain we would have encountered some material evidence some middens with millionyearold steel and copper wiring or something even if it was just a few screws in ancient rockagriculture Maybe Ants developed fungus cultivationhttpenwikipediaorgwikiAntfungusmutualism some sixtyfive million years ago which is arguably a form of agriculture  In fact when hymenoptera like bees and ants began living in colonies millions of years ago they hit a new level of social complexity that the mammals only matched very recently through us  Wilson and Holldoblers The Ants describe how this form of ant civilization allowed them to basically take over the world displacing nonsocial insects to the fringes of ecosystems symbolic toolbuilding cultures like CroMagnons and Neanderthals This is within the realm of possibility for sure  Theres no evidence but on the time scales were talking about here millions and millions of years its not clear there ever could be surviving evidence  The one fact working against such hypothetical bursts of humanlike culture seems to be this no candidates in the fossil record for a species with suitable cranial capacity to approach largebrained humanlevel cultural traditions  However thats possibly a limitation of the fossil record  As a matter of historical fact an ancient cephalopod species that developed language composed poems went to war and made tools would be invisible to us because they leave no skeletons  Its compelling to think how much history we still may not know about,2,cdo1yym,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,51,49

Rabbits,Theres numerous problematic assumptions to your question the first of which being that fossils though relatively scarce are still recovered from a wide variety of times and places to form a coherent genealogy of humanity Thats not really what you are asking though is it You want to know if anatomically modern humans AMH developed sedentary agricutural societies prior to the Neolithic RevolutionhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNeolithicRevolution In that case looking at human fossils is a moot point what you should be looking at is palynologic and genetic evidence of the crops which would have allowed the the existence of large groups of sedentary groups and in this the evidence is simply not there Simply put you may speculate that humans were neurologically complex enough to create complex agricultural societies but the evidence of domestication of a staple crop like wheat argueshttpwwwsciencemagorgcontentshort againsthttpwwwsciencemagorgcontentshort this proposition If you are asking about the probability of ancient societies existing on the same pattern that we now call civilizations replete with dense settlements supported by intensive agriculture then the botanical evidence is against youThe other problem is that while soil and burial conditions may make preservation of bones less than optimal the preservation of tools is less bound by those rules The archaeological record right now traces an evolution from simple stone choppers in Oldowan Africa up until sophisticated microblades in Neolithic Eurasia For some sort of complex civilization to have existed outside this evolutionary toolset they would have had to diverge from it while also leaving not a single trace of a lithic toolkit outside of what is already known Furthermore they would have had to avoid leaving evidence of the work they did with those tools in the form of other shaped objects anthropogenic landscapes and artistic works associated with this advanced toolsetBones can tell a fascinating story of an individual or even a species Civilizations however leave a multitude of evidence beyond the remains of their actors They leave evidence of the tools used to create objects the objects themselves the foods they ate and the areas they manipulated to support their societies There are multiple lines of evidence supporting the mainstream interpretation of human evolution and the development of complex sedentary societies These lines of evidence actually militate against contrary interpretations because such an interpretation would require extraordinary evidence contradictory with regards to tools and crops Even structure that decay away leave evidence of their construction in the form of exploitation of land caches of tools and foundationspostholes So no there is zero evidence for what you are suggesting and multiple lines of evidence arguing against it,2,cdo1vn5,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,22,20
oglach,Theres some indication of civilisations more advanced than we expected definitely But theres nothing to suggest wed ever find a highly developed civilisation like the Atlantis myth for example My own country Ireland for example has deep evidence for an advanced early civilisation Ireland is home to several structures that far predate more famous structures like the Pyramids and were built with techniques we formerly considered to be from GrecoRoman innovation Newgrange in Meath predates any standing structure in Greece Italy or Egypt by around nearly a millenia and Stonehenge by several centuries and uses architectural styles supposedly unknown until the Greeks came around over a thousand years later Scotland which was likeky inhabited by a culturally similar people also has several such monuments Later Irishmen looked upon Newgrange and similar sites with wonder by the time writing and literacy came around they were already mysterious ancient sites Theres no solid information about who built these sites or how So theres that element out there Certainly Ireland and Britain were home to advanced civilisation long before literacy was around to record them I think thats not just plausible its a given How this was all forgotten and lost and the Irish essentially devolved from that ancient civilisation to the tribal society seen by the Romans is still a mystery It may also be noted in a similar vein that when the Norse went journeying around seemingly unknown places like Iceland in the middle ages they found Irish people living there That Iceland was not only known of to the Irish but already explored and settled seems to imply an older knowledge of the area But of course thats just a theory ,4,cdo0ybu,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,11,7
henkiedepenkie,There is a significant school of thought that posits that although anatomically modern humans emerged around  years ago they only reached behavioral modernity around  years ago The latter may include language art complex tools etc Assuming that civilization building is only possible for modern humans this limits the time frame for possible lost civilizations considerably If you further hold that agriculture is a requirement as brought forward elsewhere in this thread which came into its own over the last  years or so you are further limiting the possible window And in fact over the last  years we have evidence of many societies so those would not be considered lost ,0,cdo3rpl,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,6,6
atomfullerene,As for your second question signs of human civilizations whether now or in  will be easily detectable  years from now and less easily detectable for millions or potentially billions of years after that  We have fossils of stromatolites sediment filled algae mats and pillars from  billion years ago that are basically just funny shaped rocks  Humans produce lots of funny shaped rocks and finding eg a series of cobblestones that had become buried would be a telltale sign of civilization  So would the bizzare jumbling of plant and animal life when species suddenly spread all over the world in the fossil record due to humans moving them around  Weve definitely made our mark which will remain even after the last building crumbles,4,cdo0ag1,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,8,4
Spoonfeedme,Vincenti makes some excellent points as to why it is very unlikely There are two real reasons why that is the case The first is the lack of artifacts Not only tools but structures monuments and more There is some work being done to search areas that were once above sealevel that are now under water but of course this is difficult What artifacts we do have suggest a progressive advancement and our timeline really runs for tens of thousands of years We not only have pretty good evidence about the spread of homosapiens limiting our search to areas that were inhabited by them but also a pretty good idea about the spread of tool use and technology in generalBut thats not all We also have access to genetics to help answer this question One to look at is our ability to continue to metabolize lactose a development that occured in the last  years This has been shown to increase health generally among the population who have the mutations required so it doesnt make sense for it to have appeared than disappeared again Another is crops Thanks to genetic analysis we have a pretty good idea as to when crops were domesticated and animals as well Without domesticated crops you arent going to have an advanced urban society and without that urban society you arent going to have the specialization of labour that helped spur other advancementsIn short we have no evidence that an earlier advance society existed and lots of evidence that suggests it didnt,2,cdo0db3,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,5,3
websnarf,Ill answer your second question first since it is trivial and hopefully will help illuminate the rest  In  million years there will be AMPLE evidence of our current ca  existence even if we were to be decimated tomorrow  The reason is because we have spread to nearly the entire surface of the earth and we have constructed gargantuan artificial structures sky scrapers dams roads railways Great Wall of china etc that even the worst erosion would leave significant remnants ofSo its simple weve left a multimillion year semipermanent mark on the surface of the earth with our activity on the planet so far  Theres some question as to exactly how many millions of years our mark would remain but I would guess in the hundreds of millions of years rangeSo working backwards now could there have been some really advanced civilization that existed long ago that is just outside of our archaeological range  Well one thing we can be sure of is that we know for sure that they didnt leave significant marks lasting more than  years spread throughout the world  So such a hidden society being as advanced as we currently are is basically impossibleIf you read Guns Germs and SteelhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiGunsGermsandSteel by Jared Diamond he explains that agriculture is dependent on many things  But two stand out in this case Geography and Climate  Modern Homo sapiens are as advanced as we are today because agriculture arose simultaneously in the middle east indus Valley China mesopotamia and the Andes about  years ago  The reason is because the ice age had ended and those locations are host to precereal grasses that lead to the domestication of wheat barley rice and cornIn other words if you think such a thing may have happened earlier you need to solve the crop domestication geography problem and the ice age problem  There was another opportunity between  and  years ago when again there was a warm interstadial  And indeed it was a genuine opportunity  Fossil remains show that homo sapiens were in the Levant area of the middle east and Indus valley at this time  When you take soil samples you can not only find fossilized bones but fossilized plant remains and even coproliteshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCoprolite  So you can estimate plant populations  So far no archaeology has revealed any older agricultural societies in either of these areas or anywhere else  Keep in mind that we have detected protofarming societies in the Levant area between  and  years ago during a very brief warm period called the Bolling Aelerod interstadial  So its not like I am presenting a fake technique that has never yielded resultsAnd thats it  Prior warm periods interstadials predate the existence of Homo sapiens  Of course remember we were all surprised to find the HobbithttpsenwikipediaorgwikiHomofloresiensis  They of course fail to meet your criteria because they were an offshoot of Homo erectus that was not on the Homo sapien line  But it points out that there may be remote areas on the earth that we have not visited at all and may be hiding ancient human populationsSo that remains the only possibility  Some hidden pocket of land which for some reason modern man has neglected to explore was somehow reachable by ancient Homo sapiens and which is host to domesticatable protocereal crops  I dont think there are a lot of candidates for this unless the place is currently under water  So Im going to say this possibility is extremely remote less than  chance,1,cdoi4wu,1rj3ri,askhistorians,new,4,3

farquier,The language as you yourself note is Hurrian a nonsemitic language related only to the even more obscure and poorly understood Urartian language albeit with Babylonian loanwords pertaining to technical termsjust as English uses many Italian loanwords in its technical musical vocabulary More broadly the Sucession of Languages and Civilizations model is at best an attractive oversimplification and this is a good example why It is true that the Hurrian Hymns are not from within the Hurrian heartland in the Khabur valley and perhaps dated to after the Babylonians had conquered much of the of the Khabur valley but that does not mean there were no Hurrians or Hurrian states elsewhere People did not just stay in the same region all the time they moved around from place to place In fact even in the time period when the Hurrian Hymn was written there were several Hurrian or predominantly Hurrian states such as Arrapha and the Mitanni empire which were important enough to produce Hurrianlanguage correspondence found in the Armana archive And the circulation of texts in many languages in various centers is quite normal the Armana correspondence for example contains letters in Akkadian Hittite and Hurrian and Ugarit has produced texts in Akkadian Sumerianwhich at this point had long since died as a spoken language but which was still an important language of literature and culture Hurrian and Luwian  It is also true that they contain dedications to Semitic gods but gods could and did circulate among multiple cultures The Hittite pantheon is a spectacularly extreme example of this containing preHittite Anatolian godsthe Stormgod of Nerik IndoEuropean gods Hurrian god and even various Mesopotamian gods The later phases of the Hittite myths are so throughly influenced by Hurrian myth that Hittite myth is sometimes called HittiteHurrian myth In fact it is quite possible that the semitic name Nikkal comes from the Sumerian name Ningalsuch borrowings are amply recorded most famously the fact that the hebrew word heikal comes from Sumerian ÉGAL via Akkadian Ekallum So Hurrians in Ugarit writing a hymn to a Semitic goddess with a Sumerianderived name in Hurrian is by no means absurd,0,cdok9jj,1rj5dl,askhistorians,new,1,1

GeorgyKZhukov,There are really two questions here one answered with fact and one opinion The first one I believe is fairly obvious in its answer Marshal Zhukov was a phenomenal military leader and an instrumental part in Soviet victory over Germany in World War II bet you didnt see that one coming Name a major Soviet victory during the war and Zhukov probably had his fingers in it Prior to the war he repulsed the Japanese at Khalkhin Gol which played a major part in ensuring the Japanese remained neutral towards the Soviet Union Once Germany invaded he played key roles in the defenses of Moscow and of Leningrad The encirclement at Stalingrad The reaction and offensive at Kursk Bagration Berlin Youd be hard pressed to find any general with such a string of victories to his name Even in his failures which were few he still managed to shine leading one of the most successful delaying actions during the initial German offensive and his one true defeat Operation Mars still being fiercely debated as to whether it was intended as a diversion which took a bit to many losses or if it was the main offensive which failedPoint is he totally deserved the nickname Marshal of Victory But that is really only half the question It is one thing to say he was a military genius rivaled by few others The other question though is whether he was the line between victory and defeat Whether the Soviets only won because he was there And no matter how much appreciation I have for the man I dont believe that to be the case The Soviets had other great leaders Rokossovsky especially comes to mind but he is only one of a number of leaders who could have filled the void left by ZhukovId hardly go so far as to say Soviet victory was always inevitable but especially with the aid rendered by the Western Allies through LendLease the Soviet Military was a force to be reckoned with and it is frankly hard to imagine the Germans being able to win against them even if the leadership had gone down a peg The Soviets certainly were stretched in their resources especially manpower contrary to the popular image of it being a limitless pool but Im not a believer in the Great Man theory and I simply cant endorse the idea that one man was the line between victory and defeat even if it was a man such as Zhukov,1,cdnwxso,1rjbxs,askhistorians,new,11,10
Nai,General Georgy Zhukov is almost universally agreed upon as being the leader in the Soviet Unions defense and eventual offensive against Nazi Germany during the Second World War Fellow Allied Generals and famous in their own right Bernard Montgomery of the United Kingdom and Dwight Eisenhower both recognized Zhukovs contributions as being pivotal not only on the Eastern Front but as being a key to the eventual victory of the Allies in the warAs a military leader Zhukov was a crucial tactician in some of the largest and strategically important battles both offensive and defensive of the entire war These include General Chief of Staff during the Red Armys defense of the German invasion Operation BarbarossaCommander of the Reserve Front during the Yelnya Offensive Commanded the successful defense of Leningrad Ordered the crucial counteroffensive during the Battle of Moscow leading to Germanys first defeat in a large scale battle involving over  million soldiersThese examples are what General Zhukov was able to achieve in a single year alone  The following years Zhukov went on to lead the Red Army in some of the largest battles ever fought in the history of warfare This includesThe  counteroffensive during the Battle of Stalingrad also known as Operation UranusThe  breaking of the Germany siege during the Battle of Leningrad also known as Operation Iskra These actions and the eventual liberation of Leningrad through the LeningradNovgorod Strategic Offensive led to Zhukov being made Marshal of the Soviet UnionZhukov went on to lead many more successful campaigns Kiev Vistula Berlin to name a few When one looks at all of his accomplishments not only their importance to the Eastern Front but to the war as a whole it can be argued that General Georgy Zhukov may have been the most important successful andor influential military leader on the Eastern Front if not the entire Second World War,1,cdnulrg,1rjbxs,askhistorians,new,7,6

SmilinDave,Khrushchev was effectively part of the team that ran the Soviet Union after Stalins death along with Beria and Malenkov So straight away you can see how he was in a good position to win the top job  he was already in a good position and was nominally aligned with his two enemiesBeria went first As ggorillagoriila notes Beria was promoting a political line that the more conservative members like Molotov of the Politburo were opposed to More moderate members would have been more disposed to Khrushchev in the first place Both categories would have feared Beria to some degree Khrushchev was also able to get the support of the military against Beria Berias position was a bit weak  he didnt have much of a base outside the security apparatus and that had been shaken up a bit prior to Stalins death so its possible he didnt have all his old power any moreWithout Beria Malenkov became vulnerable Malenkov was targetted for promoting consumer goods production From memory part of this attack was premised on the idea that there was a housing shortage and hence there were more pressing concerns Malenkov like Beria didnt have a particularly strong base in the party machinery  he had been closely tied to Stalin then to Beria now he had no backup So minus Beria and Malenkov Khrushchev was the last one left standingKhrushchevs power base seems to have been in the lower ranks of the party Time and time again when challenged Khrushchevs strategy was to marshall the support of the rest of the Central Committee He would also expand existing committees to make them more inclusive and thus diluting the power of the old guard or he would bring in lower ranked members as observers to meetings bit embarassing to pull a dirty trick when there are outsiders watch This is also how Khrushchev was able to ward off the AntiParty Group which was nominally a conservative grouping but had many people who just didnt like Khrushchevs leadership styleWhich also leads to how Khrushchev was ultimately defeated  his particular style of leadership seems to have been the determining factor He essentially annoyed enough party members and upset enough factions with his reorganisations and interference that he ran out of allies Then they threw him out in favour of Brezhnev who the other Politburo members could be reasonably sure wouldnt go around causing trouble by changing thingsSourcewise there is William Taubmans biography of Khrushchev its quite detailed about Khrushchevs leadership and rise to power Some of the contemporary sources on Khrushchev were a bit off the mark  they seem to have misinterpreted certain elements due to a lack of info The brief mention I made about Berias diminished position prior to Stalins death is discussed in Robert Services bio of Stalin or it might have been elaborated more in Montefiores Red Tsar I forget,3,cdo17a6,1rjcpb,askhistorians,new,25,22
LIPCSB,That far back  It honestly sounds like nonsense  Ive got a copy of that particular textbook though Ive never had a moment to actually crack it opencan you cite the particular chapter  Anyway European culture is a bit difficult to apply to this period  Going by the Kurgan model of IndoEuropean expansion that is out of Ukraine about  years ago rather than Anatolia  years agoDavid Anthony makes an excellent case using recentlyavailable Russian archaeological studies for the former though the latter has many adherents still this is the general portrait of Europe at the timeFarmers from Anatolia populate the Balkan Peninsula at this point  They speak an AfroAsiatic language that is the same family as Arabic and have an economy centered on grain and cow and sheepagriculture  They live in large villages often fortified and work copper and bronze  They have their warriors and their quarrels  They tend to replace rather than convert to farming the local huntergatherersthere are likely completely different ethnolinguistic groups in Northwestern and Western Europe but they will be mostly wiped out by the coming tide of farmers and herders  The ProtoIndoEuropean language and culture has been born in Ukraine and has harnessed the horse to begin the establishment of a staunchly patriarchal culture centered on warriornobles with chariots and whose wealth is measured in herds of horses and cattle and sheep  They will spread out into Europe and east into Asia soonnot so much in conquest as in cultural conversion as people will join their society hoping to strike it rich with very fruitful herds  From this root will spring Homeric Greece and Vedic Central Asia  More warlike than Mesopotamia  Id really doubt it  Mesopotamia is at this point is home to the worlds first true Empires  While the IndoEuropeans will give rise to a culture that overall can be described as generally warlike in that gathering up your brother warriors into a gang and stealing your neighbors herds is considered a rite of passage and that warrior chiefs get buried with their weapons in the most elaborate tombs its really hard to say that theyd be more warlike or wardriven than say Sargon of Akkad,0,cdnzg2t,1rjcq1,askhistorians,new,2,2

LIPCSB,This would be more a matter for asking rcatholicism given how much of it is rooted in theology but the basics of Catholic sexual ethics owe a lot to the integration of Aristotelian teleological thought on natural vs unnatural into Catholic theology  This became what is called Natural Law  Under this doctrine any action taken that does not reflect Gods will for the organs in question is sinful because it is going against Gods intention  It is on the surface a doctrine that most modern westerners would not agree with for example St Thomas assembled a hierarchy of sexual sins in order of mostdisordered to leastdisorderedhomosexuality and masturbation were just slightly less disordered than bestiality while heterosexual incest was by his analysis of natural law much more ordered because it was more in line with the purposes of sexuality  So if the purpose of a penis is to inseminate a vagina in order to cause egg fertilization then any use of these organs for other reasons is wrong  Masturbation is wrong because it is sexual pleasure outside what it was meant forthat is the actual creative sex act  Contraceptives are wrong because they divorce the act of sexual intercourse from its creative purpose  Its interference with Gods will  Even Natural Family Planning if used with the intention of foreverindefinitely keeping a couple childless is a grave sin in Church teachingIt took a while for the general nomasturbation nofornication nononstandardintercourse teachings inherited from a combination of old Jewish teaching and early Christian theology to expand to include contraceptivesbut thats because easilyavailable contraceptives are a rather recent invention in Christendom  Paul was rather sexually conservativethough not excessively so by the standards of the early Church Origen  years later would castrate himself in keeping with Christs if your eye leads you to sin pluck it out commandment  He didnt quite advocate total celibacyin his letters he says that celibacy leads to a holier state but advises that marriage is preferable to burning in the passions of lust  His exact phrasing is that an unmarried man can focus on doing Gods will while a married man must focus on his wifes willif youre burning with thoughts about women youre not focusing on Gods will anyway  Anyway where Christs words are used as the basis for this one oftcited passage is Mark  where Christ says that in marriage man and woman shall become one flesh  Contraceptives according to Church teaching impede thismost obviously condoms put a physical barrier in place between the fleshes preventing them from becoming one  ,0,cdnwn2b,1rje90,askhistorians,new,5,5

rosemary,Theres a lot of confusion about the reality or otherwise of Troy and it stems from thinking about it backtofront This is the curse of Schliemann Schliemann wanted everyone to think of mythical Troy first and only then wonder whether it was real But its completely barse ackwards To get it right we need to ignore Schliemanns propaganda campaign focus on what we know first and then work towards questions about the relationship with the mythsSo to do it the right way round the site in NW Turkey now known as Troy is most certainly accurately named since it was inhabited continuously from the late th century BCE until ca  CE We have many many contemporary writers telling us about it and heaps of Hellenistic and Roman era evidence about the city Its most common name was Ilion with Troia as a secondary name but the two were always equated with one another during this time There is no doubt whatsoever that it is the site known to the Greeks and Romans as Ilion and there never has beenOnly after weve established that does it make sense to go on to ask the secondary questions  and there are several secondary questions to ask Again it makes sense to work from the more historical questions towards the mythical stuff So Did Troy exist in the Late Bronze Age Certainly yes the archaeological evidence from Ilion shows that there was a decentsized Bronze Age city there comparable to Gordion in size which was at its height ca  BCE and then gradually dwindled away to nothing by ca  BCE Was it called Troy in the Late Bronze Age Almost certainly yes  provided we substitute the more common name Ilion and allow for changes to names from one language to another There is very little doubt that Bronze Age Ilion was the site of the city that the Hittites called Wilusa or Wilusiya which corresponds rather tidily with an early Greek form of Ilion One Hittite text hints at an association with a place called Taruisa which may or may not be the Hittite name that Greek Troia came from We dont know what the people of WilusaIlion called themselves because we dont know what language they spoke at that time But northern Asia Minor was certainly dominated by Anatolian culture not Greek so its going to have been an Anatolian language perhaps Luvian though an early form of Phrygian isnt impossible and it might be a language that we just dont know anything about At last the question you really want Is the real Ilion to be equated in any meaningful way with the mythical Troy Now that weve got the real stuff cleared up the longandshort is its a moot question A few respectable experts think that the answer is likely to be yes most would say no The reasons why no is the more popular answer boil down to the complete lack of anything at all to corroborate the myths        The existence of a real city doesnt mean the reality of a myth if it did wed have to accept the reality of Thebes as evidence that Oedipus really did kill the Sphinx or the reality of Jerusalem as conclusive evidence that Jesus was the son of God That way madness liesBased on that last answer your third fourth and fifth questions are pretty easy Achilleus and Hektor theres nothing to substantiate their existence In particular note that Hektors name has a Greek suffix and many other Trojans in the myths have Greek names too Alexandros Antenor Euphorbos Andromache Astyanax etc pointing to the name  and very likely the character  being a Greek creation What happened to the city This is a straightforward historical question See above the Bronze Age city gradually dwindled away to nothing by  BCE and it was resettled by Greeks a couple of hundred years later Where did the survivors go Well we never took the step of substantiating the reality of a war but its the same situation as with Achilleus and Hektor  theres nothing to substantiate a war WilusaIlion wasnt destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age it just gradually faded away Though theres some evidence of fire ca  BCE that doesnt equate to evidence of a city being destroyed by enemies we know from textual evidence that the city was ransacked by the Hittites a couple of hundred years before that but theres no archaeological trace and even if it was attacked by enemies theres nothing to indicate who those enemies were Its best to regard the violence at Troy if violence it is as part of a wave of destruction that afflicted many many many cities in Mycenaean Greece Anatolia Cyprus and Ugarit at the same time Anyway if theres no evidence of a war that means there isnt anything to say about survivorsNone of this diminishes the importance and cultural impact of the myth Its believed by some experts that in the thth centuries there was a clan of Aineidai in Phrygia who claimed to be descended from the hero Aineias Aeneas later on the Romans claimed Aeneas as a founding figure too just as Beneventum claimed Diomedes Naples claimed the Sirens and Tusculum claimed Odysseus son Telegonos The myth had a huge impact on historical developments regardless of whether there was a real war or notFor more info youll probably find this part of our FAQ

TheHistoryGeek,Hello  First post here so Ill try to keep it simple and not go into too many details that might make my answer boring to read The Storming of Bastille or la prise de la Bastille in French is considered as the first big intervention that the Parisians did But just because the Storming of the Bastille occurred on the th of July it doesnt mean that thats the only reason that the th of July is considered as Frances Independence Day Since the summer of  and throughout the French provinces were created regional  federations  made of national guards a reaction to the weakening of the central power To control this spontaneous movement The Paris Commune the one during French Revolution under the leadership of Lafayette decided to establish a great national federation gathering representatives of local federations He decided  to meet in Paris on  July  The ceremony was supposed to celebrate the storming of the Bastille but also to bring a semblance of order and unity in a country in crisis On that day  federal troops arrived in Paris and therefore marched under the banner of their department from the Bastille to  Champ de MarsOn an esplanade for the occasion a large mass was celebrated after which the king Louis XVI swore to maintain  the Constitution decided by the National Assembly The  Parisians present that day cheering their sovereign the monarchy is not questionedThen and for nearly a century the commemoration of July  was abandoned It then reappeared in  under the Third Republic Since the regime desired to be more united and consolidated they wanted to build a new national imaginary around republican symbols and thus the Marseillaise became the official anthem and July  the French National DayBut the proposal emanating from the deputy for the Seine Benjamin RaspailhttpenwikipediaorgwikiBenjaminRaspail was not welcomed unanimously by the Assembly Some members called into question the fact that the  July  was a violent day and thus not a good day to represent the national holiday And so they finally made an agreement around the  July PS If youre interested in the subject you should read Jules MichelethttpenwikipediaorgwikiJulesMichelets work,2,cdnykx5,1rjlmg,askhistorians,new,18,16

TFYD,Historically Quebec remained more strictly religious and conservative than France for a longer time The French Revolution sought to dismantle the power of the Catholic Church in France and began the secularization of French society quite early on Atheism was much more vocal in France in the th century than many other Western countries Quebec because it has always been surrounded by English speaking Protestant cultures put more emphasis on preserving traditional conservative French culture particularly Catholicism Quebec also remained quite rural up through the early th century this is why so many French Canadians immigrated to New England during this time they could only live off the land in Quebec Although Quebec changed tremendously and became much more secularized in the s this change happened later than in France so I think one may find more traditionalism and conservatism in Quebec than in France,0,cdoon4i,1rjus1,askhistorians,new,1,1

outhere,I am not a historian but I am a philosopher of religion Here is what I learned from my studiesThe Torah and the books of the Old Testament Bible came from oral history There was not a single author but these books were composites of a variety of scripts fables and traditions dating back several hundred years BCE from a variety of sources  Scholars believe that King Solomon of Israel began compiling them around  BCE  Solomon also produced many original works that became part of the Torah and Old Testament It is likely that he employed scribes or historians to do this work as was a common practice among kingsThe New Testament began to come together in the late first century CE By this time the apostles of Jesus had scattered throughout the middle eastern region and established churches These churches were writing many texts and ascribing them to the various apostles It would not be until the first ecumenical council in  that these scripts were sorted and assembled with many rejected as false doctrine or forgeries It is unlikely that any of the apostles were the actual authors but rather the religious scholars of the various churches they establishedThe Quran was assembled in the th century Unlike the Bible the scripts used to produce the Quran came from a closenit group of followers of Mohamed and was not assembled until after Mohameds death The contents of the Quran comes from some written manuscripts written during Mohameds lifetime and some written after his death While there are parts that are attributed to specific authors it is more likely that these people were assigned the task of memorizing revelations dictated by Mohamed and reciting them to scribes Over time various religious scholars edited these recitations to produce a homogenous manuscript So there is very little if anything that we know about actual authorship of any of these holy books and none of these writings survived without considerable editing at the hands of very many people,1,cdo5z0p,1rjvwd,askhistorians,new,8,7
luckywood,Theres a theory about the authorship of the TorahPentateuch the first five books of the Old Testament which though I think its probably somewhat discredited these days is still interesting This is the Documentary Hypothesis which breaks down the books into four separate works by different authors which were later combined The details are quite complicated but to give you a massively massively simplified breakdown these authors areJ  the Yahwist writing c BCE so called because they typically refer to God as Yahweh or Jehovah hence J The J sections of the Bible typically refer to a highly anthropomorphic God the God who walks in the Garden of Eden or who shuts the door of the ark behind Noah Most of the Biblical stories we are familiar with such as the Garden of Eden Cain and Abel Noahs Ark the Tower of Babel and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah come from this section A simple simplistic way to think about it might be to consider these the mythological sections of the Bible E  the Elohist writing c BCE so called because they typically refer to God as Elohim Elohim is a generic name for deity while Yahweh is the specific name of the Hebrew God The Elohist sections are still narrativefocused but God is typically a more detached presence speaking through prophets messengers dreams visions and voices rather than through direct interaction with the charactersD  the Deuteronomist writing c BCE who unsurprisingly is responsible for the book of Deuteronomy This authors main focus is to demonstrate that the contemporary sufferings of the Jews during the Babylonian exile were the result of the failure to observe the Hebrew laws So Deuteronomy focuses on religious law and the terrible consequences of failing to observe it P  for Priestly author writing around c BCE This author is responsible for most of the Genealogies X begat Y begat Z begat etc Leviticus and the Creation myth as opposed to the Garden of Eden story P is mainly interested in ritual and laws That author breakdown was as far as I know the first real alternative to the Moses wrote everything theory Its a theory based entirely on analysis of the text itself rather than any archeological evidence and its been increasingly challenged since the s One of the other posters here can probably provide more information on whats the current understanding of the authorship of the BibleSource My knowledge of this comes from The Book of J by David Rosenberg and Harold Bloom cue sharp intake of breath by proper historians Its a fantastic book  theres an English translation of those sections of the Bible attributed to J by David Rosenberg and a long fascinating but kind of mad introduction by Bloom Bloom argues a that the religious associations around the TorahBible have stopped us from seeing that the Book of J is a superlative work of world literature that deserves to sit alongside the Iliad and the Complete Works of Shakespeare and b that J was a woman based largely on the fact that she writes really good female characters I wouldnt be sure how much weight to give to that particular idea since it seems to be based on little more than a hunch But he provides a pretty clear overview of the whole Documentary Hypothesis and makes a really strong case for considering the Book of J a remarkable selfcontained literary work whoever actually wrote it,0,cdo9ak3,1rjvwd,askhistorians,new,4,4
crb,For both the Torah and the New Testament there is in most cases considerable scholarly debate on the question of who wrote each individual book when it was written and whether it was written in its current form or subsequently edited A decent scholarly commentary on any book will give a summary of views which are usually based on a combination of clues in the text what the intended audience of the book seems to have been writing style and often just speculation Some of the more interesting cases   these happen to be books I looked at in my theology MA  include  Corinthians and Isaiah  Corinthians is generally reckoned to be written by Paul but many argue that what we have now is a composite of two or perhaps more letters given a radical shift of topic between chapters  and Isaiah is in three distinct sections the first  apparently speaking to the situation at the time when the prophet Isaiah described in the text was alive the second  to the time of the exile about a century later and the third  to a period probably not long after the return to Israel Most except a conversative minority only want to attribute most of the first section to Isaiah himself with the other sections being added later and the whole being edited to make it a little more coherent but vast amounts has been written on what was edited together whenIve replied in addition in a couple of places below   ,0,cdo9hnu,1rjvwd,askhistorians,new,2,2

dmar,I think youve been had Unless the Soviets developed a completely different physical model for computation that does not require transistorswhich I doubt there is absolutely no they made microprocessors with sugar instead of silicon The key property of silicon and other semiconductors that allows them to be used for computation is that they their constructiveness is between complete conductance metals and non conductance nonmetals Their conductances are variable and can be adjusted using a variety of methods including ion implantation and the application of a voltage Sugar does not have this property and could never be used to construct transistors I could talk forever on how semiconductors work but lets skip ahead to the historical evidenceFor the historical question the evidence supports that the soviets never got very far on their own in microchip production without borrowing the innovations that were developed in the West by Intel Texas Instruments and others Here is an excerpt from the summary of a CIA reporthttpwwwfoiaciagovsitesdefaultfilesdocumentconversionsDOCpdf entitled Soviet Block Computing Direct Descendants of Western Technology that was published as the result of a FOIA requestThe Soviet Union and Eastern Europe lag the West in all aspects of general purpose digital computer technology ranging from at least five years for microcomputers The progress that has been achieved is in large part a result of acquiring Western technology ranging from microelectronic and printed circuit board production technology to use of Wester computers for reverseengineeringEdit I also want to add that sugar as a raw material is far more expensive than silicon The raw material cost in the production of semiconductors is completely negligible  the real cost of production is the precise and complex fabrication process as well as the significant design costs in developing a microprocessor,0,cdo7m3e,1rjztn,askhistorians,new,1,1

Astrogator,gtSome of the accepted history about Spartan society strikes me as so strange that it comes off as exaggeration or outright invention and none of the authors were actually SpartansThat right here is the answer to your question already The extreme claims made about their society are reflections of what we and the Spartans themselves as well as their contemporaries wanted to see in Sparta not of reality Let me cite a poemgtO maidens of honey voice so loud and clear my limbs can carry me no more Would O would God I were but a ceryl such as flies fearless of heart with the halcyons over the bloom of the wave the Springs own bird that is purple as the seaThis is Alkman Fragment  one of Spartas most prominent sons theres debate about his origins and one of the nine great poets of antiquity He writes quite a lot about pretty girls song festivals and dance Does this sound like something out of a society focused completely upon the military Spartans liked to live a good life too When boiotian troops entered Lakonia in  they made rich plunder in the houses of the Spartans Festivals like the famous Hyakinthia or the Karneia where girlanded youths sang and danced in choirs and lavish meals are also part of Spartan cultureAlkman is writing in the th century just like his more militarily minded colleague Tyrtaios It has been argued that Spartan culture declined after that time following the conquest of Messenia as they focused more on the military aspect but theres material evidence to the contrary Spartans continued to paint and sell vases as far as Gaul hold feasts erect statues and so on not to mention that quite a few of them became ultrarich gtThe idea is that they trained from early childhood to be the biggest badasses possible and thanks to the helot system they were free to focus entirely on warfare Essentially  military focused with incredibly extreme training and honor culture Yet if you look at their military history its a pretty mixed bagIve written a bit about the agoge and its origins herehttpwwwredditcomrAskHistorianscommentsqfzbwhatwasthesignificanceoftheagogewithincdchld the short version is that the agoge as it is idealized in modern popular culture is an invention of hellenic Sparta thrd century long after their prime to construct a tradition Public education was part of all Greek poleis and even if Sparta was a bit more focused on austerity and military it was not exceptionally so The big advantage was their klaroisystem giving them more time to concentrate on military training  or other aristocratic matters  while the helots worked the landConcerning their military effectiveness for a few decades they really were the supreme military force on land in all of Hellas But as another commenter has already pointed out military training only gets you so far For one thing Sparta was never more than a collection of four later five villages and had never more than probably around  full citizens Spartiates They subdued the whole laconic plain down to the sea and then Messenia which is a pretty strong feat if you look at the size of the other contemporary Greek polities But in terms of their ability to deal with losses Sparta was like the antithesis to Rome They could never replenish any serious losses After the big earthquake the Peloponnesian War and the disaster at Leuktra there simply was no large citizen base anymore Upwards social mobility such that losses in the body of citizens could have been replenished was practically nil The defeat at Hysieia like most of the battles of those times is shrouded in mist and probably apocryphal to give a mythical legacy to their constant conflict with the Argives Same goes for the battle of the promachoi that  vs  episode Then theres their spectacular successes Lysander is a name that is in ancient and modern perception one of the greatest strategists of all times his popularity has sunken with the loss of importance of classics in popular culture but in the thearly th century youd have heard that name uttered in the same breath as Alexander Caesar Scipio and Hannibal His victory at Aigospotamoi was pretty amazing in itself Then of course you have the strategical and tactical defeat at the Thermopylae that was turned turned into what is probably the biggest propaganda victory in the history of history Concerning their honor culture deceit and trickery was as much part of Spartan strategy as anything else Lysander purportedly had this to say on the matter of deceit gt In answer to those who blamed him because his carrying out most of his designs through deception which they said was unworthy of Heracles and gaining his successes by wile in no straightforward way he said laughing that where he could not get on with the lions skin it must be pieced out with the skin of the foxKing Kleomenes tricked Argive warriors that had taken refuge in a grove by calling them out one by one telling them that their ransom had been paid Then he had them killed When they got wise to that and refused to come out he simply burned the whole grove So much for honour Tactical retreats were perfectly OK too and Leonidas didnt remain at the Thermopylae because it was proscribed by some Spartan honour code or any law True their increased focus on military training gave them an advantage But that system was only implemented after the th century and it was only an advantage in one field Theres more to warfare than training ,5,cdo4lpv,1rk42q,askhistorians,new,52,47

TFYD,For the best answer to this question see Alexis de Tocquevilles The Old Regime and the Revolution the classic history of the French Revolution Tocqueville emphasizes the consistent and gradual decline of the old feudal order in the centuries leading up the French Revolution As the clergy opened up its ranks nobility became increasingly less reserved to old military families and the bourgeoisie gained power the ancient feudal structure was slowly weakened French society became less hierarchical and socially immobileIn the th century Enlightenment thinkers reflected this trend and expounded it in their political and philosophical writings So yes I believe that the intellectual ideas of the Enlightenment played a large role on the French Revolution but I think these ideas had deep roots in the history of France before the revolution They were best articulated by philosophers but they were already acting upon French society albeit unknowingly even before the revolution ,0,cdop073,1rk4fz,askhistorians,new,1,1

Killfile,Since weve strayed into how the US system works too I thought this insight from Hacking Nuclear Command and ControlhttpicnndorgDocumentsJasonFritzHackingNCpdf a research paper done for the International Commission on Nuclear Non Proliferation and Disarmament would be helpfulgtThe US uses the twoman rule to achieve a higher level of security in nuclear affairs Under this rule two authorized personnel must be present and in agreement during critical stages of nuclear command and control The President must jointly issue a launch order with the Secretary of DefenseIf you want something thatll really keep you up at night consider this from the same paper though evidence of Perimetr aka Dead Hand is spotty contradictory and largely based upon admissions by former highranking Soviet officials  gtAdditionally the alleged Soviet system known as Perimetr was designed to automatically launch nuclear weapons if it was unable to establish communications with Soviet leadership This was intended as a retaliatory response in the event that nuclear weapons had decapitated Soviet leadership however it did not account for the possibility of cyber terrorists blocking communications through computer network operations in an attempt to engage the systemPerimetr allegedly became operational in the shttpwwwgwuedunsarchivnukevaultebbdocIchpdf but essentially amounted to a dead mans switch for nuclear launch  The Soviet command structure would activate Dead Hand as tensions mounted and then Dead Hand would require constant affirmative orders from the command structure in order to prevent launchIts difficult to find much information on the exact procedures the Soviet Union used for launch control and it becomes more difficult the further back into the Cold War we go  Partially thats because of institutional Soviet secrecy and partially its because there were fewer and fewer physical and electronic safeguards in place  Launch authority doesnt mean much when possession of the weapon constitutes the only barrier to setting it offWe know a good bit more about the late Soviet and early postSoviet command and control structure  Here from a document from the Federation of Atomic Scientistshttpwwwfasorgsppstarwarscrshtm is a description of how launch control worked roundabouts   Note that given the complexity of revising such a system we can probably safely assume that it worked this way prior to  though the names of the offices involved were differentgtAccording to American and Russian sources the command and control system for all strategic and tactical nuclear weapons is centered in Moscow this central command authority would have to authorize the use of any of those weapons The release and dissemination of nuclear weapons authorization and enabling codes begins at the top of the political and military establishments in Russia The President of Russia and the Minister of Defense would independently generate and transmit a special code which would be combined with a third code provided by the Chief of the Russian General Staff This combined code would then be transmitted to the forces in the field where it apparently would become part of the enabling codes needed to arm and launch the weapons,0,cdo6pmq,1rk8cb,askhistorians,new,4,4
hughk,In early days there were not so many nukes so control was fairly lax Some kind of lock was fitted to prevent unauthorised arming of the weapon This is general across all the older nuclear powers After some thought it was realised that these weapons remained quite vulnerable so both the US and the Soviets thought about technology to prevent unauthorised launchThe technology was known as a Permissive Action LinkhttpwwwstanfordeduclasseeAbstractsslidesbellovinpdf Wikipedia gives more of an overview herehttpenwikipediaorgwikiPermissiveActionLink It is essentially just a locking system that requires multiple actors to authorise a launch and will prevent unauthorised launch to the point of deadlocking when multiple incorrect access attempts are madeWe have some kind of view from just before the end of the USSR when the systems were probably at their most sophisticated and had been running since This is an excerpt from the book The Soviet Nuclear Weapon Legacy by Marco De Andreis published by Oxford University Press  on page gtThe seperate codes sent by the president and defense minister travelled over a dedicated communications channel that validated and combined them and passed them to another device that integrated the code input of the Chief of the General Staff Then the composite code would be sent to the Commanders in Chief of the forces dedicated to launchSo three persons at the top Note that shortly after the  coup attempt apparently one person temporarily had all three codes The commanders in chief would then be responsible for releasing the enabling keys that allowed the weapons to be armed as well as the authorisation for a launchNote that full permissionauthorisation information was further delegated but I dont actually know how For example on British and US submarines they have the ability to launch a nuclear attack without authorisation in case highcommand is destroyed This is where the launch authority is split between multiple officersInterestingly a pair of Soviet launch keyshttppawnstarsthegamewikiacomwikiSovietLaunchKey were sold on eBay They are supposedly authenticated Although they look simple other pictures suggest dimples in the main cylinder to engage the pins As there are two it suggests a two man launch system where each key has to be inserted and turned within a certain time by two seperate persons As the keys are together it is probable that they were kept in a safe similar to that used in a minuteman silo However this is speculation The same book I mentioned earlier mentions that in later Soviet times there was a twelve digit key involved and enabling and launch authorisation were separated,0,cdo6wgx,1rk8cb,askhistorians,new,2,2

blatherskiter,Rapes in war happen rapes in peacetime happen So to call rape as a routine weapon of war means that rape is ignored to where it is encouraged That rules out Vietnam though rapes certainly happened there Rapes were covered up at the small unit level Ones that were revealed were severely punished    Generally speaking the  and the end of the Thirty Years and Eighty Years Wars marked a shift in Western European culture Before it was generally acknowledged that conquering soldiers in certain situations could rape locals This is mostly seen when an attacker sacks a city after a siege A few days of looting pillaging and raping was used to  reward soldiers  warn next cities to not resist But the wars got so out of hand and armies so ruthless that it shifted the culture Though soldiers continued to rape after  a uniform in war was no longer a license to do so,3,cdoi3vg,1rkts6,askhistorians,new,6,3

jamez,Not at all This is kind of hard to provide an answer for because there are so many different examples of colonialism ending but as a rule Britain never wanted to lose its colonies per se and it was only political and economic pressure that caused them to be given up    I was taught by Richard ReidhttpbooksgooglecoukbooksaboutAHistoryofModernAfricahtmlidUSRQtYwasUCampredirescy and he claimed that in Africa colonies had simply failed to become profitable enough and were never really that profitable Where there was money to be made every attempt was made to hang on to the colony and if the British position became untenable it was generally ensured that the next leader would be reliant on British support or at least have British sympathies,0,cdob1q9,1rkwp9,askhistorians,new,4,4
mormengil,Britain may not have wanted to lose its colonies but it did not try very hard to keep them eitherOP is quite right to say that Britain gave many colonies more and more freedoms until they effectively had independenceCanada for example became a selfgoverning  Dominion in  not British Colombia or Prince Edward Island or Newfoundland which joined later    but did not really become a totally independent nation until  when the constitution was patriated to CanadaBetween  and  the six British colonies in Australia all became selfgoverning parts of the British Empire  In  the Commonwealth of Australia came into being with its own constitution but still some powers in the hands of the British  In  the Royal and Parliamentary titles Act in Britain moved from a unified crown for the British Empire to multiple crowns worn by a shared monarch  The Statute of Westminster Adoption Act in  reduced British power over Australia further  It was not however until the Australia Act of  that Australia became totally independent of the British ParliamentBritain did just give the colonies more and more freedom until they were totally independent  Britain did not try very hard to hold on to colonies  Partly Britain was increasingly proud of being a free and democratic country as opposed to almost all of Britains enemies from  onwards which were more totalitarian and Britain was not hypocritical enough to really think that democracy and freedom were good for Britain but not good for the Colonies  Not after the American Revolution at any rateOn the other hand Britain was never prepared to create one democratic free and representative government over the whole Empire  The British Parliament was perhaps too jealous of its own supreme role in governing Britain to ever suggest Imperial institutions which might govern over all the countries in the EmpireThe more Britain made a moral and ideological commitment to democracy the more it became obvious that the colonies had to move towards independence or the Empire had to build supernational democratic institutions of some kind The path chosen was to move the colonies towards independence perhaps WWII accelerated that movemore rapidly than Britain thought optimal but that trajectory seems to have been inevitable for some time previouslySources for dates and stages of Canadian and Australian independencehttpenwikipediaorgwikiConstitutionalhistoryofAustraliahttpwwwtheaustraliancomauopinionweonlybecameindependentofbritainonthisdayinstoryefrgzohttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofCanada,1,cdofqaa,1rkwp9,askhistorians,new,5,4

kwgoodlet,In  LitaRose Betcherman examined the various fascist movements in Canada during the s in a book called The Swastika and the Maple Leaf Fascist Movement in Canada in the Thirties Toronto Fitzhenry and Whiteside  Although she did not assess the experiences of GermanCanadians after  Betchermans study shed light on the development of ethnic German attitudes toward National Socialism and how events in interwar Europe had commensurable effects in Canada It also vindicated certain groups of Germans in Canada while imputing to others more hardline National Socialist principles In this way she effectively described the regional variations of GermanCanadian communities the degree of Canadianization among those communities as well as their ideas and beliefs which added valuable nuance to debates about predisposed German attitudes toward the impending warThere are a couple key sources that you can use to gauge the degree to which certain groups aligned themselves with national socialist ideas One is the Canada Gazette which includes the ordersincouncil from the s and s These documents often outline which groups associations or newspapers the Canadian government at the time perceived as a threat They also detail lists of aliens who were either repatriated or granted naturalization according to the Naturalization Act and these lists are broken down alphabetically A second source is the RCMP security bulletins These are published in volumes and are usually available at most Canadian university libraries Kealey Gregory S and Reginald Whitaker RCMP security bulletins  the Depression years In these sources surprisingly little attention was given to GermanCanadians and fascism compared to how much energy the RCMP directed towards communism particularly among Italian and eastern European communities and specifically those living in Toronto and Montreal In addition to these sources you could always go through certain Germanlanguage or Italianlanguage newspapers from Canada and assess the type of discourse that these papers published Keep in mind newspapers present another set of methodological problemsnot least is the issue of representativeness At any rate newspapers provide anecdotes about what at least some people thought about and felt during the periodIts worthwhile to mention that you should distinguish between how influential Canadian fascist groups were based on the knowledge possessed at the time versus how these movements have come to be remembered following the war The way we construct an understanding of Canadian fascist groups has changed considerably according to subsequent generations  ,0,cdochjp,1rl1qu,askhistorians,new,5,5

superadvancepet,The short answer is that it means there was a culture that allowed and supported it More art tends to emerge when there is leisure and a relatively permissiveliberal society and not so much when there is a subsistence or militarydominated society You might have more luck in rarthistory which is fairly active ,1,cdoedal,1rl2ok,askhistorians,new,4,3
farquier,I would qualify superadvancepets answer by saying that virtually all societies have had some kind of role for the visual arts Beyond that saying that art flourished in a period can mean one of two things The first and relatively boring and uncontroversial meaning is that it was a period with relatively substantial expenditure on artistic patronagefor example the first half of the reign of Tahmasp I of Persia the Northern Song Dynasty the Rome of Julius II and so onwe could multiply examples ad nauseam These are all periods where there was substantial money being spent on art and artists The more interesting meaning is retrospective when people say art flourished in X period they are often identifying a period with what they consider the best art and using it to define a specific set of visual canons Probably the most famous example of this to a western audience is Giorgio Vasari whose Lives of the Artists constructs a narrative of the improvement of Western art that connects Giotto to Michelangelo to demonstrate first that the arts reached their peak with Michelangelo and Raphael and equally crucially to turn around and use that peaking as an argument for why the norms of artmaking should be based on the style practiced by Michelangelo and Raphael which forms the basis of Vasaris variety of mannerism We can see a similar kind of work in a preface to an album of Persian painting by Dust Muhammed This account of painting after providing various historical examples of painting specifies that the painter Amhed Musa inagurated the style of painting current and then traces the history of painting from Amhed Musa to the painter Bihzad specifically to explain why those paintings attributed to Bihzad in the album should be regarded as the pinnacle of painting So describing a period of art as flourishing is not a neutral act it is rather an act of picking a period of artistic production as worth emulating,0,cdorcqv,1rl2ok,askhistorians,new,1,1

DonaldFDraper,The Continental System was created to starve Britain from vital trade income Napoleon thought that if he couldnt sink Britains navy hell sink Britains economySo the effect that it had on Europe was a terrible economic event Due to the restrictions in trade most of the countries in the system were experiencing an economic slump due to the loss of vital British trade So people whom traded lost income from the lack of trade What they would do instead is participate in the black market in order to get trade items from Britain It would affect urban populations rather than the rural populationsI cannot say much on internal pressure but there was Pressure from Britain for nations under the system to fight Napoleon or ignore it Notably one of the reasons for the invasion of Russia in  was due to the Russians flouting the system Britain involvement in Continental diplomacy at the time is due to the need to get rid of the Continental system as it was costing much in terms of tax and trade dollars for BritainOverall this is Napoleons biggest blunder The system alienated his conquered allies and kept them in an uneasy state due to a failing economy,0,cdobsnf,1rl3zo,askhistorians,new,1,1
Dominicanes,The sources I have read Thomas The Spanish Civil War and Beevors The Battle for Spain did not deal extensively with the mechanics of how the volunteers were recruited especially for the Germans Italians and Russians  The German response in particular supplying transport planes very early in the conflict which allowed the Nationalists to airlift troops from Africa over the heads of the Republican naval vessels blocking their path was very specific  I find it much less likely that this was a random outpouring of goodwill from Luftwaffe transport personnel and much more likely that it was as you describedI cannot address the later and more substantive in terms of equipment if not effect volunteers on any but a survey level  The opinion at the time and reinforced by Beevor and Thomas was that this was an obvious sham  The troops and aircrew were referred to as volunteers and this served everyones interest  The Germans and Italians got to support a fascist ally the depth of that alliance is very much in doubt and got to try out new equipment and tactics  Since the participants were volunteers the UK and France could look the other way and not have to go to war right now  Similarly the USSR didnt have to become officially embroiled in the conflictAs for the participants from France the UK the US Mexico and Ireland that all trickled into the Iberian peninsula it was much more on an ad hoc basis than was the aid from nations  This stands to reason given the lack of funding and organization available to them  The Irish Brigade a group of Irishmen who came to support the Nationalists apparently turned volunteers away  I havent yet read a history of that unit but the majority of their members arrived on a single ship  This speaks to a good deal of organization and finances though not on a scale of the Italians Germans or RussiansThere are a number of histories of individuals that served in the International Brigades  This has not been an area that I have spent much time studying so I cannot recommend any particular titles  They should be widely available though  I am sorry I was unable to answer you regarding the mechanics of volunteers during the conflict   I never much considered that aspect so perhaps I will have to reread Beevor and Thomas to get a better understanding  Feel free to ask followup questions and I will answer to the best of my ability,0,cdoggi7,1rl4qr,askhistorians,new,3,3
abt,Your point about recruiters in major cities is true for those volunteering for the Republican side most of them with anti fascism andor leftist ideals Recruitment agents were set up by Unions and leftist political parties Socialist Communists etc I recall several examples where these recruiters would also arrange transportation into Spain and the associated logisticsFor the Nationalist on the other hand it would be a different business On one hand Germany and Italy supplied regular army navy and air force units but I can only speculate to what degree the soldiers would volunteer presumably from the existing ranks for the units to head towards Spain For some reason I think army and air force would be easier to staff with volunteers than the navy where you do not call them and give them a destroyer a far more expensive and complex asset than a machine gun or even a plane of the era In the case of Italy you will find the so called Black shirts or Mussolinis paramilitary organization clear candidates for volunteering see CTV for their brief history httpenwikipediaorgwikiCorpoTruppeVolontarie  remember that despite the term voluntary it has a lot to do with politics and terminology not being necessarily true Germany would be a different thing too the so called Condor Legion was effectively used to test Germanys military machinery and some of its doctrine a small scale but their history is well documented and many books are availableFinally to have grasp of the recruiting and war experience you can follow this fellows tribulations a good readhttpwwwamazoncomComradesTalesBrigadistaSpanishCivildp,0,cdpk57w,1rl4qr,askhistorians,new,2,2

Macktheknife,The most common and direct method was by simple handwritten or spoken orders from a commander Signalflags are useful for short messages or signals but direct orders were generally more useful A fast dispatch ship might be sent out from HQ to deliver orders or relay them between fleets or home ports In addition to signal flags cannon shot was also used as a primitive code Because of the uncertainty of encountering a ship alone on the high seas and the fact that a captured ship was very often taken into the service of the navy that captured it it was often difficult to discern nationality at a distance For example two British ships approaching each other might display a series of flags as a signal to show their nationality with a certain amount of cannons fired to windward or leeward Friendliness established they would then draw closer in order to discuss the particulars of the message,0,cdoedrl,1rl6tx,askhistorians,new,1,1
Dominicanes,One thing to keep in mind is that the Spanish Civil War was incredibly chaotic  The fate of a particular town or city could be decided in mere minutes  Whomever could muster the most firearms in the least amount of time would end up in control  This was often an army unit but was also commonly a militia or even a mob  The Nationalists ended up with a bit more than half of the army under their command but these men did not make up the bulk of the fighters on either side  Most were completely inexperienced themselvesBasically anyone that could carry a rifle was shoved into the front lines  Inexperience was the rule not the exception  In fact at first many men were unwilling to take cover or dig trenches as it was seen as unmanly  Once the obvious folly of such practices was exposed to modern rifles such reluctance melted away  The fact that this was commonplace should tell you just how green such fighters were  Also the practice of getting rifles into the hands of combatants was often haphazard  It wasnt often the orderly distribution of identical rifles from a magazine  Instead rifles of all makes and models were handed out along with shotguns and pistols of all kinds  Just sorting the ammunition into usable groups was a novel and trying experience  Especially early in the conflict arming your own side was extremely problematic  This isnt even to mention the new headaches of supplying the other logistics required of these newly created army units  Water food medical services transport etcSo while it did take some time for foreign volunteers to arrive and there was some of the standard harassment of the new arrivals these artists and intellectuals and thugs and criminals were only marginally less experienced than most of the other troops around them  And they like the local fighters learned at the front  Especially for the Republicans they provided needed manpower in a bitterly contested war,0,cdogy9c,1rl7wk,askhistorians,new,31,31

jamez,Turks as an ethnic group have existed in central asia since pretty much forever since humans spread there I suppose As you can imagine they were pretty disparate and nomads so hard to get a historic handle on You might be best off looking at anthropological sources to look at their origins  The Mongols were the tribe that united all the other Turkic tribes under Chinggis Genghis Khan Chinggis is the Persian pronunciation used in a lot of sources as opposed to the anglicanised version Genghis    So a lot of people use The Mongol Invasions as shorthand for the long chain of military conquests begun by Chinggis Khan But by the time they get very far there are very few actual Mongols in the army Those who were invaded were often enlisted into the army and the force grew exponentially So its while Chinggis was in charge its probably best to call them The Chinggisid invasions    But even then Chinggis died before all the invading was complete So youd also want to name them after their specific leaders like the Hulaguid invasions in China Some experts still just refer to everything as Mongol simply to delineate them from the Seljuks even though its not technically correct so do as you please     The Tatars were a Turkic group that established itself properly around the river Volga after the Mongol invasions being a mix of original Turkic Volga Bulgars and invading Kipchak turks They developed a distinct culture then spread out again across central Asia taking their culture with them So they were a tribe that developed a distinct ethnocultural but still Turkic identity  Source George Lane lecturer SOAS University of London,0,cdoifjz,1rl8dk,askhistorians,new,3,3

Spoonfeedme,Although it is flawed in many ways I highly recommend Iris Changs book on the subjecthttpenwikipediaorgwikiTheRapeofNankingbookIn general most soldiers reported just going along with what was happening The sheer scale of the slaughter does not appear to have been something actively directed by the Japanese command but it was certainly not discouraged Changs interviews with former soldiers suggest they simply dont understand why or even how they could have done such things It was not only enlisted men who were partaking and lower officers certainly participated and even encouraged the slaughter The Kwantung Army at this point was pretty much operating independently of direction from the Home Islands I dont know of any evidence that suggests the slaughter itself was ordered by anyone in the command structure of either the Kwangtung Army or the Japanese High Command in TokyoThe Rape itself is really a culmination of the policies that Army had in place in dealing with the Chinese They became more brutal as the war wore on and as war commonly does the men themselves became more and more desensitized to violence I think you can find comparables in the slaughters that occured in Berlin by the Red Army The senior officers turned a blind eye while the lower level officers would have actively participated and the enlisted men had no control over themselves Being told your enemy is inhuman for years tends to let stuff like this happen sadlyEDIT One thing Id like to remind people who might criticize Changs book is that she killed herself over what she found This event is really one of the worst things to happen in recorded history in my opinion and I forgive her for some of the hyperbole and poor academic quality of parts of the book given how disturbing it was,7,cdogn5x,1rlbx6,askhistorians,new,25,18

AsiaExpert,The Rape of Nanking is the historians equivalent of a potential nuclear meltdown in a shoddy home made reactor Even going near the topic or mentioning it in passing is dangerous territory The topic is also a magnet for controversy and heated emotions I usually avoid it because I usually get no where with it Ive even had my objectivity called into question because of my own ethnicity so its kind of telling how hard it is to let cooler heads rule with thisOn to the main topic The question of whether or not the Rape of Nanking was an operation that was carried out as orders from higher command echelons andor possibly directly derivative of an overall policy that the Japanese Imperial military had put into place has nominally two general sides The prosystem side and the notsystem side I will go through both sides and follow up First the common points Both sides agree that there was much violent excess against military and civilian victims in the taking and subsequent mopping up of Nanking Even Nanking Massacre deniers agree that this took place as a side note denier has a connotation of refuting that the events ever took place at all which is a misconception Both sides roughly agree that the definition of policy they are using in the context of this argument is an official widely circulated article that states clearly the order to kill andor attack with deadly intent or at least the strong encouragement to do so Finally possibly the most important point is that both sides cite the exact same documents consequence of there being so few surviving known records and documents relating to the event This means they are drawing completely opposite conclusions from the same documents Above all else this is a sign that we need to approach the discussion carefully The prosystem side generally asserts that there was indeed a policy that was put in place where Chinese soldiers who were taken prisoner were either not to be considered legal prisoners of war and consequently following this line of thought they could take actions as though under the pressures of combat or more sinister there was an outright order to kill punish maim or otherwise attack any and all Chinese soldiers whether or not they surrendered or had been taken prisoner The individuals they hold responsible for this are usually Prince Asaka who was nominally the commander of the forces that were charged with taking Nanking The claims are generally that Prince Asaka either sent along or created himself the orders to kill Chinese prisoners andor a general policy where killing Chinese prisoners was encouraged Others believe General Matsui Prince Asakas nominal commanding officer is responsible Others still believe Prince Kotohito Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army at the time to be responsible for the original orders As a secondary some also believe that these orders were not only limited to soldiers but were worded to directly order andor encourage IJA soldiers to intentionally include civilians in the kill order A minority also suggest there were also orders or policies where rape within Nanking was also encouraged The notsystem side generally asserts instead that there was no official policy that was enacted That is to say there was no over reaching policy that was promulgated through official and proper military channels from Japan to the armies in the field namely the Central China Army Group of the Imperial Japanese expeditionary forces nor were there any orders that originated with the Army high command while in the field This side suggests instead that the socalled orders were either fabricated at low levels then subsequently spread sporadically through hearsay then made real by the actions of men on the ground or completely nonexistent Furthermore the notsystem side asserts strongly that there were no such orders that related to the intentional killing and rape of civilians whatsoever The main assertion of this group is that higher ups never issued any orders to illegally kill Chinese prisoners to kill Chinese civilians nor to round up and rape Chinese women and that the events that occurred at Nanking was the Army falling out of control not following orders This group believes that while no orders were issued Prince Asaka and General Matsui are highly responsible for what happened at Nanking While it is strongly asserted that Prince Asaka never issued any orders he also did not work towards curtailing the violence in Nanking at all They also assert that Matsui was culpable because while he was not in the field at the time he had the knowledge of what was going on and the power to stop it Final Conclusions on my partI am personally of the notsystem group Often there is talks of orders and missives that declared executions of POWs to not be illegal sometimes allegedly condoned by military general staff other times condoned by Emperor Showa Hirohito himself I have personally not seen any of these documents and if there were any copies lying around I would be very interested in examining them myself but too often these claims are unsubstantiated Secret orders is too little to go on and it seems to me that there was no such policy There are also no documents that point to Prince Asaka Matsui Prince Kotohiko or the Emperor himself issuing any orders to the effect of executing prisoners though there is a question of responsibility that I will not be arguing here In the historian community it is generally agreed that the stress and rigors of the brutal campaign in China resulted in many soldiers pouring out their resentment against the occupants of Nanking Its entirely possible that lower echelon officers and staff ordered their men to kill civilians and prisoners then the rumors subsequently spreading sporadically that there was an order to kill a lie made realThe singular thing that everyone can agree on is that the events in Nanking were chaotic There was no effective authority not enough policing ineffective communication and continuous skirmishing between remnant military forces and partisans with civilians caught in the middle with no safe haven This was a recipe for disaster Its also important to understand that the narrative of the Nanking Massacre has grown to massive proportions over the years Too often its portrayed as the Japanese being singularly blood thirsty The name of the event itself is politically and emotionally charged as it is meant to beChinese partisan forces were a large part of the war against Japan and many civilians would fight as guerillas which means they were technically illegal combatants Other soldiers would fight in plain clothes and mixed in among the civilians another illegal act in war There was also fighting between Chinese themselves sometimes atrocities being committed against Japanese collaborators And while there were civilian casualties that were intentional some were definitely not and were a consequence of the difficulty of the modern war Japan was fighting something that can be appreciated in a contemporary time of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan There were also records and witnesses of Japanese soldiers who were altruistic and sympathetic Not every Japanese soldier partook in the excesses of the Nanking Massacre just like how not every German soldier was a rapist in Stalingrad The rigidity of the Japanese command structure as well as the propensity of Japanese officers to be extremely liberal in their application of corporal punishment means that acts of kindness would not be very likely if any such kill order was given Executions for disobeying orders in the Japanese military or any military during the time in fact was not uncommon In conclusion here are some scholarly articles andor academic works on the subject for further reading As a tertiary note Iris Changs book The Rape of Nanking is generally not considered a reliable source though very well read it is As an alternative I suggest Honda Katsuichis work listed below which has its own problems but a much more reliable investigative work As a STRONG DISCLAIMER this topic is INCREDIBLY charged and requires the utmost

paradoxplaza,Well it may have to do with the fact that the colonial rulers of South America were Catholic vs the Protestantism that characterized British rule of North America and India More to this point the Phillipines which is firmly in Asia is staunchly Catholic to this day and that is because it was ruled by the Spanish before the war agaisnt USACatholic orders like the Jesuits and Franciscans made aggressive conversion campaigns in SA and one of their main objectives was exactly that Not to mention the fact that Spanish administrators also took their part in breaking up their old belief systems many Catholic churches in Mexico are built directly above Mayan or Aztec templesAlso populationwise a large porcentage of the native South American population was wiped out by the Old World diseases and the hard conditions of labour imposed by the Europeans As these populations dwindled they would be more vulnerable to conversion attemptsEDIT I did a little bit of more research and although it is not definitive proof compare these two images CatholicshttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonseDistributionofCatholicspng ChristianshttpuploadwikimediaorgwikipediacommonsChristiandistributionpng  In the colonies South and Central America Africa and Asia most of the Christians that are in those place are Catholic ie Protestants were not as effective or willing as Catholics at converting the local populations,4,cdok2cz,1rlfca,askhistorians,new,17,13
Qhapaqocha,Okay to give you a quick TLDR right off the bat Id argue that youre massively underselling and simplifying what happened to both the eradication of the Inca state religion when the Spanish showed up and the conversion of the natives to ChristianityOne of the Spanish motives for conquering the New World  and much of their moral support for the endeavor  came from the papal dispensation that allowed Spain to conquer so long as the natives were brought into the fold of Christianity as they had souls and could thus join Team Jesus yes the notion of New World civilians having souls was a topic of debate and discussion In practice this was often exerted rather forcefully  for instance conquistadors presented groups they met with the Requirement which basically boils down to Join Christianity or we have casus belli against you As was somewhat famously recounted in several chroniclers accounts Atahualpa victorious Inca of a brutal fraternal civil war was presented with a Bible and told of Christianity Asking the man who is considered by his people to be an aspect of the Sun to up and change teams is presumptuous wouldnt you say It is said he threw the Bible on the ground and the conquistadors promptly sprung into action Always a fun story the capture of Atahualpa  ask me again sometime and Ill expand on itAnother way the Spanish usurped Inca state religion was through the extirpation of idolatry Keeping worshipping secreting or otherwise maintaining idols and shrines was a severe offense and these objects and places were vigorously sought out and destroyed The white rock YurakRumi outside Vitcos a holdout of the independent Inca state after the Rebellions was one such huaca or sacred placeobject The shrine of Chuquipalta containing it was burned to the ground  the rock is still present and Brian Bauer found evidence of the burning in excavations there At every point the Inca pantheons or their local analogues maintained by the people of Andean civilization were replaced with saints and ceremonies respecting themThe result however is a Christian religion completely unlike any other in the world and markedly different from the Roman Catholicism initially presented to the people of the Andes For example the thunder and storms here in the Cuzco Valley of Peru is called San Pedro What does Saint Peter have to do with lightning Well Inti the Sun had an aspect known as Illapa the Thunder Inti got replaced more or less with the Christ figure and Saint Peter took the place of Illapa in the pantheonAnother example theres a painting of a virgin at one of the sites Ive worked at here This virgencita garners pilgrims from the towns in the valley and occasionally the surrounding areas  folks from the city of Cuzco occasionally even visit The virgencita basically replaced the huaca of Andean society  a deeplyseated cosmological concept of sacred space and spirit that inhabits the earth water and sky of our world The Virgin is responsible for good or bad weather in the valley  if you fall into sickness it may be because you hadnt respected the Virgin or given her a pago offering of late This mentality survived from well before the Inca so far as it can be discerned straight into the present day  save for a different nameI cant speak for how Asian cultures resisted Christian advances but for Andeans adaptation is a much more proper term than conversion,0,cdoosil,1rlfca,askhistorians,new,12,12

bitparity,Well its politicalIt depends entirely on what you consider the most important aspects of the Roman Empire to be  Is it hegemony  Is it political continuity  Is it urban continuity  Religious continuity  Cultural inheritance  Language  Religion  Is it selfidentificationBasically all of these questions are a subset of the question what should be the primary legitimizing agent for a polity to considered as the Roman Empire  The answer to that question conveniently also decides on your choice of end date for the end of the Roman Empire  Why   In a nutshell political convention  Especially with Gibbons history people like the symmetry of the founder and the final occupant of the imperial throne in Italy being both named Romulus never mind Julian Nepos who was still around til   In much the same way people like the symmetry of the founder and final imperial occupant of the Byzantine Empire to both be named Constantine never mind David Komnenos of Trebizond who was still around until   Either way  has been in the popular imagination so long that its a convenient marker flawed or notThat of course doesnt preclude arguments for alternative end dates but like so many things in the social sciences few positions can be argued as definitively right or wrong just widely considered at the timeIf your primary consideration is translatio imperii you can consider  End of the Ottoman Sultanate who were also Caesars of Rome via descent from Alexios Komnenos  End of Third Rome Imperial Russia or  end of the Holy Roman EmpireIf its selfidentification you can make a case for  with the demise of the Byzantine Empire  If its bureaucratic structural continuity you can make a case for  with the sack of Constantinople  If its classical urbanization and culture you could go with your aforementioned Heraclius   If its language then Justinians If its classical continuity within the city of Rome itself you can make a case for either   or  which were the three most devastating sacks of late Roman history but the Gothic War sack dealing the most permanent damage to the cityIf you make a case for religious identity well technically the Roman Empire as the universal christian empire is still around with the Roman Catholic ChurchSo in a nutshell yes it is a Gibbon hangover  The choices in end date for the end of the Roman empire will be as many as the politics  But by convenience and force of habit  has stuck around  Its as good a date as any of the othesr Ive argued okay maybe they arent all equal but at least  is a nice place holder from which to start,1,cdogqoj,1rlgas,askhistorians,new,6,5

Reedstilt,In the autumn of  a massive influenza epidemic swept through Wendake the land of the Wendat Hurons It began on the southeast periphery of the nation and swept northwest toward Ossossane the capital on the southern shore of Georgian Bay French Jesuit priests and the Wendats own arendiwane became quite competitive in response to this epidemic each trying use their medicinal prowess to emphasize the validity of their religion and each trying to discredit the other  There are some examples of cooperation such as when the arendiwane Tonneraouanont somewhat reluctantly instructed the Jesuits in the use of two medicinal roots now unidentifiedIn this religious battle the Jesuits had few victories They were accused of preying upon the ill and dying for quick conversions quite accurately as Francois le Mercier admits I will even add that some little innocents were baptized in their last moments unknown to or against the wishes of their parents under the pretext of wishing to give them some of these sweets Additionally when the town of Oenrio asked the Jesuits to bring their god to their town in hopes that it would help them in this calamity the Jesuits made a long list of demands forbidding many aspects of their traditional culture Oenrio had at least two garihoua the French refer to this rank as captains in English it would be sachem or chief who rejected the Jesuits proposal Onaconchiaronk said We have been greatly deceived We thought God was to be satisfied with a chapel but I see he demands much more Aenons gave a longer reply but the key point is this I consider that what you propose will only prove to be a stumbling block Besides we have our own ways of doing things and you have yours and all other nations have their own ways When you speak to us about obeying and acknowledging as our master him whom you say made heaven and earth I believe you are talking of overthrowing the countryMeanwhile several arendiwane led by Tehorenhaegnon converged on Ossossane and performed the various means of traditional healing In addition to prescribing concoctions made from medicinal plants there were religious and social services At the first of these religious services a garihoua announced Come now see us here assembled Listen you demons whom Tehorenhaegnon invokes behold us about to make a feast and have a dance in your honor Come let the contagion cease and leave this town If you still have a desire to eat human flesh repair to the country of our enemies We now associate ourselves with you to carry the sickness to them and to ruin themIts important to note here that the word demon comes from the Le Merciers writing and was part of a very literal attempt by the Jesuits to demonize everything about the Wendat religion The arendiwane themselves are often called demons In this context the garihoua was likely referring to the oki a generic term for spiritual and nonhuman entities equivalent to the Algonquian manitou The garihouas invocation does indicate that at this time influenza was being incorporated into the okis arsenal of diseases which could be unleashed to display their displeasureTehorenhaegnon and his subordinates enjoyed considerable success initially and soon he promoted some of the lesser arendiwane and empowered them to continue the care of those in Ossossane as he and some of the other most skilled arendiwane went out to the neighboring towns These newly elevated arenidwane were instructed to send word to Arendiwane after about a week to report on their progress This they did reporting half their patients had recovered Tehorenhaegnon dispatched Saossarinon his secondincommand back to Ossossane to help cure the remaining Unfortunately Saossarinon seems to have bungled this effort by requiring those who were still sick to come to a centralized place rather than going out to visiting them personally Saossarinons failure according to le Mercier caused the newly promoted arendiwane to renounce their officeThe disease continue through the winter during which time it appears the arendiwane had exhausted their usual remedies without further success Sondacouane replaced Saossarinon and discouraged the use of  French snow the sugar the Jesuits had been using as bribes for children Sondacouanes stated reason for this ban was that he believed it to a poison the French used to spread the disease while le Mercier believed the ban came because the Devil knows well enough how much these little sweets have already aided us in wrestling from his hands so many souls By the end of spring the Wendat were increasingly blaming the French for the disease More people died as the weather improved than they did during the bitter winter and those who had recently received baptism were frequently among the dead Additionally the Algonquins to the east renounced the belief that the disease had been caused by their native manitou but was instead caused by the French Occasionally a Frenchwoman identified as the sister of Etienne Brule was thought to breath the disease onto people in her attempt to avenge her brother who had died mysteriously among the Huron in  Others believe the Jesuit missionaries themselves were using their spiritual powers to spread the disease since as mentioned earlier they flocked to the ill and dying in hopes of winning converts Luckily for the Jesuits many of the garihoua valued their alliance with the French too much to believe this themselves As the disease waned in the summer tensions eased before as the garihoua feared someone acted violently upon that beliefHowever in  smallpox made its first appearance among the Wendat Some of the Wendat who lived near the Jesuit missions on the shores of Lake Ontario had gone to the French colony of Quebec and one had come back with the disease He died soon after returning home and as Jerome Lalemant wrote Within a few days almost everyone in the cabin of the deceased was infected and then the disease spread from house to house from town to town and eventually the entire countryBecause the unnamed Wendat Patient Zero lived close to the Jesuits the missionaries again were blamed for the disease They observed with some basis in reason Lalemant wrote that since our arrival in these lands those who were nearest to us happened to be those most ruined by the diseases and that the towns that welcomed us now appeared utterly exterminated In a word we were dreaded as the greatest sorcerers on earth Wherein truly it must be acknowledged that these poor people are in some sense excusable For it has happened very often and has been remarked more than a hundred times that where we were most welcome and baptized the greatest number of people was in fact where the greatest number died Conversely in the cabins to which we were denied entrance though they were sometimes extremely sick at the end of a few days one saw every person happily curedAt this point even the garihoua were starting to disapprove of the Jesuits presence Popular opinion was against the missionaries and even in the councils the garihoua were increasingly voting to put the missionaries to death and to renounce the alliance between Wendake and France  with only a few elders kindly obliging us with a verdict of banishment as Lalemant put it The Jesuits were permitted to remain in a few missions on the southern fringe of Wendake as a token of the continued alliance and as such they were later on the front lines of the Haudenosaunee conquest of Wendake ten years later,0,cdplvg6,1rlm4x,askhistorians,new,3,3

BeondTheGrave,The Russian Revolution has its roots in the various structural problems of the Russian Empire See the Tsars ruled as an absolute monarch they were the font of all political power After the French Revolution the idea of democracy and political freedom spread across Europe And the  revolutions across Europe further spread the idea of democracy across Europe However Russia took part in none of these developments Instead these ideas infiltrated Russia and the people of Russia But political change was slow in coming the Tsar only ended the practice of serfdom basically slavery in  By  the Russian political system had changed little since  But the Russian people who had been denied even the most fundamental reforms which had happened in the rest of Europe had become extremely radicalized So in  Russia went to war with Japan over control over Manchuria and northern Korea The Tsar committed the majority of the Russian Army to the Manchurian front where it was quickly defeated by the Japanese At home the Russian people felt that they had been pushed into war by the Tsar who then led them to defeat They seized the opportunity and launched a major strike in  which turned into bloody street battles between protesters and the army The Tsar quickly realized that the situation was spiraling out of control and that he did not have the army forces to suppress the revolution While the RussoJapanese war ended during the early days of the protests at the Treaty of Portsmouth thank you Teddy Roosevelt the Army was still largely in the East trying to navigate the inefficient TransSiberian Railroad So the Tsar was persuaded that he should accept the protesters demands and began to negotiate What came out was an elected body of representatives called the Duma This Duma was supposed to have some oversight over the running of the Russian government the passing of laws and things like that But it was hardly representative every adult male could vote but only the nobles had any real power their votes were weighted to have the most effect The votes of the Bourgeoisie were weighted less But the Peasant and workers classes votes were so diluted that they had very little electoral power over the Duma And during the process of these negotiations the Army returned from the East in large numbers They quickly suppressed continued protests like in Moscow around the Moscow Soviet Also the first of the Soviets were created during this period the Petersburg Soviet and ended any attempt to further extend the revolution But most Russians were happy with this situation as they got a parliament essentially and some kind of say in how Russia was to be run But importantly Tsar Nicholas II still maintained that he was the absolute autarch of Russia and that the Duma was merely an extension of his power In the United Kingdom for example the KingQueen has their powers but Parliament has its own powers which are derived from the natural sovereignty of the people Essentially Parliament represents all of the people in the UK andy by their will passes laws In Russia the Duma was an extension of Nicholas personal power it served him But Nicholas was not a huge fan of this settlement There are various debates as to what his political philosophy was Some authors like Richard Pipes argue that Nicholas really believed the oath he took during his coronation that he was promising God that he would preserve Russian autocracy Others like myself would argue that Nicholas like the status of being an absolute autarch and didnt want to throw that privilege away But why he did what he did isnt important for this post What is important is that Nicholas set himself to work following the  revolution destroying the independence and power of the Russian Duma By using secret provisions of the settlement of  I believe it was called the October Note Nicholas was able to disband the Duma at will call for new elections and then in the interim rule by decree So basically whenever the Duma began to challenge the Tsar he would disband it then postpone elections till he got his political agenda settled People quickly became disillusioned with the Duma which was essentially reduced to the status of a debate club and a very mild one at thatFlash forward to  The Duma had been defanged and the Tsar unilaterally supported his Serbian and French allies in attacking Germany But like in  the Russian army was severely handled by the Germans in every campaign except the Brusilov Offensive  neat stuff The Russians invented a new kind of tactics and made some modest gains against the Germans which is amazing considering every other battle seemed to range from a major setback to a catastrophic route The Germans then adapted these tactics into Hutier Tactics and proceeded to smash the French and British Now Tsar Nicholas was very upset with his Generals He wanted more control over the affairs of the army in an attempt to prevent more major disasters So he made himself the Supreme Commander of the Russian forces and moved to the city of Mogilev where he personally commanded the armies This was a terrible idea because it removed any buffer between the Tsar and direct military failure There was no longer anybody at the top of the army that the Tsar could point to and say It was his fault because he was that guy So as the Russian army continued to suffer major defeats it started to make the Tsar look incompetent or worse It is important to mention that even after all that had happened in  and despite all the privations of World War One the Russian people still looked up to the Tsar as a sort of father figure more like God as a father than my dad as a father So the common Russian generally assumed that the military defeats were somebody elses fault not the Tsars While this will continue into the Revolution the direct command of the Army severely weakened the Tsars image as the infallible father

mormengil,There is mythology  There is history  There is actual practice  All are different  As usual the mythology is the most interestingThe mythologyIn  the Pilgrims traveled from England to Plymouth Plantation to establish the nd English colony in North America aboard the good ship Mayflower  They were unable to practice their religion in England so they were coming to America in search of religious freedomThey didnt have much of a clue how to be pioneers or farmers or survive in a wilderness being urban types so many of the poor Pilgrims died in the first harsh New England Winter  Luckily they met a friendly Indian named Squanto who spoke English  He helped them make friends with the local Indians  They taught the Pilgrims to grow North American foods like corn and hunt North American game like Turkeys  As the second winter approached the Pilgrims collected their harvest and were content for they had a mighty surplus of provisions  So they had a great feast of Thanksgiving where they invited the Indians and spent  days feasting and having a great timeToday we continue this tradition having a feast of New World foods Turkey Cranberries Potatoes Sweet Potatoes Corn Pumpkin Pie and giving thanks for our blessingsThats the mythThe HistoryOddly enough pretty much the same as the myth  OK our eminent historians can nitpick at the details and argue about whether todays tradition truly descends in unbroken tradition from the Pilgrims and just what they ate at the feast and how many Indians were thereEssentially the Myth is the Reality which is very coolThe Practice TodayWell oddly enough it is a HUGE American holiday  The busiest travel days of the year are just before and after Thanksgiving  The airlines get all snarled up  The airports are jammed  Everyone goes to get together with family  Everyone but killjoys and iconoclasts eats way too much turkey  Lots of people watch football on TV in the afternoon  Lots of people go shopping for Christmas present bargains on Black Friday the Friday after Thanksgiving  which by the way is always on the th Thursday in November so it is one of those annoying holidays which moves its date around but on the plus side everyone gets a four day weekendThere you go  Thanksgiving in a nutshell  It is such a cool holiday that the envious Canadians had to copy it but put theirs on a different date  It is such a good holiday that I wouldnt be surprised to see it creep into Britain sooner or later  Come on over and enjoy it yourself some time though you really need to get some American friends to spend it with  It is a family holiday not a public sort of thing,0,cdoof4u,1rlt5m,askhistorians,new,2,2

itsallfolklore,This is an excerpt from an Introduction to Folklore I am putting together The text deals with Campbell who I regard as JungliteIn the last part of the twentieth century Joseph Campbell  created a great deal of interest in mythology and folklore with a series of publications on the subject This was followed by a s television series and the result was extremely popular with the general public but not necessarily with all within the discipline of folklore To a certain extent Campbell was relying on an older approach that Carl Gustav Jung  developed Jung was a Swiss psychologist who studied with Sigmund Freud  but later broke with his mentors teachings to form his own approach to the study of the human mind Jung developed the idea of the collective unconscious maintaining in almost spiritual terms that all of humanity is linked by an unconscious common denominator Ultimately Jung implied that certain themes are woven into the fabric of the universe This results according to Jung in a shared symbolic vocabulary which manifests in dreams mythology folklore and literatureJungian psychology was extremely popular during the upheavals of the s when people looked for mystical explanations of life to unify all existence In spite of the faddish qualities of late twentiethcentury consumption of Jungian ideas it is easy to regard Jung as an exceptional thinker with an extraordinary background of diverse reading Campbell borrowed heavily from Jung presenting many of these ideas in an easily consumable package that itself became something of a fad during the s Campbell drew not only on Jung but also on Otto Ranks  publication The Myth of the Birth of the HeroThere are clearly many good ideas in this literature but there are problems with this approach from the point of view of folklore studies The first is that this body of literature presents the concept of tale types in mythology and folklore as though it were a new discovery In other words Jung and Campbell ignore the highly developed bibliography that folklore offers The second more serious problem is that there is no distinction between the core of a story and its culturallyspecific or narratorspecific variants and variations The JungianCampbell approach treats any variant of a story as an expression of the collective unconscious regardless of whether its particular form is the product of an individual storytellers idiosyncrasies or of the cultural predilections of a region made irrelevant by traveling to the next valley This does not mean that there are no valuable insights in Jung and Campbells literature There is of course but folklorists regard their approach as removed from their own discipline and flawed to a certain extentFolklorist Alan Dundes presented a similar critique of Freudianbased psychoanalysis of folktales In his The Study of Folklore  he wrote that the analysis is usually based upon only one version To comparative folklorists who are accustomed to examining hundreds of versions of a folktale or folksong before arriving at even a tentative conclusion this apparent cavalier approach to folklore goes very much against the grain How does the analyst know for example whether or not the particular version he is using is typical and representative  Dundes also pointed out that often the variant presented by the psychological analysis is from a childrens literature anthology rather than directly from oral tradition,0,cdolx5e,1rlvaa,askhistorians,new,15,15

yodatsracist,Remember the Martial Race theory came to fruition not in the early part of British colonialism where the East Indian Company was actually conquering land the two AngloSikh wars were between  the Gorkha War was  the Third and final Maratha War was  etc  The martial race idea was really put into practice only after the Rebellion of  the Sepoy Mutiny  Who were the martial races  According to Pradeep Baruas Inventing Race The British and Indias Marital Races Historian   pg gtMartial races became a concern immediately after the outbreak of the Sepoy Rebellion in  when the government conducted an official inquiry into the causes of the munity  The report of the Peel Commission concluded that the British had been unaware of the true martial attributes possessed by various Indian ethnic groups  According to the report the mutiny had started with the Brahmins whose high caste made them scheming and dishonest  Such highcaste domination of the Bengal Army had interfered with the traditional Indian social structure and provoked the munity  This simple explanation appealed to the British administrators at the time  After all the Gurkhas Sikhs Marathas and Rajputsonce the most formidable enemies of the Britishhad remained loyal and accepted British supremacy  Because these groups understood the meaning of honor and duty the British felt that they were Indias truly martial peopleLets just stop here and realize that one of the characteristics of a truly martial fighting force was their nonrebellion  If you scan Wikipedias list of martial raceshttpenwikipediaorgwikiMartialRaceTribesandgroupsdesignatedasmartialclasses youll see several that say later excluded for rebellion or something similar  This of course was not a satisfactory justificationgtOf the three explanations for the differences between martial and nonmartial races in Indiaclimatic theories physical qualitites and behavioral characteristicsphysical measurement or anthropometry gained the greatest favor  gtPhysical measurement formed a crucial element in the recruitment of the martial races  The chief measurements taken at the recruiting centers were height and chest width  Although RIselys methods of measuring skull and nose were not followed the recruiting handbooks were full of descriptions about these and other physical characteristics of the respective martial classes  The officer who complied the famous handbook The Goorkhas noted with pride that their physique compact and sturdy build powerful development keen sight acute hearing and hereditary education as a sportsman eminently capacitate him for the duties of a light infantry soldier  Handbooks went into great detail about distinctive physical characteristics of each of the martial races  Another officerauthor of an equally famous handbook The Sikhs wrote The Jat SIkhs have always been famous for their fine physique and are surpassed by no race in India for highbred looks smartness and soldierly bearing  The lenght of limb makes them excellent marchers and their physical activity is developed by active habits  Another handbook Jats and Gujars showered similar prasie on the fine physique of the Jat  InThe Dogras two authors conceded that for vigour and manly strength the Dogra is not equal to the SIkh or Jat but added that when enlisted however they rapidly develop and fill out and commended the Dogras as decidedly a good looking race being generally fair owing to the temperate climate in which they live and among the higher castes owing  to the purity of their descent  Using Risleys anthropometric methodology the authors continued This is a specialty notable among the Brahmins and Rajputs who are more refined in their appearance than the Rathis and Firthis  The clear narrow arched eyebrows are a distcintive characteristic of the highbread Rajput Dogra as is the fine nose and norrow nostrilSo here we see an emphasis that they were chosen  for their actual loyalty  for their putative physical traits  We see surprisingly little history We know theyre good because we fought so many wars with them  Im far from a South Asianist but from the little I know this constructivistloyalty argument I think its true but perhaps not the whole story  One of the questions is where does martial prowess come from   is technology and equipment and since after  these groups were given the best equipment one would suspect that they showed more prowess   would be more cultural reasons be they based in organizations training and education or the power of symbols etc  This second point is more critical before   I dont know the answer to it but its a very interesting question  How much was the British idea of martial races based on loyalty  How much of it was based on objective but arbitrary physical measurements  How much was it based on past behavior  If they were notably successful against the British what caused this success  I dont know the answers to those questions and perhaps they cant even be answered  Methodologically to figure out the benefits of the martial racehood you have to have a comparison group the nonmartial races  I think particularly comparing before and after  will do a lot to clear up how much of this was real and how much of this was a posthoc explanation,11,cdosigb,1rlzg6,askhistorians,new,53,42

ArcherTarith,According to the Cambridge Guide To Asian Theatre Noh was developed from the earlier sarugaku noh by Kanami Kiyotsugu in the th century  Kanami combined rhythmic dance with the popular narrative songs of the time and structured his plays as virtual monodramasin which the crucial event in the life of the chief characterwas remembered and reenacted The Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu became a patron of noh in  and noh continued to develop as a style of court entertainment Kabuki emerged in the th century as a form of popular entertainment as has already been described in this thread By the early th century the key elements of kabuki were in placesuch as the all adult male cast and daylong multiact playsand Kabuki grew as a popular urban form of theater despite official attempts to suppress it Bunraku in its current form emerged in Osaka between  and  In  Yoshida Bunzaburo developed the threeman puppet allowing for an expressive puppet performance that could rival the performance of the live kabuki actors As bunraku became popular kabuki actors started to borrow puppet movement techniques and adaptations of puppet plays moved into the kabuki repertory Conversely the puppeteers studied kabuki productions and imitated kabuki actorsTLDR Noh developed as a kind of high class entertainment kabuki and bunraku were popular entertainment Kabuki and bunraku performers heavily influenced each other and thats why kabuki and bunraku appear similar,0,cdpxci4,1rm5r1,askhistorians,new,2,2
TheVitruvianDan,I couldnt say when the earliest example of this view is but you find a rough version of it in Aristotles Politics  BC He argues for a state in which the endeavours of most of the state are put forward to allowing a specific group of rich people to live the good life a life of philosophical enquiry and emotional breadth and that the entire purpose of the state was to allow a small group of peopl to do this He felt that most classes the farmer the shopkeeper the artisan were incapable of living this good life as it involved fostering diverse interests and activities while most people with their professions did the same activity again and again He said that this dulled the brain  the best they could hope for was to work and help other people with a more leisurely lifestyle,0,cdow1g1,1rm5xi,askhistorians,new,2,2
Starnold,I am going to attempt to help answer this question with three relevancies The first is the idea set out by the Battle of Thermopylae which illustrates in example battle pulses and the array of battle written by Herodotus The second will be using a biography on Scipio Africanus specifically speaking about the Battle of Ilipia written by B H Liddell Hart The third will not be a cited source as much as a reference to a pop culture movie in order to create a modern depiction of events the movie being Black Hawk DownAs many people know the basis of the Battle of Thermopylae cBCE was between the famous  Spartans and the Persian army led by Xerxes we do know however that the Grecoarmy contained far greater number  Spartans  men from Tegea  men from Mantinea  from orchomenus and  from Arcadia  from Corinth  from Phlius  from Mycenae  from Tespia and  from Thebes It was at the mountain pass specifically a rebuilt gate that they held the Persians The text suggests that there were battle pulses or times where the battle raged and then fell The Medes charged and in the struggle which ensued many fellall day the battle continue the Medes after their rough handling were at length withdrawn and in their placethe Kings Immortalswho advanced to attack This suggests that at times there was full on battle with a skirmish but then at times there was nothing In other words there were pulses where battle picked up and then battle fell Further it can be seen further in the passage Next day the fighting began again This would suggest that the battles ended sometime during the eveningnight only to be renewed at a later date This here would give men time to eat relieve themselves and sleep Further sorry for bringing in another source in Plutarchs writings On Sparta he states that Leonidas had told his men to eat breakfast in the expectation that they would be having dinner in Hades While these texts do not write in plain text they took a break so they could have chow and rest it does suggest that there was relatively a time for battle and a time for sleep eating and rest Further this text would show that battles did indeed extend over a course of numerous days and was common to do so Therefore a battle cannot be seen as one act of fighting but rather continuous pulses or skirmishes with rest in between This text does not clearly relate to the Romanera to do so looking into the next text will better be able to paint a picture of what Roman war was like in comparison to the Greco way of war Much like the Greeks it would seem that there were times set aside for sleeping and eating and times for fighting in the Romanera One of the great generals of the time Scipio Africanus the conqueror of Africa fought many battles against the Carthaginians the Battle of Ilipia will be focused on for point of the question During the Battle of Ilipia Scipio applied many strategies but the one that stands out is that the two armies the one led by Scipio and the Carthaginian army would come out and meet each other on the field of battle but not fight for multiple days there is no clear time frame Scipio did this to establish strategy that will not be discussed but it does show that this was not an unusual tactic as the Carthaginians were not thrown by this tactic In one specific part of the text however it does state that there was a time that the armies would meet one another on the fieldHe Scipio observed that the Carthaginians made their daily advance at a late hour and had himself purposely waited still later to fix this habit on his opponents mind Late in the evening he sent orders through the camp that the troops should be fed and armed before daylight and the cavalry have their horses saddledThis text in itself accurately depicts that the battles would potentially be fought during different times of the day much like the GrecoPersian battle at Thermopylae After having made his aforementioned orders Scipio had his men attack outlying Carthaginian camps and retreat while having his main force simply stand and face his opponents main force earlier in the day compared to before thus making the Carthaginian army recognize their loss of breakfast Again this depicts that there were times that were set aside for resting eating and sleeping The fact is that Scipio was smart in changing the time he forced his opponent to appear thus they had not been fed and were starving facing his army while his men were well fed and prepared for battle This would ultimately lead to his victory in that battle The message however stands that not only would armies fight these skirmishes Scipio having his men attack outlying camps then retreat but also would have a such times where battles did not occur Finally while not a reputable source the movie Black Hawk Down does depict in a way how modern military fights its wars and how they relate all the way back to the Grecoarmy way of fighting In the battle the forces fight throughout the day and night Now while they are not continually shooting or moving sometimes being holed up at a certain position there were points where they would fight heavily then rest or wait till the enemy made another move This relates back to the texts as it shows that while we may not have always had an orderly time to go and eat or sleep these pulses where there are skirmishes then stops in battle do show that there does seem to be some sort of pattern that would allow individuals time to sleep eat or relieve themselves Overall I know that I was able to provide only one source to directly identify a Romanera battle but you can see over the course of thousands of years we still keep the pulse mentality This would mean that there would be times where men would sleep eat and relieve themselves in between the calamity of battle Feel free to look into my sources more in depth to find out more not only about these battles but others Hope I helped answer your question

BrownKid,It seems that the battles that lasted multiple days in the roman army were actually very rare I just watched the same video and went online searching for the answer httpwwwromanarmytalkcomromanmilitaryhistoryaarchaeologydurationofancientbattleshtml This forum thread discusses specific battles and sources for examples on multiple day battles But in general multiple day battles involved minor skirmishes with small groups of the actual army In fact most were screening forces that would engage for a short time interval and then retreat At night forces would retreat because it was very difficult to fight large scale battles because maneuvering a large force such as the roman army would become difficult The men would then retreat back to their camps which would usually be a mile or so from the front line so that enough space could be provided to allow sentries to spot the enemy advance in time to form up the army as well as maintain the army close enough to the front line to be able to engage without walking too far of a distanceThe camps they constructed called castras were the forward base camps for the Roman army They would select the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it tertia castra quarta castra etc a camp of three days four days etc would be a temporary camp that was constructed for the duration of the fighting In fact every soldier carried tools for digging and constructing a castra Through the use of the army as a building force to build a temporary fortification the army could build and maintain a base for the duration of a multiday battle But again these battles were not the norm,2,cdos0cs,1rm8e9,askhistorians,new,18,16

Badgerfest,On Her their Lives Depend by Angela Woollacott is an excellent account of British womens roles in industry during the Great War and the socioeconomic effects it had on Britains culture and the role of women  The book takes its name from this recruiting poster httpcfbmedialibglogstercommediaddfaababfbcdbbeabfaeddacfceedhertheirlivesdependjpg which is one of my favourite posters from this periodOther useful sources are Arms and the Wizard by R J A Adams which discusses David Lloyd Georges work at the Ministry of Munitions in  and Dewars The Great Munitions Feat which was written in  as part assessmentpart puffpiece about the production of weapons and munitions in Britain during the great WarEarly estimates ahead of the outbreak of war were that Britain would face widespread unemployment  The logic went that the collapse of trade routes would affect the balance of payments and large sectors of the countrys industry would suffer as a result  There was no prediction concerning the total war which was to follow everyone who mattered expected a limited conflict  As a result British industry was caught off guard and when Field Marshal French claimed spuriously that the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in early  had been unsuccessful because of a shortage of munitions a state of affairs known as the Shells Crisis ensued  This coincided with the collapse of the Liberal government and the establishment of a coalition some historians have argued that the crisis was a factor in the collapseEither way Lloyd George was appointed Minister of Munitions of War and found himself in an utterly unenviable position  British industry was far from capable of dealing with the demands of the war the scale of which was increasing rapidly  Far from unemployment rising Kitcheners drive for volunteers and the ever present threat of conscription risked denuding industry of the manpower it needed in order to feed the war machine  Lloyd George fought to prevent skilled workers from joining up bringing him into direct conflict with Kitchener and worked hard to introduce unskilled workers into factories where he faced strong opposition form Trades Union who saw it as a threat to their membersHe achieved some success with retaining skilled workers and eventually won over the Unions but the transition to a total war economy combined with armed forces far larger than Britain had ever seen before to create a manpower crisis  This is where women came in  A previously untapped resource the opportunity to bring women into the industry was seized upon by some but opposed by many  With one eye on a postwar world many opponents feared the introduction of women to the workplace citing a breakdown of society if women chose work rather than motherhood  Naturally the Trades Union feared further dilution of the workforce and thus a threat to their monopolies and there were concerns raised about womens physical fitness for the manual work required in factories  There can be no doubt however that women workers were invaluable to the war effortWoollacot argues that for working class women this amounted to little more than a revolution  Empowered trained and now with spending power these workers were never going to look back and there was a step change the progress of womens rights because the majority of women now understood what they could achieve  They had become an economic and political force in their own right moving on from the range of relatively small political movements which had existed before the war to achieving limited suffrage in February  and allowing female MPs in November ,0,cdowga4,1rm9yq,askhistorians,new,5,5

TFrauline,I have two answers for you One is very general based on my impressions from studying history and is mostly personal conjecture the other quite specific to my areaGeneral The nature of what is considered humorous changes enormously throughout different regions and time periods but I dont think that there has ever been a time in which being funny wasnt valued in daytoday social interactions provided that your jokes conform to the zeitgeist of humour for that particular period decade year region social class etc Also keep in mind that daytoday social interactions are not the same as pieces of art or writing and there are plenty of instances of satires plays or novels being censored despite a large readership finding them funnySpecific In relation to your question about differences in social classes and whether the upper crust is more humourless my own research on libertines can be illuminating Id like to point you to English Restoration and the court of Charles IIhttpenwikipediaorgwikiCharlesIIofEngland as an example of a period in which fairly bawdy humour stuff that we would considered unseemly today was valued at the highest levels of societyThe typical historical narrative for this period is that after the oppressive moral Puritanism of Cromwells commonwealth the reinstatement of the English monarchy brought about a period of general social liberalism that allowed for humour to become pervasive in public discourse Regardless of how true this is theres no question that during the Restoration English literature and theater was obsessed with the idea of wit or witticism as being an extremely valuable trait to possess This strong desire to demonstrate intelligence and humour in speechwriting frequently led to very risqué statements often mingling politics and sexualityThis carried over into the court of Charles II composed mostly of nobles who all aspired to win the affection of their peers and the King through displays of wit in speech poetry or writing None were more successful than John Wilmot the nd Earl of RochesterhttpenwikipediaorgwikiJohnWilmotndEarlofRochester probably the most definitively libertine figure there isRochester is best known today for his poetry which was never intended for publication and usually written on a manuscript that was passed around and copied by members of the court and parliament something I think makes him a particularly good example of the daytoday humour of the nobility While he produced excellent works using standardized poetic formats with reference to Greek classics etc Its his obscene works that are most notable and also most topical to the period They directly referenced members of the courts and their entourage with scathing satireIts difficult for me to describe quite how hilarious edgy and crude this guy could be In one poem he dedicates to Sue Willis a prostitute who operated around the Kings court he saysHer belly is a bag of turdsAnd her cunt a common shoreOccasionally he would even target the King himself and this got him exiled from court repeatedly One of my favourite lines attacking Charles II isHis scepter and his prick are of a lengthAnd she may sway the one who plays with th otherHis life reflects his writing despite being highly educated and showing bravery in several naval battles he lived a debauched and hedonistic lifestyle until an early death in his thirties from venereal diseaseRochester combined real poetic eloquence with crudity and humour in a way that enchanted and infuriated many members of the nobility and made him infamous Both his obscene poems and his serious works show genuine brilliance and even depict fairly melancholic human truths and theres no question that he embodied the English Restorations obsession with wit and witticism Consequently I think Rochester and the court of Charles II is a really good example of humour being a daytoday social function of nobilityKeep in mind that everything I described in my general answer still applies to Rochester Only  years after his death moralists like Samuel Johnson decried Rochester as wasting his talents being a dissolute rake and someone not suitable to be read and he was almost entirely ignored throughout the Victorian era Humour seems to me a product of taste and subject to the whim of societies that constantly shift and change But that also means Im confident there are many other examples of humour being similarly prized by the upper crust of those societies even while in public The parliamentary quips of Winston Churchill and Lady Astor come to mind I hope you get lots of responsesMy information for this post comes mostly from the David Vieth collection of Rochesters poems published by Yale University Press in  Its the most wellresearched and thorough collection Ive found to dateIf you want to read more about the court of Charles II Matthew Jenkinsons Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II  cannot be beat For

DonaldFDraper,I want to write a large amount of uneasy sounds because its problematic I think the level of vagabonds was exaggerated for dramatic means but it was a very large cultural image in Europe at the time Voltaire in Candide wrote his character getting drafted into the Prussian army by unscrupulous recruiting sergeants that would get men drunk only to wake them up in the barracks It must be noted that Voltaire was close to Frederick the Great so he had some concept of the militaryThe Battle of Valmy is also a very noted victory over the slave armies of Europe and it bolstered the confidence of France into declaring the Republic Free French men fought and defeated the slaves driven by the whip However there is a grain of truth to it The Prussian army was somewhat conscript based before the Seven Years War but the man power problems caused over half of Fredericks armies to be almost half foreignmercenary by the last years of the Seven Years War Punishment was severe and if a soldier ran away there was a bounty placed on his head and the people of the region were required to help in finding himHowever I am not familiar with the phrase you mention it may allude to the fee given recruiters for getting men hence why they would gravitate to recruiting drunks and vagabonds that cant really say no,2,cdorlz1,1rmkck,askhistorians,new,22,20

molstern,It depends on what you mean by leadership The legal power the king had was dependent on other people like the parlement of Paris actually going through with his decrees since he couldnt exactly go out and physically force people to pay more taxes on his own So he couldnt really go against the parlement too much or they would rebel which they did before the revolution when they refused to record his laws when they involved raising taxes on the social class the parlement belonged to in order to unfuck the economy So the natural limits to absolute powers were a factor without them there would have been no estates general and in my opinion no revolution as we know it but thats not really a problem in Louis character more in the system of the old regime After the opening of the estates general everything Louis did to try to steer things in his direction basically made things worse He closes the door to the third estates hall They swear the tennis court oath and basically start a revolution He orders them to calm the fuck down Mirabeau makes epic speeches in reply rebels keep rebelling and its Christmas for revolutionary newspapers He tries to use force to calm them down The people of Paris storm the Bastille He confesses to feeling kind of iffy about the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen and the August decrees The women of Paris show up to his castle and politely inform him that he now lives with them in Paris So honestly I dont think doing MORE would have been a good thing for him if that is what you meant would be strong leadership of hypothetical Louis compared to the weak leadership of the real one In my opinion it might have hurried things along and he would have been hated and deposed much faster He also had the problem of the old regime system of military basically fucking over the majority of the soldiers even more than the average Frenchman by making the upper ranks of the military available only to the nobles So when the revolution starts brewing they fuck off tired of being ordered around by some random dude who just got the job for being rich and early on a significant part of the army declare that they wont fire on protesters So using more force would have been difficult What he could have done was go against everything he actually wanted to do and push through laws abolishing privileges and making taxation more fair but that would do enormous financial damage to all his friends and family and he himself could have limited the power of the absolute monarchy That in my opinion would have basically stopped the revolution but it would have been the royalist equivalent to declaring himself a servant of Satan and peeing on the church and there was just no way Louis was going to do that And when I say it would have stopped the revolution I mean the popularbourgeois revolution that happened IRL but it would have very likely triggered an aristocratic revolution that might have led to similarly unfunny results for him ,0,cdounau,1rmx9h,askhistorians,new,3,3

backmarkerSE,Luxembourg First World WarLuxembourg was invaded and occupied by GermanyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiGermanoccupationofLuxembourginWorldWarI during the First World WarBeing able to move their army through Luxembourg as well as Belgium was a key part of the MoltkeSchlieffen Plan  On st August  the Germans violated Luxembourgish neutrality by using Troisvierges Station in the north of the country and taking control of the telegraph posts there  The Luxembourgish prime minister Paul Eyschen telegraphed Berlin asking what was happening  The German State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Gottlieb von Jagow responded that there must have been a mistake and that Germany would respect Luxembourgish neutrality as had been affirmed at the  Second Treaty of London providing that France did the sameOn nd August  Germany launched its invasion of Luxembourg crossing the Moselle which the border between Germany and Luxembourg follows excluding a little bit of Luxembourg near Vianden which is east of the river at Remich and Wasserbillig and moved on the capital Luxembourg City  The Luxembourg Army consisting of  mostly ceremonial troops were ordered by the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg MarieAdélaïde not to resist the Germans  At  a telegram was sent to the Luxembourgish prime minister in which the German government apologised for the invasion which they said was necessary to protect German military and railway interests and that Luxembourg would be fully compensated by the Germans for any damage  At the end of the day a fight between German and French troops broke out at PetitCroix on the western border of LuxembourgOn rd August a further telegram was sent claiming the occupation to be temporary that the rights of Luxembourgers would be respected and that France had caused the invasion by sending  troops on bicycle into Luxembourg before the invasion  This claim seems unlikely though possible and was denied by the government of Luxembourg Luxembourgers had left the country before the invasion and most of these volunteered within the French army  of these were killed in the course of the warDuring the occupation trees were pulled down in Luxembourg City in order to improve the line of sight for using machine guns should the Germans have needed to defend Luxembourg  Orchards and farmland were dug up to locate bunkers and gun emplacements  Luxembourgish workers were made to work for the German war effort  In order to prevent trouble brewing among the local population preventive arrests of possible dissenters were made  it seems that the German secret police had been active in Luxembourg before the war  Most of these prisoners were taken to Trier just across the border into Germany  Luxembourg was kept under martial law and there were restrictions on travel free speechpress and rationing  The country was used by the Germans as a logistical support centre for the German army and Crown Prince Wilhelm who was a general in the army had his headquarters at Luxembourgs second city EschsurAlzetteOne of the major events during the occupation was a strike by iron miners on st May   As a result of the British naval blockade on Germany Luxembourg had become very important to German iron production and contributed oneseventh of Germany and the AustroHungarian Empires pig iron  Generalmajor Richard Karl von Tessmar put down the strike and arrested the ringleaders who were sentenced to  years imprisonmentHad Germany won the war it has been argued that she intended to annex Luxembourg  There is some evidence to support this  The Septemberprogramm a draft of German war aims stated that Luxembourg was to become a member of the German Empire and this has been used by historian Fritz Fischer in Germanys Aims in the First World War to claim that it was German policy to annex Luxembourg  General Friedrich Bronsart von Schellendorf Chief of General Staff of the Ottoman Army also talked of annexing Luxembourg  The Septemerprogramm was never official policy however and Bronsart von Schellendorfs statements should not be seen as representative of German policy makers opinion  As it is no serious attempts were made to annex Luxembourg during occupationOn th November  Richard von Tessmar announced the withdrawal of German troops from Luxembourg  After the armistice on th November  it was decided that General John Pershings US Third Army would move through Luxembourg to take up their occupation of the Rhineland which they did the following day  The American troops were greeted by the Luxembourgers as liberators and on nd November the German army completed its withdrawal from LuxembourgLiechtenstein First World WarOfficially Liechtenstein was neutral during the First World War and did not have a standing army  Unlike Luxembourg its neutrality was largely respected  Liechtenstein was closely tied to AustriaHungary however since  Austrian customs officials were in charge of collecting duties at border crossings since  the ViennaZürich train line which passed through the country had been under the control of the Imperial Austrian State Railway since  Austrian diplomats were able to represent Liechtensteiner interests abroad  As a result the Allies saw Liechtenstein as being so closely integrated into the AustroHungarian economy that it too was subjected to embargo by the Allies  This caused hardships in Liechtenstein and the Allies even denied the Swiss their requests to send food to the principality  As a result after the armistice and the collapse of the AustroHungarian Empire Liechtenstein concluded much the same treaties customs consular etc with Switzerland in the place of Austria and adopted the Swiss Franc which is still the currency

IronEngineer,Ive read a book called Wings that gave a fairly detailed history of the aviation technology for the past thousand years  One of the interesting points it brought up was that there was some evidence of humans flying mounted to kites going all the way back to BC times in China  Namely they would mount people to large kites and fly them up high for reconnaissance purposes  The earliest known record of kite flying is from around  BC in China when a general flew a kite over enemy territory to calculate the length of tunnel required to enter the region Yuan Huangtou a Chinese prince survived by tying himself to the kite  There was strong evidence that it was used even earlier in the form of written stories people have given of seeing flying scouts  In  AD one of the Chinese emperors even executed prisoners by having them fly an ornithopter off a cliff  They would glide for some time until they fell to their deaths  There were many variants of unpowered or semipowered flight devices everywhere in the world over the past thousand years  Also interesting is that there were powered flight toys I believe around  AD in select European areas there is a big ish on that century though as it has been a while since I read the book and this was a minor detail  These were simple sticks with blades attached to them  You would wind a string around them and pull fast  The toy would take off and fly around a little bit before crashing to the ground  Other toys used steam power to fly around a bit  The key point is that these toys were very small and light weight  However they marked the first point that a machine could generate its own lift in excess of its weight or a liftweight ratio greater than   From Wikipedia  gtItalian inventor Tito Livio Burattini invited by the Polish King Władysław IV to his court in Warsaw built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in  Described as four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate dragon it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in  but not Burattini himself He promised that only the most minor injuries would result from landing the craft His Dragon Volant is considered the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the th CenturyhttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofaviationThe big point coming up to the s though was that nobody was having any success making a machine that could fly on its own power with large weights and lifts as to lift a person per se  All the flight mechanisms that made the toys fly were just not scalable enough  The little steam engines used to generate power on the small toys would never scale well enough in a powerweight ratio to work on a large scale  Enter the big point of the Wright Brothers  What they did was slap an early car engine on a plane an inline  I believe work out the bicycle chain gearing in a low weight fashion and incorporate low weight aerodynamic controls  Essentially they scaled up the small low weight toys in a way that no one thought possible  This was a marvel in itself however none of their ideas had anything novel in them with regards to the aerodynamics of manned flight  Their work mostly regarded scaling the propulsion and mechanism systems to generate enough power while keeping the weight low  As more directly toward your point on paper airplanes I would assume they would exist based simply on the available knowledge at the time period  I know assuming is bad form but I just wanted to show that nothing the Wright Brothers did would have had anything to do with the paper airplane other than popularizing flight  Many of the efforts towards manned flight go back to Sir George Cayley  This man set forth the guidelines for manned flight as early as  including identifying the main aerodynamic forces and designing the principles of cambered wings finding the importance of dihedral angles for stability designing the traditional tail with horizontal and vertical surfaces etc  He even flew controlled gliders that established all the principles of flight later developers like the Wright Brothers would base their designs off of  He even organized clubs of people to build and fly similar contraptions and further develop the science  When the Wright Brothers first showed their stuff to the world the concept of controlled flight was something that had already been seen  What hadnt been seen was the ability to perform long flights and fly indefinitely on your own power  That was groundbreaking  The real earth shattering occurrences werent kitty hawk where they flew seconds but rather when the brothers went to France and flew around a stadium of people up to an hour at a time  Since the history of aviation is so strongly tied to toys and other mechanations of amusement long before thought was given to manned flight and since all the general concepts needed for developing paper airplanes were laid out and demonstrated by  I would assume there were paper airplanes during the th century at the latest  ,0,cdpfziq,1rn8y8,askhistorians,new,6,6

RenoXD,During World War One there was very much a need to preform a proper burial for dead soldiers as these men were friends brothers dads and sons For morals sake it was important that the men left over after a battle could see their comrades laid to rest or at the very least have a cross placed beside them After a battle there was usually a period of rest where each side collected their dead from No Mans Land In many areas there was sort of unwritten rule that this could happen without shots being fired as each side knew each others perils very well As far as I know there was never a death went by where nobody cared about it but in some cases a burial was impossible Either the battlefield was overrun or the body have been buried under the mud Sometimes a small cross made of anything a soldier could find stickswoodplanks would be placed where the body was thought to have fell or the last place they were seen as a simple memorial to them Remember that the actions of one man may very well have saved the lives of hundreds of others so it was definitely a big deal to show respect to every man who was killed as these men died to save othersWhen there was time and land makeshift cemeteries were set up and subsequently filled very quickly Bodies were buried properly and a sermon was usually issued by a priest or religious man Then a wooden cross would be placed above their body and their helmet if they had it would be laid on top Their name would usually be carved into or drawn on the wood as well This definitely wasnt as common as a battlefield burial but it did happen whenever and wherever possible Herehttpwwwwwbattlefieldscoukflandersimagesypresmichelinresovoircemjpg is an example of one in Ypres The photograph was taken just after the war This cemeterys headstones have now been replaced with the typical white headstones we see all over France and the name of each soldier is properly engraved As to whether anybody cared about the bodies I think the time and effort that went into burying each individual soldier and writing letters home to their families show that every soldier was not just a number lost in the mud but a name and a human being that died horribly Every soldier deserved a proper burial for their sacrifice,0,cdp6v2c,1rn99l,askhistorians,new,3,3
HallenbeckJoe,I dont like the term Banana Wars because it throws together a wide range of events wars interventions occupations  in very different countries Mexico Haiti Cuba  over a time frame of up to  years  is the generally accepted and reduces them to a war over bananas or of youre less polemical than me to the economic interests of the United States in the Caribbean But thats just my personal opinion as the relevant historiography is using the term all the timeThe important use of Banana Wars as a concept is in demonstrating how the United States behaved as an Imperial power in the Caribbean while it rhetorically denounced Imperialism It shows continuities in American policies and actions that would get lost if you look at the events individually But once youre past that and able to accept that the United States never was the innocent and disinterested power it claimed to be Banana Wars loses its usefulness to analyze this periodI know it can be annoying to receive an answer that mostly challenges your assumptions or definitions Historians always like to do that If my answer went over your head as it needs a preexisting knowledge of American foreign relations Im sorry But Im willing to answer your questions if you could narrow it down to one of these events preferably preWWI or a less general question The wikipedia article on the Banana warshttpenwikipediaorgwikiBananawars is an acceptable introduction to them If youve read it and have questions left Id be more than happy to answer themIf you have time on your hands anyway Id be interested in how much and what kind of history education one gets in boot camp I never knew that history would play a role there,0,cdp3404,1rn9mz,askhistorians,new,15,15

rocketsocks,The biggest problem in all of history is the street lamp problem The fact is that studies concentrate where theres the most data and avoid areas where theres little data So you have the Scythians living as close neighbours with the Persians and the Greeks and there are surely many exciting things happening within the Scythian civilization But most of it will remain unknown because they were a different sort of society from the Greeks and didnt have the same traditions of story telling and literatureThey say that history is told by the victors but at a level even above that history is told by the writers And at a level above that history is told by the writers whose records survive and fall into modern hands and are accessible to themIn the cosmology of our physical universe we know that most mass is actually squirreled away in the form of dark matter The same is true in history The history you can read about is only a subset of the events even the important ones that happened in human civilization through those timesIn short so little is written about the Scythians because they didnt keep records very little is known about them compared to the Greeks so theres only so much that can be written without speculating,5,cdp0zpu,1rn9uz,askhistorians,new,65,60

Naurgul,Im not sure if my comment is worthy of a toplevel reply but Ill try anyway please delete if its not up to par My understanding is that there are two main differences First the conception of who counts as a citizen suffrage was extremely limited compared to modern standards Second representation to them was an undemocratic concept that was only used in special cases and considered a concession to aristocracyhttpwwwjstororgdiscoveruidampuidampuidampsid Most executive positions were decided by lot and only some specific positions that required a very specific skillset generals economists were elected by popular voteI suggest watching this extremely informative interview with philosopher Cornelius Castoriadishttpvimeocomt who discusses this issue in detail Im posting some quotes from the interview that will hopefully elucidate the issuegt Every law is voted by the Assembly the ekklēsia  and those laws were voted by the fantastic clause It seemed good to the Dēmos and the Boulē  One doesnt say that its the absolute truth that its God who gave the Tablets of Law It is said At thishere moment the Athenians thought it good to vote this law This means that five or ten or twenty years later one can change it gt Among the Greeks there is no idea of representation Once again no one is saying that everyone can decide at any moment about everything Either there are specialists or there are magistrates But there are magistrates who are not representatives in the sense that the people say All power will be delegated to them for a fixed period as we do They are simply emanations of the city that embody it in certain regards and for certain posts gt Among the Moderns the idea of representative democracy goes hand in hand with what must really be called an alienation of power a selfexpropriation of power That is to say the French population says For five years there is nothing for me to do on the political level I have chosen  people who are going to take care of my business within the Constitutions framework with certain guarantees etc The result is during those five years the citizens arent active theyre passive gt For the Greeks for Aristotle for Thucidydes when he wrote The Peloponnesian War when they spoke about the political entity we would call Athens they never spoke of Athens Athens is a geographical expression For instance at such and such moment Alcibiades left Athens but the Athenians that winter decided the Lacedaemonians decided That is to say its the people itself that is what we call the State which is the political power gt Whereas in the modern political imaginary we have never finally exited from the conception created by absolute monarchy that there is a Power somewhere a monster the Leviathan as Hobbes called it From time to time this monster exits its cave and demands ten thousand young men and forty thousand young girls to eat them and one hundred thousand people to kill them it demands money and everything else gt We can do nothing about that monster what we can do is put around its cave some paper barricades that are called Constitutions which limit the prerogatives of the State gt The citizens of Antiquity really thought that the community the polis was their affair They had a passion for that Modern individuals and theres the rub dont have a passion for that Whence moreover the following quite characteristic phenomenon of the modern world we have long periods of greater or lesser political apathy during which common affairs are managed by professional politicians and then we have in paroxysmal ways things like crises revolutions Because obviously the professionals managing the political domain have gone too far Or what they do no longer corresponds with what society wants society cant find normal channels to express its will so one is therefore obliged to have a revolution a crisis etcgt Archilochus was a mercenary A mercenary soldier and a poet A verse from Archilochus remains where he says the following I was in the battle the other day we were going to fight I threw away my shield to escape more quickly Big deal I could buy me another one at the corner store To say that in a society where what is prized above all else was warrior valour to have thrown away ones shield in battle meant infamy for life to be able to say it and be by this very act a poet prized in all of Greece thats freedom gt Whats hubris The Greeks are free they create freedom and they know at the same time that there are limits But these limits arent fixed There is no Tablets of Law Of course there are moral rules and so on But in other respects no one can know in advance whether he is going too far and yet he has to know it And when one goes too far its hubris its excess and this hubris is punished by a sort of impersonal order of the world that always pulls back anything that tries to overstep order  gt In Greece order measuredness are gained against reality It is not the initial given  whence the Greeks obsession with proverbs that may appear banal nothing in excess dont exaggerate etc I dont see the Swiss or the Dutch having proverbs against overdoing things because the people arent carried away towards exaggeration The Greek people are so obsessed by the fact that one can do too much because thats its natural tendency and because thats what it always does gt The modern Greeks after the war of independence against the Turks set up a State in line with the Western norm They had to borrow from the ancient Greeks a term Kratos which in ancient Greek doesnt mean State at all its not a political notion Kratos means the fact of being the strongest Its the brute formgt That shows once again the absence of the thing There is no word to say that Theres the political community theres polis but one cannot say State in the sense that we say it  that is to say an instance of authority separated from the body of citizens

Agrippa,Yes and no a big no In Athens the only democratic state we have any information on other states had democracies but we have no writings about their inner workings that survivedIn Athens you needed to be a citizen to have any political rights In the midth C BCE they added a clause that required you to have both parents as citizens most states only required the father be a citizen this was a political law though not a genuine social change As a noncitizen a metic you might be invited to the city to setup shop but there was almost no chance youd ever get citizenship You could participate in many social activities join in the festivals but the chance of being given citizenship was incredibly remote As a woman while you may be a citizen you had no political rights heck you couldnt even represent yourself in courtSo right away from our perspective  its not democratic at all to our modern view But heres the kicker an ancient Athenian wouldnt consider our system democratic theyd probably consider us slightly better off than slavesThe thing is Athens was a participatory democracy there was no representatives that did stuff for you You wanted to vote on a war against Corinth Well you walked to Athens from wherever you lived maybe it took a couple of hours maybe it took you all day and you went up to the assembly and voted personally If you didnt like a law you could stand up and address the entire assembly and propose something different Nowadays we fob off decisions to representatives and hope they do what we want or promised to do years ago during the election The downside is that those living nearer to Athens could go and vote more often than someone who lived a few days awayWhen we talk about the Athens of Pericles time the democratization went even further They had little of the bureaucracy or administration we have today The state would have some slaves but much of the work would be done by citizens Athens was broken into  nongeographic tribes each year those tribes would randomly pick out  citizens to serve on the council So all together each year youd get  randomly picked citizens For th of the year one tribes allotment would set the agenda for the assembly draft laws hear ambassadors No minister of foreign affairs no specialists The untrained citizens did all this If this sounds insane to our modern ears well they didnt have as messy issues to deal with But they did have  strategoi usually translated as generals who could advise them These were elected posts almost certainly of elites who were probably incredibly influential Pericles was elected strategos repeatedly and this was how he got his agenda across But also keep in mind that nowadays we dont have to think about our budgets in detail because we have politicians to make the decisions and we gripe about it afterwards In ancient Athens youd have to pay attention to alot of stuff because you were almost certain to end up in the council at one point of your life unless you didnt mind getting nicknamed Agrippa the thick by members of your tribe,0,cdp8h27,1rne56,askhistorians,new,7,7

fractalvoid,I cant speak with specific regard to Ancient Greek democracy but a lot of the features of what we call democracy developed much later onFirstly the term democracy itself is a very debatable subject so pinpointing a specific definition of one that has universal acceptance is impossible plus there exists many varieties of democracy and more importantly the idea of democracy is a very fluid idea and doesnt necessarily encompass solely the political and legal apparatus a number of political theorists also associate various social economic and cultural systems or ideals as integral to the idea to democracyHowever getting to some concrete differences and developments firstly any introduction of democracy will cover Montesquieus trias politica seperation of powers this is the ideal that any organ of state should only exercise one type of power legislative executive or judicialAnother feature of a modern day democracy would be equality this means equality under the law regardless of nationalityreligioncitizenship etc and no legally enforced class system this of course also entails universal suffrage giving women the vote Any good modern day democracy should have a system of checks and balances within the state apparatus quite often this viewed in light of a states constitution and specific institutions are set up to ensure this is followed Similar to this is a system of accountability where individuals in office or the offices themselves are accountable for any breach of dutyA more modern ideal of democracy with particular significance in Scandinavia is the idea of transparency as in the stately process decision making policy making and all actions taken by any organ of the state or business operating within the state is open to the publicThe notion of Human Rights is often considered to be integrally part of Democracy or at the very least parallel to it although the idea of human rights did exist in some rudimentary sense in ancient greece and even then mostly in philosophical discourse it wasnt the force it is todayThe rule of law is another big one too in fact I dont think you could find a political theorist that does not equate democracy with the rule of law Once again the basics of the idea may be traced back to Ancient Greece but the importance of the idea and its key developments would not come to much much later I write this in a bit of a rush so forgive any mistakes and if you want me to go deeper on any points I will be happy to oblige when I get home in a few hours time Hopefully though someone with a bit more understanding with how the Ancient Greek system can weigh in here so you get a better comparison,1,cdp1pg6,1rne56,askhistorians,new,2,1

tobbinator,From most descriptions and primary sources anarchist occupied Catalonia and Aragón were actually quite functional with productivity reportedly increasing by up to  as well as increases in wages as upper echelons were taken out of the equation and industries consolidated funds could be redistributed without the high paid CEOs etc Most workplaces in heavily industrialised Barcelona and the region of Catalonia were collectivised by the workers working there with most remnants of the old upper class having gone into hiding or defected In Aragón which was primarily a rural and agricultural region local communities often formed to redistribute the land of the larger landowners An arrangement was made in many communities that land was to be collectivised by the agrarian workers but if a landowner wished to exclude himself from collectivisation they were allowed to but only on condition that they only kept land they actually worked and could only hire labour from within their own family From Homage to CataloniagtThis was in late December  less than seven months ago as I write and yet it is a period that has already receded into enormous distance Later events have obliterated it much more completely than they have obliterated  or  for that matter I had come to Spain with some notion of writing newspaper articles but I had joined the militia almost immediately because at that time and in that atmosphere it seemed the only conceivable thing to do The Anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing To anyone who had been there since the beginning it probably seemed even in December or January that the revolutionary period was ending but when one came straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was something startling and overwhelming It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags and with the red and black flag of the Anarchists every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black Waiters and shopwalkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared Nobody said Señor or Don or even Usted everyone called everyone else Comrade or Thou and said Salud instead of Buenos días Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time of Primo de Rivera almost my first experience was receiving a lecture from a hotel manager for trying to tip a liftboy There were no private motorcars they had all been commandeered and the trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black The revolutionary posters were everywhere flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud Down the Ramblas the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro the loudspeakers were bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night And it was the aspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing of all In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist Except for a small number of women and foreigners there were no welldressed people at all Practically everyone wore rough workingclass clothes or blue overalls or some variant of militia uniform All this was queer and moving There was much in this that I did not understand in some ways I did not even like it but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting forso far as one could judge the people were contented and hopeful There was no unemployment and the price of living was still extremely low you saw very few conspicuously destitute people and no beggars except the gypsies Above all there was a belief in the revolution and the future a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machineBryan Caplan however in this essayhttpeconfacultygmuedubcaplanspainhtm argues interestingly that Anarchist held regions still displayed a lot of statist characteristics and presents the issue of the CNTs abuse of coercive measures to collectivise some communities and workplaces This is again disputed by some other historians Beevor Kelsey that the coercive climate was unavoidable in the wartime situation presented The PCEs official party line was also similar to this They claimed that the war came before the revolution and used the alleged forced coercion as a reason to seize anarchist collectives and place them under Republican state control Their actions in doing this produced a lot of tension between the PCE aligned parties and the anarchist aligned parties which culminated into the Barcelona May Days and the end of anarchist power in Catalonia SourcesAugustin SouchyhttpflagblackenednetrevoltspaincollcataloniadolgoffhtmlAlbert

mormengil,The main cause of the huge declines in American Indian populations after the Columbian exchange was the impact of recurring epidemics of European diseases to which the American Indians had no immunityGenerally for about  years after the Columbian exchange began sparsely populated regions of the Americas suffered from recurring epidemics and the population declined to a low point in circa  after which inoculations and vaccinations began to counter epidemic diseases and many American Indiian populations began to finally rebound populations in Canada and the USA for example have grown more than ten times since If the American Indian population was dense enough the European diseases or some of them would become endemic in the population instead of epidemic  Once diseases became endemic populations began to stabilize and recover  Diseases like smallpox became endemic in Mexico for example sometime before The effects of epidemic diseases on populations with no immunity could be huge  Charles Mann in  estimates that the Wampanoag nation had  people in  and only  survivors in  one year before the first European settlement in their territory at Plymouth Plantation after an epidemic disease spread from French shipwreck survivors on Cape CodOf course populations could recover even from  mortality rates like this in time  But the American Indian populations were hit with epidemics again and againFor an example of how population rates struggled to recover from recurring epidemics we can look at Iceland where there is some better data  though still not great  about populations  Small pox entered Iceland in  killing some  people out of a total population of    httpwhqlibdocwhointsmallpoxchppdfThere were then a total of  other smallpox epidemics in Iceland between  and   One epidemic every  years  In  at the end of the  epidemic the population of Iceland was   The population of Iceland never recovered in  years  Note  the population of Iceland continued to decline farther but much of this was due to the great eruption of the Laki volcano in  which wiped out most of Icelands livestock and the ensuing famine killed  of the population making the impact of edidemics vs the impact of natural disasters become hard to disentangleJ N Hays  Epidemics and Pandemics Their Impacts on Human History  p  found at httpbooksgooglecombooksidGyEQtkSkCamppgPAamplpgPAampdqEpidemicsinicelandampsourceblampotsVnfgqcampsigxCPHfAXNhhwrHQAGiwCBwljtamphlenampsaXampeicqXUsrBLNsQStIHIBQampvedCEQAEwBAvonepageampqEpidemicsinicelandampffalsehttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofIceland for date and impact estimates of Laki volcano eruptionThe population of Iceland seems to have had more genetic protection against small pox than American Indian populations  Mortality rates in a bad epidemic in Iceland were usually below   Mortality rates in bad epidemics in American Indian populations were often above The example of Iceland indicates  that American Indian populations exposed to recurring epidemics would never managed to stabilize and recover  They just kept declining  The evidence is that most American Indian populations continued to decline until circa  when the advent of immunization and vaccination programs halted the decline and a rebound beganWhere American Indian populations began to stabilize or recover earlier it seems to have been where populations were dense enough Mesoamerica parts of South America that some of the European diseases could become endemic rather than epidemic  Endemic diseases even if still deadly have a greatly reduced impact on population levels compared to recurring epidemics because they kill children the adults being either immune or survivors   High childhood mortality rates are more easily replaced by a populationSo the reason why there are many more American Indians in Mexico and parts of South America is that these areas were more densely settled originally  Although hit with hugely damaging epidemics the populations in these regions remained dense enough for the European diseases or some of them to become endemic rather than remain recurring epidemics  Once diseases became endemic even though the mortality rate could remain tragically high in children the population had a much better chance of stabilizing and beginning to recover  So some densely populated areas began to stabilize American Indian populations by circa  while in less densely populated regions where diseases remained as recurring epidemics populations did not begin to stabilize until some  years later,0,cdpezgu,1rnwn5,askhistorians,new,16,16

johnandrewsmith,The short answer to your question is no All of these occurrences were isolated incidents that happened for various reasonsThe long answer is well complicated I dont quite like covering Russia with broad generalizations since their society is so unique but I think in this case it might work Russia is a steppe country whose borders are very long and open making it vulnerable to the various horse tribes of the steppe In order to counter this Russian rulers tend to militarily expand in order to eliminate possible threats from the steppe They also tend to consolidate and centralize power using terror and violence when necessary This is not so different from other European monarchs at the time although it can be argued that the Russian methods were more thorough And then sometimes the ruler was just plain mad as it can be with any monarchy Ivan the Terrible for instance was starting to go crazy at the time he killed his son He didnt intentionally do it and afterwards he  held his son in his arms cryingIts important to understand the situation many czars were in order to understand their actions They were often threatened by war rebellions and coups Sometimes this necessitated harsh policies Peter and Catherine were certainly great rulers but they ruled Russia with an iron fist Peter brutally stamped out opposition to his western policies and Catherine either manipulated or killed anyone who was a threat to her Ivan the Terrible created the Oprichniki which was the original secret police These rulers were keenly aware of the political situation and did this not only to hold onto power but to save their own skin So now were at Peter the Great Peter asks his son to start preparing to become czar while his son wants nothing to do with that Peter had another son but he needed to make sure that after he died that Alexei wouldnt get powerhungry and go after the throne anyway He demands that Alexei become a monk if he wants to be czar one day to join the army Alexei flees from Russia to Vienna This causes quite a stir among the nobility and Peter suspects his son of treason He convinces his son to return on the false pretense of safety After Alexeis return Peter starts his inquisition to root out all the traitors in Alexeis circle His son is convicted then sentenced to death He is instead tortured to death in an attempt to get more informationStalins situation is also unique He was also very concerned about the political atmosphere in Russia He was also in the middle of a devastating war and while it did give him some leverage among the general population he could no longer afford to eliminate political threats in the military Stalins son was captured by the Germans Hitler offered to trade him for Field Marshall Paulus and Stalin replied I will not trade a Marshall for a Lieutenant While we can speculate on the various reasons Stalin abandoned his son it is claimed by his daughter that Stalin believed his son deliberately surrendered and was therefore a traitorThe very long answer to your question is that Russian leaders might not have cultural background for killing their heirs but they do have a history of autocracy and paranoia Hopefully this answers your question,10,cdphgz4,1roiae,askhistorians,new,35,25

TheWinStore,Botched intelligence and botched communication within the Kennedy administration contributed a great deal to the failure of the Bay of Pigs Yet the catastrophe was entirely avoidable Just for some essential background information during his first few months in office JFK was immediately confronted with the question of what to do about Cuba In  Castro had taken control of the country and Castro wanted to free Cuba from its dependency on the USthe US bought  of Cubas sugar at subsidized prices and owned the major oil refineries sugar plantations and utilities Castro wasnt a communist when he took over but his brother Raul was and so was Che Guevara Both pressured Castro to draw closer to the SovietsOn November   about a week after his election JFK was briefed on a CIA plan to send an invasion force of  Cuban exiles to invade Cuba President Eisenhower told JFK that the antiCastro plan was proceeding well and that it would be his responsibility to see it through That advice left a big impression on JFK who greatly respected Ikes military background   So what intelligence and bureaucratic failures doomed the Bay of Pigs and why did they developFailure  the Joint Chiefs The Joint Chiefs studied the CIA plan and correctly concluded it would fail without largescale popular uprisings in Cuba meaning the people of Cuba would have to rise up against the government The Joint Chiefs also correctly concluded that there was no evidence the Cuban people would do so Unfortunately the Joint Chiefs obfuscated their conclusions For example they concluded that the CIA plan had a fair chance of success But does fair mean good or bad Its very ambiguous language What the JCs really meant was that there was a  chance of failure which are pretty poor odds relatively speaking But when JFKs advisors read the memo they werent aware of this probability Additionally all the Joint Chiefs reservations about the plan were buried in the back of the long memo Failure  obsession with secrecy A series of meetings were called in the White House to discuss the CIA plan One of the first issues that arose was the disposal problem which was raised by Allen Dulles who was still head of the CIA as a holdover from Ikes administration He said that if the invasion were called off the Cuban exiles who had been training in Guatemala would come to the US and risk leaking the plan making JFK look weak and indecisive In March  JFK approved the plan provided US involvement was kept secret He wanted the plan to be free of traces of US fingerprints Whether this was even feasible was another question entirely But secrecy was desirable at the time because the US was still engaged in sensitive negotiations with the Soviets over Laos JFK also wanted a more benign relationship with Latin American countries and a US invasion of Cuba would make the US look bad Unfortunately JFKs desire for secrecy led to the invasion site being moved from Trinidad Cuba to the lessexposed Bay of Pigs This decision would have substantial consequences As far as intelligence goes JFK approved the plan with the assumption that even if the invasion failed the Cuban exiles could flee to the mountains and conduct guerrilla warfare there There was a minor snag howeverwhereas the original invasion site at Trinidad was close to the mountains the Bay of Pigs was not It seems that no one took the time to look at a map and point this out to JFK Oops Excessive secrecy was a problem even within the process of administrative decisionmaking At every meeting for example the CIA would hand out copies of the latest plan and then confiscate the plans at the end so that none of JFKs advisors could leave the room with them This prevented the administration from consulting outside experts at the State Department and so forth Failure  erroneous assumptions The Bay of Pigs plan was based on numerous erroneous assumptions For example it was assumed that the invasion would set off an uprising in the Cuban underground against Castro But after the air strike Castro just rounded up all the members of the Cuban underground and chucked them into prison The antiCastro forces were weak disorganized and lacked clear leadership No Cuban underground even existed Another poor assumption was that US involvement could be kept a secret  clearly implausible given the extent of US involvement And finally there was the assumption that even a failed invasion would allow a flight to the mountains which never occurred Failure  newbies Typically bad intelligence can be checked by thorough careful decisionmaking However JFKs advisors were reluctant to speak out against the plan The advisors were in place only  days were new to each other and were not used to blunt discussion They were afraid to challenge the CIA on the premises of the plan especially because the CIA was headed by Allen Dulles who had overthrown governments in Guatemala and elsewhere There was no real discussion where advisors were allowed to debate the issuesthe administration simply deferred the plan to the CIA and so the outcome was extremely poorFailure  bureaucratic politics The CIA and the Joint Chiefs were much more concerned about their own parochial interests than national interests The CIA withheld critical information from the president such as the known weakness of the antiCastro underground and the low morale of the Cuban exiles when they learned US would provide direct support The CIA also had no evidence of strong antiCastro forces on Cuba The CIA was not the only culprit The Joint Chiefs did not effectively warn JFK that the operation was not militarily feasible They failed to warn him that Castros air force had to be totally destroyed for the invasion to have any chance of success And the Joint Chiefs did not make their other reservations known to the administration Why They thought if the plan started to fail JFK would have to deploy US troops to salvage the mission which would conveniently serve the Joint Chiefs interests And if the invasion did fail they assumed the CIA would take the blame not them  All of these reasons contributed to the failure of the Bay of Pigs Would a USflagged invasion have succeeded Perhaps but JFK would never have approved such a plan If the intelligence had been properly handled the correct decision would have been to take no action Fortunately JFK learned a few lessons from the Bay of Pigs First dont trust the bureaucracy Second dont be awed by experts And third encourage frank discussion and debate JFK would draw on all of these lessons during the Cuban missile crisisso in a way failure in  laid the groundwork for success in    Source Deborah Welch Larson lecture University of California Los Angeles

Bezant,gtJust outside Athens Pisistratus cut himself and his mules about the body then drove into town claiming that hed been attacked by his political enemies The people gave him bodyguards who followed him around armed with clubs Pisistratus then took the Acropolis by force with the help of his new bodyguardsThis one I dont think is particularly hard to believe  The main point is that he overrode the traditional Athenian objections to an armed bodyguard  Once he had say a handful of men the precedent was set and as a powerful political figure he was able to expand his guard further over timegtPisistratus was later driven out of Athens His plan to get back into power is described by Herodotus as the silliest trick which history has to record He found a tall woman called Phye Φύη and dressed her up as Athena He taught her some goddesslike moves then rode into Athens on a chariot with her standing next to him The Athenians fell for this ludicrous ruse and he returned to power Herodotus himself is incredulous about this storyMy Greek history professor suggested that rather than being taken in by the ruse it was never intended seriously and the Athenians just went along because they appreciated a good show  The entire show was secondary to the political context that allowed him to return and be welcomed by the citizens  I find that a more reasonable assessment than the Athenians being complete idiots  for fun if you calculate Phyes height she was about gtAfter being chucked out of Athens for a second time Pisistratus gathered an army and made for the city On the way a soothsayer wandered by and told him some nonsense about fish being caught in nets Pisistratus ordered his army to advance at that exact time the Athenians were having lunch or playing some dice or having an afterlunch snooze So Pisistratuss army walked into Athens unopposed This strikes me as the fairly common practice of random oracles and divine acts being thrown in  The thing that makes Herodotus different from the people that wrote about history before him is he incorporated human agency rather than divine  A common feature of his work is explaining the human side and  the supposed divine side of any historical event but what really makes it history is they basically function without the divine bitsWhat we know is that during his exile he built contacts throughout the Greek world raised a pretty big army which he marched back to Athens with and won the battle of PalleneAlso keep in mind he was not just some nutter gaining power through crazy tricks  He was an important political leader with a large base of support among the Athenians as well as a skilled and competent ruler  So it wasnt very absurd that he rose to power  As to whether people believed the more fanciful parts of the story probably not at first but as the time passes and the events grow more distant the authority of remaining sources gets stronger so until more serious criticism of historiography emerged Herodotus version was likely widely believed,16,cdphf7u,1rp2ge,askhistorians,new,113,97

khosikulu,Only in a few places did various Europeans have the power to generate conflict directly andor raid for slaves even then they had African auxiliaries like Portugal in the area of northern Angola today  So some involvement by Africans of various standings and origins had to exist and did the mixedheritage Eurafrican trading class that grew from the s onward was also a crucial part of factoring slaves into the Atlantic trade  But one must always remember that only certain African societies took part and only certain leaderships under varying conditions usually connected to other existing political objectives  African rulers didnt have to give consent because the majority of people taken into slaveryand certainly the majority of fightingage menwere captured in war or surrendered as tribute  Under the older system however those people remained in the region the export trades removed them entirely  Except for civil war important in Kongo and occasionally the sale of condemned criminals African rulers were not putting their people into the trade but normally their enemies or other strangers  The acquisition cost was effectively pretty low so this was pure profit for the individual captorThe getting guns thing was not quite as important as you suggest in part because a number of societies had other things Europeans wanted too and sometimes they wanted other things from Europeans  Asante for example not only actually imported slaves on the coast but also had gold and could buy firearms It wasnt alone  Arms traffic in West Africa wasnt restricted to those who engaged in slave trafficking  It wasnt just leaders either a lot of traders were pretty independent and simply gathered slaves from the major markets  Slaveoriented states like Dahomey were late developments on the wholeThe Atlantic trade was something of a magnitude unknown in the intraAfrican trade or generally in the African experience of slavery  Chattel slavery required a lot of people to pretend they werent doing anything wrong the massive expansion of the slave trade required the same  In effect answering the question of whos at moral fault is impossible because everyone involved in the trade from the point of capture to the final destination was in some way responsible for the trade  The morality of the slave trade is another matter because of the prospect of presentism but we can certainly recognize analytically that the machinery of the export slave trades worked helically growing and deepening as it went one step at a time involving people of all sorts with a lot of different motivations across three continents and a whole ocean  A search for particular blame is not really relevant here and its honestly not good history to frame a complex  year long commercial trajectory that wayHave a look at John Thorntons Cultural History of the Atlantic World  or his earlier Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World  He gets at some of this in there  One important warning thoughthe agendas in play when people talk about the blame game or the related numbers game are a mile wide on many sides,4,cdphq5f,1rp6v4,askhistorians,new,26,22
mormengil,Moral culpability is a very tricky subject for historians to get intoWe really should not anachronistically reflect our own moral values or todays moral values back into the past and use them to judge historical peopleIf we think that it is immoral to conquer other people does that mean we should go back in history and declare that Alexander and Caesar and Muhammad and Genghis Khan were evil and morally culpableInstead if one of the goals of history is to deeply understand the past and the people in it we should try to understand how the people themselves or their contemporaries thought about the morality and how they might have judged themselves or been judged AT THE TIMEAt the time of the early Atlantic slave trade in the s slavery had been a long standing institution in Africa and the slave trade in the Indian ocean had been going on for a long time  I dont think we know of any sources indicating a moral objection to the slave trade within African societiesThere was also little or no moral objection to slavery from Europeans in  It wasnt until late in the s that the abolitionist movement and men like John Wesley and William Wilberforce in England and colonists in Northern Colonies like Vermont and Massachusetts began to be a strong voice against the morality of slaveryAfrican rulers were certainly heavily engaged in the slave trade but whether they or their contemporaries considered them morally culpable for this engagement seems dubiousBy the late s there were enough people in Europe mostly England and the Americas who thought that slavery was immoral and were vocal enough about it that most Europeans were aware that the subject had been opened for debate  Whether or when any of this debate occurred in Africa I dont think we know,1,cdpjwy3,1rp6v4,askhistorians,new,5,4
GHboy,The moral culpability of African rulers is a loaded and subjective question whose answer depends on perspectiveIts a complex interplay of the two European powers specifically set up forts on coastal areas to purchase slaves However they could not have purchased slaves without a sellerIn addition to buying slaves from freelance slave catchers Europeans also bought slaves who were POWs and refugees from kingdoms such as the Ashanti KingdomhttpenwikipediaorgwikiAshantiEmpireConsidering the extreme profitability of the slave trade in the Americas it was in European interest to have Africans fighting as it supplied a steady stream of slaves It was in the Africans interest to sell slaves as to acquire guns so as to not be enslaved by their enemiesIf an African kingdom had refused to cooperate and sell slaves the European powers would have simply armed the competing tribekingdom So the Africans had to play ball whether they wanted to or not and some states like the expansionary Ashanti empire definitely wanted to play ballSecondly tribes never actually sold their own people They sold other tribes from further inland So Im not sure if consent is even applicable Its fairly easy to consent to you enslaving my enemy,5,cdphw56,1rp6v4,askhistorians,new,4,-1

BeondTheGrave,The answer is really simple so dont be upset if this is a brief answer But  Shiloh is so important for Grant because he almost lost See the battle happens over two days and on the first day the Union forces were thoroughly beaten by the Confederates Grant should have accepted his loss and pulled his troops back its what every other general did during the war need I bring up panicky McClellan But instead he consolidated his forces and fought again on the second day where he turned the tables and inflicted a defeat on the Confederate forces a defeat which allowed the Union to keep all the gains it had made across the Mississippi river I should add This showed Grant to be a tenacious and capable commander It didnt prove that he was a great general that would come in  but it proved he was willing to continue fighting when by all measures he was actually beaten Also its interesting to look at the battle of Shiloh in the context of the Overland Campaign During Overland Grant suffered major defeats at every engagement if we use the same ruler we use for every other Civil War battle which doesnt quite fit the OC Ill admit But US Grant kept turning Lees flank and continuing south Whereas every general before him had retreated after losing to Lee Grant just kept going Thats another reason why Shiloh is so critical to US Grant  Edit Did you delete your comment Anyway get Russell F Weigleys A Great Civil WarhttpwwwamazoncomGreatCivilWarPoliticaldprefsrieUTFampqidampsrampkeywordsRussellWeigley which is really a classic ,0,cdpk2qy,1rpiji,askhistorians,new,4,4

LordSariel,It has an extremely high variance depending on what kind of environment youre in Atlantic World Historian Ira Berlin has said something to the effect of To know a person is a slave is to know only their legal status And I stand by this from my own research in the Atlantic World The experience of slaves cannot be so easily generalized even within the very clear lens of British Colonial North America Even there a number of different crops were grown between  and  and slaves were subjected to different legal and social privileges that effected their socialization and cultural melding with the settler populationAs predominantly mentioned in Berlins book Many Thousands Gone The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America the question of language has many factors The most prominent of these factors is how many captured Africans spoke your same language This would effect the actual sales pool upon reaching the Colonies Beyond that the geographic region in which you arrive in which in time you arrive further has a huge effect on your cultural integration Urban slaves generally had more autonomy and were required to socialize faster because they were usually in extremely small numbers in close quarters with settlers Rural farmers could still have    slaves from many diverse regions forcing them to learn a common language usually English Large planters largely in the southern states that had a yearround climate for agriculture could have anywhere from    slaves even in the Early Colonial years and they would be less likely to develop any kind of propensity for English in the first generation In other areas of the Caribbean the native language of the slaveholding class was much less adopted because in places like Brazil Haiti etc slaves were imported in such mass numbers and less care was given to their survival Generally speaking these areas has a much larger population of native Africans at any times This differs from British Colonial North America in that the class of African Americans rose much sooner out of the imported populationFor more information read Ira Berlins book He goes into much more detail based on Geographic region type of work type of crops grown as well as the politics of the time Its a beautiful mix of social political and economic history that transcends national boundaries to give you an exhaustively thorough look into what slavery was like everywhere in British Colonial North AmericaI can elaborate a bit more later but for now I have to shoot out for errands Sorry for the quick and dirty response Expect some clarifying edits later,7,cdpp97v,1rpl4t,askhistorians,new,28,21
RamblinRambo,Id like to answer this from a personal experience point of view Sure enough the world has changed and there are a lot of new resources out there but the main principle of learning by doing hasnt changed Ive moved countries a few times and Ive never learned a language through class Ive learned it by listening pointing asking and picking up words as you go And I know a good few others that have done the sameIt is important to note that for some people it takes longer and for some it takes less time Some are just simply much more talented in picking up and understanding new languages Exactly like some people are more skilled in maths than others some are more skilled in athletics and so onIf you try and are completely surrounded by a new foreign language Id say it takes on average  year to learn an acceptable level to be able to speak and converse If the language is close to another language you already know then it might take less than six months But if we analyse it from the perspective of being completely different it takes at least a year Once you get the basics youll learn fasterOne universal thing Ive noticed is that people understand each other very well through basic sign language It is actually amazingMy grandfather moved as a  year old boy with his brother to a country where they did not know a single word It was back in the day when english wasnt a common denominator as it is in much of the world today I remember a story from him on how he agreed to rent an apartment pay rent found a job etc with just basic sign languageAnd Id argue that nothing has changed since early history to today if you take away classes and education If you set out to learn a language by doing youll go through the exact same process Ive done this myselfOnly thing we need to think of when it comes to slaves is their ability or freedom to communicate with others that spoke english If they were heavily tied to one owner and their farm then it might have taken  years instead of one It all ties in with exposure to the language So Id expect heavy correlation with exposure to the language and it will have been case specific Also if there were a lot of slaves that spoke a common language it might mean that some of them never learned the new language You can see this in any areas even today where you have a lot of immigrants from the same part of the world Say china towns that have people that dont speak a word of english even if theyre been in an english speaking country for years,0,cdq593u,1rpl4t,askhistorians,new,1,1

agentdcf,There were no state regulations regarding labor as far as I know However the trade would probably have been regulated by guild structures in cities or towns of any size Medieval London had Livery Companies for carpenters joiners different from carpenters because they used adhesives and not nails bricklayers and tylers and plumbers among others These guilds would have controlled things like apprenticeships and mastery as well as prices and wages I dont know anything specifically about the building trades but I have studied the baking trade a bit and I think we can extrapolate from one to the other For vital elements of the urban economy guild structures and what regulatory legislation existed served to either remove a trade from market forces entirely or at the very least highly circumscribe its operation Prices and wages were so arranged as to ensure a just price preventing collusion and manipulation of the market by merchants and tradespeople while providing acceptable wages to workers With set wages and prices what frequently happened was that craftspeople competed in quality whoever could build the best house or bake the best bread would have more custom and do better I suspect from my fairly cursory reading of medieval urban history that being a tradesmen was not a bad gig as things go If you could get into a guild you were going to do alright as long as you were reasonably competent If you were a casual laborer things were going to be roughGuild structures also regulated quality and conduct often with their own private courts empowered to fine guild members and punish them publicly For bakers this meant ensuring the proper weight and purity of products For builders I would guess that quality meant ensuring stability of construction and soundness of materials Bakers all had their own personal stamps which marked the loaves so that any loafs baker could be identified if some violation was found I would guess that similar measures existed for builders so that if a building collapsed without cause the builder would bear at least some responsibility ,0,cdq2euv,1rpqi6,askhistorians,new,1,1
stayhungrystayfree,This wont be as detailed as I want it to be but I have time to give the quick and dirty In the timeframe youre looking at there wasnt anything resembling a unifying practice Liturgies were local and though there are some who argue for a unifying shape of Catholic liturgy being apparent the wording of the liturgies wasnt uniform and it wouldnt be for quite some time Its likely that the Arian liturgy kept a similar shape but we dont have any extant liturgies to say for sure As far as monasticism goes the idea of ordered monks didnt really exist yet and cloisters were mostly just associations of hermits who lived in community Nothing like the Benedictines or Augustinians The Franciscans sort of follow this model But Im digressing Arian monasticism was very decentralized and existed primarily in the Arabian peninsula and in Syriac speaking eastern kingdoms where it would survive marginally until the rise of Islam It was a very hermetic kind of asceticism and didnt lend itself to putting down roots and putting up buildingsThis is from my earlymonasticism professor who focused on Syriac monasticism I cant really speak to how it worked for the Germanic tribes So they very well may have had an entirelydifferent liturgy but seeing as how liturgies were especially suppressed see how long Donatist parishes lasted after Constantine came down on them we dont have any details of what they included Also Rowan Williams book on Arius and Arianism is a great read and I highly recommend it It focuses more closely on Arius the person but he covers some of this ,0,cdpsv1b,1rpqui,askhistorians,new,8,8

backgrinder,Each unit in the US Army has an offcial TOampE or Table of Organization and Equipment established by the Army This determines everything assigned to the unit from men to equipment to vehicles and breaks everything down A division TOampE will call for a certain number of battalions each battalion has companies each company has platoons etc Depending on the tasks assigned to the division the battalions will be set up differently An armor heavy division will have a different grouping than an Infantry division which will have a different grouping than a support unit  The TOampE will call for an infantry company to have a specific number of privates plus a specific number of sergeants and officers and will specify specific ranks for specific jobs when someone is promoted they automatically shift to a new job with different responsibilities  The TOampE will also call for a specific mix of weapons In a WW infantry platoon the standard weapon is a semi automatic rifle Each company will be assigned a set number of light and heavy machine guns used to set up defensive positions and crews will be assigned to carry them tripods ammo and either serve them with ammo during battle or protect the gunner from enemies sneaking in close enough to take out the  weapon Large crew served weapons are generally company weapons that can be assigned to a certain platoon by need lighter  cal machine guns are platoon weapons Then there are the in between type weapons like Thompson submachine guns and BARs and specialty weapons like bazookas  Tommy guns and BARs Browning Automatic Rifle are squad type weapons A company is divided into platoons run by Lieutenants and platoons are broken into squads led by noncoms During combat the squads were often separated each performing a different task particularly in the US Army where the standard infantry doctrine developed by George Marshall before the war called for a unit to be divided with one group firing directly on a target from cover while the other group attempts to flank it A simple easy to learn and effective maneuver but the forces are divided so platoon weapons are only available to one group at a time  A group separated from the rest of the platoon will need enough punch to hit the enemy and may need to defend themselves from counterattack Thats where squad weapons like the BAR and Tommy gun come in A Tommy gun is a close in weapon It is actually a machine pistol not an automatic rifle It shoots a snub nosed  bullet that wont stay straight in midair and it tends to buck a lot and be hard to keep pointed on target Its great for spraying a lot of bullets in a general direction quickly while making a huge calamitous racket though It also has a lot of stopping power Because of this its great for clearing buildings and fortifications Its also good for defending against sudden attack Bullets go everywhere bad guys all duck and your squad gets a couple of precious seconds to assess the new situation and deal with it  The BAR is an offensive and defensive weapon Its a big heavy bitch to tote around but it can be handled by one man and fired while standing and moving It shoots a  rifle cartridge like the crew served Browning Machine Gun so its more accurate than a Tommy gun and you can attach a small bipod stand to it and fire it from a prone position  Now outside of the basics with crew served weapons being company weapons and hand held machine guns being owned by the platoon and assigned to individual squads is the question of who was selected to use each weapon and why Generally during training the biggest strongest toughest most aggressive guys were assigned the squad weapons The most obvious reason is these weapons and their extra ammo are pretty heavy and big men make better mules Also the more aggressive guys would be more likely to actually use them A lot of people arent aware but not everyone pulls the trigger in combat Some are scared and break some just freeze some cant bear to kill and avoid firing at another human being After a unit had been blooded the officers and noncoms figured out who the shooters were and reassigned weapons based on need After a unit had been in combat longer you had vets absorbing in new replacements and vets would get first choice of weapons as well Sometimes after a few engagements that big heavy bitch that was such a beast to lug around and made so much noise and attracted so much attention was a lot more attractive Combat soldiers have a fine appreciation of the value of getting lots of ordinance on target fast and soon realize that big noisy attention getter usually causes the bad guys to duck and cover once it has their attention instead of shooting back at you a nice fringe benefitUS Army Infantry

starfox,Im not sure about the SS and the Wehrmacht but government ministries and officials were often engaged in bitter bureaucratic rivalries and intrigues usually due to having overlapping fields of responsibility or power Theres some evidence that this was deliberately encouraged by the Hitler In Inside the Third Reich Albert Speer writesgtHe Hitler also did not like establishing clear lines of jurisdiction Sometimes he deliberately assigned bureaus to the same or similar tasks That way he used to say the stronger one does the jobHitlers quasiDarwinist thinking in this regard doesnt really seem to work out however and the practical result of the constant bureaucratic struggle was a lot of wasted time money resources and talent due to inefficiency and the unwillingness of ministries to cooperate with each other This definitely would have affected the war effort in terms of logistics,5,cdpoe15,1rprcx,askhistorians,new,29,24
BeamMeUpScotty,Not sure if this  fits your question but there was a lot of rivalry within various commands of the Luftwaffe itself which impeded the war effort The competition between bomber and fighter units is an excellent example Seeing as Hitler saw the Luftwaffe primarily offensive weapon the bomber units took priority until vary late into the war The best pilots were chosen for bomber units and they received the most training even when it was clear to those in the Luftwaffe that aerial defence of Germany was taking precedence over bombing Britain and other Allied centres of manufacturing and military bases Also the fighters units of the RLV were often put under the command of Flak units,0,cdpqnzy,1rprcx,askhistorians,new,3,3

snickeringshadow,If you dont mind spoilers Aztec scholar mike smith wrote a review of the bookhttpworksbepresscomcgiviewcontentcgiarticleampcontextmichaelesmithampseiredir Basically its reasonably accurate but not perfect Jennings does a good job covering the major aspects of Aztec culture and gives the reader a good feel for what life would have been like but many of the details are wrong A few notable errors he makes The Aztec writing system was less flexible than Jennings makes it out to be It could only record a few kinds of information History Yes Financial records yes Personal correspondence probably not The main character is way more liberal with sex than the Aztecs would have been comfortable with  The way he depicts the Tarascans Michoacan is pretty much entirely wrong Smith doesnt talk about it but it did bother me A few of the violent details surrounding human sacrifice and the conquest have been exaggerated for dramatic effect Human sacrifice was brutal and so was the conquest But Jennings kind of goes out of his way to make it gutwrenchingly awful For example he describes the priests raping a sacrifice to Xipe Totec and he describes the conquistadors feeding Indians to their dogs at Cempoala Neither of those things happened  he added them to make it more dramaticIn all Id say its probably  accurate As reasonably accurate as can be expected of a work of fiction,1,cdpnvp3,1rpss5,askhistorians,new,19,18

GeorgyKZhukov,France had a large army at the time and on paper it was possibly the best in Europe They had the numbers and the equipment The problem was that they didnt see the direction warfare was going The generals were still stuck in a mentality gained in World War I Not however the idea of static warfare which people seem to think due to the Maginot Line but rather the tactics of the end phase of the war during the Hundred Days offensiveAs such the French invested in lots of infantry tanks Big slow heavy tanks that were to be distributed throughout the infantry to move with them and supply support While they did have some quality tanks like the SOMUA  they just didnt have enough of them And even if they had more without a serious reevaluation of their deployment the effectiveness would be questionable at best Most French tanks even lacked radiosThey invested in a LOT of artillery Because they believed that it was the key to victory But they didnt foresee the pace that World War II would be fought at Their guns simply couldnt be wielded effectively as the battlefield changed and also since they lacked mobile artillery they couldnt move the guns quickly enough Many of them were of World War I vintageStrategically the French were also lacking While it is not true that the French believed the Maginot Line was going to keep them safe and in fact the purpose of it was to force the Germans to attack to the north of the line the French did make a grave miscalculation in where they expected the German thrust to come Expecting a similar path as that taken during World War I the AngloFrench force was positioned in the northeast of France waiting for the Germans to enter the Low Countries When they did they moved in to Belgium swiftly to counter the Germans But the main German attack was further south through the Ardennes which the French planners had assumed was to rugged for the Germans to move through quickly and consequently had not defended very well This wasnt the case though The Germans swept through and in just over a week the AngloFrench force that had been positioned on the border  the cream of the crop  was cut off from the rest of France The British began evacuating and France soon had no choice but to capitulateAnd thats it in a nutshell France had quantity but not quality They were well prepared for another war fought in the style of October  But what works there didnt work all that well in ,0,cdpp6q0,1rpulu,askhistorians,new,11,11

idjet,I think you are perhaps getting hung up on labels and definitions and we should clarify these so that you can understandCapitalism is very strictly defined as an economic system in terms of how economic value is created and stored profit is a byproduct of that Capitalism is generally viewed as having its origins in the late medieval period when we begin to see the creation of broad markets for labour and goods through the transformation of serfdom and bartering economy to monetary economyIts true that there has always been something for sale whether armour houses and castles However if we look closely at what was for sale in the European medieval period we would see the list of things bought and sold is short and very infrequently transacted The greater portion of the economy was what we would roughly call bartering  this was at the rural and village level In fact even taxes were paid in kind often as part of the harvest Remember that medieval society was predominantly agricultural Yes someone with money could by anything  but money was relatively rare For example there were whole regions of Southern France in year  where there were no mints creating coin  ie money note bartering is used loosely here to allow a short response  some will complainAs such from a modern financial perspective the financial transactions were stunted they have no accumulating value To explain as a farmer or as the noble who enserfed the farmer I could not store my wheat for several years waiting for an increase in the value of the commodity and trade it for charcoal or building limestone a year later  I had to trade it within its life or it goes mouldy I could not speculate in value and make a profit on the difference between my production costs and my sale value when wheat supplies were low Or as an blacksmith I would be working directly in the castle of the lord for whom I work but I am not paid in cash I am fed clothed I have a small home or just a room in the compound As a blacksmith I might also do some metal work for the local farmers because they are tending the lands owned by the noble I work for But I am not paid and neither are they There were large towns where money might be used but the overwhelmingly rural medieval population did not engage economically with cities in substantive cashSo how did this economy change to capitalismThe general idea held in economics is that the transition from feudal economics to capitalism was through the transformation of manorial serfdom to free holding tenanthttpenwikipediaorgwikiHistoryofcapitalismPrehistoryofcapitalism This is a point of argument for some and you may see responses to this post which argue differently But the point is still important this was the moment where the medieval serffarmer no longer paid in kind with his crops but he rented his land from landlord for cash and he could sell his crops at market for cash The landlord could evict him from the land for a higher paying tenant and the farmer could sell his crops for more to those who were willing to pay The farmer could invest in his farm so that it was more productive The landlord could take the cash and invest it where he likes perhaps in speculating in other lands or in other assets Its labour and assets that begin to have value not the crops themselvesAnd this is where we begin to see the fundamentals of capitalism in large scale lending in speculation in transforming serfdom and bartering into labourforwage relationships These things did not exist at large scale until after the medieval period None of this happened fast  there were many places in Europe that remained unaffected by early capitalism for several hundred years And there were transformations in forms of capitalism such as mercantilismhttpenwikipediaorgwikiMerchantcapitalism before we get to modern capitalism as we know itThe essence is that economic relationships transformed into an exchange of capital and capital is abstractly related to actual value And this completely overtook all other economic relationships from   Source Das Kapital Karl Marx ,0,cdpumwf,1rpw94,askhistorians,new,9,9
CanadianAmbassador,I just wrote an undergrad paper about the history of interestusury and can maybe help shed some light on this In Ancient Greece Aristotle was against any form of interest Interest is the cost of borrowing money His reasoning was that because money had no value in itself and was a medium of exchange between two commodities it should not be hoarded Money by itself was not considered wealth It was the physical goods bought that dictated how wealthy a person was This viewpoint has been debated though as being idealistic and not how life actually operated in ancient Greece Aquinas follows in similar tradition with Aristotle except adds the Christian charity idea to the mix Due to the nature of money hoarding it is bad and unnatural You cannot have a capitalist society without leftover money to fund and invest This was backed up by the Catholic Church Again this viewpoint was challenged by specific people but the Catholic Church stood by its stance Big changes didnt start to occur until the Reformation Both Luther after some prodding and Calvin after no prodding both accepted that interest was an acceptable risk that the lender takes over the borrower Prior to the Reformation interest was an unnatural way to create wealth by the scholastics and the Catholic Church Now that is for loan payments Venture Capitalism was not frowned upon and was one of the ways that people who were looking for investment circumvented the sin of usury The Romans did have some forms but usury has always been condemned under the Old testament I did actually ask a question related to this but it has also yet to be answered I am not a historian by any means but I am taking a class on the History of Classical Economics Basically the economics of the world until Marx The reason I dont address Rome and Roman influences is because from what I found the majority of their contributions were in law not economics and therefore out of the scope of my paper To answer the question though if I was being bold and banking ha on the history of venture capital probably the th century is when you could find the beginnings of modern capitalism That is mostly me talking out of my ass From what I read in regarding interest I would put the timeframe at or during the Reformation The backlash that the ban on usury caused the Church to lighten its stance in the th century but the Protestants had been okay with it officially for  years prior The important thing to remember is that capitalism requires surplus money to invest If you put restrictions in place stopping the borrowing process it makes it significantly tougher to engage in capitalist procedure Hope that makes sense I am a couple beers in because I am finally done essays and slightly celebrating Sources will be provided upon request ,2,cdpqycx,1rpw94,askhistorians,new,4,2
Reedstilt,At the time of Old World Contact there were three major polities in Florida and several smaller ones CalusaThe southern half of Florida was under the control of the powerful and expansive Calusa The core Calusa region was center on Charlotte Harbor in southwest Florida with their eponymous capital Calos currently identified as the Mound Key sitehttpenwikipediaorgwikiMoundKeyArcheologicalStatePark but their influence spread eastward to encompass the Mayaimi who lived around Lake Okeechobee the Tequesta of the Keys and modernday Miami and the Jaega near modernday Palm Beach The Ais who lived on the east coast from Cape Canaveral southward to the Jaega who may have been part of the Ais as well were either subjects or allies of the Calusa  the relationship is a bit unclear Additionally Taino refugees from Cuba and likely from elsewhere in the Caribbean since earlier refugees had fled to Cuba first had established communities in southern Florida under the protection of the Calusa dominion before the Spanish arrived on the mainland Until the Spanish negotiated a peace in  the Calusa were at war with Tocobaga who lived around Tampa BayThe Calusa were led by three men First was the paramount chief called the cacique by the Spanish after the Taino title for a similar political position The Calusa word for this rank is probably certepe but thats uncertain as it could refer to village chiefs as well The paramount chief received tribute from Calusa village chiefs and from the leaders of his nonCalusa subjects He also had several wives one each from his nonCalusa subjects for example as well as having a sisterwife according to Spanish chroniclers which probably meant he had one wife from his own clan rather than literally marrying his own sisterThe other two men were the war captain who command the Calusas military specialists and militia on behalf of the paramount chief and the chief priest who oversaw the temples organized important rituals and attended to the religious needs of the paramount chiefs family which he was usually part of The Calusa built canals earthworks to keep their homes above the water during floods and large communal houses and temples The kings house in Calos was said to be large enough that  people could comfortably gather there for councils What makes the size and structure of Calusa society especially interesting is that they made no use of domesticated plants or animals though there ancestors a few centuries earlier probably engaged in some farming The bulk of their diet was composed of seafood though some wild plants were gathered and they made a type of bread from coontiehttpenwikipediaorgwikiCoontie a cycad native to the Southeast Deer were relatively rare in the region and Calusa traded their seafood with people to the north for venison and deer hides In  the Spanish reported that the Calusa or their Tequesta subjects  travelling to Havana to sell fish ambergris fruits turtle shells cardinalshttpenwikipediaorgwikiCardinalbird and other items Such trade likely existed in PreColumbian times between south Florida and Caribbean as wellTimucuaMost of northern Florida minus the panhandle and a large portion of southern Georgia was the realm of the Timucua Unlike the Calusa the Timucua were not unified into a single cohesive nation Instead they had several powerful village and alliances of villages which at the time of Contact were vying among themselves for dominance Each village had its own chief called holata or utina in various Timucua areas For simplicity Ill use holata here The title of holata was inherited matrilineally within the White Deer Clan Clans were ranked and while the White Deer was at the top among the Timucua the relative ranking of the other clans Panther Bear Fish Earth Buzzard and Quail differed between the Timucuan districts The holata had several prominent subordinates The inija was the most important of these who severed as the holatas spokespeson and communicated the holatas orders to others and gather information for the holata The inija was also chosen from the White Deer Clan The holata was also served by two ranked anacotimas and the afetema who seem to have been advisers chosen from the elders of the village Women became holata regularly and when they did so their subordinates were also women The holata oversaw both the secular and religious affairs of the Timucua war however fell to the irriparacusi the war chief also known as the uriutina and possibly just paracusi The irriparacusi had his own entourage of officials ibitano toponole bichara amalachini and itorimitono though their duties are unfortunately unknown The irriparacusi likely inherited their rank as the holata did but thats not certainLike the Calusa the Timucua fished and harvested wild plants But they also hunted and cultivated maize and other domesticated plantsthough not to the extent of their Mississippian neighbors to the north and west Famously the Timucua wore deer disguiseshttpmediawebbritannicacomebmediaFAjpg when hunting Unlike the Calusa however they were quick to adopt Spanish agricultural tools and plantsThe surplus of their hunts were trade south to the Calusa but the most important trade routes went north and west to the Mississippians These trade routes brought down copper greenstone and argillite from the mountains The Timucua also controlled an important chert outcropping in northern Florida which was vital for the production of tools and weapons Chief Utina and his alliance largely controlled this outcropping and the most important trade routes which made him an enemy of other major Timucuan alliances In the s the Timucua would become important middlemen controlling the trade between St Augustine and the nations of the interiorApalacheeThe Apalachee were a small but powerful Mississippian chiefdom located between the Ochlockonee and Aucilla Rivers The Timucuanspeaking Asile who lived east of the Aucilla River were subjects of the Apalachee The Apalachee had two major towns Ivitachuco was the dominant town in the east while Anhayca modernday Tallahassee dominated the west and served as the capital of the whole chiefdom Historically the two towns were ruled by brothers Later in the s political power would shift to Ivitachuco at which time the Apalachee were at war with the Timucua again the Spanish negotiate a peace treaty between the twoNico seems to be their word for paramount chief  Interestingly holata refers to subsidiary chiefs  The Apalachee holatas oversaw major towns which controlled districts and satellite towns within the larger chiefdom The nico and the holatas were the spokespeople for their respective dominions and oversaw ceremonies within them The Apalachee nico was also served by an inija though his role here was to oversee the nicos guards farmland and to serve as a sort of court historian as well as handling trivial daytoday business of the chiefdom The holatas seem to have had inija of their own and the inija were apparently relatives of the holatas Finally the nico had an atequi a translator whose duties extended over other areas where such language skills were importantThe land of Apalachee was an important stop on the trade routes heading west out of the Timucua regions to the Mississippians and was famous throughout Florida for its agricultural productivity That fame was used as bait by other Florida peoples to lure the de Sotos expedition out of their area and encourage them to keep moving onto Anhayca where de Sotos expedition spent its first winter living maize beans squash and other plants cultivated or harvested in the region as well its ample stores of dried venison They grew three types of maize for different purposes a small fastgrowing maize used to quickly replenish their granaries in spring a yellow maize used for hominy and a white maize used for flour They also made flour from a root known as ache which the Spanish said was indistinguishable from flour made from wheat in both versatility and taste Both ache root and the flour made from it were important exports from

gingerkid,gtDid Jewish people not charge interest when loaning other Jewish people money Was interest condemned as usury Or could Jewish people loan to non Jewish people at interestThe answer to all those questions is kind of  Judaism prohibits lending to other Jews at interest  Its a biblical prohibition  However there are several caveats which Ill explain at the end since theyre a bit complexAnyway it wasnt exactly condemned as usury  Usury just isnt a term thats part of Jewish legal thought  There are simply sorts of loans which are prohibited by religious lawwhether something is or isnt usury is irrelevant since for Judaism its not a meaningful categoryJudaism does permit loaning nonJews money at interest  The wording of the biblical prohibition explicitly doesnt include outsiders in the ban  There are some Rabbinic cautions on doing so since its not so far from a prohibited thing but its definitely permittedgtAlso how did this affect relations between Jewish people and Catholics The Catholic Church condemned the charging of interest so would they have tried to stop Jewish people from charging interestThe Catholic church itself didnt try to stop it  Jews were seen as outside the religious prohibitions on the Catholic church so as long as Jews followed any local secular laws the church didnt actually ban it even if they did attempt to discourage it  However this doesnt mean that relations were always good as a consequence  It wasnt uncommon for wealthy debtors to stir up resentment at Jews so theyd be run out of town andor expelled by the government  This would make the loans practically unenforceable  It also could cause resentmentJews were outsiders to society who could hold a significant amount of financial power over someone  This contributed to Jewish stereotypes for centuriesHowever it could also help Jews be welcomed in places  Sometimes the importance of access to capital was acknowledged and having Jews around was seen as a way to improve the economy  This is significant reason why King Casimir of Poland admitted a large number of Jews during the Crusades which is essentially the reason a large Jewish population existed in Eastern EuropeThis articlehttpenwikipediaorgwikiLoansandinterestinJudaism Anyway back togtDid Jewish people not charge interest when loaning other Jewish people moneyThere are several exceptions to the general prohibition  These include Loans between partnerships are generally except from biblical restrictions on loans since the wording usually is specific that the rules are for one person lending to one other person  This is especially important for avoiding problems with loans of all sorts during the Sabbatical year when all loans are void Loans can use some sort of legal fiction to have the same output as charging interest without actually breaking rules These were generally not strenuously objected to by Judaism because the biblical prohibitions seem to be speaking about shortterm loans to the poor to support themselves  So lending at interest in one of these permitted ways wouldnt violate the spirit of the law so long as the letter of it was upheld things that violate the spirit of laws are often prohibited Rabbinically  The ability of poor people to have access to money so they dont starve is a concern in several biblical laws  The one that comes to mind is the requirement to pay hired labor on the same day that they work so they dont have to wait to get the money required to support themselvesHowever that doesnt mean interestfree lending didnt happen  An important part of Jewish society historically was the Gemach short for gimilut chasadim meaning acts of kindness  These lend money to people for various purposes without interest  They are a legal loan that is enforceable and generally has cosigners its just interest free  This means that the loan pool can continue though donations are required to keep it up with inflation  In the US these are usually called Hebrew Free Loan Societies,0,cdpr14l,1rq26b,askhistorians,new,9,9

DeletedByMods,Generally as the federal government became more powerful  states rights became more and more of an issue because the states were losing more and more to power to the federal government  There are obviously early examples besides slavery but it really gained steam as a reaction against the federal governments use of the commerce clause to expand its power during the progressive eraIssues that traditionally would have been statelevel issues became legislated under federal law through the commerce clause and thats what gave a new head of steam to the states rights movement  This shift in power away from the states really came in as a result of the progressive movement in the early s but it was as much a consequence of advancing communication technology as it was a consequence of the politics of the time,0,cdq2290,1rq7q0,askhistorians,new,1,1
Steel,Sovereign Immunity Way bigger issue than slavery when it comes to states rights Slavery was a uniquely American institution A relative newcomer to economic paradigms compared to other bedrock common law concepts Sovereign immunity was THE big prize It ensured that states could retain a sense of well Sovereignty Individualism SelfRule Keeping foreigners from mucking about in our affairs was one of the big ticket items we revolted to protect And although the states were more or less united in this they were still fiercely independent In  Chisolm the executor of the estate of Farquar sued the state of Georgia for debts incurred during the Revolutionary War The case was brought under Article III section  of the US Constitution which granted federal courts jurisdiction over disputes between a state and the citizens of another state Georgia disagreeing with this provision and given the Supreme Courts lack of prestige during this time period didnt even show up to the oral argument Naturally the Court sided with the plaintiff Outrage ensued amongst the several States and shortly thereafter the th amendment was ratified in  which served to reverse the Courts decision in Chisolm v GA The th isnt absolute but it is definitely a major victory for states ,0,cdq2pd2,1rq7q0,askhistorians,new,1,1

bemonk,A few reasons In the th Century there was an Austroslavic movement to protect Slavic interests against Austrian German interests Both Slovaks and Czechs and some Yugoslavs were in this movement together At the outbreak of WWI It wasnt just Masaryk Czech but Slovaks like Rastislav Štefánik that were pushing for independence of a unified Czechoslovakia  Czechs had a huge industrial base while Slovaks were much more rural and agrarian I think Slovaks realized they would be better off with the much wealthier Czechs Also Czechs had been independent  years before For Slovaks it was more like  years Slovakia just didnt have as strong of a claim for independence than they did together as Czechoslovakia In the Treaty of SaintGermain sort of like the Versailles treaty but for AustriaHungary instead of Germany when Hungary was given independence and the real union with Austria terminated This treaty also had a certain philosophy about it to end majority rule in the former Empire The way they did this was to break up the borders among ethnic lines It wasnt perfect but Polish parts were given back to Poland German speaking parts of Hungary were added to Austria Bukovina went to Romania so on and so on and Czechoslovakia became independentAustrians and Hungarians both had been pretty harsh at times to minorities in their countries The Allies saw this as a way to reduce the likelihood of further ethnic strife in the region It was also I would argue at least punitive to Hungary The majority of Slovaks themselves wanted this The Slovak people also were far less supportive of the idea of independence in  than the government wasTLDR Slovakia was extremely rural while Czech had a large industrial base Slovakia hadnt been independent for a millennium Hungary reduced to  of its formal size on all sides not just Slovakia by the treaty after WWI,7,cdpylun,1rqafy,askhistorians,new,18,11

mormengil,Acadia had been French until  when it was conquered by Britain during Queen Annes war  The British were worried about the loyalty of the Acadians in subsequent wars and finally expelled them from Acadia in  when circa  Acadians were deported  After this there was little remaining French population or heritage in AcadiaMany of the people who replaced the departed Acadians were from New England and some of this population formed a sizable minority in favor of Independence from Britain during the American Revolution  They tried and failed to take Fort Cumberland and move some or all of the Nova Scotia colony into the Revolutionary campBy the war of  however the demographics of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had changed   British Empire loyalists fled the US during and after the Revolution to settle in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick  This made the overwhelming majority of the population Loyalist with no interest in joining the Americans in the War of Source  httpenwikipediaorgwikiUnitedEmpireLoyalist,0,cdptc13,1rqeoi,askhistorians,new,5,5
ghotipop,Im not an expert on Acadia but Ill answer why Quebec did not turn on Britain during the War of IndependenceWar of   The first thing that you have to remember is that by the s many Quebecois did not think of themselves as French just as many Americans did not think of themselves as British  The Quebecois were in no real rush to restore French rule over New France  The other thing was that Britain had ingratiated themselves with most Quebecois after the passing of the Quebec Act in   the Quebec Act almost doubled the size of Quebec ensured the free practice of Catholicism and ensured that Quebec would retain its civil law code which it still does today  During the War of Independence the Quebecois felt that the British would be more accepting than the Americans of their culture  During the War of  the reasoning was still more or less the same,0,cdq05ma,1rqeoi,askhistorians,new,2,2
