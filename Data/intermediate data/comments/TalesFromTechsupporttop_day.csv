cmanyall,It would probably be worth your time to make a backup anyway when they say they have one already and then later on charge them ridiculous amounts for it if they turn out to need it but that would be ethically questionable,6,cdp7z11,1ro8ur,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,37,31

Koras,I had a friend at uni who harped on constantly about needing backups despite the fact I told him repeatedly that I keep a portable drive and a dropbox account that I use purely for backing what little important stuff I have his computer died he lost everythingTurns out the entire time he was backing up files from his computers only hard drive on his computers only hard drive So yknow if his computers hard drive died hed always have a copy of all of his files on his oh,0,cdphh3a,1ro8ur,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,13,13
hicow,Id back it up anyway Even if I know a machine is backed up I pull a fresh backup before I wipe a disk For certain procedures I do at work I back up data two different ways  one is easier to restore but harder to get to the other is a pain to restore but close at handIn this sort of situation I wouldnt charge to do the backup obviously but itd be at least double rate to restore said backup And very clearly laid out as to why theyre paying double to get said data back,0,cdpbkfa,1ro8ur,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,11,11
JNoel,Ive run into this problem several times and have since decided to always make a disk image backup whether the customer thinks he needs it or not I use a program called Drive Snapshot The program doesnt require installation and it has good compression After I reinstall Windows I put the disk image file in a folder on the C drive called Backup I tell the customer that all of their old stuff is sealed in this file and that if they realize later that they need something I can get it back for them I dont charge for the disk image but I do charge for the data retrieval from the image Doing this has saved me so many headaches ,0,cdpgtg6,1ro8ur,TalesFromTechsupport,top_day,3,3
