ctm29070,279,,2217,19760w,,5035,"Last Thursday, we experienced a lot of snow and freezing rain. I was driving home cautiously since the road were unplowed and in very bad condition. Naturally, a person zips right behind me and begins to tailgate me. I am not going to speed up and risk killing myself or others, so I maintain a safe speed. The tailgater begins to honk at me, repeatedly, even as we pass multiple people stuck in the snow on the side of the road. 

After tailgating and honking incessantly at me for a solid five minutes, he zooms past me and barrels down the road. Not 100 meters ahead, he reaches a sharp turn, loses his traction, and slides straight into a snowbank. He immediately tries to back out of it, but his tires spin uselessly in the snow. He jumps out of his car and flags me down for help (I am driving a truck and I am sure he got a good look at the winch on the back of it while tailgating me).

I stop my truck and he makes a visible gesture of relief. I lay on my horn for about 10 seconds, and drive off. ",I never knew revenge so petty could feel so good. ,7252,pettyrevenge

An elderly lady in front of him asked for a single stamp.

TheCannibalLector,283,,443,12oe1y,,4463,"12 years ago, when I was in 10th grade, my sister (who was 8 at the time) built a giant snowman after an unusually heavy Pennsylvania snow.  She spent all day on this thing and it was actually pretty impressive.  

The town I'm from is actually a borough and it only has something like 7,000 people who live there, meaning High School classes were small and relatively tight-knit.  There was one particular kid, who I'll call Scotty, who drove me up the fucking wall.  He never did anything to me personally, but he just had a massively annoying way about him.  To make matters worse, it seemed as if I had way too many classes with him to be statistically possible.

One of Scotty's irritating behaviors is that he drove a loud, redneck-ish, John-Deere-green truck.  It was obnoxious as hell and (important to the story later) had a huge brush guard on the front of it.    

Well, on the evening after she built her snowy sentinel, I heard the sound of Scotty's truck making its way down the street from inside our livingroom.  Then I heard the ""pfft"" of someone running over a snowman and laughing.  Unfortunately for my sister, she had built it close to the road and too easily within the range of this semi-guided asshole.  She was rather upset to see her day's work splattered all over the street...  Something needed to be done about this.

So, the next morning, I woke up early and began building another snowman.  It was glorious.  I made the classic, three section, scarf-wearing, sticks-for-arms-and-vegetables-for-a-face snowman.

This new snowman's cheery countenance betrayed a grim and dark secret, however; Frosty was built on top of a fire hydrant at the corner of our yard where there was no curb.

For a good two days I dreamt of Scotty wrapping his stupid truck around my masterpiece out in the yard.  But no dice.  I didn't see him at all anywhere around town so I thought I was out of luck.

Then, on the evening of the 4th day, I heard it.  My family was eating dinner and I heard the low grumble of fate's motors kicking from gear to gear.  Would they find themselves abruptly halted in about 10 seconds?  It all depends on you, Scotty boy...

So I start chewing my food really fast because, knowing the idiot, I knew what was happening next.  The final acceleration sounded off like a chaotic crescendo as he plowed straight into—not through—the snowman with the deafening crunch of twisting metal.

My family ran outside and it took everything I had to not laugh before I got out there.  There stood Scotty, dazed and bewildered and caught-off guard by a battle that he lost before he realized it had begun. ","Run-over Another Snowman, Jackass—I can build these all day.",4906,pettyrevenge
Strange_Bedfellow,226,,1504,1d5y93,,4113,"This took place in a golf tournament I was playing in a few years ago. 

There was a long drive contest on the 18th hole. The way a long drive competition works in a tournament is there is a little marker with a pad of paper on it out in the fairway. If you hit your ball in the fairway past the marker, you sign the paper, and place the marker next to where your ball was. It's an honor system sort of thing, but then again, that's golf for you.

I was in the second-to-last group, one of my good friends was in the group behind me. I step up to the tee, tee up, and free the beast all over that golf ball. By some fluke, it ends up drawing down the right side of the fairway. I crushed this thing. Based on yardage left, I hit this ball a little over 330 yards. I had the previous long drive beat by almost 20 yards. I happily signed the marker, and put it next to my ball.

After I finished the hole, I walked off the green, and watched the foursome behind us tee off and play the hole in. You know, waiting for my friend, and to see if anybody beat my drive. Now, the men's tee box that we were supposed to play from was on the left side of the hole, and the ladies was 40 or so yards up and on the right side of the hole. I saw one of the guys tee up from the ladies tee, hit his drive, walk up, sign the marker, and move it to his ball. That shit ain't right.

They finish the hole, and my friend comes up to me and confirms my suspicions. This chucklefuck had hit from the ladies tee and taken my long drive. He beat me by two yards. I went up to the asshole, and had this conversation with him.

Me: ""Are you really going to take that drive?""

Him: ""Yep.""

Me: ""That's cheating, chief. You didn't win.""

Him: ""Do you have any proof?""

Well, fuck. It's his word against mine. The other guys in his foursome are his friends. My jimmies are at maximum overrustle.

We go to the post-tournament dinner. Sure enough, when they call the long drive winner up, this smug fucknut goes up and collects his (my) $50 Tim Hortons gift card. 

Oh, but what's this? He dropped something when he stood up. It's his door prize raffle ticket. It's number 77. Well, I'm just going to take this, you know, for my troubles. I lean over in my chair, and snag it off the floor

An hour later, we're at the final prize. It's the door prize draw. The prize?
 A $1000 MasterCard prepaid gift card. The MC rifles through the drum with the tickets. The universe must have been on my side that day, because the MC pulls out a ticket, and speaks into the microphone.

""The winner of the MasterCard prepaid card is... Ticket 77.""

Asshole McTerribleperson loses his shit. He's jumping up and down, yelling ""I won I won I won ohmygod I won!""

He runs up to the front to the MC, who then asks for the winning ticket. Fuckface sticks his hand in his back pocket. Then his other back pocket. Then the side pockets. His face looks like he just watched his dog just get run over. Repeatedly.

I'm crazy excited at this point, but I make a show of checking my ticket. Then I hold up the ticket and call out,

""I got it!""

I run up to the front, and give it to the MC. 

Douchebag McGee isn't happy about this. He starts yelling about how I stole his ticket and ticket 77 was totally his and I'm a cheater and a liar.

I look him dead in the eyes, and ask him deadpan ""do you have any proof?""

He looks like he's about to cry. The MC sends him to sit down, and I collect the $1000 dollar gift card.

Because I'm the type to salt the wound, as I leave, I walk past his table, and say quietly to him ""Enjoy your Tim card. You deserve it."" 

Pretty sure he popped a blood vessel. But I didn't stick around to find out. I had beers to buy for my friends.

I wait for the car leaving the spot to exit, turn signal on.  He leaves and as I begin to pull in, someone whips out from behind me and makes it into the spot before I can, almost hitting my car in the process and scaring the shit out of me.

But he moved so quickly to get my spot that he ended up parking crookedly and couldn't exit his car.

So I just pulled up behind him.  Now he couldn't adjust.  And he was too heavy to climb across to the passenger door, though he did attempt it.

He was giving me the middle finger and shouting at me to move so he could readjust.  I literally stayed there for 15 minutes (to my roommate's annoyance) until he called security who asked me to move.

DorkJedi,325,,2018,1cgr2o,,3978,"I guess this belongs here. I got petty revenge by merely existing....

At a past job I had a long commute. It was 62 miles door to door. To save money I bought an early 80's Rabbit Diesel from an old man for $2000. 40MPG and it ran like a top.  
However, it was gutless, and some of this commute was through the foothills of the Colorado Front Range. Some of the larger hills would slow my top speed to about 50 on this 70MPH Interstate. I can handle this just fine, especially with the money it saved me.  

However, even though this is a three lane hiway and I kept to the right 100% of the time (never even tried to pass people on the very rare occasion it was an option) some people would still honk angrily or flip me off when they came up behind me. I was somehow inconveniencing them to force them to pass. Bear in mind my shift did not make me commute in rush hours... there was little to no traffic. 
One guy lost his everloving mind. Honking and flipping me off, he paced in the next lane becide me for a while- foaming and spitting, screaming and using every rude gesture in the book. Completely lost it. Then he moved on.  
 A few minutes later I arrive at work, and my boss asks me to sit in on a interview as the tech interviewer. I settle in and wait. The first smiling candidate that walks in, looks at me, and loses his smile. It is Mr Foaming Nutbag!

 In elementary school I wasn't the most popular kid, I was into books, had big glasses, into video games, got very grades, classic nerd. I had friends sure, but I did tend to be the butt of the classic ""nerdy-kid"" jokes.

One day in class we were doing some sort of busy work and I was seated across from one of the girls (let's call her BitchJ) who always loved to make fun of me and give me crap. The girl for some reason was stamping her feet up and down on the floor like a crazy person (not just the nervous knee thing that most people get from time to time, full on lifting and dropping them fuckers). 

The massive shockwaves from her dinosaur stomping ending up knocking her glasses off the desk and somewhere right beneath her feet. Being the good guy that I was, I immediately yelled out ""BitchJ, STOP, WATCH YOUR FEET!"". She stops her foot, a few inches from her glasses, then looks at me and just asks, ""Why?"".

Now I could have told her that she was about to ruin her glasses, but for some reason I didn't. I happened to not be wearing my own glasses at the time, and on a lark I told her, ""You're about to step on my glasses"". 

The bitch got the biggest grin on her face, lifted her foot back up and smashed it back down onto her own glasses. BitchJ heard them crack and bent down to pick the glasses up, still grinning at me without breaking her gaze. When she lifted the glasses up and looked at them, and realized they were her own, she started crying, loudly. Ran to the teacher.

CFO422,450,,3718,1jcebe,,3334,"There's this Facebook group I'm part of. There are some close friends in there, that's why I'm there. There are about 25 people in this group, five of which are good friends. The group plans all kinds of things; parties, friendly soccer tournaments, clubbing and whatnot. There's this guy, let's call him Steve. Steve thinks he's the alpha male of the group. He uses performance enhancing drugs to be 'a beast' in the gym. This guy completely flipped out towards his sister on Facebook, because she expressed her concern towards his drug use. It was very verbal and extremely rude. He also stole an iPhone 5 last weekend, that's Steve. I don't know if any people in the Facebook group actually like him, but he's there for most of our events. Now I have zero respect for assholes like him, but one rotten apple in a group of 25 is not going to ruin anything for me, so I put up with it. He once hysterically laughed at me while working out at the gym because I was struggling. It was my first week. It demotivated me, but I started saving up towards revenge. This was about a year ago, fast forward to last week. He proudly links to a status update on Facebook, through the group. It's an irrelevant update of him, containing the word 'cancer.' It was something like ""I had a cancer-hard workout this morning"". In our native language it sounds better, 'cancer' is sometimes used as an adjective. 

Some girl I don't know commented on his status asking him why he had to use the word 'cancer'. He starts raging towards this girl, as per usual. He uses the word even more, because he is an alpha male of course. For no apparent reason he flips out completely. 

The girl then states she is suffering from cancer for the second time. Even though I know this asshole, I presumed he'd stop after that. He didn't. He literally stated she might as well be dead and the cancer should ideally spread to her entire family. 

He proudly links this to the entire group. There are mixed reactions, but most of the people think he crossed the line. The subject is dropped soon and everyone starts talking about something else. But I couldn't leave it at that. I wanted revenge, for myself but especially for that poor girl with cancer. I took screenshots of his comments and saved them.

And friday, the perfect opportunity for revenge presented itself. He posted in the group that he was invited for a job interview at a local company. I'm not sure if I crossed the line with the following, but I stand by what I did. I printed out the screenshots onto paper, put them in an envelope, and sent them to the small business where he was to be interviewed for a job. I anonymously addressed them to the personnel manager. 

He made another status this morning. When he showed up for the interview, the interviewer showed him the screenshots and told him this was no behaviour he'd tolerate in this business. Steve went batshit crazy again and he said he knew it had to be someone from the group. Many people laughed and that made him quit the group and unfriend everyone.

I've been smiling the entire day. That asshole had it coming.

Radijs,248,,1801,1cj0wl,,3323,"A little over a year ago I had just gotten my motorcycle license and I was on my way home.

I wasn't driving particularly fast, just some 5-10 kph over the speed limit, pretty normal.

Up behind me comes a car tearing up the asphalt. But I'm not in a hurry, my bike is new and I'm not gonna risk a ticket just cause this guy is in a hurry.

He starts to come up really really close behind me. Just a meter or two between his front bumper and my rear wheel. So now he's driving dangerously and putting me at risk. So I move over to the right side of the lane and give him room to pass figuring he'll go on on his jerkish way and be done with it.

Well...nope! He passes me and then slows down in front of me, and starts to break at random basically trying to tick me off even more.
At the next traffic light I tell the guy how dangerous his driving was and that he should quit it. Apparently I shouldn't have because he flips his lid and starts opening his car door, probably to give me a good kicking.

Thankfully the light turns green, I gun the engine, now really thinking ""fuck traffic regulations this guy's dangerous!"" Of course motorcycle in dense traffic beats a car no matter how nuts the driver is so I get away.

Later that evening I'm doing grocery shopping, no longer in my biking clothes and guess who I see at the checkout lane next to me? Yeah it's the asshole.

I'm out of the store before him and heeey, there's his car... And I happen to have found an old parking ticket on the ground. Rather then keying his car I slide the paper underneath his windshield and keep my distance, I'm gonna enjoy this little bit of payback....

And oh boy did I! Not only did he completely flip his shit about the ticket ( Which btw has a diffrent plate number on it but apparently he's blind with rage ).

Bonus points because there's 2 cops nearby. The asshole stomps over to them and begins to rant and curse and swear at them like there's no tomorrow. At first the officers try to calm him down but this guy's fucking nuts. So after a minute or so the officers have enough, perform the most beautiful takedown I've seen in my life and put the cuffs on him, he gets stuffed in the back of the van and hauled off to the station.

TL;DR: I give an asshole driver a fake parking ticket. Guy flips his lid and gets arrested for it.

Edit 2: Most of you have enjoyed this story immensely, but reasonably there have been a few comments that say that I made this up. I'll admit readily that it's a pretty incredulous story and I'm glad I can enjoy telling it now.

I do think it's unfortunate that this happened though. The revenge is sweet but the dangerous situations on the road are most definately not. Motorcyclists are vulnerable parties in traffic and dangerous driving like this can lead to horrible accidents. So I would definately prefer that this situation had never ocurred to begin with and I wouldn't wish this kind of situation to happen to anyone.","Here, have a parking ticket!",5124,pettyrevenge
msingerman,214,,1501,1euxnt,,3112,"This story dates from last June.  I was headed to San Diego for a conference.  The night before, I went out for some drinks with a coworker who would also be there.  A few drinks turned into us pretty much closing down the bar.  When I woke up at 6:30 later that morning, I actually felt great - I figured I must have drunk my way through the hangover!  This was of course a very stupid thought, and as the morning dragged on through getting to the airport, getting through security, and waiting at the gate, my head decided I am an idiot and deserve to be punished.  It was not wrong.

I made my way through the plane to my row, where I was to be seated in the window (a personal preference).  As I approached my row, I saw a woman sitting in the middle seat, with her belongings on my seat.  I politely said that it was my seat and waited for her to move them.  She let out an overly-large sigh, then laboriously moved her things onto her lap.  She then sat there.  And sat.  I asked her if she would mind letting me by, and she said the oddest thing:

""Go over me.""

Now at first, I assumed that this was my fault.  I assumed that in my awful, terrible hangover, I had forgotten how people board cramped seats and that I was wrong for assuming she would and should get up to let me in.  But then I remembered, I'm an idiot.  So I assumed she had some sort of physical disability which made standing and sitting difficult or painful for her, and rather than embarrass her I did as she requested, I went over her.

Shortly before takeoff, she stood up and hollered at her husband, who was in the back of the plane with their two children:

""I don't know why you couldn't get us seats together!  Honestly, this is absurd, why didn't you?!""

Lady, I got an idea why.

I didn't really care about her constantly reshuffling things or her armrest-hogging.  It did bum me out when her daughter came up to our row with a cheese and cracker platter and asker her mom if she wanted some and the lady simply said ""No.""  Eventually, I was able to fall asleep.

For those who don't drink, there is a phenomenon called the beer shits.  After a night of heavy drinking, you will often have a large amount of gas (and other things which go along with it) the next day.  About halfway through out flight, I felt this coming on, and I decided I had no choice but to go.  I asked her if I could please get out.  The gentleman in the aisle seat immediately got out, but she again said:

""Go over me.""

Now by this point, I was pretty irritable.  I had an awful headache, my stomach was doing somersaults, and I was about to blow an O-ring, and this miserable bitch wanted me to go over her?  On a moving plane?  Fine, I would.  I swung my right leg over her, then put my ass over her face, nearly touching.  A slight tremble in the flight, and I released a full-on, seemingly never ending fart, a cloud of noxious gas which should have had me arrested for war crimes.  I let the whole thing go.  Afterwards, I turned, made full eye contact, and said ""Sorry.  Turbulence.""  Everyone around me was fully and truly disgusted, and to them I am still so sorry, but I did what I did for the greater good.

When I got back from the bathroom, she got up to let me in.","Really, I just wanted to get to the restroom.",4613,pettyrevenge

I flew in from Canada (my residence at the time) because this partner company was so important to our development in a product we were releasing. I prepared for about 2 weeks with our team and made the client aware that I was traveling abroad and looking forward to the 2 hours we had to go through fine details. Everything was confirmed, everyone was excited.

I landed in LA the day before, prepped, drove across town about 2 hour morning commute. Got to his office and sat in the waiting room while the admin told me he would be along shortly. I sat and sat...and sat. Finally she came out and told me that ""Lou"" had another meeting come up and apologized but couldn't make it. She would be happy to take any materials I had so he could review.

I reiterated how far I had traveled, that it was confirmed (at great expense) on several occasions. She said ""so sorry"".

He never showed up and then didn't respond to an email I sent for about 2 weeks where I showed my disappointment. H

is response was one **curt** line explaining his no-show.

Wouldn't you know it his resume ended up in my desk. I told our admin (the entire back story) and to make sure to book the interview, he didn't know it was me that was first interviewer.

He told her that he would love to interview in LA where he lives, but unfortunately we said that he would have to make his way to NY if he was truly interested.

Well I guess he was. He flew all the way to NY and drove out to Long Island where my admin made him wait for 1 hour before informing him that I was unfortunately unable to make it and we would have to reschedule. So Sorry. I was chuckling about this from my office (In LA).

He emailed me and was VERY UPSET, to which I did not respond for a week (I couldn't wait a whole 2 weeks).

My response was verbatim, ""Apologies, but when my CEO calls, I go. Sorry""

I expected a long winded email back from him, but no - he simply said ""**Fuck You**"". It made me so happy and our company still laughs about it.

You know the scam. Whine about perfectly good food to get some sort of comp.
In their old age, my parents befriended another older couple who would pull this stunt everywhere they went. After my mother told me a few stories about how their new friends had shown them how to get discounted or free meals, I felt like I was suddenly the responsible adult, concerned about the bad influence these people were on my parents. While visiting my parents with my girlfriend, this other couple attended dinner with us. As I expected, the food was brought to the table and they immediately began dramatically complaining to one another about the quality/taste/temperature/etc. They were making a scene in order to attract the attention of the waitress. When our waitress returned to ask how we were doing, the miserable old bastard who played the lead role in their act took a deep breathe, struck a dramatic pose (with his hand raised to begin gesticulating for emphasis) and bega--I leaned forward and cut him off before he could finish the first word: ""Everything is absolutely fantastic. It's all great! Thank you very much!"" She smiled, and began her obligatory ""Great, well if you need any--"" when he made a second attempt. ""We come here all the time an--"". I didn't acknowledge that he was speaking at all, repeated that all was just as we ordered and thank her again. He was stunned and thrown off from his routine by my interruption. During this pause the waitress walked away (It seemed clear that she knew what they were trying to accomplish). He turned bright red. I turned to my girlfriend and, smiling and without lowering my voice, stated how pitiful it is that some people could be dishonest, deceitful and put at risk the livelihood of a cook, server or hostess for a pathetic discount or a free early-bird special.

For whatever reason, in a totally empty waiting room, they come and sit very close to me, over in the corner in a little alcove or whatever near a table with a bunch of magazines and coloring books on it. Before anyone says ""well no shit they came and sat near the coloring books"", there was more than one table like this in that waiting room

Ok so the mom is sitting across from me and the kid is next to her and in between us are these magazines and all that and some crayons and just junk on the table. Well I'm reading a magazine and the kid picks up a magazine that is obviously not something he's interested in, like the Economist or something. I turn a page in mine, he turns one in his. I sigh, he sighs. I move my leg, he moves his leg. I pick up another magazine, he picks up another magazine. He's copying me, in other words

So at first this was vaguely amusing, but then the longer it went on the less funny it got. Obviously I'm tired of waiting for my dog, ready to leave, etc, and this kid is mimicking everything I do with this shit eating grin on his face like he's got me and there's nothing I can do about it

Eventually it gets so that he's mocking my eye movements and facial expressions, stuff like that. I look over at the mom with a look of ""are you really going to just let your kid do this for 15 min straight to a total stranger?"" kind of in disbelief, and she's smiling at him like he's the most amazing kid in the world and clearly encouraging him to mock me some more

Up until this point, not a single word has been spoken between the 3 of us, its all non-verbal communication. But it was clear (to me anyway lol) that the kid was a brat, I wasn't in the mood, and the mom was over indulgent of him and something had to be done to right the balance of the universe

By this time it was obvious to the kid I was annoyed and I had been sitting totally still not doing anything for a minute or two while I thought this through, so he was afraid his game was over I guess. So finally I moved my arm with elaborate non-chalance and he got this huge grin on his face like ""fuck yeah! this guy still hasn't figured out i'm the king of this waiting room!"" and he mimics my arm movement very obviously

So then i reach over and get a coloring book. He gets a coloring book. I get a crayon, he gets a crayon. I slowly take the paper wrapper off the crayon, he take his wrapper off his crayon. He shoots his mom a jubilant glance once in awhile and she beams back at him like he's a good boy and is taking his first crap in the adult toilet or something

So i'm sitting there with this crayon and he's sitting there with his, waiting to mock me more, and the mom is looking on waiting to see how special and brilliant her child is going to be, and then i stick the crayon in my mouth and start chewing. 

Only not really, I palmed it and was making these exaggerated chewing motions with my jaw like ""OMG this crayon is SO good!"" with this look on my face like I was loving it. So then boy wonder stuffs his crayon in his mouth for real and starts going to town on it, bits of wax all in his teeth and shit, it was glorious

Finally mom springs into action and snatches him up by one arm and starts smacking his ass with the other hand, clearly furious, while staring at me the whole time like she wishes she was hitting *me*. I stare back with the shit-eating grin I just learned from her 5 year old. Then after about 5 smacks, she grabs the crying child and storms out of the vet's office in a huff

I have no idea what they were even there for, since they left without getting it, but I like to think that they went home with a little lesson in waiting room etiquette and I left with my (very) petty revenge and my loyal dog",Very Petty Revenge on Bratty Child in Waiting Room,4256,pettyrevenge
swinebone,198,,761,1akknu,,2935,"I'm in graduate school and my paying job is as a behavioral therapist for a few families that have kids with autism. I often take my clients out to the local mall or whatever to engage them with the community.

One of my clients, ""Sean,"" has been diagnosed with both autism and a rare chromosomal abnormality. He's nonverbal and has severe physical and mental handicaps, but the dude is seriously one of the coolest people ever. He's obsessed with one of the department stores in the mall that employs pianists. I've spent hours sitting by the piano and listening to them play, which is fine because it's easy money for me and it's probably his most favorite thing ever to do.

The other week we were in there hanging out. ""Sean"" is standing up and rocking back and forth on his feet, clapping and squealing to himself at times. He may have been a little louder than the average customer, but it was a busy Thursday afternoon and he wasn't being disruptive in any way.

Lo and behold, a random woman comes up behind me and taps me forcefully on my shoulder. She tells me that Sean is being way too loud, for which I immediately politely apologize for. She continues to say that ""people like 'Sean' shouldn't be out in public"" and I ""should be ashamed to have a child like that.""

A few minutes later, the woman returns with her children and strikes up a short conversation with the pianist. Most of the pianists are elderly women that are just there to get out of the house, and since Sean and I are there all the bloody time I know them all by name and they often sit down with us during their breaks for small talk.

The woman asks the pianist if some of her brood could play on the piano, as her oldest is ""just *the* talk of her art school"" and is ""incredibly brilliant at the piano for her age level!"" The pianist looked her dead in the eye and said, ""I'm sorry, but we try not to encourage rude behavior in our stores. Perhaps children as brilliant as yours shouldn't be out in public?""

As the woman stood there stunned, the pianist turned to Sean and gave him a high five.",Revenge on a rude and obnoxious parent,3696,pettyrevenge
GSXR450x,138,,1303,1igw0f,,2794,"**Background**:

I worked at a busy Waterpark similiar to Six Flags as a lifeguard/attendant. It was the middle of summer, there were thousands of people in the park, and good 'camping/setup' spots where limited by lunch time.

**Situation**:

While lifeguarding over a fake beach/wave pool, we were periodically required to tell customers on the dining table that the seating was short term seating only, while they eat their food etc. Otherwise people leave there towels and bags over every table, and flip out if anyone tries to eat at 'their table'

Most people are cool and clear out after eating, freeing it up for the next customers. These tables are constantly packed when it's busy.

One lady has decided that she'll pull 2 tables, and 8 chairs together, spread all her stuff around, and start reading a book (with a coffee). This is incredibly rude, and pisses a lot of customers off (rightly so).

So after the waves turn off (20 min on, 10 off) I do the walk through with the same speal ""Limited seating, appreciate if you could free up once you're finished your meals etc etc"" I get to this lady who says:

""Im drinking a coffee""

""I understand, but you can't really set up 'base' here, we keep the dining tables free for people with food to have somewhere to eat. There are plenty of spaces here, here n here""

""yeah, thanks...""

Another half hour goes, I go through the tables again, same speal etc, get to this lady.

""Sorry Ma'am, but I really have to ask you to move on shortly, you've taken up 8 seats and 2 tables for the last hour while only occupying one...""

""I'm reading a book! Get your manager if you have a problem, show some initiative! (She actually said that...)""

So call the duty manager over, he has a chat, calms her down, comes back to me and says ""She claims to have a heart problem and can't walk around much or be in the heat etc, so just let her be""

Not a problem, I'm not going to harass a lady with a *cough* heart problem, and the Manager is cool with it so I dont care.


**Revenge**:

About 3 hours later I was rotated on one of the more popular group waterslides. The lineup was over an hour.

Low and behold, look who it is! The same lady, with some of her friends.

She gets to the front of the line, attempts to step into the ride:

""Sorry Ma'am, unfortunately I can't let you ride this today""

""Why not!??!""

""As it's a 'thrill' ride, people with heart conditions aren't permitted to ride"" (not entirely true, they are just not advised to ride, I wasn't going to tell her this though)

""I don't have a heart condition!""

""I'm sorry if I was misinformed, but I've been notified that you have a heart condition, and so really wouldn't feel comfortable putting you in this situation, risking it etc, your friends are fine to go though!""

They all took off yelling and laughing etc

""This is b.s! I want to speak to your manager!""

""Certainly""

I radio'd to the Manager, briefly let him know the situation, and heard the amusement in his voice when he said he'll be around soon.

She waited another 30 mins standing at the top of this line, only to be greeted by, guess who, the same Manager she claimed she had the heart condition to. While putting on his incredibly sincere and concerned voice, told her how he couldnt possibly risk putting her in a situation like this, opening them up for court action etc. She tried pleading to him that she didn't really have a heart condition, and how it was something else etc.

vinnyredm,173,,704,1cw1cx,,2723,"When I was in college, my roommate and I were both engineers. This meant lots of tests/quizzes/labs on Fridays. The guys that lived below us were in one of the several colleges (I don't know which one) that had no class on Fridays, and so would hold parties almost every Thursday night. Obviously, not an ideal situation for us. Conversations with the downstairs neighbors resulted in near fisticuffs, so we decided another tact was required.

My roommate and I were climbers, we would go camping/climbing frequently, and after one particularly loud Thursday party, we were set to head out. My roommate, the acoustical engineer, brought in several impressive looking speakers from his lab along with some acoustical foam. We used the foam to ""soundproof"" the front door and we hooked the speakers up up, laid them down on the floor, face down, cranked the volume to max, and just before we left on Friday at about two, we hit play on a 5 second loop of ""Achy Breaky Heart."" ""Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart,"" repeat, repeat, repeat.

We returned about 50 hours later to death threats on the door. It appears that because we put the speakers face down and because of the acoustical foam, the noise was nearly inaudible at our front door, so the Police would not make entry, and the super was never available on weekends. So they got 50 full hours of achy break heart. 

We negotiated a ceasefire. No more parties past midnight on Sunday through Thursday in exchange for no more weekends of Billy Ray.

TL;DR - You throw a party before my test, you get Billy Ray Cyrus for the whole weekend.

Decyde,543,,1820,1kcno0,,2689,"Someone told me to cross post my comment here from yesterday.

A couple of kids who lived in my neighborhood who were around 10-12 years old kicked my cat while it was laying out in front of my porch sun bathing.  I was looking out the window while I saw them walk by and do it and when I opened the door, they took off running.  My cat limped up onto the porch and I could obvious tell it was hurt so I took it up to the vet who gave it an x-ray and confirmed she had a couple broken ribs but no internal organ damage.

This whole thing happened at about 4:30 pm and I ended up getting home at 7:00 pm.  When I got home, I put Bonkers in the house and went down to talk to the kids parents about what they did.  They told me that their kids wouldn't do something like that and I must have been mistaken.  I told them that I wasn't and I wanted to make sure they were disciplined for what they did.  She told me again that her kids wouldn't' do something like that so I went home and called the police.

The police came and got my statement and talked to the parents.  They denied everything and then came and told me there was little they could do.  I could try filing in small claims court to recoup my vet bills but I told him there was next to no way I'd win and he apologized to me and hoped my cat would get better.

I went to work the following day and told my co-workers about the incident and they felt sorry too for my cat.  I got pissed off to the point where I wasn't going to let them get away with it.  The day after this, I got off work and stopped by the hardware store and bought some bolt cutters.  I waited till about 2 am and went and stole both of their bikes off their porch and put them in my garage.

I went to work and thought about dumping them on the other side of the city but instead, I decided to cut them up instead.  When I got home, I took them apart and cut them on my work bench and tossed the crankshaft and bolts in the car wash dumpster a couple blocks away.  I waited till Friday night and dumped them down the street in the field they liked to play at on the weekends.  

I was on my porch most of Saturday when I saw them crying and dragging their cut up bike pieces home to their parents.  I saw the police come over to their home later in the day but I was sure they told them that there was no proof I did it so they didn't stop by and talk to me.  In the end, my cat didn't get to go out side the rest of the year and they didn't get bikes to play with the rest of summer.

This happened about 10 years ago and my cat was 7 at the time.  She lived to be 11 before she passed away in her sleep one night.

dragongrl,155,,366,14tnvo,,2663,"   Many many many years ago, in the early days of cell phones, I worked customer service for a cell phone company, who's name is just a bunch of letters.  This man called in, and I was lucky enough to get him on my headset.
  
   ""Thank you for calling &lt;redacted&gt;.  How can I help you?""

   Him (screaming) ""This fucking phone isn't working!  I can't make calls and people call me and just get my voice mail!  Fix it god damnit!""

   Usually, the first thing we do is have to customer power the phone off and then on again.  Nine times out of ten, this re-registered the phone on the cell site and made it work again.  So I suggest this to him.  He just continues to scream.

   ""Fuck you I'm not doing that!  I'm a fucking lawyer.  My time is very valuable!  People pay me hundreds of dollars an hour.  You should be paying ME to talk to YOU!""

   As he's ranting, I'm checking out the computer.  We had two programs; one that was Windows based, contained all the normal account stuff and a DOS based program that would show you what cell sites they were pinging off of, as well as allow you to deauthorize their phone, basically knocking it off the cell site until they powered the phone off and on (sometimes the phones got hung up between sites).  The Windows program could be seen by the bosses, but the DOS one could not.

   I check his account in Windows.  He's all paid up and everything's fine from that angle.  I pull up the DOS program and sure enough, the cell sites aren't picking up his phone.  So I tell him again to just turn the phone off and on again, and that should fix the problem.

   ""FUCK YOU!  I shouldn't have to do that!  I shouldn't have to do anything you dumb bitch!  You need to fix this right now.  And I want my account credited for every second I can't use my phone!""
    I explain that we can't do that, his service is fine, all he has to do is pick up the cell site again.  He continues to scream, yell and threaten to get me fired if I don't fix his phone and give him credit.  I keep telling him he has the ability to fix the problem himself if he just presses that one little power button. After some more cursing and sputtering, he finally hangs up on me.

   After he hangs up and my ears stop bleeding, I go to add my notes about the call into the Windows program.  I look back at the previous notes and see this guy has been a douche-nozzle to every single operator he's ever spoken to.  So I write his phone number down on a little post-it and stick it to my computer.  For the rest of the time I worked there, whenever I had a spare minute, I'd pull his phone up in the DOS program and knock it off the cell site.  And I did it completely randomly.  Sometimes once a day, sometimes as many as twenty.

Trashmannn,378,,1539,1l2cq1,,2579,"So I live in a low income housing area of the town i attend college in. I was initially drawn to the apartment I'm currently living in because it was extremely cheap and on the second floor (this is a house converted into two living units). I immediately signed the lease and everything was dandy for the first few weeks. However, I had taken notice of the neighborhood riff raff and was wary to keep my distance. I wasn't exactly scared of a bunch of young teens, but after observing their absolutely appalling nature, i tried to give them no excuse to fuck  with me through vandalizing my car or apartment.

Well, not so long ago, I was sitting on my second story porch, enjoying a cigarette after a long tedious shift, when the teens decided to fuck with me. At first, i didn't realize they were speaking to me, until one of them called out ""hey you indian fag!"" Now even though I'm not indian, people often assume i am because of my skin tone, so I'm aware they're attempting to heckle me. I look up and merely raise my eyebrows in acknowledgment, when one of them kicks over my (full) garbage cans and tells me to get on my knees and pick up my trash you (insert random racist slurs here). They laugh and leave. Knowing that I'll be fined by the city if i dont clean up the mess, i begrudgingly clean up the mess. It was while i was kneeling among the strewn garbage that my revenge came to fruition. 

A few nights later, I was sitting on my porch again waiting for my targets to arrive. Sure enough, the pack of them comes strutting down the road talking shit and fucking things up. When they get to my house, I shout at them to keep it down and that theyre being obnoxious. Just as i had planned, they took my bait, and the one who had kicked over my trash cans a few days earlier told me that i was a fag and aimed a full forced kick at my trash cans. Little did he know that i had filled them to the bursting point with packed down rocks and dirt, making them extremely heavy and almost unmovable. I savored the moments leading up to contact and burst out laughing when the garbage can failed to move and the kid howled out in pain when his foot connected. Judging from the time he spent on the ground clutching his foot and the fact that he limped away on the verge of tears, I'm assuming he broke a toe or two. i slept like a fucking king that night.

""It's OK ladies, allow me. This rounds on me. What would you like?""

They requested their order, though I never bothered to listen to it. They then freed up some space for me to get to the bar. I ordered my drink and nothing more. I then proceeded to explain to the barman how I had heard these girls talking about school and probably weren't old enough for drinking. I turned around to see them casting me some really evil looks as I left the bar with only my drink.

Antigon35,232,,1618,1nmb5m,,2494,"So a friend of mine, we’ll call him Daniel, is deaf and has been his whole life. Daniel was fired from his job by a manager that openly mocked him for being deaf. So when he needed to go to the unemployment office he asked me to go with him because I have been trying to learn sign language and we can communicate pretty well. We get there and there’s only us and a very elderly old man (EM) sitting in the waiting area. All of the chairs are set up so that we are facing the only receptionist in the room. There seems to be some sort of issue with EM’s paperwork so every few minutes EM would walk up to answer a question of the receptionists’ or to sign what she asked him to sign and then he would sit back down. Daniel being the sweet guy he is, would reach forward and hold the man’s chair every time he went to sit back down. 

So me and Daniel are signing back and forth just shooting the shit when a few other people come in, including a very loud, obnoxious, white trash couple. Now, as I previously stated, I am just learning sign language so I was concentrating on what I was signing and understanding what Daniel was signing so at first I didn’t notice white trash couple plop down in the seats behind us. Then I heard it “derrr… derrr… I’m a deafie….derr”. I glance behind me without moving my head and in my peripheral vision I can see white trash male mocking Daniel and imitating the noises that Daniel makes when he laughs or gets into a story. White Trash bitch apparently thinks this is hilarious. I realize that because I am super concentrating, I haven’t said anything or given them any idea that I am not deaf.  I take a look at the receptionist who looks mortified but seems not to know what to do. 

Now nothing would have made me happier than to cause a huge scene but I knew Daniel was already self conscious about getting fired so I did the next best thing. I waited until EM went to sit down again, Daniel reached forward to hold his chair, I spun around in my chair, looked white trashy 1 &amp; 2 and yelled as loud as I could “WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM!?!” White Trash douche’s jaw drops in shock and the bitch went white as a sheet. I just stared at them. Daniel suddenly realizes I am looking at the white trash couple and signs “What’s wrong?” I told him they kicked my chair. He signs “Asshole” and glares at them. 

I guess they felt uncomfortable enough that they decided to slink out of the building. Fuck you and your unemployment check.  

Edit 1: Concerning the amount of posts regarding legal action against Daniel's workplace, At the time Daniel couldn't prove that he had been fired for his disability. The Manager claimed it was for him being lazy and tried to say that Daniel had drawn a penis on the white board in the back that he sometimes used to communicate (which he hadn't). So Daniel went for unemployment while his friends back at his job pulled some strings. I want to get Daniel to post his revenge story for getting his job back b/c I don't think I could do it justice. It's pretty great.

One of my 12 hour colleagues loves it, chicken-guy felt superior before he went 12 hour and it probably hasn't helped. He often forgets that he isn't superior to me. One day he took it upon himself to do the lunches. He asked if I wanted a specific time and I told him 12:30, it was another colleagues leaving day and we were going for a pub lunch to say goodbye to her. He told me ""I'm going at 12:30, you can go at 1:30 or 2:30.""

I politely declined his offer and told him why I wanted to go at this time, he replied ""Tough shit, bitch, I'm going at 12:30 because that's when not-Tesco finishes cooking their deli chicken. You can go at 1:30.""

The bitch bit was unnecessary, I'm a dude for starters, so I agreed to go at 3:30, with the full intention of going at 12:30. This meant that the other lunches where filled out from 12:30 - 3:30 and during this 3 hour period no one would be able to go on lunch at the same time.

I'm a curious guy so I scadoodled on over to see what was going on.

I can be a bastard-coated-bastard with bastard filling sometimes, but I absolutely hate it when people are rude to store employees/waiters/people they thing are 'beneath them'.  Really, really pisses me off. That bitch wasn't getting away with it.  I stalked her through the store, never getting too close to set off alarm.  She moved from aisle to aisle getting more things for her impending bitch-festival, not knowing that a predator was about to strike.  She got some pretty delicious looking things, I might add...but I wasn't after those.  I had my target.  I was going to take that fucking cake mix.  

I knew exactly where it was in her cart.  Her cart was getting pretty full so I decided to move in for the kill. The petty-revenge gods were on my side because somehow the cake mix wasn't covered by anything.  She turned her back on her cart and bent down to get something off the bottom shelf.  I rushed in, very nonchalantly snagged the cake mix out of her cart, and moved on.

Of course I had to watch to make sure she checked out.  In fact, I made sure I was right behind her.  She didn't notice a thing.  For how big of a deal that damn cake mix was to her, I was surprised how little attention she payed to what she put on the conveyor belt.  

I smiled all night thinking about how she got home, unloaded all of her groceries, but couldn't find the cake mix.  She probably went back out to her car, looked around, maybe under the seats...but guess what lady, it's not there.

That cake mix deserved better than her.  *I* bought it.  It was confetti cake mix.  It might have been for a kids party for all I know, but I don't care.  I made it when I got home and it was fucking delicious.  Store brands are great.","If you're a jerk at the grocery store, you don't get any cake.",3384,pettyrevenge

I think I get it now:  In Shelly's world you push a button and money comes out.  Anytime she wanted to party, all she had to do was take 2 hours out of her day to mow my lawn, stop by my office, and she instantly got $50.  Next day broke?  Mow the lawn again, pass Go, collect another $50.  I think she was confused and even hurt when I put a stop to it.

""Silas"" came to my work and threatened me with a bullshit lawsuit but I think he was white-knighting for Shelly.  They have a kid together, so I don't blame him.  But I could not resist seeing what would happen if I confronted him.

Instead of calling I decided to get up early this morning and go to the law firm where Silas had a job.  The business card he gave me just said ""The Offices of Legal Guy, Legal Eagle, and Law Dude"" (you can substitute the names of actual attorneys here, none of which are Silas).

As soon as I walked in the front door I saw Silas sitting at the back of the front room.  He looked up, panicked, and I swear to Zeus, he skulked out of the room like he'd shit himself.  Went into an office and closed the door behind him.

Now my brother had already told me that he knew Silas worked for a law firm (Shelly had told him).  He couldn't remember what Silas did there, but we reasoned that Silas couldn't possibly be a lawyer because he graduated from a 2-year community college just two years ago.  The timing, you see.

I asked the receptionist who ""that guy at the back"" was, and she said ""his name is Silas, he is one of our best paralegals"".  I asked if that meant he could sue somebody, and she laughed.  Yeah, that's what I thought.

I asked if I could talk to him, and she said I'd be better off talking to an attorney, and that Law Dude and Legal Eagle were in the building... no thanks, I really need to talk to Silas.

She said ""Is this a personal thing?"" and I said well, sorta, and she whispered to me, ""Look, Silas has already gotten in trouble once this week for 'personal' stuff.  Can you wait until lunch, when he's out of the office?""

Uh, no.  He came to MY office, tried to embarrass ME, no way in hell I'm letting him get off that easy...

If I'd thought ahead of time, I would've taken today off.  I could only wait half an hour for him to come back to his desk (yes, I'm a sucker), but he stayed put in that closed office, and I had to get to work myself.  I wrote a note for the receptionist to give to Silas:  

I'LL BE BACK AT 12:45 ON MY LUNCH BREAK.  IF YOU'RE BUSY OR GONE, I'M SURE ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS HERE CAN HELP ME INSTEAD.

He showed up at my office at 12:20.

He closed my door and sat down and looked like he was about to cry.  He couldn't even look at me, but he mumbled how he was trying to spend more time with his son, and he believed some things that weren't true, and how very sorry he was, and how his life was falling apart.  He said he was trying to get custody of his kid but it was hard to do because he 1) was trying to go back to school, which took time and money and 2) was not a woman.  His words, not mine.

Fuuuuuck.  He'll make a GOOD lawyer someday.  Almost made ME cry.

We started talking about the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I told him how Shelly had mowed every few days, and I was refusing to pay her for the last day because she didn't do shit except sit in her car for an hour.  He said that was his fault, she had called him while she was waiting for me that day, and she was in a panic because she had been seen breaking into my house and she --

Wait. What?

He calmly continued that she said she had broken into my house and that she was all upset, because she had taken a laptop --

WHAT???

He said calm down, she put the laptop back, but she was upset because the neighbors had seen her climb through my window and she was worried she was going to get arrested.  I asked why she didn't just leave that day, then.  He said she was afraid that would make her look ""guilty"".

Oh.  My.  God.

He said that he had told her to wait until I arrived, and to explain.  She told him that she was going to try to get into my house once I got home, so that ""her fingerprints would have a reason to be there"".  Well that explains why she was so pushy and insistent on getting inside.

Wait, wait.  HOW did she put the laptop back?  ""She went in through the window twice.  She said she left the front door open so she could say that you left your door open, and that was why your laptop was missing.  I told her that wasn't a good idea.""

NO SHIT, SHERLOCK!

I really, really want to hit this guy, but I manage to stay polite, and ask him nicely if he would mind telling the police that Shelly admitted to him that she went through my window.  I omit the part about the neighbors saying they ""didn't want to get involved"" (I think Shelly brought her kid to along a few times she mowed and they saw, and felt bad for her).  He says he doesn't want to make ""an already ugly situation even uglier"".  I remind him that if he wants custody of his son, this would be a good start.  He says ""I'll think about it"".

I resist the urge to get up and dance.

[Then this happened.]

(A friend of mine that works for the town newspaper gave me this.)

Shelly got picked up this afternoon - she was speeding and got pulled over.

Couple of things you might notice from that press release:

- She's not being charged with breaking and entering because, according to the investigator I talked to earlier, ""if I left my window open she didn't technically break in"".

- The cops are claiming that I had ""complained of a missing laptop"" the day that I called them.  No I didn't.  I didn't notice anything missing that day.  I wouldn't have known she was even in my house until my neighbors told me they saw her break in.  I'm guessing this is to make the cops look less like idiots.  I love how they called it ""an investigation"", like they had actually done their job.

- Shelly apparently told the cops that she had ""temporarily lived"" at my house.  My brother used to live with me right after our dad died, and he and Shelly dated during that time, and she slept over more than a few times, but she never paid rent or anything.  It's possible she thought she could tell the cops some excuse about how she was my roommate.  This pisses me off more than anything she did before.  When she was arrested she gave her mom's address as her permanent residence.  I think she and her son had been staying there since Silas kicked her out.

She made bail immediately - I would bet Silas paid it out of guilt, but I can't be sure.  I *do* know that she left her kid at her mom's house and that no knows where she is right now.  I really, really hope she doesn't skip town, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Guess she'll owe Silas some money.","UPDATE on the UPDATE: Stupid bimbo scams me, brags about it on Facebook, threatens to sue with a fake lawyer. VENGEANCE IS MINE, SAYETH THE SWEETALKERSWEETALKER.",3185,pettyrevenge
DrRat,509,,1376,1g78ps,,2342,"A little bit of background before I get into the petty revenge. I’m a dancer at a strip club in Florida. It’s a small club in a relatively conservative area, so it’s pretty tame compared to a lot of other places. It’s more of a bikini bar as we must keep our bottoms on and our nipples covered with tape or tassels at all times under penalty of losing our job (which I’m OK with). In the past few years strip clubs have become more mainstream and popular with all types of people – not just the clichéd perverted old men (although we definitely still get those guys). We regularly host bachelorette parties, couples, groups of women, and groups of couples come in to enjoy the show. We even get middle-aged couples (they’re always the most fun and surprisingly accepting to the scene).  For the most part, the women are pretty cool with being surrounded by half-naked strippers, and enjoy hanging out with us, and we’re happy to have them there. MOST of them….not all. We get the occasional girlfriend or wife who comes in with a ‘holier than thou’ attitude who just sits there and scowls at everyone. Clearly she was dragged in against her will and wants to show her displeasure by trying to ruin the night for everyone. If you try to make conversation with them, they make passive-aggressive remarks putting you and your profession down.  That’s fine. Dancers have to have tough skin and lots of confidence, so we usually just go to the dressing room and laugh about how insecure the girl is. 


For those of you who aren’t familiar with how most strip clubs are set up, here is a brief explanation. Most have a bar right when you walk in so you can grab a drink. There is typically a stage with a dancer on it either in the middle of the club, or running along one wall. Generally, the closer to the stage you sit, the more open you are to talking to girls and getting private dances. The stage will have chairs around it which is called ‘the tip rail’. At the tip rail you have a very close view of the women on stage, but it is heavily implied that you must tip the dancer to sit there. At my club, there are about a dozen chairs around the stage.  When a dancer receives a tip at the tip rail, she normally does something a little extra for the guy. If it’s a dollar or two I just let them stick it in my G-string. If it’s $5-$10 I’ll motorboat, or shake my butt. If it’s $10-$15 I’ll wrap my thighs around their neck and jiggle the lady bits. Anything over $15 I’ll climb off the stage and give them a 30 second lap dance.  If a douchebag sits at the tip rail and tips nothing, then I will completely ignore them. An additional note: if you’re sitting at the tip rail, and all the chairs around the tip rail are full, and the club is packed your ass had better be tipping generously, because if you’re just sitting there taking up space from someone who would otherwise be tipping, then you’re essentially taking money out of my pocket. It’s truly frustrating, but we can't really say anything about it because tipping at the tip rail is only heavily implied, not required.


Here is where the petty revenge comes into play. Every once in a while one of those scowling, angry women sits at the tip rail –usually with the boyfriend or group of friends who are having a GREAT time – and doesn’t tip a single dollar. Her friends are usually tipping, but she will just sits there, arms crossed, pissed off and bitter. For the longest time my reaction to these women would be just to ignore them just like I do with non-tipping men. Then I mentioned it to a co-worker about how annoying these girls are because they bring down the mood of the night, and don’t tip when they should be. She told me I’m taking the wrong approach in ignoring them. Next time it happens, treat the girl like she tipped $15 – wrap your legs around her neck and stick your crotch right in her face. So I did. The next time a pissy girl came in and sat at the tip rail during a busy night and didn’t tip, I SHOWERED the girl with attention: boobs in her face, ass jiggling, thighs wrapping around her neck, pussy in the face, the whole nine yards despite her not tipping a single dollar. This is what happened: the guys LOVED it and threw TONS of money on the stage because, hey, girl –on –girl. The woman? Madder than hell, but unable to do anything about it because she’s sitting at the tip rail and I’m just doing my job. In addition, I’m the one smiling having a great time while she looks like a curmudgeon. It’s a win-win for me.
I now do this on a regular basis with almost the exact same results each time: I make more money, and at the same time piss off someone who clearly looks down upon my job.

Edit: I really hate when people edit, but it's pretty clear some of you have never been to a strip club. The atmosphere is VERY relaxed and chill. No one is sexually harassing anyone. The tip rail is literally the only place I do this. If someone isn't comfortable with it, they have a choice of about a hundred other chairs they are more than welcome to sit at without any disturbance.

jubjubmacrub,192,,798,1djzpv,,2335,"This is your typical asshole neighbour revenge with a twist.

I have an asshole neighbour. He is an elderly-ish man - maybe around 60. Still works down in town. Anyway, we share the start of our driveway, except his goes past my house and down the valley a ways, where his house is. 

Now we had just got our driveway paved, meaning he had to park up on the road for the two days they were laying the sand and pavers. Its maybe a 25 meter walk down to his house. 

Not only did he berate me at long length when our paths met at the letterbox on the first day, but on the second, he outright abused me in front of my student (I tutor drums). I told my young student to go inside, as he was swearing furiously at me for having the nerve to ask him to park out front for two days. 

Fast forward to the next week. He decides to park in the middle of where our driveways split up. Meaning I have to park out on the road. Keep in mind this is actually my property, he's just a prick. That night, instead of abusing him the next time I saw him, I thought of a better revenge. 

In the dead of the night, I take a pack of frozen prawns out of my freezer. I sneak down my driveway and kneel down by one of his tyres. I then begin sliding frozen prawns one by one into his hubcap. Pushing them far enough in that they are invisible from the out side. I systematically fill each of his four hubcaps with two kilos of frozen prawns (4.4 pounds). 

Now keep in mind this is in the middle of a boiling hot Australian summer. Even by the next morning i could smell the prawns had thawed and were beginning to cook. Over the course of the next week I watched him inspect his car thoroughly, trying to work out where the abhorrent stench was coming from. He looked in his engine, all through his car, in his fucking exhaust for christs sake. 

But never deep within his hubcaps. 

They must have festered there for a good month before he finally sold his car. The smell was bloody horrible. Serves him right, the cunt.

CejusChrist,216,,1351,1nsk4f,,2299,"So, this happened last month, but I am finally getting a chance to type it out.

I work as an EMT in a decent sized city. We tend to run call to call, and get all sorts of calls. One night, we get called for a call coded as a Psych. A gentleman had been having a bad run of luck, and was feeling depressed. So my partner and I show up, and I begin to speak with the man. The gentleman begins to tell me about how he had been kicked out of his home, by his wife, for drug use. This caused him to feel depressed, and spiral into the world of homelessness and drugs. He had a revelation earlier, and he wanted help, so he called us.

I move him into the back of my ambulance, and the guy begins to break down, crying because he feels hopeless, worthless, and he can't stop apologizing for wasting my time. I am in the middle of trying to calm him down, and have a conversation with him while I take a blood pressure, and begin to get a little bit of demographic information, when I hear my partner yell from the front seat.

I look around, and in the back window, I see a hand, and an iPhone in the corner of the window. I begin to see red, as I realize what the guy behind my ambulance is doing. Not only is he taking a picture of me, he is taking a picture of a man who is already feeling like he has hit rock bottom, and is sobbing in the back of my ambulance. The man realizes as well that he is being photographed, and says something along the lines of ""If I was them, I would be taking pictures of someone as useless as me as well."" This is when I have a stroke of genius.

At my company, we run van-type ambulances. The rear doors open like they do [in this picture.](http://i.istockimg.com/file_thumbview_approve/995999/2/stock-photo-995999-ambulance-van.jpg) The right side door opens first, allowing the left side to open afterwards. The handle is right next to where I was sitting, which was on the bench inside. So I tell my patient to hold on a second. I grab the handle, and kick the door open with all my strength, and hop out right afterwords.

The door flies into the guys hand, and his phone goes 10 feet into the road, with a satisfying crack that can only be the sound of a screen breaking upon sidewalk and pavement. I give a halfhearted apology stating that I didn't see him, and that I was trying to find my jump bag. The kid, who appeared to be early twenties, and drunk, was too dumbfounded to say anything. I get back in the ambulance, and we begin to pull away. I look back, to see the kid pick up his phone, look at it, and throw it against the wall, in what I assume was a post-screenbreaking act of rage. Felt good man.

One night we're out having martinis when I start talking about a hot bartender at a local establishment. She tells me that it's her ex-boyfriend and we kind of laugh it off. Later that night she asks me to send him a Facebook message, indicating that I want to have sex with him. She says she wants to see if he'd ""be a whore"" and ""do something like that."" Obviously she's not over it even though it'd been a year. Well, I send the message. I sort of laugh about it and she looks at me all serious and says, ""You wouldn't actually do anything with him right? Since we're such good friends and all."" I nod and the night carries on.

The next weekend I get a response from Lindsay's ex saying he'd noticed me before, we should get together, etc. I ignore it because, well, that's what friends do. That same weekend Lindsay starts spending all of her time with some new guy. For two weeks she ignores my calls and texts - sometimes responding with a short ""busy. sorry."" (same message every time... ""busy. sorry."")

My stepsister was raised to expect everything handed to her on a platter. She's the first-born idol of her side of the family. She's not an only child but she fills every cliche of the spoilt brat only kid. I feel sorry for her brother and sister. They get treated so differently, although they're okay people for it they do miss out on a lot from their parents.

Stepsister is also a bigoted, racist cow. The filth that spills from her mouth and her attitudes about anybody who isn't attractive, cool, or *normal* is sickening. I've lived with it for years and I'm pretty bitter about it, though I keep the peace for my mom's sake. Worst that's happened between us is a screaming match where I ended up bawling and wilting because she hates the idea of gays being visibly gay, gays being allowed around kids, gay marriage, and she wonders out loud why we can't just shut the fuck up and hide like good little freaks. Me, I'm lesbian and out.

I'm not terribly confident at the best of times, though I'll stand my ground when it comes to that kind of bigotry, but her confidence is absolute. she feels she's right all the time and entirely dismisses anything that stands in the way of her bigotry and goes into attack if she feels threatened, and everything threatens her. Fuck I hate her.

Occasionally I check her facebook page (we're not friended, but it's well worth seeing what she's up to in order to prepare for her dramas before they hit the family). Before her wedding she had a meltdown on facebook at the cost of the photographer she wanted. I know the guy she wanted to use, and he's damned good and charges worthwhile prices for good work.

The kicker here is that's my profession too. Most of my income comes through my photography. Commercial and product though, not weddings thankfully.

And in a little post on the wall of a friend of hers, hidden from general view, she said she planned to get around even paying for a wedding photographer by inviting me. She knows I always have a camera on me and one or another of them comes with me everywhere. The presumptive cow decided she'd get free wedding photos out of me.

Day of the wedding I brought my worst camera body with a broken flash, and a useless 17-85mm lens (a rubbish lens to start with) that I borrowed (ironically from the photographer she wouldn't pay for) and had suffered from a water spill. It took photos with bad halos around EVERYTHING, and I took photos constantly in small jpg mode.

She asked for the photos from me after the wedding and I gave her the cards with them all on, straight from the camera.

It made her cry. She went fucking MENTAL at me to her and my family, but not a soul except her and her husband lay any blame on me for taking shit photos because hey, I was never hired for the job and never told to my face I'd be needed as a photographer, let alone paid for anything. If she had a clue beyond the superficial she'd realize that her wedding, the actual event, and the marriage that followed was the most special part of it all - but no.

fierylady2,352,,1203,1gqddi,,2198,"I worked at a nice, 3 star hotel in a very rich suburb in 2007.  I worked the weekend night audit shift to have a little extra spending money while I was finishing up my Master's degree, since the rest of my weekly 8-5 money was going to pay my bills.  

It was Saturday morning around 5 am and I had just gotten finished putting all of the room checkout slips under the doors of the people checking out.  I was in back finishing up my paperwork when I hear ""ding ding ding"" (I would put a bell out if I was in back working so I knew when people came up to the desk.) I reply ""I will be back up in a minute"" and I heard ""ding ding ding"" again.  I ignore it since I knew he heard me, then he starts hitting the bell incessantly until I finally come up.

I come around the corner and take the bell out of his hands (since he's still ringing it even though I'm in front of him).  I smile and say ""How can I help you?"" and he replies ""There's a mistake on my bill.""  I take the bill and look at it, check his account, and say ""I don't see any mistakes on the bill.  What do you think is in error?""  He replies, ""These video charges... they aren't mine.""  I look at the bill again and see around $250 in video movie charges.  I reply back ""Sir, these were movies were checked out of your room and the system automatically processes them.""

He looks uncomfortable and he then accuses the housekeeping staff of renting the movies while he was out of his room.  I highly doubt this, but trying to give him the benefit of the doubt I say I will look into it.  He says he'll come back in a little bit.  I go back to the movie rental system and print out his rental report.  I don't really review it because I need to check my audit paperwork and finish running my reports.

He returns around 6:30 am and in tow with him are a group of other adults and kids checking out (he's chatting with them, so I assume they're in the same group).  He asks me if I have removed the charges and I go and grab his checkout report.  

One thing you should know is that the rental system in most hotels will tell the hotel staff exactly what movies were watched, when they were watched, and how long they were watched.  Usually if movies are flipped on by mistake (usually by a kid or rolling/sitting on the remote), most people catch it within the first few minutes and call down immediately to have the charges removed.  Which we have no problem with because hey, it happens.

I look over his report and ALL the movies rented are adult films.  They were all watched for 15-20 minutes and they were all late at night at almost the same exact time (there is no way the housekeeping staff was here that late at night or would be in someone's room). It was hard not to smirk, but I put a smile on my face and politely say ""I'm sorry sir, but the rental report shows that you did check out these movies and watch them."" I show him the report and his face totally falls.

Then this guy narrows his eyes and out of no where stars yelling at me. ""Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you, I DID NOT RENT THESE MOVIES.  YOUR HOUSEKEEPING STAFF ARE THE ONES WHO WATCHED THESE MOVIES.  THEY ARE STEALING MY HARD EARNED MONEY AND I'M GOING TO SUE YOU AND THE HOTEL.""

Well, I do not take well to being yelled at or being told I'm going to be sued.  So in front of all his friends and their kids, I loudly start reading the times, movie titles, and how long they were watched for.  A few of the adults start pulling their kids away from him, a few starting laughing at him, and one guy even said ""You sicko, just pay the nice lady your bill for your pornos.""  The best part: All the titles were for granny porn. 

He grabs the bill from me and runs out of the hotel (literally ran).  A bunch of the adults start laughing harder and I hope is that to this day they have not let him live it down.

**tl;dr** - Guy in hotel has about $250 in adult movie rentals.  He accuses the housekeeping staff of watching them in his room, so I read the list of granny porn he watched out loud to him in front of his friends.

We shrugged it off as we are pretty relaxed fellows and parked in another spot. We make way into the grocery store, head directly to the baked goods counter, and wait in line to be served. The Blob pulls up behind us chattering away obnoxiously on her cell phone and completely oblivious to what was around her. Our turn to be served comes up, we select the last remaining chocolate cake, and ask the baker to out a message on our cake. She said it would take about ten minutes, as there was a line, and we told her we would be back to pick up our order. As we were walking away The Blob asks for a chocolate cake and is told there is none left and that we got the last one. She begins freaking out in a very entitled tone and demands that she receive said cake since we cut her off in the bakery line. However, the baker assures her we were here first and she would have to pick a different cake. At this point we could no longer hear what was happening but we didnt care as the Blob stole our parking spot, and got her just desserts as we took the last chocolate cake. However, our dealing with the Blob were far from over.

We headed to the frozen aisle to grab some pizza pockets, fries, chicken fingers, and other delectable snack foods as we were pretty starved. We headed back to the bakery counter only to find a different person behind the counter. We ask her for our cake and are told our sister picked it up. She then points down the bread aisle to the Blob with our cake in her motherfucking cart. Now most people would walk away and let this bitch eat her cake, but we were not backing down.

We followed her for some time through the grocery store. We decided to wait for an opportune moment and steal our cake back. The second she turned to grab something from the dairy fridge we gallopped over, grabbed the cake and ran headlong to the checkout. Looking back we saw she was distracted on her phone again and did not notice the cake was missing. We paid for our groceries and headed out to the truck.

As we were leaving we realized that maybe we could get a little extra revenge on her. So we wrote up a note, indicating how delicious the cake was, and that she should thank us for saving her the calories. We tucked this under the wiper of her car and drove off just as she was walking out. Her face was red and puffed with air, we could tell she was angry as hell that we got our cake back.

Octosaurus,158,,481,17t4n8,,2191,"I live in an apartment complex, but its unique in its layout. I live above a doctors office, but my apartment sits directly above a tunnel for the doctor's crew to get to the parking lot. This means I have 3 neighbors: one behind me (best friend), one directly next to me (2 layers of thick concrete makes a great sound barrier), and one directly adjacent to my place. 

Since the school year started, the adjacent people play loud music on weekends, and talk loudly in the tunnel, creating an echo chamber in my room. I hate them. They always get pissy when I bang on the floor or walls to quiet down. They usually go louder and harder from it. 

Today, my vengeance made itself known. Woke up early to work on some stuff (9 am), and turned on a song (the volume low). I hear the neighbors banging on their wall, but my music is so quiet I don't know why. Eventually, they scream at me to turn it off.

kamakawiwo,138,,936,1jf3se,,2143,"So I'm doing my morning commute from the suburbs into the city. I get to the platform about 8-10 minutes before the 7:16 express train which arrives in the city a little after 8. At 7:12, there is a local which arrives at 8:15. At 7:12, the local still was not at the platform. I am standing towards the edge of the platform because I was one of the first ones there (I was behind the yellow line which is the area on the edge of the platform they reccommend you do not stand on because it is an unnecessary danger being that close to the tracks). The way it works is that the first people stand towards the front of the platform so they get on first, classic first come-first serve. 
 
At 7:15, this woman comes pushing past everyone on the platform. She goes behind me and, I don't know if she only meant to nudge me, didn't see me, or meant to push me because she was having a bad day. I stumbled forward and almost fell on the tracks. I was starting to catch myself but I realized I was probably going to have to jump down onto the tracks then climb back up to avoid falling on the metal tracks onto my face. I was going slow enough that some nice person behind me grabbed my backpack and stopped my forward momentum. I thanked the man for his kind action and he said loudly how obnoxious that lady was. She either didn't or pretended not to hear.
 
I realized because she arrived at 7:15, she didn't know the 7:12 hadn't come yet, so I thought of a quick revenge plan. I moved towards her so I was next to her and at 7:16, the local arrived. As it was pulling into the station, she said aloud to no one in particular, ""this is the express, right?"" I said ""yes ma'am"". Because she pushed her way past everyone and was at the front, she made sure to rush and be the first one on. No one else followed her. The conductor said ""delayed 7:12 local"" but becuase she had moved SO fast to get the seat she wanted, the doors closed before she got out and left me a glaring look. I just kinda smirked and people around me chuckled. The 7:16 arrived 2-3 minutes later. It was a good, petty way to start the day",Almost push me onto the tracks? Be 15 minutes late,3079,pettyrevenge

It is a very popular destination for rich swedes and norweigans during summer, and is packed with bars and fancy resturants.
Although, the people working there all know eachother well.

There is a very popular bar on this island, who has a regular with downs syndrome. She is there 2-3 times a week, always happy and loved by all. She has been on the island every summer for years, so all the staff and people living there knows her.
                                                            
Last year, during the monday of the busiest week of the year (packed with rich, loud people with big boats) two norweigan guys in their 40s started harassing and making fun of the regular with downs. 
The staff saw what happend, and threw them out. But the girl was in tears, and everyone was mad. The owner of the place quickly sent one of the staff to take pictures of the two men. He then sent them to every owner of a resturant, bar, nightclub and shop on the island and explained what had happend.

The following week, the two guys could not buy a beer or food on the entire islanď, and had to go by boat for 30 minutes to do so. I still get the chills when i hear this story.

Zerbo,292,,934,1kkytp,,2081,"So I'm at the checkout stand in the grocery store, cart completely full of groceries. I start unloading my things onto the conveyor belt, pretty standard. I'm not even a quarter of the way through loading everything up when this hugenormous, quivering hambeast of a woman comes panting into line behind me. She immediately hefts two 36-packs of Mountain Dew onto the conveyor belt behind my stuff. No divider or anything, she just stands there and sweats. I was a bit dumbfounded at first, because here I was with my cart still full of groceries that need to be put on the belt and now her cases of soda were taking up any available room. Having never been faced with this particular breach of grocery checkout protocol, I nodded to my cart and told her, ""Uh, I've still got a few things to load up, here.""

She glared at me and huffed, ""Well I only have two things, so you should have let me go ahead of you, you rude shit.""

This lady. The hell. Not only had I already been loading everything up, but the clerk had begun ringing up the items well before she had even truffle-shuffled her way over to the line... if we'd gotten there at the same time, sure, I would have let her go ahead. But apparently she could NOT wait to lug that Mountain Dew out of her cart and onto the belt. Being generally non-confrontational, I cracked an eyebrow at her comment and tried to load up more items Tetris-style. When it became apparent that there was simply no more room to be had, I turned and asked her, ""You mind moving that stuff back a bit so I can get the rest of my groceries up here?""

Still panting from the intense exertion of lifting two cases of soda, she responded with, ""I'm not moving a goddamn thing.""

At this point, that little voice in my head that was saying ""Hey Zerbo, don't be an asshole to this lady"" was now saying, ""Dude, just do it."" So I narrowed my eyes, and without a word lifted up both cases of soda and put them back into her shopping cart. While she asks me what the hell I'm doing and flips out at the realization that she will once again have to put her body through the grueling exercise that is lifting two cases of soda, I finish getting my items loaded onto the now-unoccupied conveyor belt. While swiping my card to finish the transaction, she begins bumping my hip with her shopping cart. On purpose. Repeatedly. Like a child. I turn to her again, and once again I don't say a thing. But this time, I reached into her cart and ripped the cardboard handles off her cases of soda. Brutally. Like I was the lion of the checkout lane and those sodas were the innards of a dying gazelle. While I'd only intended to rip the handles off to make them harder to lift, I had instead compromised the structural integrity of both boxes and all the cans of soda within came tumbling out inside her cart. So she began shrieking with indignant rage, and I tried my hardest not to laugh. By that time, my transaction was done, and I went on my merry way while the rest of the store stared at this blubbery gravy boat of a woman having a rage stroke over her soda.

Magnus_Fojar,173,,561,19emql,,2070,"I've been reading this subreddit since it started, and it's definitely  become one of my favorites. So I'm glad to finally contribute. I apologize if it's a bit long.

Background:

During college I was in a long-distance relationship with my girlfriend Mary (now my wife). We went to neighboring state schools, which meant a lot of 3-4 hour drives back and forth most weekends. On this particular weekend Mary discovered that her friend, Jess, was also planning on visiting my school. They only lived about 30 minutes apart from each other, so it made sense to carpool for the long ride up. Jess offered to use her car if Mary would drive them up there, with the condition that Jess would drive Mary home on the way back.

Since it's a college town, parking was at a premium, and free parking was even harder to find. Luckily, some of my friends had a free lot on the outskirts of town. Since we're all doing each other favors I offered to park Jess' car there and save everyone some money.

I met them both when they arrived Friday afternoon.  Jess went to hang out with her friends,  and I parked her car in the free lot. I should mention that it's a very large town, and it was easily a 25 minute walk from Jess' friend's apartment to the free lot. That is, if you know where the free lot is located...

Anyway, we had an awesome weekend and Sunday rolls around meaning its time for Jess and Mary to go home. I was engaged in an all-day student club event when I got a phone call from Mary stating the following:  

Jess had decided that she didn't have time to drop Mary off at home anymore. And that she would leave Mary several towns over. At which point Mary should call another friend to take her the rest of the way. Oh, and can I go get Jess her car and bring it to her since I still had her keys?  Oh hell no!

I was pissed, and I was certainly not going to let Jess strand my girlfriend in an unfamiliar place with no means to get home. Mary was upset and didn't really know what to do since Jess was being a selfish bitch. It was at this point that I realized the only way I could guarantee for Mary to get home was to make the long drive there myself to drop her off. So I left my event, leaving my understanding friends shorthanded, and went to meet that bitch Jess.

The revenge:

I told Jess ""Sure, come to my apartment and I'll take care of you."" She arrived expecting her car, and was handed only keys. I pointed her in the direction of the lot, walked to my car and started driving Mary home. The thing is, the free lot was in an obscure and far away part of town. It took me 25 minutes to walk there, moving at a relatively fast pace, and knowing exactly where I was going.

Jess was still calling me 2 hours later trying to find her car from my intentionally vague directions. Mary was half way home before Jess even started her trip. I hope she grasped the irony that by trying to save 30 minutes, and screwing over my girlfriend, she ended up losing 2 hours of her time. But, that's probably giving her too much credit.

TL;DR:  My girlfriend's ""friend"" was willing to strand my girlfriend to save herself a half hour. She completely went back on everything she promised after taking advantage of our kindness. So I cost her 2 hours of her time, and a lot of stress.",Strand my girlfriend? Enjoy your hike.,2631,pettyrevenge

I was frequently bullied because of this, usually just verbal but sometimes more.  This kid named A realized that he could take my lunch and I couldn't do anything about it, so that went on for a few days.  He had a particular taste for packaged meat products- this is important.

After the second time he stole my lunch (and I went hungry as a result), I was fed up.  I went home, took a piece of beef jerky, and soaked it in Dave's Insanity sauce for 36 hours.  After sampling the meat (holy shit was it spicy, and I have a high tolerance for heat), I brought it in to school.  I told my friends and classmates what was about to go down so that they could watch it happen.

Well, what do you know, A came around and snatched the beef jerky out of my hands at lunch.  I hardly complained, just told him it was a special recipe of mine.  He took a giant bite and started to talk about how spicy it was, me telling him that was how I like it (and with a big shit-eating grin on my face).

Fast forward to 10 minutes later and A was visibly sweating, face red, swearing loudly about the beef jerky he was still nibbling on so he didn't look like a bitch in front of his friends.  He snatched my fruit snacks and applesauce, ate them in front of me, and then I knew I had to end this once and for all, so I tried to think of a plan.  Meanwhile, A spent the rest of lunch blocking anyone else from using the water fountain in order to wash the heat from his mouth.

On the way back from lunch, A still swearing at me, I told him I knew a little trick to get the heat out.  I told him to just massage the corners of his eyes, right near the tear ducts...

A house next to the bedroom side of me was rented out to a young group of people who occasionally had loud late night parties. To me this wasn't a problem as i worked nights. For the other neighbors it was a nightmare. The group would always seem to turn the music off before the cops would arrive, threaten violence or vandalism to people if they would walk over to complain etc.

I tried to be civil and even asked politely for him to wait at least until I was awake ,around 12pm ,to rattle the few brain cells he had left into oblivion.  He blatantly refused and I'm pretty sure he did it more often to piss me off.

So, I did what the other neighbors had neglected to do. I got on the tax collectors website found out who owned the house. It was owned by an elderly couple in Massachusetts, where I'm from. After talking to them and gathering complaints form the others who had been harassed the landlords had enough and sent them a notice to vacate, which they ignored.

I come out to leave for work and turn the car on like normal and watch the gas gauge rise on back up...half way. Ok, no big deal; parents might have borrowed some. I can ask them when I get home.

woahmanda8,93,,974,1qmoi6,,2020,"I was reminiscing on my past job today when I remembered a petty revenge story that occurred while I was working last summer. Before university, I worked at a children's birthday party place. It was an awesome job. Playing with kids, getting leftover pizza and cake, and the pay was way better than the minimum wage food service job I'm working now.

Anyways.
Two workers were assigned to each party. There was a lead and an assistant. Most people became leads after working for ~6 months and showing that you can handle the job and communicate well with the parents/kids. While both jobs were nearly the same, the lead got to do a few of the cooler things, such as introducing the rules to the kids before switching gyms (it was actually really fun, we would always make them play Simon Says to get their attention so they would line up), initiating the zipline, and cutting the cake. 

I was SO excited when I finally became a lead. Along with all that, there was a pay raise. It was great.

Here's where things get slightly annoying. There was this girl who worked there, we'll call her Carly, whose mom knew the manager. She worked there much longer than any of us. Like, years. She was known for leaving early, not doing her closing duties, sitting down on the job, etc. Just a general bad employee that none of us really liked because she made our job harder. She never became a lead. Although she was perpetually stuck being an assistant, she liked to play her own little game of trying to take over and act as a lead with the new leads. On multiple occasions I had to work with her, and each time she tried to line the kids up, start zipline without telling me, and one time she even tried to cut the cake. Hell no. (I made sure she didn't get to cut the cake, by the way. Cutting the cake was what I lived for.)

Anyways, one day she pulls out the zipline 15 minutes early. Without telling me. 

Me: ""Hey, it's kind of early for zipline.""

Carly: ""Well, I want to do it early today.""

Me: ""I don't know if that's a good idea, the kids will get bored later if-""

(Carly interrupts): ""Hey (birthday kid), do you want to do zipline?""

Of course, he says yes. Fine. I go with the flow.
Here's where it gets petty and revengy. Carly is a bit (well, moderately) overweight. She tires very easy. I mentioned above that she's often found sitting when we're supposed to be constantly active and energetic.

We start zipline, get all the kids lined up, I explain the rules. It was a large party, 25 kids or so. All around 6-7 years old. 

Me: ""Carly, since you wanted to do zipline, you can lead this one.""

The lead is responsible for holding the kids and running down the gym with them, the assistant only has to hold a rope. This is the worst part of being the lead. It's fucking exhausting having to hold multiple kids up and run to the opposite side of a large gym with them, especially because many of them don't hold onto the bar very tight and parents get pretty upset when you drop their kid. 

Carly: ""..okay.""

So, we go through 25 kids ziplining down a hot gym, and boy oh boy is Carly exhausted. She starts to tell me she's going to get water.

Carly: ""I'm gonna go get some water, I'll-""

Me: ""Wait, we're not done!""

Carly: ""What?""

Me: ""Hey, (birthday boy), do you want to go again?""

He, and all 24 of his 50 lb. friends get excited and get back in line to do the zipline again.

Carly: ""We're only supposed to give them one turn!""

Me: ""Well we started 15 minutes early, so we have plenty of time.""

I'm allergic to bee stings, we were at least 45 minutes from the nearest medical facility, and most of our co-workers were non-English speaking production workers. He was the assistant general manager, and he tried to write me up for refusing to walk into an enclosed area that had several large Yellow Jacket nests in it. This was on a hot August afternoon, when the are the most aggressive toward potential intruders/food.

I got some Yellow Jacket attractant that's made for bait traps, and put the liquid on the headband of his hard hat. (It is a food manufacturing plant, and everybody - even the CEO and executives - are required to wear them in most areas of the facility).

He couldn't figure out why the Yellow Jackets kept flying in his face. They wold get aggressive and start biting and stinging when he started swatting them away. He finally quit a few weeks later. He tried to file for unemployment, but the company fought him and used his own documents against him: He put in writing that the Yellow Jackets weren't a problem, and that I was using my allergy as an excuse to avoid working.

I actually heard him say, ""But...but...I didn't mean it like that!""

The HR manager noticed I was keeping close tabs on what happened to the guy, and asked me if I knew anything about it. I said I didn't - that the wasps must have known he was an asshole, and the smell of shit attracted them.

We were good friends (and still are), though, as with any roommate, there were always small things that bugged each of us about the other - simple things one ought to let go.  My roommate, let's call him NJ was an awfully friendly guy but had a bad habit of eating things that did not belong to him, without asking or ever acknowledging the fact that he ate them.  I found this very rude and, after bringing it up on several occasions, I realized that he had no plan to stop, for he was one of those “share everything” types.  NJ was a social butterfly, easily peer pressured, and thus always ready to get supremely drunk and go party on any and all given nights.

One night, I came home to find my what-would-have-been munchies were gone, the wrapper for which was in the trash.  He was out, drinking heavily as always, and I knew he would come home wasted and fall right asleep.  In this, I found the outlet for my petty revenge.  The small annoyances he caused me of having to walk back to the convenience store (or wherever) to replace the snacks were only so annoying because they were constant, so my revenge must be a constant, small annoyance as well.  With that in mind, I stuffed his pillowcase full of magazines and hid all bedding in his closet aside from a small blanket.  He came stumbling home a few hours later and, as I predicted, fell right asleep.  He didn't notice his brick-like pillow at all!

NJ woke up the next day cold with a sore neck, wondering why the fuck his pillowcase was stuffed with magazines and where all his sheets were.  I told him that he came home ranting about pillows or something and that he was shifting all his books around as I was trying to sleep, making a lot of noise by his closet, too.  For the next few months, I did this every time he went out drinking; effectively convincing him that he had a drunken habit of replacing his pillow with magazines and hiding all his bedding.  The laugh it gave me made the short walks to the convenience store for snacks worth it.

**EDIT 1:**  I'm glad you are all enjoying my first story! To clear a couple things up, he never found out and I have no intention of telling him.  Also, we shared a room (2 twin xl beds) with one mini-fridge - we didn't have separate rooms - which is why hiding food was not really an option.

**EDIT 2:** I decided to write down another petty revenge story about living with NJ, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ky2qa/disrupt_my_studying_enjoy_your_cramming/) it is!","Drunk College Roommate Revenge, or How Did These Get Here?",2887,pettyrevenge
technographie,87,,428,17ylwd,,1986,"This happened back in high school, in my senior year. In one of our subjects, the teacher wanted to have a class debate about a controversial topic and chose abortion since there was a national debate on the practice at the time. I was picked to be the moderator of the debate, so I had to do research, create questions, know how to ask follow up questions, etc.

Now there were two classes for this subject. There was mine, right before lunch, and another right after lunch on the same day. The class after lunch picked an obnoxious, idiotic, spoiled brat of a soul as their moderator. She was an obnoxious person. Lets call her X

I was never a top student, but I was quite good, and so I prepared all my work and had it ready a bit in advance. The day before the debate, X comes up to me all nicely and asks if she can have my notes because he hasn't had time to prepare them (this is bullshit, she was known for copying). At this moment, I instantly came up with a way to teach her a lesson. I said yes, but tomorrow at lunch since. I told her I wasn't finished yet.

Come the next day, I do the debate, it went fine and then there's lunch. At some point she runs into me and asks me for the notes. I gave her the notes folded up and she put them in her bag without even looking at it. This turned out to be an even greater blessing, so I went to the teacher and asked if I could watch the debate to see how they approached the subject (I had a free period after lunch).

Class begins, and X takes out the papers and opens them to my delight. The expression of horror on her face was beautiful. Each page had one word on it in the very centre. The first page said 'NO', the second page said 'FUCKING' and the third page said 'WAY'. She gave me a death stare while I smirked. She tried to improvise but was a disaster, causing the teacher to ask for my help to 'show X how it's done'. It became clear she didn't do her work. Ohhhhh it was beautiful.

[deleted],305,,836,1hh6mi,,1973,"Not quite petty but...

This girl, let's call her R, is a coworker of mine at a local grocery store.  One day at work R asks me to buy her cigarettes from our work (I'm 18, she's 17).  I tell her I won't and after a few more questions she drops the subject.  Later that day, I am called into my manager's office and he is furious because R told him that I had offered to buy her cigarettes.  He  threatens to fire me over this, but gives me one final chance because I've been a model employee, although he believes I'm lying to him when I tell him the true version of the story.

Now R is a very flirty, touchy person.  She is always giving hugs and touching the other male employees.  I was never bothered by it, but after this incident I decided her touching was making an ""uncomfortable work environment"" for me.  I began to keep a detailed record of each time she touched me and told her each time that I wasn't comfortable with her doing it.  Each time I said it loud enough so another employee could hear and asked them to sign my record, thereby affirming my story.  

3 weeks go by and I mention something to our store's HR person telling them R was making me uncomfortable.  R is given a warning, but after a couple days the touching continues, as does my recording.  3 more weeks go by and a similar complaint is made by me to our HR person.  R is given a second warning, but ignores it and continues to touch me, mainly because she knows that I'm ""made uncomfortable"" by it, and she thinks that is funny.

Finally, after 2 months I go to the HR person and show them the physical list I have made of each time R has touched me, including my fellow coworkers signatures, telling how they can back up my claim.  The HR person immediately calls R into the HR office and fires her on the spot for ""repeated sexual harassment of fellow employees"".  The look of shock/surprise on her face made it all worthwhile, especially when she looked over and saw the knowing smirk on my face.

tl;dr:  Co-worker asks me to buy her cigarettes illegally, and almost gets me fired.  I get her fired for sexual harassment. 

Edit:  R was the niece of the manager.  He pulled strings for her to be hired, and that is why he took her side over mine.","Ask me to buy cigarettes for you illegally, then rat me out to my manager? I'll do you one better",2809,pettyrevenge
TurtleMountain,161,,718,1gmvlw,,1971,"When I was about 6 or 7, my uncle was found dead under gruesome circumstances after being missing for three months.  Obviously, my cousin (who is 3 years older than me) was heartbroken at the loss of her father.

After the funeral there was a reception.  A friend of my cousin's family and her shithead son (probably 9 years old, let's call him ""Ben"") were in attendance.  Ben, backed by his posse of a few bigger kids, decided it would be a good idea to bully my cousin and my sister while they were outside away from the adults.  My cousin and sister asked repeatedly to be left alone but Ben was relentless.  I watched from afar.

After eventually losing interest in my cousin, Ben and his group decided to go back to the reception.  They ran by me with Ben in the lead.  I happened to be standing on a pathway made of new and sharp gravel.  As Ben ran by, I stuck my foot out and he left both his feet and landed face first into the rocks.  He stood up, started crying, and yelled that I tripped him as the blood from the deep cuts on his face and elbows ruined his white shirt.

The best part? Ben told his mom and nobody believed him.  I was a small and quiet kid and nobody thought I could do so much damage--especially to someone older and bigger than me.

I tell her to move to the back of the line and what does she do? She turns around, laughs in my face, and turns back to her friend. This isn't okay. I have to find a way to get back at her. When she reaches the front of the line I overhear her say to her friend ""I could really use a coke right now."" This is when an idea forms. At the back of our canteen is a vending machine, supplying various beverages, including coke. When she gets her lunch, instead of ordering mine, I follow her to the machine. When she inserts her money, before she even had a chance to push the coke button, I quickly reach forward and hit a different button. She sees this, looks over at me, she is **fuming**, and yells at me, asking why the hell I did that. I look at her, laugh, and walk off.

youwhoneverarrived,161,,681,1hntbu,,1933,"So I work at a frozen yogurt store, one of those self-serve places where you make your own and weigh it.  It's an easy job and aside from some occasional bullshit from upper management, it's also generally pleasant.  I also happen to live in a fairly wealthy area, and the vast majority of my customers are very wealthy folks, and while 99% of them are awesome, wonderful people, there are always bad apples.

Slightly rude or short with me is one thing, but once in a while we get a customer in who is well and truly an entitled monster, and on those occasions I wish for nothing more than the power to set people on fire with only my furious gaze.  This young lady was one of those people.

**The offense:**  It's about 6-7pm, and it's a busy day.  I've been cutting up fresh fruit for the fridge and now I'm bringing it out for the customers to use.  *Entitled Princess*(hereafter known as *EP*) and her friend - both would be about 16-17 - are getting their yogurt, and as I'm passing them, *EP* ""accidentally"" knocks a chair into me, causing me to fall and spill about 6 containers of mango all over the floor.  I take a deep breath and ask the customers to please not walk on it while I grab a cloth and a cup to put the floor-mango into, and *EP*'s friend immediately begins to help me, getting on the floor and scooping it into a pile.  

*EP* leans down, laughs, and tugs friend to her feet announcing loudly ""Ewwww Laura, don't help her!  That's what they pay her for!"" as she purposefully stomps all over the fruit on her way to the cash, making an already huge mess about 5x worse.  Friend begins to protest, but *EP* is clearly queen bee and she relents, giving me apologetic eyes as they pay and leave.  *EP* also made sure to run the yogurt all over the place while making hers, so the machines are also really messy and gross now.

**The Revenge:** So about 5 minutes after they've left, the store has gotten quiet.  I'm going around doing some busywork, cleaning chairs and tables and doing a quick mop, when all of a sudden I notice a wallet lying beside the scale by the register.  As is our policy, I open it up to look for ID(so that when they return I can verify that the wallet does indeed belong to them), and lo and behold, the wallet appears to belong to *EP*.  But then, looking closer, I notice two driver's licenses.  I pull them out, thinking maybe it's the nice friend's wallet instead(and in that case, I would have slipped a bunch of dollar off coupons inside), but no, both have pictures of *EP*.  One has a name and birthdate matching her health card(that says she's 16) and the other has a totally different name and birthdate(that says she's newly 20. **Edited to add: I live in Ontario, Canada where the drinking age is 19**).  It dawns on me that it's a fake I.D. and I chuckle to myself before putting the wallet away to return when she comes back, untouched.  I'm not the kind of person to risk my job to steal from a forgotten wallet, even if the owner sucks.

But then it happens.  About two hours after the wallet was found, *EP* returns with her spray-tanned, blinding-teeth-knashing, hair-helmeted and polo-shirt wearing dad in tow, both in a snit and clearly expecting the wallet to have mysteriously ""disappeared"".  Dad marches up while *EP* stands behind smirking at me, and declares that his precious daughter left her(very expensive, LV in fact!) wallet here and that she ABSOLUTELY must have it back this very moment.  Well, this is like Christmas morning for me, because I realise that I get to completely shit all over *EP*'s day.  I pull out the wallet and ask ""Is this the wallet you left?"" to which she snappily responds that it is, while jumping in front of dad and trying to yank it from my hand.  I pull it back, open it up, and say, very calmly and with a poker face: ""Can I get the name and birthdate on the I.D.?""

Dad rolls his eyes like a dying cow and barks ""OH FOR GOD'S SAKE (FIRST NAME) (LAST NAME) AND (ACTUAL BIRTHDAY)!""

To which I respond, fake I.D. in hand, ""That's not the information I have here."" right before I swiftly reach over *EP*'s grasping fingers and hand the I.D. to Dad.

There's a moment of horrible, fantastic silence while Dad takes in the I.D. in his hand.  About 10-15 seconds later I break the tension by pulling out the real license and saying ""Ooooh, silly me, here it is!  That other one must be old or something!"", giving *EP* my best fake grin and holding out her wallet for her to take .  *EP* reaches out to take it, but dad leans over and snatches it from me, shooting her a look that could peel paint and snapping ""*EP* WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE CAR!""

MoonshineBaby,285,,794,1pnwh6,,1925,"I was at my parents house last night when my mom answered a call on their landline. I perked up when I heard her say with a worried look on her face, ""my computer's infected?"" I knew immediately this was a scam call so I told her I'd handle it and took the phone. It was a guy from India in a call center saying he was with Microsoft and I needed to follow his step-by-step instructions to clean up all the viruses on our pc (i.e. give him remote control, steal whatever info they can get, install malware, turn it into a zombie, or whatever else they do with this scam.) 

Now I hate scammers with a passion but I'm especially pissed off because my mom is getting up there in age and isn't as sharp as she used to be and would've fallen for this had I not been there. In fact, she did fall for this exact same scam about a year ago. I had to wipe the computer and told her very plainly that no one will ever, ever call from Microsoft, or for any other internet related issue. Unfortunately her memory isn't so hot these days.   

In a very thick Indian accent this guy tells me how bad the computer is with all its viruses and infections. ""Oh no! Really, I have viruses? How do I fix it?"" I say. He assures me he'll walk me through the clean up process and I express my relief and gratitude. Sweet - I don't have shit to do at the moment.

""Ok, sir. I need you to hold down the Windows key and the R key at the same time."" 

""Ok, I did that."" 

""Now what do you see?"" 

""My computer is off now."" 

""Sir, no, why is your computer off? You should see a menu. Please power the computer back on."" 

I actually had turned it off so I would be able to blare the Windows log-on sound to make it convincing. Now, this is like an '04 PC my mom has so the start up time is NOT exactly fast. So after a good while I tell him I'm back up and ready. 

""Ok, sir. Now look at the keyboard and find the WINDOWS KEY and the ""R"" KEY. Please hold these down at the same time. Now please tell me, sir, what do you see?""

""Hmm. My computer turned off again. I held down the main Windows button and the 'R' key just like you told me and it turned off again. I'm sorry, I just don't know what I'm doing wrong."" 

He's getting a little frustrated now. But the beauty is, I'm thinking, this guy probably has to call hundreds of people before he's got a sucker on the line as willing and eager as I am to remedy this particular computer problem. So I do this cycle a full four times, each time giving him more little hints that I think the ""Windows Key"" is actually the power button. By the fourth time I thought for sure he would get it because I was calling it something like, ""the main Windows power button on my Dell,"" but sadly he never did figure it out. He gives up on that and moves on to try something else.

""Ok, sir, forget that, we will try something else."" He goes on to explain that we're going to do a boot-up sequence where I have to press the F8 key *while* the computer is booting back up. Obviously, this could not have worked out better. The chance to continually miss hitting the F8 key in time has me absolutely giddy inside. I assure him I'm ready to hit the key and restart the machine. 

I let it fully boot up and blare the Windows login sound again and say, ""OK! It's back on and I'm hitting the key now."" He sighs with more frustration. ""You have to do it WHILE THE COMPUTER IS STARTING BACK UP,"" he explains. So I apologize again and feign frustration myself while holding back my unfettered delight. 

The next round he is more careful to make sure I'm hitting the key *during* the boot-up sequence. So I'm punching away on the space bar key as loud as I can during the boot-up, and after a couple minutes or so here comes that beautiful Windows start up sound again and he lets out an even louder, more frustrated sigh.

""SIR. Did you hit the **F8** key?"" 

Well I've gone this far, I think to myself, I may as well lay on another level of frustration by insulting his English. ""Yes, I was hitting the ""S"" and ""H"" keys the whole time! I don't know what went wrong."" 

Yep, that did it. ""**No**, no, no, the F-8 key. The **F** - **8** key. Sir, look at your keyboard. Do you see the F8 key?"" 

""OH....Oh...the *F-8* key,"" I say. ""Yes, I see, I'll try again."" We sit there waiting a few more minutes. I repeat the whole process, this time after the start-up sound I tell him I hit the ""F"" and ""8"" keys but again nothing happened. Holy Shit. He's fuming at this point but trying as hard as he can to hold it back. Right then I heard my mom call that dinner was ready. Normally I would have blown off dinner for something this much fun but we'd grilled out these beautiful ribeyes and I wasn't about to let mine get cold. I tell him I'm really sorry, I have to go to dinner now and I will have to fix it later. And with that, after this 35 minute phone call, I just hang up. 

I sit at the table admiring this beautifully marbled steak and tell my folks it was all a scam and I was just wasting his time. The phone rings. My mom jumps up and says, ""I got it."" In the sweetest voice, my mom said, ""I'm really sorry but we are having family dinner at the moment and I have a rule that everyone has to sit down together,"" and after a moment listening to his reply she hangs up and sits back down. 

""What'd he say,"" I ask. Mom replies, ""He said, 'Fuck your family dinner'.""

As we got closer to my stop I realised that now was the time to step up and be the bigger bitch.

hipsterhijabi,452,,907,1gx8r0,,1904,"**Thank you to /u/FireCrouch for the Reddit Gold!**

I'm mild-mannered. I'm quiet, I don't really go out of my way to speak at all. I enjoy observing, and it takes a lot to phase or irritate me. A lot. I'm also Muslim and I wear a hijab (head covering, like a nun...but not). 

I live in a small rural town in Southern Ontario, and for the past 8 years I have loved it here. It's really nice, the townspeople are wonderful and inclusive and it's just a beautiful little town, really. I have never really encountered rudeness, aside from my brief foray into the world of retail. I have also never been on the receiving end of any racial abuse. That is until the fateful day I went to my local grocers to see that it was, in fact, closed early that day. 

Sighing, I resigned myself to the fact that I'd had to go to the next town over to get my bread and eggs. The next town over wasn't nearly as nice as my town. It was rundown, unpleasant and had a very long history of the KKK being active in there. But it's 2013 and no one had heard of any such horrible business for a good long while, right? And it'd be silly to not get bread and eggs based on things I wasn't even sure were true, right? 

So off I went. I walked into the grocers and began perusing the fruits. The town, thus far, hadn't been at all what I had thought of it as. Sure it was rundown, but no one had given me any dirty looks. I was contented and went on my way. Until I heard, 

""Why is *she* here?""

I didn't pay no mind, until I heard again, 

""People like *her* should not be allowed in this country.""

My back stiffened. I was, quite plainly, the only 'minority' around. I turned around and saw a wizened 50 year old woman. Long of face and sour of expression, she looked at me with such hatred I was shocked. Her bony fingers pointed at me in an accusingly. My eyes widened, but I stood my ground and decided that perhaps she was just batty, and went on with my shopping calmly. 

Standing next to her was her husband, I presume. He was tall, large and just as mean-faced as his wife. But he said nothing, and I was going to say nothing too. I'd let it go, II didn't want to get into a verbal altercation. I just wanted to get my things and go home. 

The old lady did not rest, however. She followed me around the shop and began spewing more hatred. 

""Religion is evil but Islam is the most evil.""

""You are dirty, they should burn everything you touch.""

""You're a pig.""

""Islam is disgusting.""

""Go back to your own country you illiterate bitch.""

""I bet you fuck pigs.""

And on, and on it went. Each new epithet more horrifying than the last. They were only words though, she hadn't touched me or assualted me in anyway. But I was starting to get annoyed. What had I done to her, anyway? I just existed and she hated me based on my existence! I, for the life of me, don't understand how you can hate someone based purely on their physical appearance. 

The other customers and the cashiers were starting to stare now, but no one said anything. Fine, whatever. I don't really expect people to jump to my help, at all and most of them were seniors anyway. 

I have, by now, finished paying. Her insults still ringing in my ears, I'm about to exit the store and then I calmly turn around and face her for the first time.

This whole time I had been silent, she had been going on about my illiteracy, about how I should go back to my own country, how disgusting I am etc etc.

So I said in my clipped accent, 

""I find it surprising that you know *so* much about me just based on my appearance.""

She gestured to my headscarf and spat, 
""That thing tells me all I need to know.""

So I said, 

""Well I thought you looked like a crack whore when I first saw you. But now I can see your face I realize you're far too ugly to be one.""

She turned bright red in apoplectic rage and began screeching at other customers at this injustice I had caused her. 

Suddenly a green-aproned man with a name tag that said 'manager' appeared. She turned to him saying how horribly I had been her, how I'm a terrible person for calling her such foul things.

He calmly allowed her tirade to abate and said, 

""You're a sorry excuse for a human being and you and your husband aren't allowed back here again. Please get out of my sight.""

He then turned me and apologized profusely for not being alerted sooner to the situation, and said I'm welcome back anytime. I thanked him and left. 

The old lady was spitting with rage so as I drove off I gave her a cheery wave. 

TL;DR: Called a racist too ugly to be a crackwhore, manager backed me up.

TotalEntropy,127,,626,1erqs6,,1896,"This is one that I only witnessed first hand but *still* felt vindicated by it.

I work out at a large fitness chain gym and they have a ""bar"" where you can buy drinks and shakes with various supplements. I normally just bring my own, but I had forgotten it this day due to being a little slow out of bed, and decided to give it a shot. I hopped in line behind this self-entitled suburban house mother in her head-to-toe pink name brand workout outfit and patiently waited my turn.

We slowly move up and finally it is her turn to order, but instead of ordering she just starts lecturing the employee (A huge dude) on how dangerous the use of steroids are for him and how his genitals will shrivel up and die and he will grow man tits, and etc... Essentially publicly humiliating an employee for no reason at all. 

Now I have been working out at this gym for a few months, and I go at different times according to my schedule... but almost every time I go, he is there either working or working out, and the amount of dedication that he has is admirable. I'm not saying he doesn't use them for sure, but judging by body language and how he suddenly seemed so defeated, I am almost certain he got that way through natural means and hard work.

She finally ends her unsolicited lecture and orders a protein shake with soy milk because she is trying to lose a few last pounds before the summer begins. The employee reluctantly turns and starts to make the shake and she steps to the side to take a presumably *very* important phone call. That's when I catch it, the sweet sweet petty revenge. Instead of putting protein mix into the shake, he puts in mass gainer.

If you don't know much about fitness supplements, mass gainer is essentially very dense protein and carbohydrates, so it was still a ""protein"" shake, but probably ~400 calories more than what the plain protein shake would have been. Judging by how small this woman was, those extra calories were just enough to burst any caloric deficit that she was trying to get, but not too much to gain much extra weight... If he keeps this up, she will sit comfortably for the remainder of the summer prep time at the exact same weight completely confused as to why her efforts just aren't cutting it.

Just as he turned around to hand it to her he caught my eye and froze. I just gave him a wink, he smiled back and handed her the evil concoction. I was sure to give him a nice tip out of admiration for how expertly he had engineered that petty revenge.

I live in a duplex that is surrounded by some apartments and it is all owned by the same landlord. Its hard to explain the set up, but basically we all have assigned parking spots and there are some visitor spots set up for everyone in the back lot. 

My side of the duplex has 4 spots for us, directly outside of our front door, separate from the rest of the parking.

**Enter Douchebag**

Now this one person was a regular visitor of one of my back neighbors. She knew the parking set up. But she seemed to always park in our assigned spots. I left plenty of strongly worded notes that seemed to go unread. But I rolled my eyes and let it slide. Our landlord was pretty passive and I knew he'd never have them towed.

I was frustrated, but it was fine. People steal spots here all the time. But one week everything changed.

The girl's car started acting up. The car alarm would go off at random. At any time of the day or night. For 20 minutes at a time. She apologized once, saying that it only happened when she locked her car electronically, but if she locked it manually it was fine. I thought that meant that she'd lock it manually.

Of course not.

For the next week I was annoyed, awakened, and infuriated by her car alarm. Her car that was parked outside my bedroom window. 

**The Revenge**

So one night we took the matter into our own hands. Her car had been at our house for 2 days straight. It was finally enough.

Her car was unlocked so we opened the door, popped the hood, and disconnected her battery. Car dead? No car alarm. Victory. 

**Aftermath**

Of course she is car illiterate. She comes to our door and asks if we know anything about cars. We say, sure! We'll take a look! We pop open the hood. ""Gosh, I really don't know what is the matter, looks like you'll have to get it towed.""

Girl had to spend $100 bucks to get that hunk of junk hauled out of our parking lot. I'm sure she spent even more on a mechanic to look and see our simple sabotage. 

**Satisfying Conclusion**

That also meant that by forcing her to see a mechanic, they fixed her alarm. She started parking in the appropriate spots (probably because she realized that we were the saboteurs) and her alarm never went off again.

The End. ","Oh, you can't get your car alarm to stop going off at all hours of the night? Let me help you.",2558,pettyrevenge
itssilvernotgray,208,,709,1h3sdv,,1869,"Several years back I began to receive the scam emails from Nigeria.  I'm sure you are familiar with these so I won't go into a great explanation.  Normally, I can just ignore them, but these were coming to an email pertaining to a domain that I owned for my computer repair business.

It started with a few, and then grew to about 20 per day - every single day.  It was irritating to get an email notification only to find out that it was one of these BS emails.

I thought...what to do, what to do...then I had an idea.

I went to Angelfire and created a free website with nothing more than a counter on it.

I shelled out to a command prompt and wrote a batch file that when executed erased boot.ini, nrldr, ntdetect.com then launched a browser which loaded the website I had created (I put a pause in it, silently recursing the windows directory just to make sure their PC made it to the website) then it would shut down the PC.

For those of you not in the 'know', this will prevent a computer from booting, stopping at a black screen displaying an error message.  A good tech could have it back up and going with not much issue, but I was betting against that - after all, this is Nigeria.

I packaged the file into a password protected zip file and emailed it back to a few scammers stating that 'This was given to me by the bank, and contains my banking and credit card information. It is set to give a false virus warning to stop scammers, the password for the first file is &lt;password&gt;.  Please do not steal my information, I trust you'.

Within 2 days, the counter on my website had went from 3 (where I tested it) to over 140.

I have YET to receive another email from scammers at this email address.

From what I understand, they hack each others email in hopes of stealing 'victims' from each other.  I hope that the down-time I forced upon them was enough to allow for at least a few people to be educated about this scam.",Nigerian Scammers,2578,pettyrevenge

She's packing to go home for the holiday and bitching to someone one the phone that I'm faking it, not really sick etc.  Meanwhile my fever is skyrocketing and I'm starting to hallucinate.  I remember telling her that I needed help, needed water, practically begging.  She laughs and says 'if you die can I have your stuff', and left.

I'd love to say that this was my idea, but I was only a witness to this moment of genius.
I was queuing in the ten items or less line in a well-known UK supermarket chain. Just as the cashier was helping one elderly customer bag her items, with the next guy about to unload his items onto the counter, a short woman in a business suit pushed her way in between him and the cashier. I heard her mumble to him ""Just grabbing lunch, I'm running late"", before chucking her meal deal, which consisted of a sandwich, a bottle of juice and a packet of crisps, onto the counter. I should clarify that I was about third out of six or seven people in this queue and there was only one ten items or less lane; the store was busy and we were all trying to buy our lunches.
As the cashier was helping the first lady with her bags and credit card, the guy who was supposed to be next in line - without saying a single word to the queue-jumper - picked her bottle of juice off the counter, knelt down and rolled it along the ground towards the back of the queue! She turned to him as he picked up her packet of crisps and chucked them to the back of the queue, too. Her expression will be burned into my memory for eternity. She couldn't legitimately complain, because she, along with everyone around her, was perfectly aware of what she had tried to do. Plus, there was a whole queue of hungry British people observing her now! She stared daggers at the guy she tried to skip, picked up her sandwich, then storming off (a whole five metres) to pick the rest of her lunch off the floor, then disappeared back into the aisles in a fit of embarrassed rage.

I was standing, as were a handful of other people, and some youngish guy was taking up two seats. He must have been heading to SFO, because he had a traveling backpack on his lap and a pretty big luggage bag on the seat closest to the window. He notices people coming in and avoids eye contact, keeps his nose buried in his book, keeps his white earbuds in, and ignores people who ask him to move his bag. 

Finally, an elderly lady gets on the train and she asks him (very nicely) if he'll move his stuff. He looks up at her, takes out his headphones, tells her to ""piss off,"" and then looks back down at his book. She looked shocked, but a businesswoman stood up and gave her her seat on the train.

Accidentally_Upvotes,121,,338,14za80,,1835,"I have a lifelong ~~perverted~~ **rightful** sense of justice so hopefully I'll be at home on this subreddit. My first story:

Years ago in my high school AP economics class I was assigned to sit in the corner of the room where I was flanked by a handful of very popular, *very* lazy kids. After every exam the teacher would announce (much to my chagrin) my ""high score"" to the class.

After a particularly challenging exam where I only scored 93%, the teacher announced that the guy to my right (let's call him Matt) had ALSO scored 93%, his friend behind him 90%, and the friend behind HIM 90%! Needless to say I vacillated between self-doubt and suspicion for a few days before I finally ""congratulated"" one of the 90%'ers on his score. With an impish grin he admitted that his friend Matt had been cheating off me for months and ""thanked"" me for helping ""so many people do so well"" in the class. The petty revenge gears started turning in my head for what seemed like ages before I replied ""no problem, I'm just glad to help!""

At the next exam I put my my paper in very clear view of Matt. He had been told that I was now willing to ""help"" him and his friends. I circled all wrong answers while making a special mark for the correct ones. Just before the time was up, I quickly changed my answers back when nobody was looking, turned in my exam, and smugly walked back to my seat.

What I didn't know at the time was that the cheating conspiracy didn't just involve the kids sitting next to me, but that my answers were written down and forwarded to the next 4 periods, all of which took an identical test.

One week later a record 22 people failed the exam. Matt empathetically remarked ""Oh man, Accidentally_Upvotes, did you fail too!?"" I flipped over my sheet: **100%**.

Nobody ever cheated off me in that class again.

Three years ago I made my wife a lasagna. Sauce from scratch, homemade spinach pasta, expensive cheese, the works. Hours invested - and the return? ""You should put more cheese on it like at the Macaroni Grill.""

I went out that night and bought six interior left hand doors. All of our interior doors were right handed. I cut plugs to fill the strike-plate &amp; hinge mortises, and every few weeks I change out a door or two, right hands for left, left for right. It only takes about twenty minutes now: pull the door, plug the mortises, spackle the plug seam, chisel the plug from the opposite side, hang the opposite door and sweep up. I painted the first few times, but it's a white jamb and I decided the paint smell was more suspicious than the unpainted spackle. It's a thin seam, and my wife wouldn't even know where to look.

dIbodIb,198,,465,194qln,,1824,"OK, let me preface this with two things:
1) I'm still a little (just a little) intoxicated from the time these events took place, and
2) I have the utmost respect for tipping, tippers, servers, bartenders, etc., having worked in the food industry myself. 
So let me begin.

Tonight, on my reading break back around my home city, I attended a split birthday event of two of my friends at a downtown bar. Good times were being had, all that stuff, everything was great until one point. See, I had left my jacket with coat check, but at some point I had lost my coat check ticket by accident. For a normal drunk this would certainly be disastrous, but I had my wits about me, and due to planning this couldn't be that big a problem.

See, I knew exactly where my jacket was in the coat check area, I knew my coat check number, I knew exactly what was in each pocket of the jacket, hell, I even had a PHOTO ID in one of the pockets. Easy enough to get me my jacket back, right? Nah.

After waiting in line, I explained my predicament to the attendants at the coat check in detail, which included pointing to my jacket and telling them exactly how I could prove it was mine (including the ID). In the most condescending tone possible they tell me there's *nothing* they can do, I have to wait for closing (three hours later) and a manager to get it back, long after the last skytrain (fancy talk for subway) leaves and forces me into a $65+ cab home. I ask if they can just call a manager over, I understand they can't just give out coats without tickets all willy-nilly, but with a manager called over, really taking the minimum amount of effort possible, the whole thing could've been over within 30 seconds. Nope, they clearly didn't give half a shit about me having my jacket. Well shit, there's no way I'm leaving without it and having it ""disappear"" when I go to get it the next day, I have to deal with this tonight.

Easier said than done.

After again explaining how easily this whole situation could be resolved, they decide to make their power play. Their power play turned out to be saying, word for word, ""We're going to ignore you now."" Now I'm not competitive man, I'm not a vengeful man, but I am a patient man. A very patient man. In this case, a man with unlimited patience. So I said, ""I'm going to ignore you too."" But that is not all that I did.

The petty revenge, you want? Sure thing.

If you're going to be waiting around for a very long time, like, say, for bar closing, you have to have something to lean against. In this case, l chose the empty pitcher that served as tip jar for the two coat check attendants. Immediately I saw a splash of panic in one of their eyes, but out of their principle, not a word of protest. As long as they were refusing to rectify my easily fixable situation, I refused to let them take in a  single cent of tip, leaning over the pitcher in their plain sight, with a smile on my face. Nothing. Even when they tried to get clever and set out a second one at the far side of the counter, a quick ""Oh, sorry, excuse me, gotta grab this,"" cut through the line of drunks collecting their coats and provided me with some perfect additional arm support. I was going nowhere, but they were getting nothing. Someone had to break, and it sure wasn't going to be me. I just wanted my fucking jacket, damn it.

So, for the next hour and a half (the last skytrain was long since gone), I stood and watched with glee as the two attendants worked non-stop taking in and giving out everyone's jackets without taking in a cent of tip money because of me. They had damaged me in one go, and a devastating one at that, but I got the satisfaction of watching them slowly realize the error of their stubbornness over a long, long time, their faces turning from stony half-smiles to the bitterest of longings for what those two pitchers could have meant to them. Lo and behold, a bit before closing my coat-check ticket ""was turned in"" and I got to leave with my jacket before the manager got involved. I got everything I needed while they left with nothing. Success!
Sorry if this was convoluted garbage, just read below.

**the TL;DR: Coat check attendants refuse minimum effort to get me my jacket back, I refuse them their tips for the busiest part of the night.**

brunee092,203,,442,1bmy84,,1792,"My friends bought their very first home not long after he and his wife graduated college. They had lived their whole married life in ""married housing"" which basically consisted of a one room apartment on campus. Needless to say, they were beyond excited to have their very own place and lots of room. 
Within the first day, only hours after moving in, the neighbor next to them started yelling and screaming at them to move their cars and that if they did not move their cars, he would not only have them towed but he would file trespassing charges on them for being on his property. My friends were beyond upset and didn't know what to do; they were just certain that their realtor had told them that the gravel driveway was theirs as was the very small piece of land that connected the driveway to their home. So for the time being they parked their cars directly in front of their house (practically on their lawn). In the meantime, the neighbor had rented a bulldozer and parked it in the spot that he claimed was his. He moved piles and piles of dirt into huge mounds blocking off entry to the gravel driveway. 
Seeing as how I work for the state as a social worker, I know quite a few people at the local court house. I called a few people and was directed to someone that could get me a copy of a land survey that had been done on my friends property. After pulling a few strings, I managed to get a copy of it. 
This is where it gets reallllllly good. Almost makes me want to jump up and down again while telling this story. You see....the land survey showed that the gravel drive way and the little patch of land connecting it to my friends house was THEIRS. The crazy neighbor was actually trespassing by having his rented bull dozer on their property. What makes it even better is that he had used this bull dozer to destroy their property by moving the huge mounds of dirt all over. So, I told my friends and they called the police (there was no reasoning with this man).  The police officer was just wonderful. He explained to the neighbor that he was trespassing and that he had to remove the bulldozer immediately and that he was lucky because his neighbors had declined to press charges against him for destruction of their property on the condition that he repair the driveway to its original condition so that it could be accessed by the owners. Needless to say, the neighbor hasn't caused anymore problems for my friends and avoids them at all costs.

I could have towed his car, but I wanted to confront him. 

When I wasn't too busy, he once again parked in the lot. I took my car and blocked him; I also left a note on his windshield to ""see valet at Hotel __________"". I also started the stopwatch on my watch. 1.5 hours passed and I was running to grab a car when I noticed him standing next to his car on the phone. He said to me, ""move this car I have to get out."" I replied, ""I'll move it when I have a chance"". His response was, ""I wouldn't talk to me that way, I'm a cop."" 

I hopped into the car I was bringing to a guest and slowly meandered back to the Ferrari owner after I was done. My immediate response was, ""you're a cop? I'd like your badge number and I'd like to know where you are a police officer."" He immediately denied that he ever said he was a cop, just that he had a lot of cop friends. I kindly informed him that cop or not, you simply can not park illegally and I had given him numerous warnings. I let him know that I was busy, ran back to the hotel, did a lot of nothing for ten minutes and headed back to him. He mentioned how I ""inconvenienced him"" and I retorted back, ""I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but you don't think you're inconveniencing me when I have a full lot and you illegally take my spot, making my job harder?""

""I didn't know I couldn't park here.""
I pointed right above his car, ""you didn't see the huge sign saying 'no public parking', did you?""
""I was only here for a few minutes.""
""Sir, I started my stopwatch, you were here for over an hour and a half.""
""Why are you giving me such a hard time?""
""Why did you lie to me and say you were a police officer?""
After about 30 minutes of my leaving mid conversation to check up on ""work"", he finally apologized and I moved my car out of the way.

I said, ""who told you that?""
""Your boss.""
""Oh, that's interesting. I am actually in charge of this lot and you can't park here. I will happily tow your car the next time I see you here.""
""Well, where can I park?""
I let him know the few spots that didn't belong to the hotel but let him know that chances are he will get towed. He drove off and I haven't seen him since.

Edit 2: I removed the picture. 

Edit 3: A lot of you guys have been saying that it is more pleasurable to see their face when the car is towed. I would have loved to see that but it was in a remote lot; chances are 50/50 of me being there when a tow goes down. This guaranteed that he had to see me. A few weeks ago, though I put a tag on a ladies car saying not to park in our spot and she would be towed the next time. The next day it was back, so I put another tag on her car (I like to give people the benefit of doubt). She moved her car from one spot of ours to another. I then called the tow company; when the huge tow man had showed up and put the racks around the tires (before lifting it) the lady ran out saying she would move the car. The tow guy looked at me, looked at her and said, ""that will be 80 dollars, it is what my company charges for me to come out."" The woman then said ""I don't have $80."" The tow guy looked at me, looked at her, looked back at me, smiled, hit the hydraulic button and said, ""then that will be 300 dollars, see you at the impound lot."" That was gold...

The first 2 or 3 weekends we are forgiving, tell them to move their car, and remind them that they cannot park here.

One weekend I came down separately. My parents were already down there and took a street spot. (It gets annoying to shuffle 3-4 cars around). I saw the neighbors car in our driveway again, but I had a plan this time. I parked behind them and said nothing. I usually don't need to drive anywhere as I bike most places. About an hour and a half later we hear a knock on the door. I answer it, and guess who it is, the neighbor. He wants to move his car and he is sorry that he parked there. I get in my car and flip the kill switch. I park in a bad neighborhood so I have a kill switch that will cut power to my fuel pump, basically my car will crank but won't start since no fuel is getting to the engine. After 30 seconds of trying to start a car that won't start, I tell him my car's computer needs to reset (BS story) and that takes half an hour. My family and I went out to dinner.

We come back and he was seething. He gave us a death stare for trapping his car on our property. He runs up to us and demands that I move my car. I told him that I'll move it after I go to the bathroom (this wasn't a joke I really had to take a shit). It completely slipped my mind. About half an hour later we get a knock on the door. Its the police, hilarity will ensue. The cop said that I need to move *my* car out of *my neighbor's* driveway. I asked him to repeat himself. My neighbor told the cop that *I* parked in *HIS* driveway. I asked the officer to look at where the property line is as I assured him that it was my driveway. I went on telling the officer that this is not the first time he has parked here and we have asked him to stop. I moved my car so he could pull out. It was totally worth it seeing the cop write up a trespassing ticket for my neighbor. Have fun with that fine buddy.


**Incident 2**

Fast forward 3 weeks. We see a different car parked in our driveway. We recognize it as one of theirs. The windows were rolled down a bit, and the car was manual. 

In the past I have called tow companies to tow cars off our property but they never come. However the cops will tow a car if it is obstructing traffic. This leads to my idea.

I reach inside the open window and unlock the door. I then hop in the car and disengage the E-Brake. My driveway is sloped gently down to the street. I ride the brake, and I was going to turn the wheel, but the wheel locked. I figured eh this is close enough. I re-engage the e brake, lock the doors and get out. I called the police and tell them that an illegally parked car is blocking the street. They come and in quick order tow them away. 

I was a bit short sighted on this call, I forgot that even though that the car is gone, the people that own that car are not gone. They knock on our door, and my dad answers it. He said some BS like ""Oh we just got down here about 15 minutes ago (car was towed like 2 hours ago) and I was glad to see you didn't park here. I would call the police and report your car stolen."" We never heard from him again that day.

This is why it is always important to keep receipts, everyone! I gave them the number, and they were able to track the computer back to New York, and even had the name of the individual who had the computer. 

With this information, I contacted the shuttle company. After many phone calls with higher ups of getting nowhere, and them basically telling me I was SOL, I gave them the name of the individual. Their demeanor immediately changed, and it turns out it was one of their employees who had my computer. They agreed to refund my money, as long as I would not release personal information such as names, the company name, etc. 

With the information I had, I decided to become a vigilante. I contacted the individual, posing as an Apple Genius, telling him we could upgrade his computer under a promotion for no cost, all he had to do was bring it in. 

He brought the computer in, and was arrested on the spot.

So I've made my way to the top of this queue and this girl who we shall call the ignorant cow just waltzes right up and cuts in front of me and all I could say was ""What the Fuck?!"" and replies with ""Oh well I have to print something…"" to which I replied with ""Well no shit sherlock, we all have to print something here."" she eventually states that it would be a small document and being canadian I just let her.
After she had started to print the thing she just left (I assume to go fall off a cliff or to steal the souls of orphans).
Big mistake cow… Big mistake.

This document turned out to be 90 pages long and well you see she was taking so long to come back that I decided I would enact my revenge…

I rearranged every single page in her document. Every single page was a different form of upside down and out of order.

badfan,256,,731,1ona0q,,1735,"Background: So about half a month ago, my girlfriend broke her ankle in two places. As such she has been unable to do most of the chores, and of the food preparation, or even go to work (due to having to be on her feet all day at work) leaving me a bear's share of the responsibilities. For the most part I am happy to do what I can to make her recovery all the easier.

How I have been wronged: Sometimes however I feel she could be a weensy more patient when I am making her food for her, or maybe not snap at me when I don't put her refilled water cup within easy reach.

Revenge: So my girlfriend is very particular about the neatness of some things, specifically her sandwich preparation. It's got to be neat, in the center, with no meat or cheese sticking out the side of the sandwich. For some reason how it looks before she turns it into human waste is important. Since I work very early in the morning, each night before I go to bed, I prep her breakfast and lunch and leave it where she has access to it. But every night I make her sandwich I flip one of the pieces of bread so it is pointing the opposite direction of the other slice of bread. But she can't complain to be because when she eats it, I'm safely at work.

snazzypantz,77,,487,1kovch,,1733,"I actually have this subreddit to thank for this one. 

It's morning rush hour, and I am on a fairly crowded train. All of the seats are taken, so myself and others are standing in the aisles and near the doorway. 

We pull into a station, and there is a guy in one of those big, mechanized wheelchairs at the platform. He waits patiently for us to move to middle of the car to make space, and like civilized adults, we do. Except for the girl next to me. She doesn't notice the whole car moving in, so I say, ""Excuse me."" She ignores me. So I repeat, ""Excuse me, could you move in?"" She doesn't acknowledge me, but actually TURNS AWAY, so I know she heard me. Now the whole car is looking at us, because the train won't move until this guy makes his way in. 

I know now that she is just chosing to be a massive bitch. I squeeze my ample posterior past into the human shaped empty space right next to her, probably smacking the poor people sitting down with my purse and butt. I apologize to the couple of people of whom have had their space invaded, the wheelchair gets on, and we finally move. 

I'm pissed, but what are you going to do? Well, that day, the gods of petty revenge were smiling down on me. Because just two stops later, I see her putting away her book and getting ready for her stop. But because she hadn't deigned to look at the wheelchair dude, I guess she didn't notice that he was basically blocking that exit and that people were using the other two exits of the train. So as she sees this, we've already pulled up to the stop and she has little time to make it to the other doors before they close. I immediately recalled a story I'd read here and readied myself.

I hear, ""Excuse me."" I continue reading. Then a ""EXCUSE ME!"" louder, and now I can feel her trying to push by. I make myself occupy as much space as possible in the little train aisle, but eventually she wrangles past me and makes it to the door....just as they are closing. I got to watch her, angrily muttering to herself as we pulled away, and it felt delicious. 

The train stopped in another 3 blocks, so it wasn't the end of the world for her, but I like to think of her walking those blocks in her cute heels and getting to work 10 minutes late because she couldn't be courteous for a handicapped dude.","Oh, we're ignoring people now?

The guy jumps out and starts trying to pumping gas, but apparently it turns out that spot was ""cash only"" because the credit card portion of it was broken or something.

At this point I've gotten over the fact that he took my spot and was minding my own business trying to back into position for a pump on the other side. Just as I was turning my head to back into the spot, this audi whips around and steals THAT spot from me, so now he's two for two in being a dick and I'm staring daggers at him.

He jumps out, swipes his credit card, grabs the gas pump and proceeds to try to pull it around his car to the gas tank which was **on the other side**. Looking flustered, he tugged and tugged trying to get it to reach, but it just wouldn't.

So there he stands, in a gas station having cut me off twice and unable to even pump his own gas. I think it all became too overwhelming, as he then jumps in his car and drives away.

I finally back up into the spot I was waiting for, pissed and running late, when I go to swipe my card and pump my own gas, grab my receipt and go on my merry way.

It was only when I looked at the receipt later I realized that guy had never cancelled his credit card, so the machine didn't even read mine.

fpsrandy,127,,485,1iot7m,,1720,"So I want to start off with that this was not my revenge; but I felt as a customer that I had been avenged in small way.

Today while going through/getting to a McDonalds Drive thru, I was going at what I felt was a reasonable and safe parking lot appropriate speed. I had another vehicle (a pickup truck) happily following me through the parking lot to the ordering boxes as well. 

As I reach getting to the entrance of the ordering boxes, a woman in her car comes veering in and cuts me off just before the entrance of the ordering boxes. I nearly shit myself because I had to brake pretty hard to avoid a collision, and I know the truck behind me was pissed because they were laying on their horn pretty good (this woman essentially just cut in line on both of us).

I kind of roll my eyes because if someone is in that much of a rush to get some greasy cheeseburgers in them, I will let me be. I just pull up to the second ordering box (I don't know how common this is, but McDonalds in my area just started making their drive through have two sets of ordering boxes so I guess they can help two drive through customers at a time?).

As soon as I get to the ordering box, the McDonalds employee takes my order, and happily tells me my total. At this point I hear some screaming and yelling coming from the other ordering box from the woman who just cut me off, ""TAKE MY DAMN ORDER! I WAS HERE FIRST!"".

I laugh inside kind of thinking that the McDonalds employees probably saw two cars show up suddenly and just decided to take my order first. I figure it was karma shining down on me.

I pull up to the pay window and right away I can tell the person collecting money is the one taking orders. Usually at these double drive thrus, the McDonalds employee needs to confirm that I am paying for the correct order (As there is usually two people taking orders at the same time). Today this employee doesn't she just reconfirms the cost and tells me to pull to the next window.

As I pull away from the pay window I hear car horns, and a moment later I see the truck (not the douchey woman in the car) that was behind me before is pulling up to the pay window.

As I get my food, my gut feeling is validated; seems like they keep the drive through windows open when its nice out, so I can hear the employees talking amongst themselves.

Employee 2: ""I don't know, they're honking quite a bit now""

gohomecatyouaredrunk,492,,648,1prqxv,,1714,"I was lucky enough to be the courtesy officer at my last apt and had the ability to tow cars or tag them with warning stickers. One lady would always park blocking a guy into a garage he paid extra for each month. The problem was, she would always come out before the tow truck would arrive and leave, making this poor guy late for work almost every day.  She would watch like a hawk when I got home from work (work nights at the PD in a neighboring city). One day I was able to get off work an hour early and told the guy that was blocked in to call me directly each time she did it. 

Well, he just happens to call on this day, so I get the tow truck enroute before I am even there.  I get there with just enough time to cover her entire front windshield with those bright orange stickers you see police put on abandoned vehicles on the side of the road. They are a bitch to remove when placed in a convenient location, yet alone covering the entire front windshield. Also, her tag was expired. 

All in all, she ended up having to pay $225 for the tow and storage, $125 fine for her expired tags (tow company would not release the vehicle until it had valid tags or unless it was towed off property), but the kicker is, it took her and her friend almost 8 hours to remove all the stickers from her front windshield before she could see enough to drive the vehicle, or so she said in her complaint. 

So yeah, block a nice man in and make him late to work because you are too lazy to park in open spaces 20 feet away and you get your car towed, $350 in fines, and some petty revenge in the form of pain in the ass stickers that take you 8 hours to remove... In December. Merry christmas!

It's been a week now, and ""Shelly"" has called my office no less than 15 times looking for the last $50 she claims I owe her.  Note that this was from the time when she did nothing but sit in her car for an hour.  But because I ""wasted her time"" she ""could have spent looking for a job"", I owe her $50 and she wants it NOW.

I take the call each time, laugh heartily loud enough to drown her out, then hang up on her.

But she's a persistent little bitch.  This morning I got a visit from ""Silas"", a well-groomed gentleman who hands me a business card from an attorney's office and says ""it would be better"" for me if I just paid the money because he has offered to help her sue me for damages.  Wut.

He says this is my ""last chance"" to pay up.  For 50 fucking dollars?  What the fuck?  He says that she has claimed I owe her several hundred dollars, because she mowed several times and I don't have any ""receipts"" to prove that I paid her at all.  GODDAMNIT.  I tell him I'm astonished she can pay money for an attorney when she's broke.  He says that when he wins this case he will be billing ME for court costs.  Oh hell no.

I put on my best well-mannered polite attitude and ask him why she felt it necessary to go that far.  He admits that she came to him because - get this - he is her ex-boyfriend.  Oooh, and not only her ex-boyfriend, but her babydaddy as well!

SHIT JUST GOT INTERESTING.

I notice that he says ""we"" a lot when talking about Shelly and ask him how long they have been apart.  Random polite conversation, you know.  He lights up and says that they had decided to date other people, but that he and Shelly are back together now, and have been for the past month.

REEEAAALLLLLLY.

I ask, as casually as I can, if he was aware that she was spending money going clubbing and had posted several photos to Facebook where she was rubbing against several gentlemen, doing body shots, and even tongue-kissing another gentleman in one photo.

He turns white.  He quickly covers it with ""I am comfortable enough to trust her"", she's the mother of my child, you probably misconstrued what you saw, blah blah blah.  I quickly check Facebook on my phone.  She has untagged herself, but like an idiot, her friends still have those photos online.  I show him.  He asks where the restroom is.  I point it out, then get back to work.  He left without saying goodbye.

A few things I found out this afternoon, according to the grapevine:

- ""Silas"" works for that law firm, but he is not a lawyer.  In the morning I'm going to have to call them and find out exactly what he does, and ask them why they ""allowed"" him to represent himself as one of their attorneys.  Think they'll be upset?

- Shelly and Silas are no longer together.  I assume that, like I suspected, she didn't erase incriminating photos from her cellphone.

- Tonight Shelly ended up on my little brother's doorstep and begged him for a second chance.  She told him that she had been living with her ex-boyfriend but that she had ""left"" him because she ""knew who she really belonged with"".  He literally slammed the door in her face.

disco-bigwig,214,,637,1k5vhu,,1670,"So I work as a bartender at a smaller bar in downtown Minneapolis. It is considered standard for the servers to tip me out at the end of their shift, based on a percentage of their tips, in order to compensate me for the time I spend making drinks for their customers.  Most of the servers are good for giving me 10% of their tips when they are having their free shift drink (allowed 1 rail drink or domestic tap per shift), but there is this guy who never tips back (it's not technically required). This same guy, let's call him ""B"" also feels entitled to all the free booze he wants, actually, a lot of people do, and some of the bartenders will actually give them free booze all night!  I don't usually, but sometimes I do give them an extra drink or two if they had a slow shift.


So fast forward to last night, I made somewhere between 75 and 100 drinks for this server, while having a slower night at the bar (it was nice and people wanted to sit at the patio) and I knew me must have made at least $200 based on the food/drinks he was selling. His shift was nearing an end, and a cute girl he was trying to impress came in to wait for him to get off. He comes behind the bar (a big no-no) and tells her that her drinks are on him, then tells me that she can have his shift drinks, turns back to her and suggests she order an expensive microbrew, and she does.  
Here is where the revenge part starts, i know he isnt going to tip me out for the drinks i made for him during his shift and it seems He is expecting me to just GIVE her beers. So I start a tab under his name for the craft beers. She has several more, and he gets off and asks for a rail whiskey with ginger ale, ( which he would only order as a shift drink, otherwise he would drink top shelf) and another. While I did give him his deserved shift drink, they eventually rang up a $50 tab, and when I reminded him to take care of the tab before they left, and presented him with the bill, he gave me a look like ""WTF man"". They studied the bill, and I explained the shift drink rules. He continues to argue that he should get at least 2 shift drinks and I remind him that he only ordered 1 drink that could have qualified (the rail whiskey) and reminded him of the rules. While he did pay his tab, it was grudgingly and he left no tip. She ended up paying for all her own drinks (and left a great tip) and left without him.  I saw him trying to pick up sleazy girls for the rest of the night, with no success, he was too drunk by then!

RadicalChic,179,,567,1ne9m5,,1658,"I work at an upscale restaurant that is half bar. Last night a group of pretty, well dressed women in their thirties strolled in about 12:30 and demanded a food menu. When I explained that our kitchen closes at midnight, one of them angrily pointed at another table and screeched, ""Well, THEY have food"". When I tell them that that particular table ordered their food twenty minutes prior, and that is why they in fact have food on their table, she waved me away telling me to ask the kitchen what they can do.

The kitchen relents and the ladies get a hummus. I set it down and they descend upon it, nary a thank you. They don't order anything else and I keep enough of an eye on them to make sure they are taken care of without me actually having to interact with them more than I have to. The last time I check up on them asking if they need anything I get a curt no. Five minutes later, they're gone. 

My annoyance turns to glee when I go to clear the table. One of them has left behind her iPhone. I drop it into my apron and walk up to a guy that I saw chatting them up earlier and ask if he knew them. He tells me no, that they were horrendously bitchy and that he got the fuck out of that situation as soon as possible. I tell him my experience with them, and he asks how much their bill was (it was $10). He then shoves $20 into my hand, telling me he'll cover it and I can keep the rest. I try to refuse it since it wasn't his fault that they walked out, but he insists.

I go to the office and explain the situation to my manager, who is as pissed off as I am. When one of the woman's friends calls the phone, my manger answers it up and tells her that she is welcome to come by to pick up the phone and pay her tab, otherwise she will have to wait until Monday at 5 PM to get it (we're closed on Sunday. If it had been any other customer we would have worked something out to get her phone to her earlier, but fuck her).

Well, apparently this woman has a friend who knows one of our bartenders. This friend calls our bartender, who I'm fairly close with and knew about the situation, asking if he could bring the phone to her on Sunday. He tells her no, that the woman skipped out on her bill and will need to personally come in to get her phone. The woman never came in that night.

So basically this woman will have to come back into the restaurant she essentially stole from, is going to be without her phone until tomorrow, and looked like a complete twat in front her friend in the process. Bet you wish you paid that $10 tab now bitch.

UPDATE: The bartender relented and brought the woman her phone on Sunday night on the condition that she pay her tab. According to him, she was a huge entitled bitch who just shoved a $20 at him and didn't apologize for skipping out on the bill. And yes, I could have thrown the phone away, but I felt like that was a bit much. I think the inconvenience of having to go nearly 24 hours without her phone and the embarrassment of acting like a complete shithead was punishment enough.",Skip out on your bill?

Mexiterp,233,,657,1ohyjy,,1654,"I'd love to take credit for this, but my friend was actually the evil genius.

Back in college my buddy and I worked at one of those ""goofy shit on the walls &amp; mozzarella sticks"" type of corporate American restaurants. The managers made shitty salaries so they relied heavily on performance based year-end bonuses. One of the key performance measures was cost control, meaning they'd get bonuses if they could keep their operating costs under certain levels.

Unfortunately, all of the managers were mean, bitter, broken people who took their life's frustrations out on the staff. None of us liked working for them, but we put up with it out of necessity.

One day, I'm at work and I notice my buddy drop a steak knife into the trash can as he's clearing off plates at the dish washing station. I figure it's an accident, so I reach into the trash to pull it back out but he grabs my wrist and says ""No, leave it."" I give him a puzzled look. After looking around to make sure nobody is listening he leans in and whispers:

""I've been doing it for weeks. Every time one of the managers insults me or pisses me off, I throw something in the trash. Knives, full condiment bottles...nothing big and nothing that we (the staff) would desperately miss, but enough to affect their costs. It helps me deal with their bullshit, knowing I'm hitting them where it hurts.""

Realizing the brilliance of this tactic, I followed his lead.

He was not disabled, but he would park across the handicap spot, not only making the entire area completely inaccessible to the handicapped, but blocking other drivers from getting through. After he parked, he would buy his scratch offs and a newspaper and then read the entire newspaper while leaning against the hood of his car, all the while being offensive to other customers. 

When he would buy his $20 scratch offs he would scratch them right at the counter, thereby making it impossible for other customers to check out. (He would do this because if he won money on his scratch off he would want to redeem it immediately and buy more scratch offs.)

(I would like to point out that while this revenge was very fulfilling, it did not stop him from repeating the same behavior and it was not until my manager banned him from the store that he eventually stopped coming, only to pull the same shit at a gas station a few blocks away).

I was also behind him in the grocery store one time (in that area where you buy stamps/cigarettes/lottery tickets) and he started making racial comments about the teller (which is interesting because he was Israeli w/ a heavy accent and we were in central FL where everyone is a different race) I witnessed him get escorted out and permanently banned from the grocery store. I believe the teller and the store manager high-fived. ","Scream at me, get a $250 fine.",2253,pettyrevenge

LycorisSeig,147,,421,1gdak1,,1605,"**The background**

So there’s this guy who lives near my neighborhood, who is an evil driver. I’m talking, the kind of guy who will pull into an empty right turn lane, to cut of the people in the left lane (turns left in front of them, from the wrong lane). He is always curb checking around corners and veering around other cars, even going up onto sidewalks. His car is very distinctive, so it is pretty obvious when it is him. 

He is especially bad in our Wally World parking lot near my house. He will whip around other cars, park in handicap spots with no handicap tag, and *flings* his doors open into cars parked next to him. As a permanent pedestrian, I HATE this guy with a burning passion. I was hunkering for some kind of petty revenge. 

**The set up**

So one day he comes flying past me in the parking lot. Nearly knocks me down, then honks at me and shouts “Keep out the way cripple!” Whips himself into the oncoming-lane to park crooked in the handicap spot. Flings his door open like usual and huffs his way on up to the door, shouting on his cell phone the entire way. 

I wander up to his car, and notice that he has [this]( http://imgur.com/BfvSjT7) kind of door handle. The kind that flips away from the car to open.

And I have superglue in my bag.

**The revenge**

So, very casually, I pull up on the handle, and put a gob of superglue under every handle on this jerk’s car. Push down on it a bit to make sure it sets. I want a rest anyways, so I sit on the bench right out front – about 20 metres from where his car is (parked with driver side towards me, some good fortune). 

Ten minutes later he hasn’t come out yet, so I wander on over, check the handles. No motion in them at all. Perfect.

Sit and wait, and about five minutes after that he comes out still on his celly. He’s got a fast food bag and a big drink on one hand, other has his cell phone. He goes over to his door, yanks on the handle hard as he can as is his custom…

And nearly falls backwards as the door doesn’t open. For some reason, (I guess his hand slipped?) his drink and food goes *flying*. He curses, yanks on the handle again – no give. I am laughing so hard I nearly died.

He checks his other handles – no go. He is screaming curses, and at this point I go on inside, to let the customer service desk know some guy with no handicap tags is parked in the handicap space. 

Cue laughter the whole walk home.

throwaway88198829,261,,501,1kzaqk,,1607,"At my job, most workers (myself included) keep our snacks in the break room fridge. I stack my bag of chex mix on top of my lunch. Well, about a month ago, a new hire, (we'll call her ""Amy"") kept stealing my chex mix. After a couple days of this happening, I decided class action petty revenge needed to be taken. I bought a bag of chocolate chex mix the next day to see if she would take that kind as well. She did. After work that day, I bought another bag of chocolate chex mix and some cat food. I emptied out all the chex mix, poured some cat food in a bowl, covered it in chocolate and put it back in the chex mix bag. 

The next day at work, I saw her go into the break room. I saw her conceal the bag and make her way back to her desk. She opened it, and without looking at the contents, scooped up a giant handful of my special revenge mix, and began to chew. I sat at my desk, sipping a Coffee with a shit eating grin, knowing what would happen next. 

Her eyes widened, and her face drained of color. She tried to get up, but the horrid taste was causing her to gag uncontrollably. She tripped over her chair, spitting out the vile concoction of cat food and chocolate as she frantically stumbled trying to keep her balance. She got up and hurried towards the bathroom, looking like she was about to cry. I'd never felt so damn good. 

EDIT:

As requested, here's what happened after the great cat mix revenge:

""Amy"" never took my chex mix again. She'd been taking other people's snacks as well, so she was a known food thief at the office, but since she's quite physically attractive, nobody really called her out on it. I never mentioned to anyone working there I did it, I kept it to myself. I've only ever been seen at the office eating original chex mix, none of the spin off flavors, so nobody thought it was me. The discussion about her ""freak out"" reached the conclusion she was either sick or had an allergic reaction. To this day, I enjoy sitting at my desk with a bag of original chex mix in plain sight sipping my coffee with that same shit eating grin whenever she looks my way. There's no doubt in my mind she knows I did it. ","Go ahead, eat my chex mix bitch",2108,pettyrevenge
sparklespoon,190,,471,1ll70q,,1602,"I live in apartment building with 4 apartments and three assigned parking spaces, one of which is mine. For the past few weeks one of my neighbors has started to park his car blocking mine in. After talking with the landlord I found out that he does not have any spot in the drive way, she said she would either have him move the car or tow it. He moved the car... temporarily. A few days later it was back blocking me in, I called the landlord, he moved it a few hours later. And then again, and again, and again despite knowing it blocked my car and he was not allowed to park there. His blocking me in made my roommate late for her first day of student teaching, me walk in the rain a few times back and forth from campus, and was rude about having to move his car.
On Thursday he surprisingly wasn't blocking me in and I drove to meet my parents a few miles away. When I got home he was back in the driveway and I parked behind him. On Friday I got drunk and lost my keys. I'll be the first to admit that I was a little pleased he was finally the one blocked in knowing the only way he would get out is if everyone besides our two cars were left in the driveway- which never happens.
That takes us to this morning when I found a note from him requesting I move my car IMMEDIATELY because he needs to get out. I called to try and talk to him so we could come to the understanding that it was my spot according to our lease and he had to stop blocking me in. He became rude on the phone bitching about how his car has been blocked for 4 days, that he lost his job because of it, and that I have an attitude problem. He then hung up the phone on me and sent me a text telling me to deal with the police... so I did. Guess who really doesn't care? The police. And our landlord. And me.

zimelm,307,,622,1iqtxo,,1598,"I was reminded of this story that my aunt had told me while commenting in a thread on another post. It got buried amongst the other comments so I thought I'd tell her story here as it's own post. Sorry if you have already read this story before in that comment thread. 


My aunt is a retired police officer. A few years ago, before she had retired, she went through a McDonald's drive through in her police cruiser. She got a really weird feeling when the McDonald's employee handed her order to her. He had this smirk on his face and was acting overly nice in a really fake way (that's how she described it me). Her 6th sense was going off like crazy, so she took her food and pulled into a spot in the parking lot to examine her burger. Sure enough, there was a pretty obvious, phlegmy loogie right in the middle of her burger. Since food tampering is a pretty serious offense, she went inside the restaurant to confront the drive through employee. He denied over and over again and then had the nerve to tell my aunt that she had no proof he had done anything to her burger. His smugness sent her over the edge, so she left the McDonald's with the burger in her hand as the evidence that the drive through moron claimed she didn't have. A little later two other police officers arrived at the McDonald's to question the douche bag. They told him that the burger was all the evidence they needed, and if they needed to, they could easily get DNA sample from it. I'm not sure whether they would have actually used the resources to run a DNA test, but they didn't need to in the end because the kid broke down like a sputtering idiot and confessed to spitting in the burger. I believe that he got charged with felony food tampering. ",My police officer aunt gets her food tampered with because of the mere fact that she is a police officer. Revenge ensues.,2220,pettyrevenge
gerudo_pirate,105,,756,1oklfu,,1585,"My ex-boyfriend (while we were still together) lived in a house with 2 other people. One guy lived on the other side of the house, and was never there.The room next to my ex's was occupied by a female teacher. She was honestly one of the most messed up people I've ever met, severe alcholic, well into her forties, kept hitting on everyone else who came into the house (most of whom were in their early twenties). 

The thing that annoyed both of us most, however, was that she and her on-and-off boyfriend kept knocking on our door with stupid questions a few minutes after we started having sex. Mostly it was asking if the internet was working for us, but it could be about anything, and although we always told them we were busy, it was still extremely annoying to be interrupted by it. And it wasn't like the house wasn't noisy, in fact, we knew that the teacher could hear us having sex, because she told us she enjoyed hearing it, and that we should cuddle more afterwards, yup, awkward as fuck.

One night, we came home. She was already wasted. We are about to go into my ex's room, when the doorbell rings. My ex opens it, and lets in a guy in his early twenties. The guy had come for the teacher, and they went into her room together. I was in a very giddy mood, being both drunk and stoned, and decided I would eavesdrop on them. Turned out the guy was a friend of the teacher's boyfriend, and they were talking about how rough the relationship was, because they were in another fight. Then, I heard her trying to seduce him, him saying he couldn't do that to his friend, her saying he didn't need to find out, really corny soap-opera stuff. After a while I can hear them as they start making out. I decide this is my chance, I quickly report back to my ex about what has happened, and take a moment to suppress all my giggles. I go back into the hallway and start knocking on her door, calling her name. At first they turned quiet, but she didn't answer. I knock more, telling her it's me and I have something really important to ask her. She says: ""What is it?"", I ask her if she could come to the door, after a minute she comes. I then proceed to ask her if her internet is working. She says she doesn't know, I ask if she could check, she says not right now, I ask her if she can check later, she says sure, I ask how long that would be, she says she isn't sure. Can she give me an indication? Maybe 15 minutes. I continue to ask her a few times to please not forget, trying to drag the conversation out as long as possible. When it's over I go back to my ex's room. A few minutes later the guy leaves.

I know it's not much, but it gave me an intense feeling of satisfaction. ","When you interrupt me having sex, I'll screw up your cheating.",2341,pettyrevenge

Lately, this one lady comes in like clockwork on Fridays, when we are slammed, right in the middle of rush. A few times, I had the displeasure of closing out her order, every time I cash her out she throws her card or cash on the counter, I have to pick it up and finish her order. I always hand her back her change or card/receipt and am very polite, basically I completely ignore the act on the outside, but on the inside I am fuming. After the 4th or 5th time (not really keeping track, more than 3 less than 10) of her doing this, fed up, I decided that if I was not good enough for her to hand me the currency like a human being than I was also not good enough to hand her anything. 

She comes in, Friday, middle of rush, I see her, give her a nice welcome with a smile (inside I'm like ""This fucking bitch again.""), get her name, find her order, tell her the total--BAM money on the counter, left with my hand out. Pick up the cash, make change-- BAM change thrown on the counter, left her with her hand out (I could see the look of disbelief on her face, mouth agape, eyes open.) grabbed her food, she's picking up her change, leave food on the counter too, she takes her food and leaves. 

First time no one said a thing, second time she made a comment as I was getting her food about how rude I was for doing that, and another customer chimed in that ""You're throwing money at him first, maybe you should show some respect and you'll get some.""

EDIT: The Aftermath: After Snarky Lady left, the one customer who spoke up (also happened to be a woman, a little older and wiser I guess) told me : ""God, the nerve of some people, what a bitch!"" I laughed and told her it was just part of the job, completed her order, and I gave her a free 20 oz. (""for having to wait for so long"" is what I told my employees so they wouldn't raise any questions). She dropped 5 bucks in the tip jar, told me it was to make up for that ""rude bitch"".

ktmrider119z,386,,782,1l9fsa,,1544,"Alright I have a story of my shitty room-mate from 2 years ago.  If its too pro, let me know and ill relocate it accordingly.  Also, Its long, hang in there.

Background on room-mate:

My piece of shit room mate (POS from here on out) was horrible.  He was going to college for no reason and was on a full ride through financial aid and bragged constantly about it.  The problem with that is, his parents are millionaires and he makes a shit ton of money showing cattle while I am white and squarely middle class and get only $500 per year in financial aid while paying out of pocket and with loans.  He also bought a brand new $40k truck while in college because he doesnt have to pay a cent for his college education, just to give you an example.  Well he gets shit grades, cheats on every assignment and test, and parties nightly especially on ""thirsty thursday"" (being an engineering student, I dont understand this tradition as I havent the time for it).  He comes home black out drunk at 2 in the morning and is extremely loud, like windows shaking loud.  He also DRIVES in that condition.  He is also a huge douche with house keep up.  Will not provide paper products at all ( I started hiding my TP as he'll go through a jumbo roll PER DAY), will not clean, and generally makes a huge mess.  He is also very abusive to his GF. I could go on but nah you get the picture.

The Offense:

 He was so shitty to everyone all the time this was just the straw that broke the camel's back.  I and the other tenants (3 of us) picked a weekend to clean the house. Everyone agreed, even POS did.  Then halfway through the week POS informs us that hell be leaving for the weekend so wont be able to clean (third time this has happened).  He has also FILLED except for one shelf our fullsize fridge (only one in the house) with shitty beer.  He also decides to thaw raw meat not on a plate and wrapped in nothing but a paper wrapping on top of all of our (he 3 other tenants) food (it obviously leaked through the paper and got all over our food and the fridge).  We tell him to remove the beer before he leaves and to clean his shit up and replace our food that has been contaminated with raw meat.  We remind him almost hourly of his for the rest of the week.  Friday comes around and by the time the rest of us get back from class, POS is gone.  He has done NOTHING.  We were PISSED.

The Revenge:

We cleaned the house that weekend anyway.  We also took the thawed meat from the fridge and since his truck was still there (his GF drove that weekend) we grabbed his spare keys and spread that shit all over the engine.  Have fun when that puppy heats up.  We then removed the beer (80 something cans) from the fridge and set it in our yard with a sign ""Free beer"" and waited.  3/4 of the beer was gone by that night so we took the rest of it back inside and shook the shit out of every single can then hid them all over the house.  We also replaced his pillow with cans of beer since he launches himself onto his bed.  We then wait.

POS returns and being the definition of stupid doesnt notice anything.  Goes to his room and flops onto his bed THUNK ""What the fuck!!!!! Why is there beer in my pillow?!""  We are dying laughing but manage to keep it quiet.  He confrints us about it and we just tell him he should have moved his beer and not ditched cleaning, he never noticed most of it was missing.  He was pissed as his tiny brain couldnt register hat he was supposed to clean too and in general pitch inand NOT be a douche.  Then came the kicker.  throughout the week he kept complaining that his truck smelled awful and he cluldnt figure it out.  Well that thursday, he went out to get blasted again.  We threw the free beer sign into the back of his truck with his beer.  2 in the morning rolls around and he busts through the door again near black out drunk bitching about how ""some nigger stole my beer!""  OH, I forgot to say he was also under age at the time.  He then leaves to go to his GF's house driving himself again while drunk so we call into the cops wih his truck description and where hes headed as were sick of dealing with drunk POS and him endangering everyone else in the town.  He gets busted, blows a ridiculously high BAC and gets DUI and an underage.  The college drops his financial aid and he has to resell his truck to pay for college.

Justice is served ass-hole.  Now you get to live like the rest of us plebs.

Sanderf90,117,,435,1dh244,,1536,"For the past few months One Direction-fever has taken my home into its cold unforgiving grasp. My sister has been more than obsessed with those kids and, well teenagers will be teenagers.

Months go my sister learned about a One Direction concert in our home country (Belgium). As a good brother I decided to get her a ticket (because I could).

As the months passed on she started to realize a bit of a problem. The concert would be done at midnight, in the other side of the country (this is Belgium, so it isn't that far). Neither my father nor I could pick her up from the concert, so after looking for parents who were driving their kids as well (she told me none of her other friends were going, note that all tickets were also sold out), and trying to fix my schedule so I could pick her up, I ended up finding the ideal solution.

A busservice was riding, specifically for the concert, from my town to Antwerp where the concer was taking place, and back. It seemed perfect and she agreed with me, so I paid another 20 bucks for the bus fare and arrenged her a seat in that bus.

That was 2 weeks ago. Three days ago she suddenly tells me she won't take the bus afterall (the bus was already paid and there was no refund possible). She had discovered the bus would arrive an hour before the concert, which according to her was not early enough. The concert starts at 7PM, but she wants to be in that city at 10AM. Her plan is to go to the boy's hotel and attempt to get autographs.

I told her it was unlikely she'll get autographs, which made her freak out. She started throwing stuff, screaming at me, calling me the worst words and telling her how I was taking everything away from her.

I pointed out that without me there wouldn't be a concert for her, and for all intends and purposes that ticket is mine and I can just sell if I wanted to. 

This made her go berserk and she shouted that I should start treating her more like an adult, and stop trying to arrenge everything for her.

I just told her I wasn't comfortable with her taking the train from and to that city on her own, especially if I already paid for the busfare (on her request).

She then told me she had arrenged for going with the train with her friends for the past few months, which is a blatant lie as she stated she didn't have friends that were going to the concert only a few weeks back. 

Now comes the revenge bit, note it is very petty and I could probably do more to have my revenge, but I'm too much of a softy for that.

My sister is notorious for never setting an alarmclock. She depends on me or our father to wake her up in time for school and other things. If we don't do that, she'll easily spend the entire day sleeping.

She was taking the 7AM train, but it is currently noon and she's still sleeping. I won't wake her up, even if it means she misses the concert. She has until 5PM to wake up (which should be reasonable, I think) so she can take the bus like I arrenged for her. If she gets angry for not waking her up, I'll tell her she asked me to treat her like an adult. 

UPDATE:

At 2:15 PM she woke up. She was of course grumpy and started demanding why I did not wake her up earlier. I reminded her that she wanted to be treated as an adult, and told her that if she had waken up in time, she could have left without a problem.

The message came across, though there was some shouting involved. She has locked herself up in her room now, and I'm going to leave her and her emotions alone now. She did apologize for her behavior, which I think is progress. She'll be able to go to the concert and have a good time later today.

So with my notes being typed out, and it not being any extra work, I decided to start posting my notes on my classes facebook page. We made this page about a year prior incase someone forgot their homework, or flatout needed help with something. So weekly I would post my notes for a few classes, and people loved me for doing this. But one day this guy who we shall call Jerk Jock (JJ for short) begins fucking with me in class. JJ starts doing shit like throwing my lunch in a tree, stealing my mouse in class and start fucking up all my shit, and even goes as far as to report me to teachers telling them I played video games in class (All the teachers trusted me and knew I didn't play video games in class though if a teacher did think I was playing video games in class, I would have been banned from using my laptop in school, gotten some detentions, and maybe even suspended) So this guy really want to fuck with me because he thought I wouldn't do jack shit because I am passive as fuck. Well I know for a fact that he flat out stopped taking notes in several classes and entirely relied on my notes for tests. So that Friday when I go to post my weekly notes, I just hit the lil ole ""Let every one see this except: JJ"" button.

The night before the test (Dumb bitch doesn't study before that) JJ comes on our page wondering where my notes were, and asking people if he could use theirs. I then proceed to tell everyone if anyone gave him my notes I would stop posting all my notes forever.

He failed the next 3 tests we took until he finally started taking notes again. One of his friends told him about what I did, and he confronts me and makes me look like a dick in front of everyone, until I remind him what he did. I then told him that if he stops fucking with me then I would continue to post them for him, but one more piece of bullshit, and I cut him off for good.

I had been working at my job for a few years and decided to apply for the management program.  No easy task to even get in and when I went through 8% of the people who were accepted actually completed the course. The course was a major ball breaker and those in it were usually regarded as sub-human throughout. It sounds weird, but it was effective in trimming the fat. Those directly associated with the course were trained in the art of balancing this facade with actual learning points. The problem usually came from those who saw this and assumed it was cool to be an asshole too.

The actual story:

I get told that I’m going to continue my course and the horrific jobs that entailed, but also drive the big boss around and play chauffeur for a while.  I go to the guy in charge of the vehicles and other logistical boringness and get the boss’s vehicle and go about my way. Dude was uber douche throughout our entire interaction – I’ll call him Major Douche. After days of babysitting this stupid truck and massive amounts of arduous awfulness it comes time to head back to the main complex and return to some semblance of normalcy.  I park the boss’s truck in the boss’s reserved spot, boss leaves and I start taking care of things that need to be done. Putting the boss’s work truck back is on the list, but not the top.

I return about an hour later to an empty parking spot. These work trucks do not have keys. Super. Someone stole my boss’s truck that I’m responsible for. We were somewhere where anyone not working in the same place wouldn’t have access to the truck, so it wasn’t in a chop shop. Being optimistic (which never works out well for me), I walk across the street to MAJ Douche’s office. MAJ Douche knew I was coming to him with this truck and maybe he saw it and just took it back saving me an errand. Nope.
MAJ Douche shifts into maximum-over-douche and tries to take a page from the instructors’ handbook.  So after an obscenely condescending ‘I-got-you-now-fucker’ speech he essentially denies having the truck (I gleaned he did and was hiding it ‘to teach me a lesson’) and smugly sends me on my way because, “if [I] don’t find it, [I’m] done for. Figure it out!” 

I am in no mood.

So instead of panicking and running around on the impossible scavenger hunt like he expected as he chuckled his way back to his office, I walk my ass straight to the complex’s police station (we have our own cops. Not security guards. Arrest power, throw your ass in jail cops). I find two cops and explain the situation. I tell them I’m in the management course and MAJ douche has issued a ‘learning challenge’ of sorts and I’m supposed to figure out how to properly handle it.  The senior cop laughs and says, “MAJ Douche? I fucking hate that guy. We’re in!”

I watched from a comfortable distance as the cops roll in and smugly say they are investigating grand theft auto and he was the prime suspect and in a world of hurt.  Quivering and sweating he threw out his side of the story and the cops played it better than I could have imagined. This went on for 15 glorious minutes. Eventually he led them to his locked hiding place and all was well.

The big boss walked out of his building and asked me what the hell was going on. I explained how I was overcoming a training related challenge and told the story. He laughed and we stood together and watched the rest of the drama unfold.  

The cops left and I walked over. “Hey sir, I see we got the truck back. Good news, huh?” He glared and stormed off. I throw in a, “Sir, isn’t that what I should have done with a stolen vehicle?” He slams the door.  I engaged smug face myself and turned back across the road. 

*I know, technically, I did have the truck stolen from me and I’m an asshole. But, technically, in that situation one would report it to the cops. He started the ‘technically’ game and I saw it through.*

SoonerE,146,,539,1o813r,,1528,"I was inspired by a previous post by a parent who got some sweet revenge on his kids in the store.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm a single father of 5 kids (4 at home (17,12,12,12), 1 in college (19)).  

I get home from work a few nights ago and everyone is lounging on the couch after school and eating snacks and having a grand old time.  I came home as I usually do, ready to cook dinner and eat with my children.  

I immediately notice the sink overflowing with dishes, the dryer full of clothes, floor needs swept, etc.  Each has their set chores to do every day.  

So I started cleaning the kitchen (kid #1's chore today) while they said ""Hi Dad"" and just continued on their merry way.  Then went and done a load of laundry (kid #2's chore).  You get the drift.  

This went on for about an hour until one of them said ""Dad, I'm hungry, what are we going to eat""  

Oh..  eat you say??  That sounds like my chore...  I don't have time to do my chores children, I'm too busy doing yours.  This is as I'm finishing the last chore and sitting down with a sandwich and a glass of tea.  House clean and ready to watch some baseball.  

The chores were done the next day when I got home.  Funny how that works.  ","Oh!! It's no chore day, I had no idea",2067,pettyrevenge

FIL is a fairly conservative guy, and didn't really like my choice of hair style.  He would often make comments like ""Your hair looks gay."" and ""You're not gay."" while combing his hair down.

I tried my best to ignore him, because you know, gotta keep peace in the family.  After a couple of times though I started to get really annoyed.  I do not want my kid to grow up homophobic or calling people gay.  So I found the perfect thing to say.

I spike up little Aaron's hair, and bring him over to the in laws house.  Sure enough FIL starts in on the whole ""gay"" routine.  So I say, ""I think he's a little young to know if he's gay or not, but let's ask him.  Hey Aaron, do you like sucking cock?""

FIL's mouth dropped agape, then snapped shut.  He's never brought it up again, and hopefully he understands why it's inappropriate to use that sort of language around a child.

Carnephex,172,,253,148etz,,1508,"Okay, a little while back I was an HVAC technician working for a company here in the limp wang of the country, Florida. 

While schlepping myself around repairing, installing, duct taping and in general making shit happen in a all together too sweaty living I've met many different kinds of people. Some love it when you show up because they're sweaty and miserable and they know you'll make them as frosty as an ice queen by the time you blow out of there; and others just fucking hate you because you happen to be the avatar of their cheapness come to visit them in their hour of defeat.

Now when installing an AC system, legally, you need to have it inspected by the County or City Building Dept. Usually these inspections are cursory at best and a real bear if you've drawn a pissed off inspector. Or if not pissed off, someone looking for a bribe(this is Florida, bribery is a part of life).

This day I drew a man looking for a bigger than normal bribe. Typically, it's $50. This guy wanted $150. Shit, my take-home on the job was only $200 and I wasn't about to split that with an over-zealous asshole with a clipboard. 

I refused to pay and he struck my inspection card with the big red pen. This meant that he found everything incorrectly installed, even if he didn't look. The miserable fuck. This meant I had to reapply for another inspection at $100(the first one's free). So this asshole had cost me time AND money. This meant vengeance! 

So I waited a couple weeks and followed him home from a busy day of gouging blue collar guys plying their trade skills. I still hadn't formulated what I wanted to do to him, but it was going to be fucking rude. Thankfully, he lived alone on a busy street but not many other houses and some long lines of sight. 

Perfect. 

So I watched and waited, hearing stories from other guys about him. The numbers never changed really, except they got more expensive the bigger the job. That fuck. 

When he left for work one morning and I didn't have anything to do, I slipped on my coveralls with the City Public Works Dept logo slapped on the back and did the measuring on his windows and doors. Wood framed house, no siding that stuck out too far, good strong timbers. Perfect. Took note of where his water meter was and checked what type of electrical meter system he had. All easily accessible. 

I worked a few construction sites over the next few weeks and collected some sheets of leftover plywood. Not the lightweight stuff, but heavy fire rated sheathing. The sheets I cut to size from the measurements I took earlier on. I stowed these pieces one by one and collected a few other things. 

Finally, the day of reckoning had come. I'd had another run-in with that greedy fuck, and again, I refused to pay the exorbitant bribe rates. That was the last fucking straw. I waited until the next week which was a government holiday, 4 day weekend, that sort of thing. Either way, the very places he'd need to call would be closed to deal with the shitstorm that was coming. 

He trundled off to work that morning while I was watching from down the road in a rented white pickup truck filled with precut wood and my framing tools. Again I was in my faux city coveralls and hard hat. I backed the truck right up and started setting the wood panels around the house corresponding to their measurements. Once those were set up, I started whacking them in with the framer as fast as I could with plenty of extra nails. Windows and doors, front and back. Boarded up as tight as you could please. 

Then I moved on to the electrical meter can and pulled that free, padlocking the panel shut. Then it was off to the water meter which I shut down and detached. That was padlocked shut too. The meters went into a cardboard box and into the truck. 

For the coup de grace, I slapped up ""Building Condemned by Court Order"" and ""Caution: Hazardous Materials Within"" sticker signs on the plywood window covers and a faked but real court order on the front door declaring the house unsafe because of methamphetamine production. (You come across this kind of stuff in the course of your days doing construction, and if you find extras, why not grab em?)

I then cleaned up my work, made sure everything looked kosher and hauled ass for a Publix sub. I needed to be back there to watch the festivities. 

After getting lunch and ditching the extra tools back at the house, I chilled out and sat in a parking lot down the road with a pair of binoculars and a good book. I didn't wait long as my target came home early and was completely floored at seeing his house boarded up with those horrid green and orange stickers all over the place. 

I watched him call the cops and when they showed up, there was much pointing at the signs and eventually they left without pulling the wood off. The court order looked way too real and the Clerks office was already gone for the weekend so there wasn't anyone to confirm it was a fake. This was part of the plan. 

I watched him try to pull the wood off and since I used way too many nails he just couldn't do it. I smiled so hard I thought my face would crack. It was beautiful watching that man have a breakdown in his front yard, enjoying the schadenfreude from a half mile away. Poetry. 

I drove away after watching for as long as I dared and spent the weekend enjoying life and doing service calls. I still smile when I think of that day. The inspector was fired a couple years later by the city when people started really bitching about the bribery accusations.

I was pulling up to an intersection and there were 2 cars and I decided to split them to get to the front of the line. The right car was in a right turn ONLY lane. The man in the right car decided he didn't like this and reached out and tried to grab my helmet as I passed his car. Doing this caused my head to snap back and I had to slam on the brakes to stop from going into the intersection with my head back.

I was quite upset but I remained calm, looked at him and asked him why he thought it was OK to try and kill me. He laughed and said ""*Don't let me ever see you do that again faggot*"". I smiled, looked at him in the  eyes and asked him if he was hitting on me, and if he wanted to go on a date later. He did not like this and decided to spit in my face. 

I was raging now, staring at him, unsure what I should do. So I put my visor down on my helmet, leaned in close and slammed the top of my helmet on his partially open window. It smashed into pieces as I dropped the clutch and sped out of there.

4me4you,101,,449,1jphj3,,1502,"I have mild to moderate acne all my life and control it with oral and topical medications. When I was a teen, my sister was home from college. My sister has very mild acne, maybe one pimple a week.

 I kept my topical medication in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. I noticed my topical medication was rapidly depleting since my sister came home. I decided to hide my medication in my room. A day later, my sister asked where it was, I told her I hid it as it was not her medication to use. She made a big deal saying ""oh mom pays for it and you don't so I can use it"" I went to my mom and she said ""oh, just let your sister use it"" probably to keep peace in the house.

I was annoyed as it was almost over and my refill wouldn't be due until next week and I know my skin breaks out when I don't use it. I ended up having a dermatologist appointment that week and he put me on a stronger medication, a retinol based med. He warned me it may cause redness and to avoid this, mix with lotion and use very little for at least a week. 

We picked up the prescription and put it in the bathroom. I did what the derm suggested by using a ""dime size amount"" and mixed with lotion. I didn't tell my sister this warning. 

By the second day my sister woke up with a very red face and skin peeling. She was very upset as she planned on going to the beach that day. My skin was fine as I had the warning. I told her that is why you dont use other people's meds. She stopped using my meds after this. My skin never looked better.

Nerflord,71,,327,1bkkp2,,1506,"I used to work in a 24 hour fast food joint by a popular club. At about closing time, we'd get the overflow of drunks. Most just wanted a greasy snack before they went home, and probably 90% were perfectly civil and hilarious.

However, as many who serve the late night drunk crowd know, there are douchebags that seek to bolster their self esteem and social standing, by harassing easy targets (like fast food workers who have to switch off their verbal self defence mechanisms to provide 'good customer service').

We had a regular who would spend his time hitting on customers and staff (me on one occasion) after what was probably another night of disappointment. He clearly thought he was charming. 

We named him 'TLE' (The Lynx Effect - after an advertising slogan for a deodorant named Lynx, which is the Australian branding for Axe Body Spray).

TLE would hang out in the dining room, sometimes with a crowd of friends that he would play to. After being politely told to stop standing on the seats, TLE decides he wants a burger, so he orders some monstrosity loaded with a stupid amount of bacon that he expects kudos for ordering (I give kudos for bacon, not wasted bacon).

When it comes time to pay, TLE opens his wallet and finds only a parking ticket and a condom. He hands the condom across and says, 'You accept these as payment, right?' Cue polite laughter.

Without a beat, my surpressed verbal defences kick in.

'Usually, sir. However, not when they've clearly been in your wallet for so long.'

He was stunned, his mates laughed and my manager at the time had to hide in the backroom lest someone saw her game face drop. After that, some lady (whom he had been clumsily hitting on) asked if I accepted tips.

revengethrowawayman,187,,464,1fa046,,1490,"**the background**

my younger sister used to date a real douchebag. he started out as an ok dude, I had no problems with him, seemed like a nice enough guy. but as time went on he became really aggressive, mean, controlling and jealous.

Some examples:

* he and my sister had a little drunken spat at a party; he pushed her and told her ""Watch yourself because I could fuck any girl here.""

* he borrowed her car without permission, dented the front bumper and didn't tell her or pay for it.

* he would obsessively check her phone and internet history to make sure she wasn't talking to other guys. 

* he would get pissy and upset if she left the house wearing anything that showed her cleavage, or shame her into changing. my sister is well-endowed, unless it's a t-shirt or it closes at the neck there's going to be cleavage (big boob problems). 

* during the very last legs of their relationship, he started telling her he'd ""found her account"" and ""knew she was posting nudes."" They were nude pictures (face removed) of a girl that was not my sister. I think he *actually* believed they were her. he was losing his grasp on reality.

* after the breakup, he went CRAZY. started calling her at work (they work at the same place) repeatedly, had a meltdown on the phone. came in to work, she wasn't there, meltdown. started texting her, calling her a slut and a whore and a bitch and then turning around and telling her ""I love you babe, come home, the cat misses his mommy."" one time she came home from a casual date a few weeks after the breakup, and as soon as she was dropped off she got a text saying ""moving on already huh?"" fucking creep.

one time he hit her up for sex post-breakup (""you know what, I don't even care about this relationship, I don't want you back, I just want to fuck"") and when my sister went over to their shared apartment (I scolded her for that) he ended up just crying for two hours. 

I could go on, but I won't, because it's making me angry.

anyway! after they broke up, there was a long period where I didn't see him and that was awesome. my sister was pretty miserable, as he was her first love, and she was in denial about a lot of the horrible treatment she got. as much as I told her that she deserved better, that she shouldn't be treated like that by anyone, let alone someone who claims to love her, they were together for almost three years. but eventually she started conceding that, yeah, it was a toxic relationship.

**the revenge**

come first day of my winter quarter, I found out ex-shithead and I had both signed up for the same class.

for god knows what reason, he saw me and decided to sit near me. he said ""hey revengethrowawayman, it's been awhile, no hard feelings about [sister] right?"" I kinda shrugged and he said ""yeah, no, **she was kinda a crazy bitch anyways, no offense**."" really??? I had a strong urge to laugh and/or deck him in the face and/or some combination thereof but I just smiled quickly and turned back to the front. I hate him so much.

our professor collected weekly assignments on thursdays; a few essay questions, a few pages typed. we didn't have tests in-class, most were take-home and replaced the regular assignment due on Thursdays. as soon as you came to class and our professor arrived, we were supposed to go put our assignment on the podium at the front.

I got up the first thursday to turn in my assignment and ex-douchebag holds out his paper to me, eyebrows raised. I was about to laugh pityingly or tell him to fuck off and take it up himself but then... I smiled and took it. I walked down to the front of the class and when I was sure he wasn't looking (buried in his phone) I stuck his assignment in my pocket and put mine and mine only on the podium. 

our teacher told us the first day she wouldn't give us our annotated work back until the end of the quarter but she would have a spreadsheet online for us to check the grades for our assignments. I worried briefly he'd notice he got a 0 for the first assignment, but... come next thursday he hands out his assignment to me again. and again. and again.

and each and every time, it went in my pocket and then into the recycling bin (save the planet guys). on the days he had it that was, lazy fuck. I turned in a few of the lower-point assignments so as not to arouse suspicion, but the take home tests found a comfy home in the big blue plastic bin outside the building.

I saw him on the day of the final arguing with my teacher, but I whizzed through the test and hauled ass out. I don't think it's possible for him to have passed the class. have fun retaking intro to psych, asshat.

**tldr: sister's abusive ex boyfriend puts his fate in my hands. bad move.**

edit: since some are asking about whether or not he found out/confronted me, yes and yes. he obviously put two and two together (for which I am proud of him) after the teacher probably asked why he'd turned in so little. he sent me some VERY ugly, expletive-filled text messages and threats. he called a bunch too, but I ignored them. he also texted my sister similar things.

FredFltStn,64,,567,1ngdek,,1473,"This is an x-post from /r/TalesFromRetail [here](http://redd.it/1nfvgn). A commenter thought I should post it here. I'll remove if it doesn't belong.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It's 2400 square foot of fireworks heaven.

I've posted a few other stories [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/FredFltStn/submitted/) if you're interested.

**STORY:**  A guy came in to pick up some fireworks. He was having a party and wanted to put on an impressive show for his friends. I spent about 20 minutes walking him through the store, explaining the different items to him, and showing him videos of the stuff to help him pick out exactly what he wanted. He mentioned a couple of times how he usually goes to &lt;other store&gt; and how their prices were cheaper. Each time, I’d apologized, but I let him know that our prices were usually less than theirs, and that I thought that we had beat them on each of the items in question.

The third time it happened, I walked to our counter and grabbed the new catalog from &lt;other store&gt;. I found the stuff he had mentioned, and showed him how we were in fact cheaper on every item that he had selected (and that’s why I keep catalogs from my competitors on the counter). In fact, on a couple of items, we were about half of &lt;other store&gt; price. Amazingly, he didn’t seem happy about it, but he kept shopping.

By the time he was ready to check out, he had a rolling flat cart full of stuff. It was mostly large assortment packages, finale cakes, and big mortar kits, with a few smaller items here and there. To speed things up, and prevent us from having to unload all the big kits onto the counter, I started calling out the prices for the bigger items to the cashier (my dad). About halfway through, I got to one of the largest items, a massive mortar kit, and called out the price of $199.95. When my dad was ringing it in, the register display looked like it had screwed up, so I stopped him and went to check it out. Sure enough, the item had rung in at $19.95. 

While I’m talking to my dad about it, the customer walks over and demands to see the mistake. I show him that the last entry was for $19.95 instead of $199.95. He immediately tells me that I have to sell the item to him at the price that rang up. I showed him that the item itself had the correct price tag on it, and that the cashier had just miss-keyed it when he had rung it in. The guy gets agitated and repeatedly starts telling me that I have to legally sell the thing to him at that price since the cashier had rung it in like that. I calmly explained that if the item had been priced wrong, I would sell it to him at the incorrect price, but since it was just a miss-key, we would just void the last item rung in and do it again. Now armchair lawyer guy (ALG) starts yelling that he knows his rights and that I’m breaking the law if I have the cashier change the price and I don’t sell it to him at the wrong price.

Now I’ve had the staff screw up before when doing pricing, and if we put the wrong LOWER price tag on something, that’s what I’m going to sell it to you for. I also know that unless it’s an **ADVERTISED** price, I don’t **LEGALLY** have to do it, but if I screwed up, I’m going to eat that mistake and re-price the item after we’re done.  (Side note to Josh C. - Happy birthday today! And next time, pay attention to the damn price list when you’re using the price gun, because I know most of these screw-ups have your name on them. Also, go back to school and don’t do drugs).

ME:  Are you telling me that legally, even if we screwed up, I can’t have the cashier fix a mistake and that I have to sell you the item at whatever price was keyed into the register?!?

ALG:  Yes!

ME:  (looking at my dad) I guess we’re going to have to charge him whatever you keyed in.

I calmly walked back around the counter and picked up another item from his cart, a small fountain with a price tag of $9.95, and continued calling out the prices. When we were all done, my dad gave him the total.

ALG:  That can’t be right! That’s way too much! There’s no way I got that much stuff!

DAD:  Oops! Looks like the fountain rang in for $995.95. Did you want to pay that in cash or with a credit card?

jimmypopjr,250,,646,1n18z6,,1477,"A few years back I took a girl on a date to The Macaroni Grill. The waiter, a good looking broseph type, came over eventually and was immediately pretty friendly towards my girl, who I'd been seeing for a few months at that point. It was off-putting, but I'm a pretty mellow guy and she and I were having fun, so I didn't think much of it. She noticed it too, and we joked about it as he got our drinks. She decides she wants to go with it, see if we can get a good laugh from it - we're both really into pranks. 

He comes back with the drinks and, I assume because I was acting beta as fuck, actually starts hitting on her in front of me. Not in an offensive way, but it was clear what was up and had she and I not already been really close it would have been very uncomfortable. 

He brags to my date that he can write his name upside down, which he does on our table. He then says that he's been practicing writing his phone number upside down too, but he needs more practice. He then writes his number down under his name. Upside down to him, but oriented straight towards my date. More one-sided flirting as he takes our orders and leaves. She was actually pretty great and was subtly messing with him and hinting that she's into some weird stuff. 

At this point I text my friend who works at this place during college semesters. Turns out she's there working that night and I track her down and explain that one of her wait staff is hitting on my girl directly in front of me. Her immediate reaction: ""Oh God, It's Barry isn't it?"" - It was. He's apparently known for this type of thing. She apologizes and asks how I'd like it handled (comped drinks, talking to Barry, etc). I tell her what my date and I had planned. 

Barry continues his behavior for the remainder of the evening and my date continues with her friendly, freaky subterfuge. I eventually pay the check and my date leaves the tip with a note: 

""Give me a call sometime. Make it dirty... - Beck"" 

She jots down the assistant manager's phone number on the note and we take off. 

Days later my friend gets back to me with the results. He called her up thinking it was B. He leads off with ""So you ready to let a real man take you to dinner, or does your freak self want to skip right to bed?"" Classy. My friend tells him what really happened, and that he can explain his behavior to the manager, or she will. He never came back to work after that. 

Beta as fuck. 

tl;dr - tricked a flirty waiter into sexually harassing his assistant manager. 

side note: I got this idea from someone we pranked in high school. Short version is a jerk, wannabe-gangster student thought he was leaving a pager voicemail for a girl that was into him when it was really our friend Trish's pager, who had no idea about any of this. Next thing she knows she has a NASTY, long voicemail from this strange kid she's never met. It was a solid 90 seconds of an awkward, inexperienced high school student trying to sound like a sexual gangster. Some of the shit he said made no sense at all. Many laughs were had, and I'm happy to say that it stopped there, we didn't use it to publicly shame the kid at school.

I found out from a friend that Sarah was cheating on me with one the typical doucher jocks. due to some problems at school, picture day wouldn't be here for another month, keep this in mind as this is important to the story. Anyways, I was thinking of how to get back at Sarah for cheating on me, Sarah liked to wear a lot of make-up and was very sensitive. I didn't tell Sarah that I knew about her cheating on me. Come picture day, I tell her that I'm breaking up with her. She starts to cry and her make-up runs down all over her face (mascara, all that stuff), she didn't  have time to clean up, so her picture looked like crap. The next day I tell her that I'm sorry and that I shouldn't have done that, we start dating again. And on retake day,I told her that I found out about her cheating on me and said we're through, and she just exploded, ruining her  ID yet again. From what I've heard she hasn't cheated on anyone for awhile.

TL;DR: make-up Girlfriend in Highschool was cheating on me, dumped her on picture day, ruining her ID, took her back, then dumped her again on retake day.

As I was driving through the garage, there was a stereotypical business jock (yelling into his bluetooth, gelled hair, expensive suit, froofy Starbucks in hand)  driving behind me in his black Mercedes SUV. He was obviously late, since he was tailgating me the entire time. I finally found a spot, and I hit my blinker and slowed down. I wanted to back in, so I went a bit past the spot first to get into position. Business jock decided his time was more important than mine and that he didn't want me to park in that spot, so he pulled up on my ass and started blaring the horn, gesturing for me to keep moving, etc. I sat there for a second before throwing it in reverse. Obviously, he could see my reverse lights, but he refused to move until I said ""fuck it"" and started backing up. I figure if you don't want to get hit, you'll move. So anyway, he moves and I take my time getting into the tight spot. He drives off and I think the interaction is over. I got into the elevator, and as I'm pressing the ""*G"" button (ground level) I see him running around the corner trying to catch the elevator. I smiled, waved, and pressed the ""close doors"" button, which shined (shone?) like a glowing beacon- a token of good faith from the gods of revenge- and watched as his face twisted in rage.

cafedream,116,,464,1fnuml,,1465,"I work for a law firm and we handle asset recovery for estates.  On this case, we had an heir who was probably the dumbest person I've ever spoken to - we will call him Bubba.  Now Bubba was the bottom of the totem pole in this huge chain of people getting money.  The estate was complicated and had crazy people (literally mentally ill) coming out of the woodwork.  I'm pretty sure there must have been a considerable amount of incest in this family to produce so many crazy idiots.

Bubba feels like the best course of action to get his money is to start calling me every day and, if I don't answer, he hangs up and calls right back, over and over again.  When I do answer, I have to repeat the same thing I said the day before to him and to his wife (who is usually screaming obscenities in the background) and, on occasion, to his dad.

Fast forward a few months.  We have completed the estate, recovered the asset and mailed out checks to all the heirs.  Here's where my revenge starts.  The day I put the checks in the mail, I start calling Bubba about 3 times a day to inform him that we have mailed the check and to ask him if he has received his check.  When he stops answering, I start calling back over and over until he answers.

After about a week of this, he's getting pretty testy on the phone.  I am overly polite and professional through it all.  The day he gets his check, he answers his phone and yells at me that he got the check.  I just say ""Good.  Don't call me ever again and I won't call you ever again."" And I hang up.

Kratzyyy,156,,328,1bno4p,,1464,"Yesterday I was on a coach journey from Glasgow, Scotland to London, England. It was a ~14 hour coach journey, so tension on the coach was at an all time high and morale was at an all time low. I was on the top deck near the back, and at the very back of the coach were two young (18ish) girls being loud, screaming, swearing, and generally pissing off people trying to sleep or otherwise enjoy their journey. For anyone from the UK, you'll understand what I mean when I say these girls were chavs. For everyone else, I direct you to [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chav).

About half way through the journey, they found a button at the back of the bus which turns on and off the overhead lights. Why this button exists is a mystery for me but it does, and they were abusing it. About 2 minutes into the abuse a somewhat old black lady asks them to settle down because she's trying to sleep, however she was only met with abuse, yelling and racist comments about ""this is my country you can't tell me what to do blackey"".

Eventually the driver had to stop and move the girls downstairs, and the rukkus stopped for the rest of the journey. When we got to the coach station and everyone unloaded to get their bags, it all started again with the girls throwing abuse at the old lady and her family. Eventually the officials from the coach company step in and take them to the side after they've unloaded their bags and dumped them beside the coach. I'm still waiting to get my bag, and when I do I'm right beside their two suitcases on wheels as I reach into the coach luggage bay. Revenge mode kicks in, and I quickly throw their bags back onto the coach and pull mine off. I walk away briskly towards the exit, hoping to hang around and watch the chaos unfold.

jeedee,77,,401,1hfbe9,,1455,"The office park that my office is situated in has pretty limited parking. Each office suite has a handful of spaces and they're clearly labelled. Typically, each office suite has a couple of spaces right outside the door, and then another few spaces in the middle of the car park. If you use all of your parking spaces, you have to park half a mile away on the main road and walk back (so it pays to get in early enough to grab a space). There's enough space behind the spaces in front of the offices to park a car without blocking the car park, if you park sideways behind two cars (i.e. blocking two cars in, but not stopping other cars driving around), which is what the postman, delivery drivers etc. do. Some offices use this knowledge to provide an extra parking space, as you're just blocking in your coworker's cars and they can easily get you to move if they need to get out. My office is in the corner of the office park. We have a space next to the wall and the space next to that. The next couple of spaces are (obviously) allocated to the office next door. I usually get in early enough to grab the space next to the wall. 

Now, the office next door is the regional HQ for a small company and they often have people from other offices visiting. As they're not familiar with the parking arrangements, it isn't unusual for us to find that one of their visitors has taken one of our spaces. In that case, we'd just knock on their office door and ask the owner of the car to come out and move it. It happened so often that the landlord put a sign on the door of their office to remind visitors that they have to park in assigned parking spaces (if we're having visitors, we make sure we leave a space for them as there are only a couple of visitors' parking spaces for the whole office park and they're always taken).

So, one day I get in early and park in the corner space, next to the wall. Lunchtime rolls around and I have to run some errands so I pick up some lunch while I'm out with the intention of eating it in the office. I got back to work to find that someone from the office next door has taken my space while I'm out. I recognised the car straight away - it was one of their salesmen. He's a real arsehole, totally full of himself, thinks the world revolves around him etc. You know the type. It isn't the first time (or even the tenth time) that he's taken one of our spaces, either.

I don't want to have to drive right down the road and walk back, and I can see him standing outside the office next door, smoking and talking to someone. I shout ""excuse me"". He ignores me. I shout ""excuse me"" again. Still nothing. I beep my car horn. That gets his attention. He turns round and I ask him if he can move his car. He says ""in a minute"", points to his cigarette (which by the look of it, he'd only just lit), and turns back to his conversation. I say ""excuse me"" again, and get ignored again. I beep my car horn again. He turns to look at me. I point out that there's assigned parking and I need to get back to work. He shrugs, tells me he'll only be a minute, and turns his back on me again.

Obviously, trying to reason with him isn't working, and I wasn't going to sit around on the car park for another few minutes. He could have moved his car out of my space and parked behind the two spaces allocated to the office that he was visiting, but he'd rather inconvenience me, so I reversed my car right up to the wall, blocking him and one of my coworkers in. I got out of my car and he demanded that I get back in my car and wait as he'd only be another few minutes. I told him that I needed to get back to work and that he could knock on the door when he was ready and I'd come back out and move. TWENTY MINUTES later (glad I wasn't still in my car!), there was a knock on the door. One of my coworkers answered it and came to tell me that I needed to move my car. Now, usually I'd be straight out, but as this person was a repeat offender, had ignored me, turned his back on me when I was asking him to move his car and had talked down to me when I'd parked, I decided to make him wait. I told me coworker to tell him that I was on a call and that I'd be out in a minute. Half an hour later, I went out and moved my car, to find him pacing backwards and forwards and complaining that he'd missed a meeting on the other side of the city. I told him that he should only park where he's allowed to park, as per the sign on the door to the office that he was visiting, that he'd been told several times before, and that he could have moved his car when I'd asked him to earlier. He never parked in our spaces again.

Throwaway14159265359,81,,242,1byaah,,1455,"Had to make a throwaway as my dad is pretty sensitive about anything to do with his job/life appearing on the dreaded interwebs.

My dad is a policeman and he works with a man, let's call him Bobby, who, by all accounts, is a pretty stand up fella. Hard-working (my dad hates the lazy) and generally a pretty nice guy. Anyway, his downfall came about 5 years ago when he had an affair, having been married for 15 years. I should mention at this point that they have no children. Suffice to say, his wife was not over the moon about it. You hear stories about scorned partners setting fire to their other half's cars or scattering their clothes down the street, but this, as far as angry spouse revenge is something quite special.

Bobby's wife found out about the affair because a friend of hers is married to a colleague of his. News spreads etc. Instead of confronting him about it, she thought long and hard about a way to really ruin his damn day. Bobby had an important work day coming up.....some sort of meeting with his superiors with a potential for promotion but I can't remember the details. 

Bobby's wife carefully took a thread cutter to each item of clothing that he would be wearing that day and unpicked every other damn stitch. No kidding, from his suit down to his underwear. 

You can imagine that the morning hustle and bustle commute was enough to perhaps strain some of the seams at most. But as the day wore on, his clothes started to slowly fall apart. First a hole in the toe of his shoe (she was obviously dedicated to the cause), then his trousers started to fray upwards from the ankles. The real kicker came when, 10 minutes into his very important business meeting, the arm fell off his suit jacket. The meeting was cut short and, for reasons that may or may not be related, I don't believe that he ever received the promotion he was after. Bobby and his wife and now happily divorced.

Bunkadin,86,,373,1nhsqb,,1450,"First post, please be kind.

I hope this qualifies,

I work for &lt;big satellite tv company&gt; doing residential installs for satellite tv. Several months ago I did an install at a duplex in a small town for a nice Filipino Lady (Now FL). She told me how happy she was to be in Canada and how her husband had worked for several years to bring her and their family (4  young children) into the country. These things made me happy and eager to help her. I proceed with my install.

Problem:
On the side of the building, there is already a dish mounted, and the landlords will not permit me to mount an additional dish. However I can use the existing dish as it is the same brand and there are free ports on it.

So I run my cable and hook up her receiver to the existing dish, which belongs to her neighbor, Racist Bugger. Who from here on shall be known as RB.

Everything works out well and when I leave the whole family is crowded around the television changing the channels excitedly. I leave with a smile on my face.

About 45 minutes after I leave I get a phone call on my work cell. 

FL: *crying* Someone cut our cable! Please come back and fix it!

Me: Sure, no problem.
(shortened, obviously)


I get back to her house and the brand new cable I had just ran is cut clean in the middle and is lying loose. I ask FL if she had cut it and she had no idea what had happened. 

So I decided to inquire with her neighbor.

Me: Hello, do you know anything about this cable?

RB: WHY IS THAT HOOKED UP TO MY SATELLITE! THAT *racial expletive* CAN'T DO THAT! *rude words and angryness ensues*

Me: Okay, but *explains situation* there can be only one dish.

RB: TO BAD! SHE CAN'T USE MINE! *more racial expletives but you get the drift*

Me: Okay.

RB goes inside his house so I calmly walk over to the dish, remove his cables and the entire assembly. I then mount her dish in the exact same spot and cut his cables just to short to reach.  

At this point RB comes out and starts raging at me to hook his tv back up. So I calmly explain to him that I got permission from the Landlord to supply FL with the service, and as that is the only dish that they will allow, he will have to ask FL if she will let him use her dish. 

I smile and leave.

avalisk,102,,370,1m4bmr,,1453,"A while ago, I worked in a cold storage facility.  It was a pretty simple, but strenuous job.  The first 2 weeks were physically very difficult.  The job was order picking.  Basically you go into the -10%F freezer, find the 40ish boxes of frozen food weighing between 20 to 70 lb, stack them on a pallet, hand wrap it up, then put it on the loading dock.  Do 3 an hour, for 10 hours, and thats the whole job.  Once you got the hang of it and got acclimated to the cold, it was a simple job.  

We had alot of employee turnover.   3 people a week would come in and quit within 2 weeks.  Too cold or too physically hard.  The veterans there would usually be friendly but not become attached to a new employee unless it became clear they were going to be staying.  

On to the story.  One new guy we had took to the work okay.  He could manage the 3 pallets an hour, and it really went to his head.  He started feeling like the best, making fun of the veterans he did better than, giving other new guys a hard time, complaining about people 'not working hard enough' and always checking on his numbers.  I referred to him as Billcocks and it caught on.   needless to say he hated me.  

One day he was being particularly bossy, so i decided to get a bit of revenge.  Now, Billcocks  was good for a new guy, but really had no idea how fast everyone else could be if they wanted to be.  He peaked at about 140 cases an hour, and he would come out of the freezer steaming with effort.  The average veteran could do 140 without effort.  I was the best, and could pull 270 cph with effort.  Theres no reason to work that hard, considering anything over 120 cph was wasted energy.  

we had a warming room where we got our order sheets, and people would wait in there for a bit to warm up.  I spent alot of time in there, and Billcocks hated that I wasn't working all the time.  As revenge, i started timing my tickets with his.  I would wait in the warming room until he came in, got his order and left.  then i would sneak out, pick my order, and go back and sit in the exact same spot.  Billcocks would come in, literally steaming, see me there, and his veins started throbbing.  Get his ticket, go out, come back and see me still there.  This happened for about 2 hours, to Billcocks, seeming like I was doing absolutely nothing.  

He told the supervisor, who could see exactly what was going on on the computer system.  Supervisor told him to mind his own business.   He told group leaders, who checked the numbers and told him the same thing.  He never had enough balls to confront me directly, so I just kept doing it.  He raged and slammed boxes, but no one would do anything about the horrible injustice of me not working.  Of course everyone else sees me working because i was only timing my tickets with poor billy's.  It was a huge running joke, with most people finding it hilarious, and no one told him.  It never occurred to him that someone would be faster than him with less effort.

He eventually started minding his own business and fit in alot better, but he never once said a word to me about it.  He probably still thinks I'm somebodies son who could get away with anything.",revenge best served frozen,1823,pettyrevenge

I was doing a physics project and had to print out an article which was 2 pages with an image or two. So after printing the article with the images I went to pay for my copy. It was double sided so I thought it was 5 cents. I didn't know there was a surcharge on printing things with images which would cost me 50 cents per page instead. This was ridiculous and I'm sure she made that up on the spot. I didn't have 50 cents (poor high school student), so she ripped up my page and threw it out and told me, bring money next time instead of wasting school supplies. WTF?!? she just ripped up the page and she's blaming me for wasting supplies.

The very next day I went back to the library planning my revenge. On the computer I opened up MS paint and used the fill tool in full black. Set the printer to double print that and set it to print 1000 copies. Clicked print and left the library immediately.

I waited a minute before going back in to see the results of my revenge. I see the printer spitting out double sided prints of BLACK pages. The librarian saw it and freaked the fuck out. I see her frantically trying to cancel the print job and had to turn off the printer. I bet there were at least 30 copies of pure black pages.

The bus was packed with people who had been out doing Christmas shopping. So it was not only standing-room-only, but also had everyone's shopping bags and other crap piled up all around. It was miserable, and about 100 degrees to boot.

We were standing in the aisle, and seated next to us was a woman with her son, who was about 6 years old. His mother kept yelling loudly at him about EVERYTHING, and he kept yelling back and jumping up and down on his seat, which of course made him fall over onto people constantly as the bus moved. He was being a total living terror. And to make matters worse, he kept pressing the button for ""next stop"", even though pretty much everyone on the bus was going to the end of the line (the subway station).

slicebishybosh,135,,441,1q44bq,,1416,"I live in a large, older style apartment building. We have these two neighbors that live above us that I swear wear cinder blocks for shoes. As a heavy walker myself, I do my best to ignore it though. 

However that all changed when I would get the ""You're being too loud"" stomps on my ceiling during the AFTERNOON or early evening. I would be playing my acoustic guitar or something. That's is, nothing obnoxious. The noise curfew is 11:00pm and we would be HOURS from it. Plus none of what I was doing would even justify a noise complaint. No parties, no stereo, nothing like that. So on top of this, they are one of loudest units in the building. Loud music, sporting events, constant pounding, yelling, and what seems like furniture moving and falling over EVERY DAY. I couldn't let them get away with their ignorance anymore.  
 
So since it is an old building, all the units that stack on one another share water pipes. I almost have their shower schedule down to a T.

aproductof,79,,320,1e0j8x,,1409,"During my last couple of years of college and the first year or so of my adult 9-5 ""real job"" life, I lived in a house with two roommates. Basically one guy bought/owned the house, me and the other guy paid rent. 

One roommate (the other renter) was an inconsiderate slob who managed to attract an equally inconsiderate girlfriend. She was rude, bitchy, loud, obnoxious, and worst of all, over ALL the time. She stayed overnight at least 3-4 nights per week, most of which fell on weekdays.

Now, the house we lived had one bathroom, which wasn't a big deal since those of us who lived there were all on relatively different schedules. Until she ""moved in"" rent free. At the time, my job was roughly 45 minutes to an hour away from the house. She worked roughly 15 minutes further away than me, but almost the same commute. Which was a less than fun multiple expressway route of mass congestion. Her job is also a 9-5.

So the first time she stayed over... I wake up at my normal time and she is in the bathroom, taking her sweet time, getting ready for work. She got up maybe 5 minutes before me. I knock, politely ask how long she will be, I need to get ready to go to work, etc. I'm eventually allowed access to MY bathroom (it's mine, I pay rent, dammit). I rush and get ready for work. This repeats every morning she's over for weeks, despite explaining to her that I get up at XX time to get ready for work- she's free to use it to get ready, but she'll have to work around my schedule. 

Apparently that doesn't matter. I go so far as to tell the boyfriend (roommate) that his girlfriend needs to get ready at her own place or wake up earlier. No change.

On to the revenge. I start setting my alarm 10 minutes earlier. Just enough time to beat her to the bathroom, but also some precious minutes to grab a few other things--my clothes, a book, breakfast. I do EVERY part of my morning routine behind the locked doors of the bathroom. She'd knock on the door from time to time, and I'd just respond ""almost done!"" I stayed in there until it was absolutely time for me to leave for work. And on my way out of the bathroom, I smiled and waved and told her to ""have a great day!""
I continued on like this until she finally got the hint and started staying weekdays at her own place, or when she did stay over, she was waking up in time to leave to go to her home to get ready--my understanding is that it wasn't that far away, anyway.",Non-roommates from hell,1729,pettyrevenge

Horrible_Histories,244,,523,1mnhz1,,1398,"My sister and I mostly get along now (being in college and living three states apart plays a large role), but we absolutely hated each other while we were growing up. She was selfish and irresponsible, with a quick temper. She would frequently ""borrow"" my possessions, then hurl them at me in anger when I wanted them back. She was careless with her own things and would often steal mine to replace what she'd destroyed. It wasn't uncommon for her to intentionally break something of mine when I made it clear that I wasn't going to cave in and give it up without a fight. She was a nasty piece of work and was unfortunately encouraged, albeit passively, by our exhausted parents' refusal to come to my aid when I was treated unfairly. My sister had been a problem child since she was in diapers (at home, that is - she knew better than to melt down in the presence of other people), and they were just too worn out to care what she did to me unless I was left bloody or bruised. 

I'd long before grown wise to her selfishness and thieving ways by the time I reached high school. I'd established good hiding places in my room for some smaller, valuable things and was shrewd about keeping these things from her sight and reach. My clothes and shoes were always up for grabs, though, and she'd even go through my underwear drawer and take what she wanted. My cosmetics and toiletries weren't really mine. She'd stopped hurling things for the most part as a teenager, but still had her eyes peeled for anything she wanted for her own. Our birthdays are in the same month, and our parents often bought us the same gifts when we were younger so that we wouldn't squabble over who had what. But as I said, she wouldn't take care of her things and would steal mine to replace what she had lost or broken. Living with her was horrible. 

During my freshman year and her junior year, she signed up to go on a weekend trip to the mountains with the youth group from our church. (I had no interest in it, and couldn't see why she did. The boys were okay but the girls were stuck-up, and I'd witnessed them ignoring my sister when she followed them like a lost puppy. I imagined a trip with the group would be a lonely one for her.) Our birthdays were a month or so before the trip, and we had found favor with the birthday fairy. We both received $100 Mastercard or Visa gift cards from our childless aunt and uncle who have no other nieces or nephews to spend money on. Our parents let us pick out our gifts from them. I chose an mp3 player to replace the one I'd had for years that now had a non-working volume control. My new toy was the same model but had twice the memory; I set aside the old one to see if my dad could fix it and use it. My sister chose some suede boots and gave me strict orders to stay away from them. I remember feeling really angry about that, considering all the things she'd taken from me. She took my mom's advice and saved her gift card for the church trip.

After Mom had dropped my sister off at church to get on a bus for the long drive, she suggested that we go shopping with my gift card. I wanted to, but had some trouble finding it. It wasn't in the drawer in my vanity where I knew I'd put it, and I searched my room for several minutes before it hit me. I knew. I just knew. I went straight to my sister's room and opened the tacky rhinestone box on her bookshelf. It was her money box, and my gift card was in it. I knew it was mine because one of the groups of numbers was the last four digits of my friend's phone number, and another group was my birth year. I'd noted this when I first received the card and looked at it. My sister had stolen my gift card from my room and was probably going to pass it off as hers after using hers up. 

My sister had done a lot of nasty things to me and had taken a lot from me. Not just my possessions, but she'd chipped away at my dignity over the years and left me without any self-confidence. But this insult, stealing my birthday gift right out from under my nose, is what I still consider to be the worst. The icing on the crap cake was that I couldn't tell my parents. They'd stopped listening to my complaints and pleas when my sister's everyday bad behavior became too much for them to stand. It was easier to just ignore it. When my mom and I went shopping, I didn't bother getting anything that my sister could make use of. I knew she'd just take what she wanted. She's taller than me and has an inseam at least three inches longer, so I bought some jeans that I liked and knew would be too short for her. I also treated myself to a couple of bras (any bras that would fit me would overwhelm her wee attributes). I love makeup but didn't bother going to the mall counters because my sister frequently raided my makeup bag and used my stuff, even the germy things like mascara. I wanted to get things that would be mine, and only mine.

Now here's where the sun comes out. She was in a right snit when my parents and I picked her up at church the following week. She was still flaming mad about opening her bag when she got to the hotel and finding that the shampoo she'd packed (MY shampoo, natch) had a loose cap and had spilled all over her clothes and some other things. She accused me of going into her bag and fiddling with the bottle so it would leak. I didn't go into her bag, but I did loosen the cap on all my hair care and body wash bottles before she left and then tighten them again after she'd gone. I knew she'd take some of my stuff with her, and I was getting the sticky results I'd wanted. (I denied it, of course.) Hotel staff had to take her clothes down to the laundry room and throw them in the washer. This was mortifying to her. She sobbed and screamed at me for what I had done. Then she regained her composure long enough to tell me that I wasn't nearly as clever as I thought I was. I'll never forget the self-satisfied smirk on her face as she told me that she had used my gift card to buy t-shirts and snacks for her ""friends"", and threw away my new shampoo-coated mp3 player as soon as she took it from her bag. Mom, confused, piped up before I could with the news that I had used up every cent of my gift card at the mall, and that I'd been using my new mp3 player all weekend. My sister snapped back at her that it was my old player I'd been using, and I took great delight in setting her straight. She had a total meltdown when she realized she'd cost herself a $100 shopping spree and had not actually destroyed my property. Mom and Dad for once were having none of it, and shut her down pretty quickly when she tearfully demanded I hand over my mp3 player as a consolation prize. She was still a jerk after that, but was never as bad after the wind was knocked from her sails. Mom and Dad started sticking up for me, too.

Justice.

[deleted],145,,399,1k53e3,,1401,"So this is from a while ago, but I think it fits here.

**Backstory**: I went to a private co-educational school for high school, I had to wear a blazer outside of school and always had to look neat as part of the school rules. Our family also had a dog who was female, and so she had a purple lead, as chosen by my sister. Normally before I walk the dog after school I would change into some casual clothes, maybe a hoodie and some shorts, but today I didn't.

**The Incident**: So this particular day I was waiting to cross the road with the dog. I had my full school uniform on and the purple lead in my hand. Then these two douchebags in a white van pull up at the traffic light and roll down their window. I'm looking ahead minding my own business when I hear ""Hey faggot!"", now I didn't think it was directed at me so I didn't acknowledge them. It wasn't until they started whistling at me and calling out ""Hey, you, Blazer boy"" that I turned around. I looked over and one of them was leaning out the window shaking an open fist near his mouth like he was sucking a dick. Now I'm not gay. Nor have I ever been gay so this made no sense. And I had never seen these guys before so they had no reason to do this. As this guy finished doing his blowjob impression with his friend in the driver seat laughing hysterically, he said 5 words which just angered me so much: ""You gay shit, kill yourself"". 

**The revenge:** The crossing light went green at this point and I began walking away from them. They followed slowly alongside me, called me names, and honked their horn whenever I didn't look at them. I continued ignoring them for three blocks before I stopped, looked at them, pulled out my phone and said the number for the police out loud as a dialed it in. The look on their face was priceless as they realised what was happening, they sped off down the street and through a red light. A camera flash went off as they went through. There was one ticket coming their way. I had memorized their number plate and told it to the police, who apparently found them doing 80km/h in a school zone, which in Australia is normally 40km/h and charged them not only for verbal abuse, but also for speeding, that coupled with the red light ticket and previous speeding fines meant that the driver was out of de-merit points and lost his license.

powerandbulk,48,,220,16l56a,,1397,"I had one particularly mean spirited history teacher in high school who for whatever reason had a hard-on to make my life difficult.

I did have to appeal nearly every test and homework assignment to the dean of students (or whatever they call that person in HS who isn't the principal) in order to get the A.

apple-d-ap,150,,1010,1lwvy4,,1401,"My favorite way to finish while fucking my lovely wife is - once she has had her fill of orgasms - I like to flip her on her back on the edge of the bed/counter/couch/washing machine/rocking horse and cup her thick ass in my hands and thrust angrily until I’m ready to burst and pull out and let ‘er fly. Oftentimes the result is a respectable shot across her breasts or an adequate belly button filler. Sometimes, if I haven’t cum in a day or two I’ll land a couple drops on her face and neck. Needless to say, my cumshots are quite variable depending on a lot of things – arousal, time since my last orgasm, level of hydration, etc.

A few weeks ago we were wrapping up a quickie in the shower and my wife starts begging me for my cum. Usually this is her polite way of letting me know that she has had her fun and I had better hurry the fuck up before the river runs dry. Still, “please cum on my face” has a better ring to it than “can’t you cum?” or similar, so I’m pretty thankful she has a good way about her. Besides, if I am in the zone and I’m still a ways off, begging me to cum on your face is akin to donning a top hat and waving a magic wand - here I cum. I pull out, she kneels down in front of me, and I cum. Sort of. Now, in my defense I was terribly dehydrated from working hard all week and this was my 3rd orgasm of the day (thanks palmala handerson). About a half load dribbled out and landed on her cheek. She grabbed my crank and rubbed the cum around on her face a little. I could tell what she was thinking, though. “Wow,” she said, “that wasn’t very much.” She had to needle me of course, it’s just the way she is. I guess I would do the same to her…“Sorry,” I said, not really feeling all that bad about it “dehydrated I guess.” “Well don’t let it happen again, Mr.!” was her reply in a fake stern sounding voice. We laughed and cuddled under the hot stream of water. My playfully vindictive side, however, was plotting. It won’t happen again, I thought, because next time I’m going at you like a forest fire. I didn’t dare tip my hand, though, as I wanted the element of surprise.

So began my mission to drown my wife in cum. I did research and found a few supplements that supposedly increased cum volume. I masturbated constantly – in the car, the bathroom at work, on fair rides. Not to completion, though, just enough to almost cum and then let up for a bit. I spaced my orgasms out to every other day and then every third day. I drank water. All. Day. Long. I must’ve peed every 20 minutes. Whenever we did fuck I made sure she didn’t see my loads – in her ass crack after doggy, on her ass cheek during cowgirl. For weeks I kept this routine going. I was completely dedicated to my mission, leave no sperm behind. I noticed my spunk volume was up. Way up. Like triple what I normally produced. And it was becoming a nuisance. I had to switch from klenex to paper towels and then from paper towels to bath towels - and then beach blankets. I was like a ketchup dispenser at a busy fast food joint. I decided it was time. I let my trouser snake lay dormant for a few days knowing that would antagonize him into a frenzy.

Finally we made love. Well, actually, it’s hard to call it making love when one of the parties involved is planning to secretly release a cum tidal wave on their lover’s village. She may have thought we were making love but I knew I was going to try and fuck-waterboard her. It started innocently enough, a simple shower as our kids watched Busytown. We loved throwing on a cartoon and sneaking away to the bathroom to fuck quietly. But this time my intentions were secretly very sinister. “Grab a couple extra towels” I said. “You’re going to need them” I whispered, but she didn’t hear me.

We fondled as we adjusted to the steamy setting. As we faced each other I picked up her leg and entered her slowly. When she had time to adjust to my slow in and out I pressed her up against the wall and thrusted more aggressively. My pounding was driving her crazy. She loves getting fucked hard and fast but with us standing she can only get to the edge of her orgasm and she just plateaus over and over in agonizing fashion. “Fucking sit down” she grunted. So I sat. And she climbed on top of me and was bouncing up and down in quick succession. Fast and shallow, slow and deep she alternates. She knows how to satisfy her dark passenger and wastes no time. Soon enough she is thrashing, and grunting, and slipping all over the place.

She barely had time to come back down to reality before I had flipped her over with her hands on the floor and I was entering her from behind. My hands grabbed and pulled her hips into my body faster and faster until she said the magic words “cum, cum on me, cum on my face!” - Well allow me to retort. - It was like a crack of thunder followed by a monsoon. Stream after stream of hot cum flew out of me. The first bundle was met with a shocked gasp, her eyes blinked as if they couldn’t believe what they were seeing. The next shot was even bigger and she started laughing uncontrollably as she fell over backwards attempting to avoid enemy fire. I was quicker, though, and was able to adjust, strafing my flow in her direction, pinning her into the corner of the shower stall. When it was all said and done she was laughing so hard she couldn’t catch her breath, laying on the floor of the shower with her hands trying to fend off my charge, and I was standing over her a la Muhammed Ali standing over Sonny Liston.

“Sorry” I said sarcastically.

They were being extremely loud, running around, and pulling things off of the shelves, etc. I was fine with just getting my bag of pretzels and moving on, until the younger boy rammed their cart into my legs. I knew it was deliberate because he had this little shit-eating grin on his face and his older brother was giggling. 

I turn to the mother (who of course was on the phone and hadn't made a single move to reign her kids in) and say to her, ""Excuse me, but your son just hit me with your cart."" She rolled her eyes at me and went back to her conversation. 

So I stand there, dumbfounded for a few seconds, while the boys go back to their reign of terror on the snack aisle. Finally, it hits me. I say to the boys, ""Hey kids, do you know what today is? It's July 11th- 7-11 day! 7-11 is giving out FREE SLURPEES!"" 

The kids immediately run over to their mother and start pulling on her arms and yelling, ""Mom! Mom! That lady says we can get free Slurpees today! You have to take us to 7-11!"" The mother gives me a murderous look. I give her a very smug smile, as the kids continue to bug the shit out of her.

I am in the process of moving all employees over to a new service provider, which also involves handset upgrades of course. If this was an issue for any other employee, I would have ported the phone number over to the new provider and upgraded to brand new device, but since I am still a little salty about her attitude towards me on that fateful day, I have decided to simply get a new SIM card for her BlackBerry.

You need to sign it or you don't register as having followed, which in case of an audit can mean trouble. Bureaucracy... Good, I sign it and put it back on the chair.

Enter another 5 minutes later the very last person, with a haughty expression on her face. I decide to be kind, and move my stuff away from the other empty chair next to me to make some room for her. She take a look around, sees me obviously holding up my gear to make space. She huffs and goes to sit in the middle of the front row, interrupting everone and sighing at the ordeal of having to attend, whips out her phone and starts not paying any attention.

Presentation ends about 40 min later, she storms out, onward to more important things than twiddling with her phone right in front of the trainer. 

I hand back the training record to the trainer, saying; ""I don't think everyone attending signed"", looking at the door... 
He looked back at me and said: ""Oh, I think we got everyone who was properly trained today."" and smiled. 

Which means she will probably have to retake it some other time.

TheLostCaterpillar,173,,341,1fm1xj,,1369,"I recently relived this story last night and realized it would be perfect here. 

**Some background about why I didn't like the management**

I worked at a  chain restaurant for a while, and the management was very demanding and difficult, especially for a minimum wage job. They would understaff and expect us to just work twice as hard for the same pay. They would not listen to my scheduling demands/requests and this led to me working 5-close after high school (which sucked), scheduling me Fri-Sat-Sun when I would ask for at least one weekend day off (esp. during mon-fri high school), being difficult about taking off days two weeks in advance, and acting like it was ruining their day to have to find someone to work my normal shift.

And GOD FORBID anybody ever called off. I found myself calling off and getting coaxed to come in, partly because I was a young pushover and partly because they would be like ""There is literally nobody to cover you, we really need you to be here. This is really going to ruin my night."" It's understandable if someone calls off often, but I would call off like once every three months or so, and often picked up other peoples shifts when they called me in.

**The Revenge** 

So on a Friday night I was way too sick to work, especially around food. I planned on taking the night off, resting and going into work the next day when I felt better. I called in and they did their whole ""No, you shouldn't stay home"" routine. 

After demanding to stay home my manager said ""Fine, we're going to need a doctor's note."" WTF? Are you kidding me? I'm not in need of a doctor, I'm in need of bed rest. Plus, it costs money to go to the doctor, for this shitty part time job? Please. 

I went to the doctor and made sure to tell him that I was scheduled for saturday and sunday as well, and felt too sick to handle peoples food. He gave me a note saying he didn't want me to work until the following monday. 

I called back that night and had my dad drop off the notice. 

""I'm sorry now you're going to have to find someone to cover me all weekend. That doctors notice sure was a good idea, I was much more sick than I thought! :) My dad will drop the note off in a minute!""

Today some lady parked her $45K Mercedes SLK-300 in my spot over two hours, causing me to have to spend up to 10 minutes hunting for parking every time I had to do a delivery over the dinner rush.

Now it's very common at this store to only have three or four cashiers for the whole store, and I was lucky enough to be put on the 10 items or less register. It was a fairly busy day, around 6pm when lots of people stop in on the way home to get stuff for dinner or what have you. In clomps this lady. Ugh. You can get a good idea as to the type of person she was. High heels, tight skirt, suit jacket, obnoxious hair, whorange spray tan, long fingernails, expensive handbag,...etc you get the picture. Anyways she comes clomping in yammering on her iPhone to one of her bitch-buddies about the latest celebrity gossip and gets a buggy. Now I'm not thinking anything of her at this point, so I continue ringing people up. Twenty minutes later she comes clomping up to the register (still on the phone) and cuts in front of two people. Just walks in front of them, throws her stuff on the belt, and continues talking on the phone. The people she just cut are standing there stunned but decide it isn't worth it and continue unloading. So I start to check her out and make some small talk. ""How are you today?"" I get a blank stare. ""Did you find everything all right?"" She holds her finger up and then points at her phone. I am stunned at the audacity of this woman. ""Oh well, just another rude customer"" I think to myself. I continue ringing her up and then she says this on her phone ""yeah I'm gonna have to call you back, this dumbass ringing me up is taking forever."" Then she looks at me and says, ""could you go any faster, I'm in a big hurry"" fuck you woman. Fuck you and your stupid friends and your stupid fake tan.

1: I'm black (this will become relevant later) and people have this habit of mistaking me for the staff, no matter what I'm wearing

About 15 years ago, I went to a fancy restaurant (dressed appropriately, slacks and a nice shirt and tie and jacket) for a lunch interview (ahh, heady dot com days, but I digress). 

After the interview, I'm walking out and a man drives up in a an expensive car (Porsche 911) , screeches to a stop, hops out and hurls his keys at me. 

Instincts being what they are, I catch them (surprised me, my coordination is terrible enough that I couldn't catch a cold). It dawns on me that the man has mistaken me for a Valet (this is ironic because this particular restaurant HAS NO VALET Parking).

I start ""Excuse me.."" and he responds in the most condescending of tones ""What, are you stupid? Just park my fucking car!""

I'm struck speechless as he glares at me, and I nod. He turns to go into the restaurant, I walk down the street (it's near Newbury st in Boston), get to the section that is a Highway overpass, and drop the keys onto the side of the highway.

One of my colleagues, whom I'll refer to as Mary, is notorious for grabbing a huge bunch of bananas as soon as they arrive and keep them in her office, as to get her daily sugar fix.

This has always bugged me a fair bit since I rarely get any of the delicious yellow fruits, so I decided to get my petty revenge on her banana hogging.

Last wednesday when Mary snuck out early for lunch, as usual, I went into her office with a bunch of zip ties (or cable ties, if you will) and attached her precious bananas to everything in sight. Her desk lamp, her keyboard, her coffee mug and as the title suggests, her [phone](http://i.imgur.com/XwefM4e.jpg).

crawker,283,,414,1kn4ts,,1347,"I work in a dusty old call center that uses terrible and outdated computers that are prone to breaking down when you look at them the wrong way. The full time staff is comprised of computer illiterate women, all of whom I suspect have a lower than average level of intelligence. 

The day the initial incident took place, I was the acting supervisor. One particular employee hates it when I supervise, as I'm a female in my early 20's while she is at least 50. **Let's call this other person 'Shannon'.**

Shannon was experiencing a low-level computer problem, in that her messages were not being sent out on time. I was able to re-send the messages without issue, but couldn't solve the problem itself because it was a problem with the computer, and there is no way in hell I think I can fix that. I told her to come to me if she had the issue again and I'd send the messages out on time. I moved on to the next issue, which was actually a problem and needed to be looked into right away. 

**This made her suuuuper angry.** She stood up at her station, pointed a wiry old finger at me and started **yelling**. 

""YOU DON'T FUCKING CARE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND I CAN'T GET AND GOD DAMN HELP AROUND THIS SHIT HOLE!"" 

It's a small work space, shared by like seven people. Everyone had to stop what they were doing, put their calls on mute (because she was loud enough to be heard in the background). 

*She stormed off.* 

Who the hell does that? She just left. She signed herself out with the explanation being **""left frustrated""**. 

As that's not a reasonable excuse to leave work early at all, I had to send an e-mail to the management team explaining the entire situation.  She was given a warning for ""Job Abandonment"".

**But that's not where it ended.**
When she was being given the warning, she told them she was refusing to listen, so she sat slumped forward in her chair and **PRETENDED TO GO TO SLEEP** Management had to bring in our Union Rep as she refused to speak with them. She was also written up for ""Professionalism"". 

At some point she decided it was my fault, and when I came in for my next shift, she immediately came over to me. She stood about two inches from my face and told me that she'd be watching me for any misstep. And that I had to watch my back from now on, because she ""knows where the security cameras can't see"" (Which I understood as a vague threat of physical violence, but whatever.)

This all took place about a month ago. Since then she's been nothing but sass, and refuses to speak with me, even when I'm supervising. 

This past Friday, I had to go over a new policy with her and saw that she had facebook open on her computer. Facebook is strictly banned at our workplace. She didn't even make an effort to hide it, just looked up at me with this smug expression as if to say ""What are YOU going to do about it?""

Obviously I told the manager, because I hate that bitch with a frightening passion. He said that management probably won't be doing anything, as they've known about her facebooking habits for awhile now.

**HERE'S THE REVENGE:** 

About an hour ago, I went to the computer she exclusively uses when she's at work, and enabled the content blocker for all websites that have not been rated.  I enabled a password so she can't go around it. So not only has facebook been blocked, but all the websites that she's been using to look for a new job are gone too.  

There was some effort involved, as we do use the internet for a few clients, and I had to find the pages of every single client we take calls for, and enable their web pages to be allowed. **It took about an hour, but I'm giddy with glee at the thought of her coming in to write some shitty status update about her shitty grandkids and NOPE! This website has been blocked. You want to use company time to look for a new job? Also not happening. Sorry bitch, better luck next time!**

atombomb1945,94,,476,1k386g,,1342,"I was shopping at Wally World once and saw a lady put a package of frozen chicken on a shelf.  Big package of frozen nuggets, freezer section two aisles over, and she just pulled it out and stuck it on the shelf with the chips.  Being the kind of guy that I am, I was not going to let her get away with this.  I walk over, pick up the nuggets, and drop them back into her cart while she was not looking.  She saw the nuggets a few moments later and you could tell she was thinking that she was sure she had gotten rid of them already.  She shrugs and puts them on a shelf again and walks off. 

Rinse, Lather, Repeat.  

I continue to pick up the package and put it in her cart of items several times.  The first couple of times it was just petty, then it started to get fun and an awesome game.  Not only that, but several people were following watching the fun.  The lady would put it on a shelf, walk away and go an aisle over.  I would run, grab the nuggets and follow as would the rest of the people watching.  She would come back from getting a bottle of water and see the chicken half buried under the cake mix she got the row before.  She would twitch a little, start looking around, and kinda get antsy.  Sometimes she would put it on a shelf right away, sometimes she would carry it a little ways and then put it on a shelf.  

Well, fun has to stop and she almost caught me.  I had slipped the nuggets back into her cart but some items fell over and she heard it.  She didn't catch me doing it, but she did see me standing some five feet away with an evil grin on my face.  She grabbed the bag and starts throwing a huge fit right in the middle of the store.  The kind of fit where a person doesn't say words so much as grunts and incoherent babble.  She then takes the bag of nuggets, raises it over her head, and slams them down on the floor causing a shower of nuggets to fly all over the place.  Including right up on the shoes of the Store Manager and a Police officer.  Seems someone let the store manager know what I was doing to the woman and decided to see for himself, the officer just happened to be coming off duty getting something.  They both tell the lady that she has to pay for her items including the destroyed bag of nuggets and leave the store.  She was pissed, she pointed in my direction and then found that I was not there (I backed away and out as soon as the bag exploded) which caused her to just start foaming at the mouth.  

She paid, she left, she was told never to come back.

daniellelasvegas,119,,393,1r28l6,,1338,"**Backstory** - So, I work in the city and there are many methods of public transportation that could be taken to get into Manhattan. I live very close to a NJ/NY train that takes you into the city in a timely manner. It's a very small train so there are limited seats and it gets dangerously crowded  quickly. So if you're lucky enough to get a seat, you'll enjoy your ride into the city in comfort.

The ""epicenter"" of the train is in Jersey City. This stop could be considered the ""Grand Central"" of this small train line. This is where completely empty trains pick up riders and bring them right into the city. This is your chance to get the coveted seat...

Now as a young, healthy female I don't mind whether I get a seat or not. It definitely is nice to have one just so I don't feel like a sardine, but I am the person to give it up to a pregnant woman or an elderly man/woman.




**The Story** - The platform was empty since a train to the city just left, they come every 5 minutes so I stood before the yellow line and patiently waited. People began filling up the spaces around me. Nothing new. People stand next to me, behind me, etc.,etc. but since I am standing right behind the yellow line, no one goes in front of me since they'd probably fall onto the tracks. 

Some girl (let's call her PB for pushy bitch) my age, clucking away on her phone pushed past several people and stood right behind me. I'm sure PB angered those several people but I didn't hear anyone complain. PB hit my bag and my back several times with her hands as a result of her flipping her hair and switching her phone from her right hand to her left.

ANYWAY, the empty train is slowly pulling up to the platform. Because everyone wants a seat on the train, you feel the entire crowd push up a little bit. I always hold my ground because I don't want to end up as rail pancake. The train is getting closer and I feel a palm on my back give me a little *shove*. Thankfully I had my heavy workbag on the floor so it didn't affect my time or ability to catch myself. 

I turn around and it's PB still on the phone avoiding eye contact with me, but since she was the only person directly behind me and she had shoved through everyone else, I knew it was her. Also if it were even possible at this point, she moved closer to me! I feel her breathing down my neck. The train pulls up and the doors are *directly* in front of me, but they aren't open yet. (It takes a couple of seconds for the conductors to load onto the train and operate the doors).

PB gave me another shove as to signal me to move as close as I can now to the train. Of course I am as close as I possibly could be, but she wasn't satisfied. (She's off the phone now) Another bag hit. I'm pretty ticked off by now, and it was like this petty revenge was meant to be...

So I decided to look back towards PB and look on the ground around her. I did it a couple of times. I finally decided to say, ""Hey, did you drop that?"" and I pointed to the ground near her. At that point the doors opened and we all pushed onto the train. She was left standing there looking for whatever item she thought I was talking about. All the seats were taken and she came onto the train all flustered. She looked both ways for any empty seat but poor PB wasn't fast enough. She had to endure a very packed train ride that morning in her heeled boots. Oh well PB, don't be a pushy bitch!




**TL;DR** - Girl almost pushed me onto the train tracks in her selfish attempt to get a seat on the train. Pulled the old ""did you drop that?"" on her making her miss her chance to get a seat.

FranzJosephWannabe,86,,337,1hv4wt,,1339,"So, I thought I'd share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago! Be forewarned, this is a serious wall of text coming.

As anyone who has worked in retail knows, you will always have at least a few quirky ""regulars"" who come in to your store. Sometimes it's a good kind of quirky, like ""She bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in."" Sometimes, however, it's a bad kind of quirky. This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky.

This customer (not his real name, but we'll call him Mr. Rogers, because I always thought he looked like he could be Mr. Rogers' evil twin brother) had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about 5 min. before we close. This would happen every time he came. Now, when doing a water test back then, it would take a couple of minutes. we didn't have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals. We were doing old-fashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything. Normally it didn't take too long, but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night. Not to mention, it can be a messy process, meaning we'd have to clean everything again before we close up.

He would come in, get his water tested, ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions (Mr. Rogers: ""Does the Turbo-shock come in a 100 lb. bucket?"" Me: ""No, sorry, it just comes in 25 lb."" Mr. Rogers: ""Why??"" Me: "".....""), and tap impatiently waiting for everything, making me feel like I was defusing a bomb. Most of the time, we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after, but seeing his car pull up at 4:55 was enough to turn an ok day into a full-on panic attack.

So, one day, I was at a high-school soccer game, when who do I happen to see but Mr. Rogers. He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didn't notice that I was there. His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr. High team, and he was there to see her. I debated whether or not to say anything to him, but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was. And then, completely by accident, I overheard him talking to one of his friends.

Mr. Rogers told his friend what he thought was ""the secret to getting good service"" at any place. He claimed that by coming in at the last minute, right before they closed, he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs. Mr. Rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail. ""After all,"" he said, ""why should they get rewarded if I don't get the best possible service?"" He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows ""for a fact"" that this technique works.

I thought about confronting him right then and there, but I managed to restrain myself. By the time the 90 minutes were up in the match, I had already formulated the basis of a plan....

The next day I went to my manager, the sweet older lady from my last post, and told her about what I had overheard. She was furious. She wanted to refuse him service, shred his file, and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else. But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit, and she agreed.

The next time Mr. Rogers came into the store (of course, at 5 til closing), we made sure to treat him like a king. We gave his water sample every test under the sun. Ph, Alkalinity, Calcium, Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Phosphates, Total Dissolved Solids, and many, many more. No test was too obscure for Mr. Rogers. When he asked why we were doing so many tests, we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect. We wanted no stone left unturned! ""But, my water is clear,"" protested Mr. Rogers. ""No, no, we just want it to stay that way! After all, we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight!"" So, we continued to do tests, all the while his foot was tapping, tapping, tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall. We found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately. We advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness. We discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system. Then we talked about Baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the Chlorine (""But I'm not! It looks great!""). We took him on a mini-tour of some of our newer stock, explaining in excruciating detail how it all works.

Finally, when I started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use, he made it very clear that he had had enough. By now it was well past closing time. We had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago. He was trapped, and he knew it. He looked at me and my manager and asked, ""why are you doing this? Why are you taking so long? And why are you talking to me about things I don't care about???"" My manager looked him in the eye, and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice, she said, ""We just want to give you the best possible service.""

It took a second, but then he got it. Someone had let his secret slip. His foot stopped tapping, and the only thing that he could say was ""Oh."" So, we decided the torture was over. We let him go after that. And while he did continue to come to our store (and get excellent service, I might add), he no longer came 5 minutes to closing.

It was one of the only times I've ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career! I will always treasure that moment.

TL;DR: Guy comes in 5 minutes before closing to get better service. So, we gave him the best service of his life as a form of torture.",We just want to give you the best possible service. (x-post from /r/TalesFromRetail),1676,pettyrevenge

She looks up -- looks over at me and says WTF out loud.  I just smiled and laughed.  She is just standing there so I said, ""push!  it works when you push!""  She waited to see what I was going to do, which was nothing.  After a few seconds she pushed on the door and it let her out and me into the mall.

GodofPorking,229,,422,1ee0vt,,1325,"I like to work out in the morning before I have to go into work at 8 AM. I work 45 minutes from my home and my gym is only 5 minutes away from my work. I was having a great gym session and it gets to be about 7:15 AM, so time for me to hit the showers and get ready for work. The problem is that the gym only has one unisex shower. When I go to the shower it's locked. I knock and a girl's voice snobby replies back ""occupied."" I have worked out for months here and this has never occurred before so I figured I would just wait it out. 

So I waited for 40 minutes for this girl to finally leave. By now it was 7:55 and I had 5 minutes to shower and get to work, which I wasn't too worried about since I have a flexible schedule and didn't have any meetings until 9.  Out comes a young, tan, attractive, in-shape girl who scoffs when she sees me waiting patiently and gave me a half hearted apology and said that she worked at 8 and didn't want to smell like her tanning lotion. I replied with a sheepish ""yea... its fine."" I walk into the shower room and see she left her phone. I smile and lock the door behind me and not even a minute later I hear her knock but I just get into the shower with a huge smile on my face. I left the shower room 15 minutes later ready for work with an evil glare from the girl who was now also late for work.

**TL:DR I was made late to work waiting for the shower to open up, so I capitalized when the girl inside forgot her cell phone.**

**Update:** My gym has two unisex bathrooms and one separate unisex shower that has no toilet in the shower room. The shower room is located over by the two tanning beds.The girl had a pink iphone. She normally doesn't shower or really lift she just comes in to tan and then talks with people she knows. I am not from the area and did get some weird looks from other people at the gym when she came in today. She and I didn't make eye contact but there was clear tension.

When Jack was young (In high school) he had a pacemaker implanted in his chest due to a heart condition. Jack also worked as a cashier at a grocery store in a nicer part of town before we met. One thing he hated was dealing with asshole customers, but he had the best petty way of exacting petty revenge I've ever known.

If a customer was being rude to him and paying with a card Jack would tell them ""I'm sorry I have to swipe your card here on the register. The card swiper next to you doesn't work."" The customer would hand Jack their card, and he would swipe it across his chest before he would swipe it at the register...

When Jack did this he made sure it would pass over his pacemaker, causing it to erase the data on the magnetic strip. So of course the card would be declined. Much to the frustration of the customer. If they tried to get him to manually enter in the info on the card he would tell them ""Sorry, our store policy doesn't allow that.""

Jack said he loved to see the customer sulk off to put their groceries back.

So I was a teenager (18-19) the first time my family got an electric can opener. Having never even seen one before, I had no clue how to use it. They had bought it while I was at work, and taught my (then around 5 year old) little brother how to use it. When I asked, my parents told me to make him teach me. Ok, I can do that. 
  
Except when I went to ask him, he wouldn't tell me. Instead, he laughed hysterically about how he was so much younger than me and knew how, and I didn't. He also added that I must be pretty stupid if I didn't know already.   
  
The revenge: later that day, I messed around with it and figured out how to work it. He doesn't know that though. He's now 12, and I'm 24. Whenever he's home and I need a can opened, I make him stop whatever he's doing and come help me. He laughs the entire time about how stupid I am, that I can't figure it out, still. I just smile.

Mosvicious,86,,372,1k7utf,,1320,"Alright, this didn't happen to me, but I did witness it. This happened when I just started working on towboats. I was a greenhand along with another guy. We had just both came from deckhand school and were both put on the same towboat. Having already spent two weeks in school, we weren't given anytime to go do any shopping or anything else. So we were put on the boat with pretty much the same stuff as we came to deckhand class with, minus what we used during the class.

The lead man on deck, we will call him LM was a pretty cool guy and always wore overalls. Always. The greenhand that was put on the vessel with me, we will call him Bum. So, Bum and LM both chewed tobacco and Bum was quickly running out of his remaining tobacco in the first week and we still had 3 weeks to go before we got to go home.

LM was a pretty cool guy and told Bum that since it was his first hitch, that he wouldn't mind sharing his chewing tobacco with him, but only for this first hitch. He told him that he understood that he didn't know how much to bring since this was his first time being out here, but that next hitch he would have to bring enough for the entire four weeks or he is on his own. Bum quickly agreed and expressed thanks.

So, next 3 weeks went by uneventful, Bum and I went home. Two weeks later, we were back out there again. This time, Bum barely brought more tobacco than he did the previous time and was out of chewing tobacco halfway through his hitch. He started bumming off of LM again. LM was a cool guy, but I could tell he was upset about it. So, one day we are on the head of tow (at the furthest end from the vessel on the barges or unit of barges we push) and we are about to make a lock. It's just me and LM at the head. He is helping me make the lock.

He told me had a plan to get Bum to stop bumming. It was near watch change, so Bum was coming out to relieve me. The first thing Bum ask for is a chew from LM. LM agreed and pulled out a bag of chewing tobacco that was nearly empty save for one last chew. Bum was kinda hesitant about taking his last chew, but LM insisted saying it wasn't a problem. 

It didn't take long for Bum to lose his guilt about taking LM's chew and took his last chew from that bag. As soon as Bum started chewing, LM immediately pulled out a brand new bag and opened it up. With Bum watching, LM pissed into the bag and sealed it back up. Bum asked him what the hell he was doing. LM simply told him that his grandfather had told him when he was a kid that if you pissed in a fresh bag of chew, it will keep it fresher longer. Bum immediately started vomiting on the barge. 

LM later told me that it was worth wasting a bag of chew for that and Bum never did ask for any more chew from him.

Sure, I wasn't the most popular kid in my school, but the main reason Dickbag bugged me was because I had gotten him a zero on a group project because he did shit all on it. Anyways, he found out, much to my dismay, that he lived literally around the corner from me, in the same condo complex. 2 days in a row, I came home from school and my house was covered in eggs. Obviously, my mom was pissed, and she didn’t know why anybody would do something like this to us. I did. The next day, I hatched a plan with a good friend of mine, who at the age of 12, was surprisingly muscular. We decided that we ""weren't feeling good"" and called our parents to get permission to go home early, about a half an hour before school ended. We met up at my place (about 5 minute walk from the school) and waited until school was out. Where I lived, in my front little gated area was a little shed. I hid in the shed, and my friend hid just behind the side of the building. After about 20 minutes I hear my latch on my gate open and somebody sneaking into the yard. I peeked out, and sure enough it was Dickbag with a carton of eggs. Before Dickbag realized what had happened I had rushed out of the shed and uppercut him as hard as an 11 year old could. He fell over and sat on the ground dazed for about 3 seconds before my friend charged in and tackled him and pinned him to the ground. The look on his face was priceless. The best part was that we held him there, on his stomach with me sitting on his legs, and my friend sitting on his hands and back until my mom got home, which was about 45 minutes later. My mom, my friend and I dragged him to his house and had him explain what he did to his Dad. I don't think I've ever seen somebody so anger at their child before.

its_not_funny,98,,183,14p1a0,,1295,"This happened about 15 years ago or so.  I had moved to a new city that had reached the point where it was running out of phone numbers left in one of it's area codes, but was resisting adding a new one.  So when I got my new land line phone number, I was re-issued the phone number of somebody who had recently canceled their service.   (this was pre-cell phone, and broadband wasn't available in the area yet, so a land line was necessary).

From the day the phone was hooked up, I started getting phone calls for ""Bob"" - the previous owner of the number.  Apparently Bob didn't bother to tell ANYBODY that he had moved, and Bob was a REALLY popular guy.  Friends, family, business calls... you name it.  From early morning until late at night, I was getting calls for Bob.  I would get home from work, and the answer machine (shut up, it was the 90's!) would have a half a dozen messages left for Bob.  For the first couple of months, I would patiently explain to each caller, ""No.. Bob doesn't live here.  No, I don't know Bob.  No, I don't know his new number.  No, I don't know where he moved to. No, I can't get a message to him"".  I would go through this process as much as a dozen times a day on some days.   I figured that eventually I would have talked to every person Bob knew, and the calls would stop.  Unfortunately... they didn't.

I finally had enough.  I changed the message on my answering machine to say ""... and if you are calling for Bob, BOB IS DEAD.  Please stop calling for him!"".  I also started giving that same message every time I answered a call for Bob - ""Bob is dead, I don't know any details, please don't call here again"".

Surprisingly, it only took about 2 weeks before I came home from work to find an answering machine message:  ""This is BOB.  I AM NOT DEAD!!!  Please stop telling people that I am dead!!""  &lt;click&gt;.  I laughed.  I did not change my answering machine message.

Immediately after this, Bob must have finally taken the initiative to start giving his new phone number to people, because over the next week or two the calls for him started tapering off to the point that I only got one call for him every month or so.

Caske,204,,327,1i0br7,,1295,"So this happened back in middle-school. I rode the bus to school and home every day, and there were three girls who would constantly annoy and pick on my friend and me. Both of us were always taught to fully respect women, so we just kind of dealt with it and did our best to ignore them. Eventually, they started to throw trash and pencils at us, and one day they brought a bag of Doritos and actually began spitting chewed-up Doritos at us. Every now and then we would lash out at them and throw things back, but it never did any good. Why they did this, I don't know. Neither of us were ugly or weird-looking and we were both pretty well-liked in school. Just a couple of average guys.

This had gone on for almost a year. Nobody ever paid any attention to it, mentioned anything about it to them, not even the bus driver who we literally sat right behind. I never truly confronted them about it because I simply never wanted to talk to them, and after a while it just sort of became background noise. 

One of the girls had nice, blonde hair that she was very proud of, and spent a lot of money taking care of it and getting it styled the way she wanted it etc., judging from what I had heard them talking about behind us. I'll call her Butt. One day, my friend was out sick so I alone was the subject of their tortures. We were on our way to school and she sat behind me once we got to her pickup spot. Butt had placed her hair in a ponytail with a red flower on the side of her head. After greeting her friends, popped up from her seat and spit on my head. Now they had spat at us before, even fired half-chewed Doritos, but they had always missed. This time it was directly dripping onto my head, as if I was in some type of horror movie with the beast clinging to the ceiling and oozing its body fluids down my face.

At this point, I'd had enough. My patience with them had already been worn down needle-thin, and the ooze from her mouth dripping onto my face had broken something in me. I didn't want to simply confront her, I needed something better. It was at that moment that I finally let the hatred flow through me, and I looked all around the immediate area, praying that I would find some kind of object or tool to exact my revenge, not later that day, not the next day, but NOW. And my prayers were answered.

Underneath my seat, there was a full, unopened jar of Vicks VapoRub and a greasy paper plate with crumbs still stuck to it.

Like an artist fueled by the madness burning inside of him, I began to finger-paint the jar all over the paper plate in between her spittings, timing it so she wouldn't see what I was planning for her. We were almost at school, and time was running out. I had to make sure that every last drop of that little jar full of revenge was smeared onto some part of the plate.

We started pulling up to the curb at school. We had arrived late and the line of buses in front of us had already dropped off their loads of kids. Butt continued to pop up to let fly drops of spittle. I had been timing it the entire ride. Almost every 30 seconds. I listened. The sound of her popping up to spit made a slight sound, that crinkling-type sound when you sit on a leather seat and it sticks to you. I was ready.

I heard her start to stand, and like greased lightning on fast-forward, I turned and pied that bitch right in the forehead with an entire jar of strategically-placed Vicks. I smeared it all in her hair, around her ears, making sure to get it on the back of her head as well. The bus stopped and the doors opened. I stood up, dropped the plate on the floor of the bus, and glanced at her. She had a look of shock and horror on her face, her hands running through the blue glazed glob covering her hair. She began to cry. I turned, without saying a word, and walked off the bus, basking in the howls of laughter coming from the rest of the kids on the bus directed at her. Her friends had their hands covering their mouths, unable to believe what had just happened.

Now I am a very thin girl and always sit at the edge of my seat to avoid awkward skin contact but she was making it very obvious she was trying to scoot me out. Well I wasn't about to stand up on that cramped bus so I waited it out until I got to my stop to get up. I saw a very large older lady a few people up the aisle from me and got her attention.

Them, ""Juan has pasted away?""
Me, ""Why do you think we financed a funeral through you sons of bitches?!? (i'm yelling at this point) are you retarded or just stupid.""
Them, ""sir, there is not need for that.""

One of the few people for miles is the ditch rider that operates a trans-mountain water diversion structure farther up the creek, owned by the company that bought the water rights my property had before the previous owner sold it.  I had met the ditch rider once before.  He was gruff at first, but as I curiously questioned him about his work, he opened up a little bit.  Ok, enough backstory.

I drove by them on the dirt road, and it looked like they were having a pretty chill get-together.  I didn't mind so much that they were trespassing, but we were in a Stage II fire ban, so having a fire was a big deal.

I made the offer that if they wanted to come back in the future, they could if they just asked me beforehand.  Not a bad deal, I thought.  However, I told them that we were in a stage II fire ban, and flame, including campfires and smoking outdoors, was absolutely prohibited.  I asked that they put out the fire immediately, and they did.  

As I was walking away, I heard one of them say ""fucker thinks he owns the place"" and they all laughed.  I was a little offended considering how I could have easily told them to GTFO, but whatever, you know how male teens can be when trying to impress a group.  Lo and behold, an hour later when I walk back up to check on them, there's a bonfire twice as big as the first one.  A ""fuck you"" to me and, more importantly, a massive middle finger to the well-being of the entire region.  I decide I need to teach these little shits a lesson.

I devised a perfect plan.  Remember when I said that this used to be ditch-irrigated pasture?  All the old water structures were still in place and in pretty good condition.  Only problem was, I didn't have a water right.  So I drove up to the ditch-rider's cabin, and he remembered me from when we had met (I don't think he gets a lot of visitors).  I explained the situation, and his rough exterior turned to outright glee as came up with the same plan I had.  

Together, we shut his company's headgate by about half, allowing a surge of water to flow downstream, and then drove down to the headgate of ""my"" old ditch, and opened it fully.  From the dirt road on the ridge above, we watched as the water crept across the field, soaked their tents and presumably their sleeping gear, and drowned the fire with a steaming hiss.  A mad scramble ensued, as they hastily loaded up their gear and drove away (well, one got stuck in the soggy field for a few minutes and needed to get pulled out).  As they passed us on the dirt road out, I get a nasty look from the guy who had so indiscreetly told me off.  I chuckled to myself.  It's not like I own the place :)

pihb,227,,487,1g4fqe,,1282,"Setting up the background of the story, I was at a youthful age of 6 and living on a military base in Germany.

This all started from my very uncharismatic mother. Of course young kids pick up words they hear frequently. I happened to learn the mighty unweilded power of the F Bomb.

One day my mom and I were talking and I dropped it. The first thing she did was grab my arm, drag me into the kitchen, grab some liquid dish soap, and proceed to wash my mouth out.

Now, I was only 6 years old, but I was not about to be punished for repeating a word I learned directly from the hand that feeds. Getting my mouth washed out was not a pleasant experience, and I learned nothing from her ""punishment.""

As the night progressed, I was pretty damn bitter about what happened earlier. That night my mom was on the phone talking to my grandparents. She usually had a glass soley for drinking water out of. One thing i figured out is that when she takes a drink, she is a chugger and not a sipper. So being the ""nice"" guy that I am, I offered to refill her empty water glass because she was busy on the phone. 

 This is my favorite part. I had every intention at getting even with her. i refill her water glass. After it is full, I take the bottle of dish soap, and squeeze a shit ton into the glass itself. I waiting to put soap in last to avoid sudding. I gave the cup to my mom. Of course she is super chatty and looked thirsty. I could tell by how parched her lips were. She was pretty much salivating over that cold refreshing glass of water as i entered the room. Sure enough she took it from me and proceeded to chuch. Then wait, the dynamic in the room changed and time came to a halt. The water glass slowly released from her hand as gravity did god's work on its course to the shaggy carpet. 

Absolute disgues spread across her face. I could feel her anger. She grabbed me up so fast and started whooping me. I didn't care though. No spanking could erase that smug smirk from my face. That was the first and last time mouth wash with soap ever happened in the house.

They say revenge is a dish best served cold. I say revenge is soap hidden for consumption.

neenerneenerboo,69,,495,1qw75b,,1272,"Sorry this is long. But oh so sweet. 


This guy that went to my high school, Jimmy, was the absolute worst. He was the typical asshole jock—everyone let him get away with shit. But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes. I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way, so he thought we were even friends. 


My main beef with him was the way he treated girls. Though Jimmy wasn’t very attractive, he coasted on popularity, and our school was very small with more girls than boys. He mostly preyed on underclassmen (my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy) but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be, so I witnessed over and over again as he’d suck in one of my friends, who would be convinced that he’s changed for her and being genuinely nice this time, and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested. 


He dated one of my friends, Jane, who is the sweetest person in the world. She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break. Telling her she’s gaining weight, flirting with other girls in front of her, general toying of her emotions. You could tell she was super stressed out, and finally she broke up with him. Wahoo! 


But it didn’t end there. We had assigned seats in computer class, and I sat between Jimmy and Jane’s sister, Beth, who is equally sweet. On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends (close to Mr. Teacher’s desk so he could try to keep them in check) where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were. Right after the breakup, Jimmy talked about how he’s over it and already has “a few public school sluts lined up,” (lols, private school life—this was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you “met on vacation so she lives in a different city”) and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane, and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth, who was not a confrontational person. 


I plotted. Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence. Since he was put in the spotlight so often, it was easy to see that while he could get an A+ at getting girls to send him nudes, he struggled academically. So, I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else. I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer, pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pull-out keyboard (there was a lot of hidden room, they sat just out of view above my own keyboard.) 


Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual, but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment, he just could not get it right. This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password. He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr. Teacher, who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmy’s information just fine. “Maybe you had your password wrong?” he says, but Jimmy is insistent that he isn’t that stupid and something is wrong with the computer. 


I tormented Jimmy for weeks, pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes. He would put his mouse icon over a button, and then I’d slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it, infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something. Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible. His documents were full of typos. He would type a word, and I would just press one letter to throw him off, and then he’d try again, only for the same thing to happen. Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead, but right-clicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention. Open the task manager while he’s in a program. He’d look away, and I’d close a window or document, or just press backspace until he turned around. I was careful to be pretty inconsistent—when other people were looking, I’d back off to make him look crazy. Whatever he’d been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over. My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard. 


I started to punish him this way. Wandering eye? Wandering mouse while he’s trying to play a game. Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that naïve freshman? Oh look, his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged. Ignore new girlfriend because it’s funny? Unexpected shutdown, because losing unsaved work is funnier. One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy, and I put a number at the end of his new password, and the same thing when he confirmed the password. This new password then didn’t work, and he couldn’t reset it again without knowing the current password. Jimmy was going nuts, but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didn’t know how to use a computer. He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer. His assignments took longer, so he had less time to horse around with his friends. People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class, and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything. 


One time, when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didn’t even have his hands on anything, I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen. His eyes widen and he shouts, “Look!” interrupting Mr. Teacher’s lecture. I stop. “It was doing it! My mouse was moving and I wasn’t even doing anything!” We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmy’s delusions as he keeps yelling, myself and Beth included, although we were laughing on the inside, giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmy’s meltdown. 


“That’s it,” Mr. Teacher said, worn thin over Jimmy’s incompetence. “No one else is having problems with that computer. You’re just not compatible, I guess. Move to that one.” He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students, which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers. 


Jimmy protests, suggesting Mr. Teacher “just fix it,” but at this point, Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too. We weren’t bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class. But to my surprise, Jimmy still had problems. Almost all the stuff I was doing. He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks, but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers. One day alone in the computer room, I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr. Teacher comes in. He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse, which wiggled around on Jimmy’s screen. 


“Wifi,” he explained. 


Turned out, Mr. Teacher knew what I was doing all along. He hated dealing with Jimmy too, and distracting him meant less class disruption. But after his meltdown, Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his far-away friends. 


Tl;dr: Guy is a douche to my friend, plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him. He goes crazy and everyone talks about it. 

Edit for more info: We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere, our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach, and he was Jimmy's track coach, so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class, they joked around a lot. At our school, the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal. He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough. He was just a few years out of college, and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruption.

Jimmy really actually was bad with computers. At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black. He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer. I know that using Bluetooth doesn't always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school, so perhaps that's what the teacher meant--I am really not that great with that stuff myself. Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts.

One night my dad was the creep, and now there are about 10 teenagers in Czech that are terrified of the woods at night. Although they were douches, so it's alright.

Let me explain.

I go to school in the US, but all of my extended family lives in the Czech Republic. Every year that we go back, my uncles and aunts throw a party for us in their mountain house. This house is up in the mountains, very secluded from other houses.


One night we were all sitting outside around a campfire and our neighbors, albeit quite far were being RIDICULOUSLY loud. They are Czech, aka. they were drunk. Yelling, swearing, shooting off fire crackers; the works. My cousin had just put her toddler down to sleep, and was worried that they would wake him up, so my dad decides to walk over there to ask them to be quiet.

My dad was really polite about it and they seemed apologetic so my dad left and returned to our campfire. Naturally, in about ten minutes they were just as loud, this time yelling thing to us telling us to not be party poopers, shooting firecrackers in our direction, that we are jealous we aren't having as much fun, blah blah blah. After about ten minutes of them not dying down my dad decides to take action.


My dad is 6'6 and 230 pounds of pure muscle (he was an athlete) so he's in incredible shape and just a very imposing man. He takes his shirt off and puts on this mask that my uncle just so happened to have laying around. This mask was human faced, but it was a very distorted and really creepy, kind of like this: http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/creepy-ultra-realistic-human-face-mask
He goes to the shed and takes the ax and decides he's going to scare these drunk assholes.

The property that they were on is shaped like a square with dense forest completely covering the outskirts. Their fire was right in the middle. My dad slowly walks from the forest, but never ventures further toward the camp, and simply slowly walks the perimeter, swinging the ax and staring at the fire.
We heard the drunk guys screaming and swearing and my dad came back laughing, saying that he had never seen teenagers run that quickly.

Not surprisingly, the rest of the trip in the mountain house was peaceful without the noise of our drunken teenage neighbors. Probably because they were too busy locked in their house, shitting themselves.

giraffe_taxi,79,,280,1pzmxu,,1262,"The main floor of my apartment building had a small common area, where the mailboxes and bulletin board were.

One day I came downstairs to find a shitty old black couch sitting in front of the mailboxes. It was taking up most of the area, and if anyone had to move large items in, they'd have to move that couch out first.

Initially there was a handwritten note taped to it, that said ""Leather couch for sale for $300! Call xxx-xxx-xxxx)."" After a few days the sign vanished, but the couch remained for a few days, then one week, then another.

About a month later, I walked downstairs in a really bad mood. The couch was still there. Then the idea came to me... I snapped a few pics with my phone, and a few minutes later, I was finishing up the text in my Craigslist submission. ""Leather couch for sale! $100!!!"" read my new post.

**Situation**

So I just started college this summer, and the roommate I got paired up with was fine for two weeks.

Now he seems to have developed a habit of leaving his key in the room any time I'm there because I'll just open the door for him on the inside.  I didn't mind the first few times, until i realized he wasn't even trying to remember his key, he was just using me as a doorman. Several times a day he expected me to stop whatever I was doing, and go open the door for him, because he couldn't be bothered with it. I know it's not a big deal but I'm usually in bed with a book or a laptop I don't want to rearrange myself once an hour for no reason.

And there is absolutely no reason for him not to carry his key.  It's just a card that opens the door when he gets close, and he wears cargo shorts everyday so it's not lack of pockets to keep it in.  If he had simply asked ""Do you mind opening the door for me all the time so I don't have to carry my key?"" I would have said yes.  I would have been a little annoyed but I would have said yes.

**Revenge**

Last night while he was out in the lobby, I decided I was tired.  I turned my phone off got into bed and fell asleep.  I'm a fairly heavy sleeper so knocking on the door isn't going to be enough to wake me up, and if you make too much noise the RA will get mad. He had to stay out in the dorm hallway all night.

He usually has an alarm every morning to wake him up at 7:00  The really annoying iphone emergency one that goes ""DAH DAH DAH"" like there's a fire.

feminazi1602,74,,368,1fq7f4,,1247,"**The backstory:**

A few years ago in a sunny old town in the south of England, my boyfriend at the time and I had tickets to go and see his favourite band. It was going to be a pretty intimate gig with only about 50 or so people there and we were both really looking forward to it.

So, we're standing in line to get in to the venue when the boyfriend spots his ex girlfriend also waiting in the queue. Fine, whatever, he goes up to her, says hello, introduces me, all is well, very civil, very English. 

Skip ahead a few hours and after several drinks, nature is calling and this being a small venue there is only one ladies' toilet. And who so happens to be in the queue in front of me? Yes, that's right folks, the ex girlfriend. Not a problem I think, bit awkward but she was civil enough earlier. I enter the cubicle, do the business and as I go to open the door, I find that I can't open it. After pushing and pushing it quickly becomes clear that her and her friends are leaning against the door so I can't get out. Very mature. They eventually give up as the main band is about to go on...

**The Revenge**

The problem was that in order to get into this particular venue you needed to be 18 and I knew for a fact that she was, at the time, 17. So, after the incident in the loo, I think ""well, if she wants to act like a child then she might as well be treated like one"", casually strolling up to the bouncer and alerting him to the fact that there is a girl here who is underage. I point her out to him (she had bright pink hair, hard to miss) and she is quickly escorted out when she fails to produce any ID, missing the band she had been waiting all night to see.

To top it off, she was barred from that particular venue.....and her bag got stolen (not by me I might add!)

Well I guess the gentleman in question had the house to himself (a rare occurrence) one night at about 2 am.


He is just BLASTING porn. Terrible, fake, girl screaming for 25 minutes porn. Anyway, I knock politely on the wall. Nothing. Knock again. Not certain, but I think the volume went UP. Two can play this game, motherfucker.


So I hook up my gigantic speakers to my lap top (its important to note that my roommate wasn't home either) and search for 'noisy gay threesome' or something on Youporn. Oh god, so much man-grunting, and dirty talking to boot. And so fucking loud.

lazychris2000,87,,309,1cts47,,1205,"I was reminded of a different kind of petty revenge when I [posted pics of my rolled Jeep](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/1ctlwm/my_wife_and_i_walked_away_with_nothing_more_than/).  

**The backstory**

The long story is in the post if anyone is interested, but the short version is this:

In 2009, my wife and I were driving from her parents' house in Kenai, AK to Anchorage a few days after Thanksgiving.  90 miles from home, we got caught in a blizzard and gale force winds pushed my Jeep just far enough to catch the snow berm and flip us.  A trooper got us to the closest town to the accident, about 40 miles from home, after midnight.

**The plan**

After many calls, I got ahold of a friend who was able to pick us up and take us home.  It was over a 2 hour round trip for him, and he would not take the $50 I was trying to give him to cover gas and his time.  Even after I stuffed the money into his pocket, he just gave it back and said that he wasn't going to take it.  Over the next few days, I kept trying to give him the cash, but he wouldn't take it.

I decided I wasn't going to put up with his shit anymore, so I hatched a plan.  I stopped at the bank and had them convert the $50 bill to 1's and put my plan into motion.  

**The revenge**

In the 2-3 weeks that followed, I would slip $1 at a time into his stuff.  Coat pockets, gloves, stuffed into his cupholder or sticking out of the seat of his car, wherever I could stealthily put cash.  My favorite was sticking one between the sun visor and roof of his truck, which took him a couple weeks to find.  

It took several months, but he eventually figured out it was me and we got a good laugh about it.  Maybe next time, he'll just take the money.

**TL;DR I told him he would take the money and goddammit, I wasn't going to take no for answer**",I don't take no for an answer when I'm right.,1514,pettyrevenge
GreenHillsBaby,276,,197,13hcng,,1210,"I work as a cashier at a crafts store. Most of my customers are bored soccer moms or older ladies. Most of those customers are also couponers who argue and fuss over everything. Hell, one lady made me return her items, manually by code, for over an hour so that she could get .38 cents back through a coupon. 

But anyways.

This one lady comes up, ignores my smile and ""Hello, how are you?"" (Fuck you, I have a beautiful smile) and throws her items at me. When I reach over to start scanning, she barks out ""STOP."" Sticking out her hand like so: http://i.imgur.com/Dnmkn.jpg . She tells me that she wants me to tell her the price of each item, even though there is a screen right in front of her that tells her the price. I inform her of the monitor and she replies ""I thought I told YOU to tell me the prices, not the computer?"" I know I should've just told her the prices, but after +30 customers a day wanting you to tell her the prices for all of her items, it's very tiring. I don't like talking. 

So I scan and tell her the prices. She takes out anything that isn't a dollar. Finally, I'm eager to get rid of her and tell her the total. She sticks out her hand again in the ""Stop"" motion and tells me to ""HOLD IT."" She throws a piece of chocolate at me. It hits me in the chest and I just stare at her. She goes ""Scan that. I want it.""

So vision reddening and veins pulsating, I scan it. And squeeze the absolute shit out of the chocolate between my index finger and thumb when I put it in her bag. The crack I felt when the chocolate submitted to my superior strength instantly released any pent up anger I felt. Fuck orgasms, true love, and good grades. That moment was the happiest in my entire life.

It was one of these chocolates: http://i.imgur.com/UJH9f.jpg

So even if it didn't upset or ruin her day, it would have annoyed her just a little. Just because all the caramel would be smeared over the foil wrapper. And she'll get caramel all over her old lady faux-fur lined gloves. Maybe even touch her stupid cat-eye glasses and get chocolate all over her vision, momentarily blinding her and causing her to crash and DIE.

Super petty but a small bit of satisfying revenge. Aside from her throwing her credit card and me and me flicking it back so that she can swipe it on the machine next to her and me not giving her a coupon. Best. Day. Ever.

MagicalMurderCat,115,,295,1astv8,,1202,"I used to work at Things Remembered, which is a store that sells a bunch of keepsake shit with space for engravings. We would do the engravings in the store, not by hand but with these big machines. The way they would work is, you'd put the piece into the clamps on the machine, type in what you want engraved, and play with the settings, of which only two mattered - how many passes the machine would make, and how much force would be behind the needle (since we engraved anything from glass to stainless steel, these varied settings were necessary). It would usually take five to fifteen minutes to do, but the company policy is to tell the customer it'll be an hour, in case there's a backlog. And the store is in a mall, so waiting an hour wasn't a big deal, there was plenty to occupy yourself with and customers never seemed to have a problem with this.

Except this one woman. She came in and bought a door knocker, wanted her family's name engraved on it. Ok, no problem. I do the papers for her order and tell her it'll be about an hour. She completely lost her shit at this, insisting that her time was too valuable to waste in a mall, and she would wait in the store, thank you very much. And she did, hovering like a bitchy hawk as I plugged her order into the engraving machine.

So of course I chose to put the needle on the lightest force possible, with as many passes as possible, turning what would have been a five minute job into - yep - sixty minutes. That damn machine was grinding away for a full hour and she lurked around the store the entire time.

Me:  Harried with, wife, kid of 8, kid under 3, everyone's hands full, tired.

Opponents:  Gang of pre-teens and teens back from day at the local mall, shouting obnoxiously, making space for themselves on the platform.

Objective:  Train seats.

Train stops right in front of where we are standing (point to us!).  But not only do the teens push in front of us (all right, sorta fair play, big jostle) but break *all the rules* by pushing in before the outgoing passengers are even halfway out.  Huge snarl for everyone on the train and platform, lost tempers, glares, teens slip through the snarl, snag the seats, we (and little kids) left standing.  We're not the only ones; other mothers/fathers with little kids and struggling also standing.

The revenge:    As train is jerking along and I'm trying to control a standing toddler and bags, one of the sitting pre-teen girls let a bag with a rolled poster sticking out of it flop over and across the aisle.  I'll be darned if the poster just didn't roll right in front of my feet while I was shifting, and *gosh darn* I couldn't help my foot coming down on the poster, and in shifting weight, step hard and crush the poster roll.

I was leaving a drugstore at (strip mall) the other day and I'd parked at the other end near the grocery store because I needed to pick up a few things for dinner and parking is easier down there.

Since I'm taller than average (6'5""), I can see a woman with her cart unloading groceries into her car which is parked next to mine.   As I walk I see her finish unloading and then **push the cart over so it's behind my car** then she gets into her car and starts doing something.

I'm getting closer and so I'm watching to see if maybe she's going to get back out and take care of the cart (the cart return is two spaces away on the other side of my car) but no. She starts the car but continues to lollygag.

I decide I can have something else for dinner so I quickly I walked to my car with my tiny bag, **pushed the cart so it's behind her car** and I'm behind the wheel and pulling out - but not before I hear her start screaming, waving her arms and carrying on as she notices the cart that's now behind her car.

cum_box_on_fire,136,,309,1land1,,1193,"In the old college days, in the days when Britney Spears was at the height of her popularity, my roommate and I had a pack of sorority sisters move into the apartment above ours.  All was well for the first couple of weeks before classes, but as soon as classes began, we were subjected to a nightmare every morning. At precisely 6:50am, Britney Spears began blaring upstairs *in the bedrooms* until 8am, usually combined with stomping and clapping. There were at least 8 girls living in the two bedroom apartment, I saw them moving bunk beds in. As a result, every morning our ceilings became the target of Britney-O-Thon 2000.

In contrast to the above, my roommate and I were both in our third year, had only afternoon-evening classes, and usually late-evening classes and labs as well. We chose an apartment in the basement of the building because it was quiet, and dark.  As a result, we woke up around noon, and stayed up till around 4am, as did most of the people we knew.  It was a good life, until the ladies upstairs moved in.

Now, this is college. They could have had a party every night stomping on our living room ceiling and we wouldn't have cared. They could have had Britneyfest each morning in their living room, and we wouldn't have cared. It was just that it was directly above *our* bedrooms each morning that made it intolerable.

Instead of tolerating this crap, the first day it happens I go up there and slam on the door, standing there angry in my underwear until three girls open the door and look out. I explain to them that the level of noise they're putting out before 8am isn't very nice for people like us, and that we would appreciate it if they took the loud music and talking and jumping into their own living room, which appeared to be completely empty.  They said ""OK!"" and were quiet the rest of the morning. The next morning, they were up to it again. I give them a one day pass because I'm hung over. I let them know on morning three that they're being too loud again, this time, they laugh in my face.  They are even louder the next two mornings.

Saturday rolls around, all is quiet. I hear them moving around about noon, overhear one of them outside talking about hangovers.  Weekend warriors, I see. So I go upstairs while they're out partying that night and borrow a friend in the building's hi-fi speakers, he had this pair of floor standers with 3x10"" speakers in each, then the tweeters and mids.  I already had a nice 100W amp that was serving only occasional duty for movie night, and with much smaller speakers.  We make a trip to Wal-Mart and hit the used CD bin.

They get home around 2am, drunk, falling down, all of that. At 5am, speakers facing upwards in both of our bedrooms start playing Boston's ""MORE THAN A FEELING"" at what I can only describe as an unholy volume. We had to plug our ears, and lock the apartment, and go for a walk while it played on repeat for an hour.

Sunday morning is as blissfully quiet as Saturday. Monday morning rolls around, at Britneyfest happens again.  Tuesday, 3am-5am, ""IT'S MORE THAN A FEEELING.""  No Britney on Tuesday. No Britney on Wednesday. No Britney, ever again.

alcoholly1985,74,,330,1mpd52,,1192,"I used to work for a large telecommunications company (UK) in the retail sector. The manager was awful. She was loud, rude, cruel (used to deny people a holiday day because she knew how much they wanted to spend the day with their partner etc.) and totally up herself. We're talking super vain here. She made comments about ""Don't they know who I am?"" When put on hold. We hated her.

So I'd recently moved back to a small town after a couple of years working for the same company in a larger city and they only had a part time vacancy of about 4 short shifts a week. I took it because I knew (she told me) someone was going to get fired. I'd actually worked for the company longer than she had, but that's not relevant to the story. She used to insist that members of the team show up half an hour before their shift even though company policy ASKS (cannot enforce, is unpaid) we show up 15 mins before. Over a week this would equate to around 2 hours extra of my being at work unpaid just to sit out the back for no other reason than her control issues.


Anyhoo, I was in town one day and stopped by a rather well known coffee outlet to pick up my favourite skinny iced beverage and took it to work to drink before I started. My manager saw me and decided to drink some. Didn't ask, just took it out of my hands and drank.
It was the final straw (pun intended). She said how delicious it was and when I told her it was lowfat she was really impressed, as she had problems with her weight. She wasn't fat, she was just a couple of sizes bigger than suited her frame and she was really paranoid about it.

Next shift I'm on my way in for the half hour before my shift started (I know she couldn't enforce it but she was such a nasty, vindictive person that it just wasn't worth the hassle) when I pass by the aforementioned coffee shop. My mind starts to fizz with a very evil and very petty plan. I call her up, say I'm getting a lowfat iced coffee and if she'd like one. I also mention there's rather a long queue (there wasn't). She gets all excited and greedy and says she'd love one, after mentioning that all the ""fuckers in the queue should move, don't they know I'm waiting for my drink?"".

So in I go, stand and chat for a few minutes, wasting time, and of course order one deliciously skinny icy coffee for me and one full fat extravaganza for her. I even got them to add the whipped cream before they finished it so it wouldn't be sat on top, giving me away. I slowly walked to work, handed her the heart-attack maker and watched her drink it all (she did actually pay me for it, which made it even better). So I'd gotten to work ten minutes before my shift and ruined her diet.

I continued to do this at least twice a week for the following 3 months before I went full time. She couldn't understand why her shirt was getting tighter and tighter... some of those things have almost half a days calorie allowance. I never told anyone, until now.

It still makes me laugh, I'm chuckling now!

You know what it is, you've probably gotten drive-through there at one in the morning while drunk and thoroughly regretted that decision the following morning. This chain, to the unaware, recently implemented their version of ""Happy Hour,"" which just made our already-busy location even busier during what used to be the dead period from 2pm-5pm.

They pull up to the menu and begin by literally screaming into the microphone. I'm still not sure what they screamed when they got there as blood had already begun pooling in my ear from the unholy screech, but regardless of what it was, it didn't leave a good first impression. They then spend the next three minutes discussing with each other what they want and falling into fits of laughter, while I sit there watching my speed-of-service time creep higher and higher with nothing that could be done.

Finally, they order. The line staff is prepped and ready for the sure onslaught of food these girls will want, given the wait time on the order.

One taco and two small Pepsi's. 

They spent four minutes in the middle of the day, a line forming behind them, to order $4 of food.

[deleted],118,,276,192skp,,1175,"This one is an unorthodox form of revenge, though. Not from the food server but instead a dismayed observer. 

So I'm out to dinner with some friends. And one guy, a friend of a friend, is being a particular prick. 

As a side note, he is known as a real penny pincher. A tight ass, so to speak. Always asking for drinks, asking for handouts. And it turns out that this guy has been rorting our country's (Australia) welfare system for years. I only recently found out. 

So here we are, at the restaurant table, and he is being racist - talking about Hitler and using fake German accents in this Hungarian restaurant...in front of the friendly young Hungarian waitress... 

He is complaining about the menu, and generally being rude to this poor waitress who is obviously new to the job (a backpacker) and just being nice, whilst no doubt earning very little and not being tipped much (we don't tip as much as people in the States) 

So I tell him to stop being an asshole, but he won't listen. 

He continues... we all, as a group, scold him for being a prick, but he continues. 

Time passes, and later, the waitress brings his dinner which consisted of chicken schnitzel and chips. At this point, we are all happy because the food is great, but of course he then decides to complain and ask the poor waitress to put the chips back in the frier because ""they're not cooked enough"". And to get a new soda because ""it is diet, not regular"" (we sip the soda and all agree he is wrong).

Rhode,194,,530,1p4ck2,,1173,"So my boss is a total bitch to me.  She's a bitch to everyone, but she gives it to me double because I'm the only man in the department and she hates men.  She's also married to my stepmother's brother, and she and my stepmother no longer get along so, as they say, shit rolls down hill.  

The revenge is a two-parter.  My boss is a classic middle-management narcissist.  She has this thing where she thinks that other people actually give a shit how much time she spends in the office, which couldn't be further from the truth.  So she puts in a 60 hour week virtually every week thinking that people see her as this great martyr that's making huge sacrifices for the good of the company.  In reality, we all know that her marriage is horribly broken and she is just desperate for attention and validation.  But nonetheless, it absolutely kills her if she's ever not the first person in the office each morning.  So I come in early.  

It makes sense for me to come in early.  We're in Chicago, traffic is brutal here, I like to get a head start.  So I'm here at 7:00 AM every day, and about once a week I'm here by about 6:30, just to stick it to her.  To compensate for me being here early, she's now here at 6:20 most days, which is madness because her drive is at least 45 minutes even without traffic.  Then she stays here past 6:00 PM to miss the evening rush hour, while I leave at 3:30.  Like I said, it's just madness, the work we do here is not important at all.  

The second part of my revenge is great because I've been doing it forever and she's only just now starting to figure it out.  The first thing I do every day is run a report, the details of the report aren't important for this story.   I log in to our system, generate this report, export it to excel, clean up the formatting, and then send it out to the department.  The whole thing only takes about 15 minutes, but my idiot boss thinks it takes longer.  Not only that, but she actually thinks she's helping to do it. 

When she was trained on the system and they showed her how to run this report, they taught her to set a bunch of filters to reduce the size of the report.  I figured out right away that the filters just slow everything down and make the system run slow.  So what my boss does is she runs the report on the system with all the filters in place and it takes forever, like 15-20 minutes, and then she saves it on a shared drive thinking that I then take her file and run with it from there.  But in reality, I just run the whole thing myself and never touch her file.  Running the report without the filters takes only seconds, so it's so much easier to just do it that way and then remove the stuff you don't want once you're in excel.  By the time she gets done running it on the system, I've already got it in excel and I'm almost finished with it.  But every day, without fail, she's been dutifully saving this report for me on the shared drive, and once saved, that file never gets opened again.  

This has been going on for years and she has no idea.  Recently, however, she's had a couple of early morning conference calls and has been late getting the file on to the shared drive.  I didn't know that, though, because I don't ever bother to even look for it.  When she realized that I had completed the report without her assistance, she actually got mad at me!  You've got to understand, this woman has a bonafide personality disorder, she needs constant validation.  That I could do something without her help diminishes her value, and therefore makes her mad.  It was like she didn't even know that I could run the reports on my own.  So she came over to me in rage and told me she wasn't going to run the report anymore and that I'm just wasting her time.  I played innocent and used my boyish charm(I always do, she's clueless), ""Oh gosh! I'm sorry, Sandie!"" I took her abuse while laughing at her on the inside.  It's been a few days now, she hasn't quit running the report for me.  Every day that file has still showed up on the shared drive, she genuinely thinks she's doing important work.  It's great.

TL;DR: Asshole boss wastes her time every day generating a file no one ever touches.  ","Be a complete bitch to me for no reason? That's cool, here let's just waste a bunch of your time first thing in the morning, every day for the rest of the time I work here.",1703,pettyrevenge

I found this subreddit and I don't know where else to put this story. I don't really consider it petty revenge, but dammit if I don't get a warm and fuzzy feeling thinking about it.

After my second year in college, a friend and I moved in with another friend. He was renting a 3 bedroom house in a lower income area, so it was pretty cheap. It was fairly close to the university campus, and as all three of us were attending, we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus. 

The neighborhood itself wasn't bad at all. It was mostly other kids, elderly folks, and a few others here and there. Everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors. We'll call them Walter and Jesse.

Now Walter and Jesse were brothers, and entrepreneurs of sorts. They ran a small, in-home business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement. They were meth cooks and dealers. Obnoxious, loud, violent, drug dealers. Everyone hated them, but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while, strung out, from there front yard.

We pretty much fell in line (at first). They would blast music and porn from there house from 7am until 7am. We'd hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn. Huge fucking parties that would go on for days. And to our chagrin, we ignored it all.

Well up arrives march, and my income tax comes in, I only get about $500, but goddammit, that's my $500 dollars and I'm gonna fucking buy something for me. Everything has gone to college and bills and I want to splurge. I go out and buy a 42"" LCD TV. It's a VIZIO, but it's the first HDTV I've ever had. My friends and I set it up, and oh boy did we have fun that week. And only that week, for that's as long as I had it.

The Meth bros decide they're gonna shoot their BB gun at whatever the fuck they can see. At birds, bushes, fences, and especially windows. Well one little BB decided to go straight through my window and hit my TV, cracking it while I was playing some MW2. My face dropped and I heard laughing. Which then immediately turned to death threats if I called the cops. Now I know they had real guns. They had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at them.

My friends and I were all disappointed at the turn of events. And both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it. But nay, not I. The one time I purchased me a bit of joy in my life (I grew up fairly poor), it was taken away from me. So I plotted. And I plotted. And I plotted some more. And an evil plot I did accomplish.

I saved up every gatorade bottle I purchased for about 3 weeks. And every other day I would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one, all with cash of course. Now some of you might see what's going. And you'd be right. I had about 15 bottles saved up. And I made some spectacular chlorine gas bombs.

I waited for a night when both of them were gone. It was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep. I had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior, so I started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence. Since I didn't break down the tablets, it took a while for them to go off. I was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom. And boom they went.

I go back inside and into my room. I hear them going off. BOOM. BOOM. One of my roommates wakes up and goes ""WHAT THE FUCK!?""

BOOM. He wakes my other roommate (his room was closer) and there both freaking out. BOOM. Time to put my game face on. I scramble on out of there and react visibly scared. BOOM. I look at them and tell them to call the cops. BOOM. BOOM. He calls 911 and tells the cops he hears explosions. I go outside and pretend to look like I'm trying to find out what's going on. BOOM. I tell my friend that it's coming from next door. BOOM. He tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller. BOOM. BOOM. I tell him there's a bunch of smoke coming from outside. BOOM. They tell us to stay inside. BOOM. The last one goes off. We close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold. 

Right before the cops come, the Heisenbros show up freaking out. Right as they go inside about 3 cop cars show up and go through the front door. The officers haul them away and we go outside. They question us we tell them what we know. As far as the chlorine gas is concerned. It has already wafted into the atmosphere. 

They came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers. We told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did. The officer left and that was the last time I talked about it. Nobody knows about what I did but me. And it was the happiest we've been in a long time.

The last I heard about them, they were doing hard time for their drug ring, being in possession of illegal firearms, and human trafficking suprisingly.

Coffeegorilla,81,,274,1ibcks,,1168,"   Many MANY years ago (I'm old) Sixth grade me was walking home from school during the wintery month of December.  I was not a popular child but even if I had been, it wouldn't have mattered for there was this 'gang' of 4 eighth grade boys that were just jerks.  They picked on everyone and today, during my cold walk home, they decided to pick on me.  I had 10 blocks to walk in the cold and snow to get home and for the entirety of those blocks, those four jerks threw snowballs at me, specifically at my face.  I couldn't run anywhere, the snow in the yards was too deep, so I had to walk, with my head down, slowly starting to cry, while these four guys kept about twenty feet ahead of me, constantly throwing snowballs.  By the time I got to the walk leading to my driveway I was a wreck, tears and snot frozen to my face, the inside of my jacket all wet from snow melting down the inside.  My dad was outside shoveling, he saw what the boys were doing and started yelling at them to leave me alone.  They started to run and as they ran, in frustration I bent down and picked up a large chuck of ice and salt and slush along the curb, the kind of chunk that had fallen off a car.  I hurled this chunk in a large arc, not 'at' the boys, just in the air in frustration.  The leader, let's call him Mike, took this moment to stop, turn around, and start laughing, ""Ha ha, Coffeegorilla, you puss-""  I'm sure he was going to say pussy, but I wouldn't know, because that ice chunk I hurled into the air hit him directly in the face, causing him to slip on the ice, and fall on his back with a huge thunk.  Immediately I felt better.  My dad started laughing and Mike got up, nose bloody, and sort of scream-cried at my dad to stop laughing at him, which only made my dad laugh harder.  Mike sort of shuffle ran home and my Dad took me inside.  There is no way I could have hit Mike if I tried as I am the least athletic person in the history of ever, but he's the one who stopped to turn around for one last dig and put himself directly in the path of my ice chunk.  So, perhaps this wasn't petty revenge, but damnit if I don't smile when I think of it, especially around Christmas.

Raregan,222,,320,1i5acp,,1177,"A few years ago when I was in Comprehensive School (High School for you non-brits), there was this horrible little kid called Andrew. 

He was your typical bully. He would make sly remarks towards people, trying to provoke them into fights. He was constantly vying for attention from everybody due to his own insecure issues I assume. 
Everyday on the way home from school I would walk for about half a mile to this bus stop where I would sit and wait for my mother to come and pick me up. It was the worst time of the day. Andrew and all his horrible friends would always walk past and feel the need to say something horrible to me to try and get me to react. I would just ignore them as I was never the bravest outgoing kid and the idea of a fight really scared me. One Thursday he and his little group of social rejects decided to stop and intimidate me while I was at the bus stop. They would do this from time to time, there seemed to be no coherence to it. They must of just got the urge to make my life miserable for those few minutes. The usual insults started; lanky, nerdy, gay. This went on for a few minutes until Andrew came up to my face and spat on me. He had always been mean to people but I had never experienced anything like that before. I had no idea how to react. His friends were all egging me on the punch him as they clearly wanted to see him kick my ass, but I was too in shock to really do anything. They left shortly afterwards as I wiped my face furiously. I got in the car with my mother when she arrived shortly after, went home and locked myself in my bedroom and just cried. I had never felt that humiliated and weak in my life.

The next day was a Friday and we had to finish off our IT Coursework for that year. For those of you who might not know IT is basically a dumbed down version of Computer Science. It involves a little bit of Word and Excel but nothing too strenuous. The entire day was dedicated to us finishing this off and handing it in by the three o'clock deadline. I had already finished mine and just intended to sit around all day talking to friends. Andrew came into the class grunting something about how he couldn't be bothered to do anything, and I overheard the teacher telling him that he hadn't even started yet and needed to work hard today. I knew the teacher was going to give him all the answers and basic points he needed to pass as he was from a ""low income background"" and it would look really good on the teacher if he could get him to pass. This wound me up but I figured there wasn't really anything I could do about it. 

For the actual revenge itself you have to understand the type of school I went to. To put it bluntly it was crap. The IT department was one room of about 30 computers, and the teacher was a PE (gym) teacher who took a weekend course in Microsoft Office. Nobody there knew how a computer worked and the concept of programming languages was above everyone. I had meddled a little bit at home with computers but I was far from good at anything, but I did know a few tricks. As he was beginning his coursework (typing out what the teacher had written for him) I decided to try something. I opened up the command line on a nearby computer and typed a shutdown command. Every computers name was written on a little sticky note on the monitor so I typed his in (with the relevant syntax of course) pressed Enter, and voila his computer shut down. 
     I was so happy. He started ranting and raving and swearing. He told the teacher but the teacher must of thought Andrew was just being the little brat he was and making excuses not to work. The nasty bully went on to try other computers but no matter which one he loaded up I kept shutting down his computer. He was getting so furious, and the brilliance was just amplified by the fact no-one believed him. 

This continued for the entire day. I would sit talking to my friends, notice he loaded up a computer, and shut it down. Sometimes I would let him get a bit of his work done and then shut it down so everything was lost. He would call the teacher over to watch how it kept happening but I would just back off and not do anything. Then when the teacher turned his back I would do it again. At the end of the day everybody handed in their finished work and he had nothing to give in. 

He got a 0 for the entire course, and out of 5 GCSE's that he needed to get to pursue further education he got 4. Sometimes I feel bad for making him fail. At the time I didn't know that this course was the difference between him passing and failing the entire year. If I had known that I might not of done it, but whenever I think about him spitting in my face and how humiliated I felt then this revenge always brings a smile to my face.

kestert,182,,327,1njzho,,1169,"I'm a part time single parent with 50% care of my kid.

When my ex got pregnant I stayed at home with the kid **during the day** and worked evenings ~~during the day~~ so she could graduate as a doctor. When she did graduate, she broke up with me.

We did have had a private arrangement where she was meant to pay child support (due to her earning 6 or 7 times more than me). But she has been paying it very irregularly and a much lesser amount than we agreed.

Last year I brought the matter up with her and pointed out that the rate we agreed on was less than I was legally entitled to and I'd like her to pay our agreed rate but I could get the full rate enforced by my country's Child Support Agency (CSA).

She took that as an outrageous threat and told me I just could not make threats like that! And as she told it the fact is she simply couldn't afford the rate they were suggesting.

So a month ago she bought a new car and last week she went off on a month long holiday to Europe but didn't tell me that she was going. I was blindly sending her texts asking for her to pack stuff for my daughter for the change over that it turns out she won't receive until she gets back.

So I just went ahead and organised with the CSA for them to start collecting the money. They will attempt to phone her at work and write to her home address but if they don't hear from her they will start billing her and fine her if she doesn't pay within 7 days beginning from last Monday.

I honestly would have preferred a private arrangement, and would have been happy to accept a lesser amount as long as it was consistently paid. But I didn't want to ""threaten"" her again.

ShaneL79,59,,215,15oarh,,1170,"Early in my relationship with my wife (then gf) we did the long distance thing. She had a two bedroom apartment but was living by herself. Then one of her ""friends"" needed a place so she offered up her second room. I was down every other weekend and since I was working I paid the cable/phone/internet bills and always bought groceries - mainly for my wife but the roommate benefited from that as well. The roommate happened to be dating a good friend of mine and he usually stayed there a couple nights a week despite having an apartment not too far away. 

About 6 months into this arrangement and after returning home to massive parties several times we received a note on my wife's bedroom door. It read (shortened version): ""ShaneL79 must pay 1/3 rent and bills since he regularly stays here. I would like that amount to be returned from this months and last months rent/bills"". 

My wife was definitely annoyed and shocked that she would make demands. She was even more shocked that she wanted those demands to be retroactive. My wife decided to write up the greatest response letter I've ever read. It said:

*""Dear (Roommate),*

*I have considered your demands and have decided that it would only be fair if we both charge our house guests for their stays. I also do not think it is fair that ShaneL79 pays our $200/month cable/phone/internet bill and still has to pay to stay when he visits while your guests do not. So I have included that bill in my calculations. Rent is $800/month, Bills are $200/month. We each paid $500/month as per our previous arrangement.* 

*The new, and more fair arrangement, would see an increase of $200 to the total amount with the addition of the cable/phone/internet bill. That is a total of $1200/month or $40/day in bills. On days when there are three of us staying here that is about $13.50/person per day. Days when there are four of us staying here it will be $10/person.*

*Last month ShaneL79 stayed here 4 days for a total of $54 he owes us. This month he will be here 6 days for a total of $81 he will pay for staying here.* 

*Last month (roommates boyfriend) stayed here 8 days, owing us $108 and this month he has already stayed here 6 days, owing us $81.* 

*Your parents stayed for 10 days last month and since there were two of them, the amount per person per day is $10 since there were four of us staying here. That equals $200. Your mom is staying with us for 7 days next week for a total of $94.50.*

*So that leaves us with our portions. Since we are responsible for the entire month, that means our portion is $20/day when there is only 2 of us here, $13.50/day when there is three of us here, and $10/day when there is 4 of us here.* 

*Last month there were only 2 of us here for 8 days ($160/each), 3 of us here for 12 days ($162/each for our portion), and 4 of us here for 10 days ($100/each for our portion). Our total portion for last month is $422/each.*

*This month there will be only 2 of us for 11 days ($220/each), 3 of us for 19 days ($256.50/each for our portion). A total of $476.50/each.*

*Since we are responsible for our guests, I will include their totals to our portions and you can collect from them however you like and I will collect from ShaneL79.*

*That brings your total from last month to $730 ($422 + $108 (BF) + $200 (parents)). My total is $476 ($422 + $54 (ShaneL79).*

*This month your current total is $652 ($476.50 + $94.50 (mom) + $81 (BF)). My total is $557.50 ($476.50 + $81 (ShaneL79))*

*Since you already paid $500 last month and this month, you only owe $382 which you can collect from your guests. Please have the money by the end of next week.*

*Thanks.""*

Needless to say she completely expected her roommate to move out after reading that. They had been having some arguments leading up to this whole event so the roommates note was the final straw for my wife. The problem is her roommate waited until rent day to give her notice that she was moving out that day, expecting to get away with paying the next months rent and leaving it all on my wife's shoulders. 

While my wife was at school her roommate moved her stuff out without a mention of where she could be reached. So my wife called her roommates parents and explained the situation about a week later (giving her roommate enough time to re-surface). That same night her roommate returned and paid her $500. 

Needless to say they are no longer friends. 

One night shortly after we were at my friends house (her bf) for a party and I jokingly handed him $20 and said ""in case your gf wants us to pay cover for visiting you"". That was the first time he had heard the story. As far as he was aware, we just decided to increase her rent $200/month for no reason. Once I explained it to him we had a good laugh and I came to find out he was in the process of breaking up with her. As it turns out, she moved in with him and tried free-loading. He kicked her out the day before the party and hadn't spoken to her since. 



**TL;DR** - Roommate demanded money from house-guest who was already paying bills. Roommate didn't realize she had guests more often and it was explained to her using math in a way that showed she owed more money by her own logic. The intention of the lesson was to kick her out.

HarryMonk,74,,313,1no06s,,1170,"I commute about 2 hours to work on overcrowded trains. Today I was on a later train that had people packed in like sardines in the corridor. I was in a narrow bit of the corridor along with the refreshments trolley (normally it would move up and down the train selling craps sandwiches and lukewarm coffee and tea).


Some hipster fuck who got on with us decided to sit on the floor and take up even more space. One of my fellow commuters asked him to stand up because we were all crushed and he simply looked up and said ""No"" before putting his earphones in and turning his head. Perhaps it's true that we're all too polite in the UK as nobody said anything. I then resolved to teach the twat a lesson for putting his own comfort over others, if the chance presented itself.


My opportunity came at the last stop. The refreshments trolley had to move due to the penultimate stop being on the other side of train so hipster fuck ended up blocked in by me and the trolley against the doors that wouldn't open.


I let about 10 grinning commuters off before I let him out. The best part was whilst I was doing that he tried shoving into me (I was a fair bit taller than the little cunt) and said ""can you move?""

I bought my two dogs rawhide bones yesterday. A big one for Ruger, the mastiff, and a small one for Molly, the terrier mix. For the last few years whenever these two get treats, Ruger would steal Molly's and eat hers up pretty quick.

As usual, Ruger steals hers. Molly barely complains. She grabs his and goes to the door to be let out. I see her run off to the woods with his bone. A few minutes later she starts barking so of course Ruger wants to see what's going on. 

He drops Molly's bone on the living room rug when I go to let him outside. Molly starts scratching at the front door so I walk to the other freakin side of the house to let her back in. She doesn't have Ruger's bone. Instead she goes straight for her own half chewed one there on the rug.

When I let Ruger in, he looks confused and kinda sad. But he sighs and lays down and doesn't do much about it. Molly finishes off her bone just before bedtime.

This morning after I let them outside to go potty, Molly comes back inside with Ruger's bone. She's laying next to me right now with it. Ruger looks absolutely defeated.

Since there is this wait, we usually ask cars to park along side the restaurant and give them a number for their order.

I was supposed to be working the register, meaning they basically want me tethered to the damn thing. It was raining pretty heavily, and the food runners were MIA. The kid on drive hurt his ankle the day before and asked me to run the food out. I'm kind of annoyed since the runners are missing and they've got our rain jackets, so I have run out and get soaked.

I run out, and this woman is sitting on her cellphone, so I tap her window to get her attention. She holds up a finger to tell me to wait. In the rain. When she rolls her window down, I read back in the most basic of terms her order, like ""cheeseburger meal"". She takes the bag and then asks me to clarify the toppings while I'm getting soaked, and then argues with me about what ""the works"" entails. Then there was an issue with the damn dipping sauce. I'm already pretty wet at this point, so I tell her I'll run and grab the correct sauce for her. ""Oh, that's okay, I was going to go inside anyway.""

At this particular lift, the approach to get onto it is a little bit of an ""organized"" chaos method where people just bunch together and then squeeze down further and further as they inch forward until it becomes a line.

My husband and I got into the bunch, and then I bent over to buckle the clasp on one of my boots.  As I do this, a woman on skis inched her way in front of me in the bunch.  Since it wasn't an official line and it was just one person, I decided to let it pass, as it was a quad lift and we'd all be able to take the same chair up anyway.  But *then*, she turns around and waves to someone behind her, while turning to me and says ""You broke up our group, we're just joining back together so we can get to the top at the same time"".

As the movie begins, we realize roughly 8 or 9 young teens (certainly all too young to be at an R-rated movie without an adult, probably 14 to 16 years old) are seated in the row behind us. This is fine, for a while...



Pretty soon 4 or 5 of them begin talking, laughing, switching seats, and literally just walking around in the theater. This is all just awful because it totally ruins a horror movie experience. I feel bad for the rest of their group, who are clearly trying to enjoy the film, but I'm also annoyed at them for not even asking their friends to settle down or stop being assholes.



At first, I turn around and politely ask them if they could please quiet down. They do for a bit, but it only lasts for a minute or so until they start up again, even louder. 



I'll admit, I have a pretty short fuse, so I turn around and ask them to shut the fuck up. Then a real brave kid tells me to fuck myself. 



You dun fucked up, little man. 



I promptly leave my seat mid-movie, grab a manager, and return to the theater with him.

""This entire row"", I say, watching all of their faces drop in disappointment.

One lady was always calling for very little things like simple paper jams on her desktop laser printer when she didn't bother to switch between card stock and plain paper settings, etc.  She'd always berate the IT staff in front of her class as we worked, playing up to the students about how it would be nice if the school had people who could keep things running, how we had everything set up ergonomically incorrect, etc.  You know the kind.

Anyway, I was finishing up doing some work while she insulted the IT Dept. yet again and noticed she had a highly prized 25' VGA cable running the 3 ft from her screen to her PC.  This lady wore reading glasses, but didn't want to wear them at her computer because 'they don't look good on me', so she had conned one of the techs into giving her the longer cable so she could pull the screen as close to her face as possible.

When she went to lunch, I swapped the 25' cable with a 3 ft cable and stretched the thing as tight as I could pulling the LCD back against the wall. I then took the 25' cable to the digital media teacher as the principal had asked me to find one for him.

45 minutes later, she came into my lab, interrupting a class, yelling about how I messed up her monitor and that she couldn't pull it forward.

I just told her that I had been asked by the principal to allocate that cable elsewhere and that her screen was now ergonomically correct as it was 20""+ from her face.

&gt;The bus driver lays on the horn and slams on the breaks and the woman in the car FLIPS HER OFF. On a red light!

&gt;The woman driving the bus curses her out and carries on. We go down the hill into the valley and there is another intersection. This is often a place police set up speed traps, and sure enough that day they did.

&gt;Who should be pulled over on the cross street on the right? Fancy cadillac lady. The bus driver gets excited, pulls the bus over and calls a cop over. She says 'Did she get caught for speeding?' And the cop says, 'she sure did,' and the bus driver responds, 'Is running a red light still illegal here?' The cop laughs, 'Sure is,' hands her his card,'are you willing to testify in court?'

&gt;The bus driver laughs and says, 'Honey, I get paid a days wage to go to court for these things it would be my pleasure.'

&gt;Then the front of the bus who heard the exchange starts clapping.

alyx,60,,261,1ffxy3,,1152,"Last year I took the train home after bringing my husband's car into service station. As I live one station from the airport I chose a good time and thought it wouldn't be that crowded. I was surprised to find the whole train nearly empty. A few minutes later a guy entered the train with a whole bunch of luggage. There were like 8 huge bags and suitcases and by the sweat on his forehead I could tell it was a heavy load. I offered my help but he would refuse.

He was arranging his luggage so everyone could easily pass by, what took him a good two minutes (credits for that!). As he was finally sitting down in the opposite cabin, the train ran into the next station and I see an elderly lady with a kid entering the coach. The woman approached the guy, pointed to a small sign that said handicapped people only and claimed the seats saying she was handicapped. She started flipping off the guy in a very rude way.
The guy instantly got up, when I chimed in and offered my seat for them. I also pointed at all the unoccupied seats in the coach but the woman wouldn't even look at me and kept claiming the seats. 

I felt sorry for the guy and this time he accepted my offer to help him move the luggage. I was boiling inside and I couldn't believe my eyes when she stood there for a whole minute watching us move the bags instead of sitting down with the kid.

The woman mentioned the airport a few times so I thought it would be their destination. I don't know why I didn't get out when I arrived at my stop but my guts told me I'd miss something and it was maybe my time to shine in a petty revenge... so I stayed for the airport stop and helped this guy bringing all the luggage to the door. When the door opened he jumped out and I passed him one suitcase after another and hell, some of them were pretty heavy. About 3 of the bags were out when I heard the lady nagging behind me...

""Let me out of the train, you're blocking me and my kid"" to which I replied with ""use another door then or wait, old Lady.""
She yelled at me and started pushing me (which makes me fucking furious, I hate people pushing near trains and tracks) but I kept passing the bags to the guy as clumsy as one possibly can and told her to shut up.  I knew the train wouldn't wait forever and when the last bag was out I heard the annoying beep of the doors which indicated the train was about to depart. The kid and I hopped out and the lady was so busy with her rant she didn't notice. She was probably expecting someone miraculousy to show up who says something like ""Yeah, you fucking old lady, I got your back here"". 

The doors shut and once they're shut there's no way back. The train slowly departed and I was in shock, I mean I didn't expect that, I just wanted to delay her getting off the train by acting clumsy... but then I noticed the kid and the luggage guy laughing hard next to me. I started laughing too and the woman in the train was pounding the glass, gasping... and I will never forget her swollen red face of anger and rage, oddly no horror or fear.

We talked to the kid and I took him to a cafe where he called his mom (which wasn't the woman in the train) and she came shortly after to pick him up. The kid told her the story and exaggerated a little too much, casting the care taker in a very negative light and that's basically how this woman lost her job. I'm still in contact with the kid's family as we found out we're actually neighbours.

Fun Fact 1:  The woman was far away from being handicapped, she was just a lazy twat who liked to harrass other people.

Fun Fact 2: I chose the cafe next to the escalator so we could see this 'care taker' to come back with the next train to search for the 10 year old kid she's responsible for. Lady kept no-show. What kind of person does that? 

**TLDR:** Care taker harrasses a guy in a train, gets petty revenged by blocking her way out and ends up departing with the train, while the kid she's in charge of, stays at the airport train station.

Edit: typo and some additional fact at the end.

Rocknocker,83,,229,18i7eu,,1133,"I live in a villa complex where each tenant has a pool of one sort or another on their third floor, which is open to the elements. Some have lap-pools, some have Jacuzzi pools and some just have big-holes-full-of-water-to-drunkenly-party-around-at-all-hours-of-the-fucking-night. 

My immediate neighbor to the east has the latter model.

He’s also single and loves to rev up noisy, raucous pool parties which do indeed last until the wee, wee hours. 

Now, I may be a bit of an old phart, but I like my parties as well; however I also like to sleep and tend to get a small bit, a tiny bit, well, homicidally irritated when this happens on a weekly basis. 

Imploring him to “Shut the fuck up you chapped bastard!” and “Will you turn that offensive crap down?” always either goes unheeded or is greeted with a single digit salute and numerous anatomically impossible suggestions. 

Well, then. Now, then.

He works in the field as well as the office and is sometimes away for days at a time. 

Hee, hee, hee…

Back in the day, I studied hydrology and fluvial systems (i.e., rivers). In order to map currents and flow rates, we would use **P-50 Fluorescein** tablets (slightly smaller in size than a hockey puck) to give a beautiful fluorescent green color to the water at concentrations around 10 ppm. 

Well, fine and dandy for flowing rivers and other open areas of water, but in enclosed bodies of water, Fluorescein dye is exactly that, an organic dye. 

When noisy neighbor had to go out on a job one warm summer’s eve, I slipped over the common wall that separates our two villas, and got into his pool shack (where the filters, pumps and other assorted pooly gizmos were housed). Everything was shut down in his absence, so it was quite simple to open the sump of his filter, and drop in 5 of the P-50 tablets, quietly seal everything up, and retreat to my own domicile; but not before I unscrew every light bulb which would illuminate the pool. 
 
A couple of days later, Noisy Mc Asswipe arrives home and how about that? It’s dark out and he wants to unwind from a hard couple of days of fucking around out in the desert with a nice relaxing swim. He flips on the filters and pumps (switches are located inside the villa) and evidently goes to change into his swimwear. 

In the meantime, the dye has had a chance to liquefy and the way I figure it, at a pool capacity of 25,000 liters of water, quickly ramped up to about 15,000 ppm. 

At that concentration (it is an organic dye and utterly harmless, well, for the most part), the dye acts exactly like a packet of Rit in the wash machine. Everything carbon-based that goes in the water will be stained a nice, indelible fluorescent green. 

Very chic.

Not bothering with the lack of lights, he dives into the pool and does a few laps before floating around and deciding it was time for a cold one. 

The screams and plaintive wails reverberating around the compound were most satisfying.

Skandranonsg,124,,266,16kjiq,,1130,"This story comes courtesy of my wife, who is the only female working at  a welding shop in out city. Naturally, she gets a lot of flak for it, but this one time a guy crossed the line.

There is one of the other apprentices there, appropriately nicknamed Steve-O, who is majorly sexist and is always bumping heads with my wife. Now, she's a smart cookie, and you're looking for an ass-whoppin' if you try to engage her in a battle of wits. He always came up with some comment he thought was smart, but she always threw it back in his face.

One day, she got to work, and in big capital letters written in white paint marker was the word ""SLUT"" on her brand new $220 welding helmet. She quickly hid it and took it to the back room to scrub the paint off. Luckily, it was fresh enough to come off without seriously damaging the helmet. 

When Steve-O, whom she already suspected, walked out of the break room a few moments later, his guilt was confirmed by his greeting ""How's it goin', slut.""

Now, I'm sure most of you would freak out, cuss, call him names, and probably even hit him, but remember how smart my wife is? She hatched an even better idea. She went to the shop supervisor and told him about the situation. He offered to write up a harassment report, reprimand Steve-O, and the usual. She asked if it was okay if she handled it on her own. A few grins crept their way onto the normally stoic super's face as she detailed her plan. With his blessings, she waited until lunch.

The bell rang for the shop to go to lunch, but one person would be missing from the break room that day. My wife spent her lunch hour spray painting Steve-O's work bench and stool with spray paint. This wasn't ordinary paint either, this was the paint they use on roads. Bright, fluorescent pink and orange that could be spotted from 50 yards with your back turned while wearing sunglasses. 

By the time she was done, it looked like Hasbro and Mattel had a lovemaking session on this desk and forgot to clean up after themselves. The backdrop was a beautiful shade of pink, accented by orange flowers and the word ""PRINCESS"". 

The lunch bell rang again, signaling time to return to work. A crowd gathered around Steve-O's desk, and laughter rang through the shop. Needless to say, Steve-O's nickname isn't Steve-O anymore. He missed the next 3 days of work for some unknown reason, and he's a few short days away from his last at this particular welding shop.

tl;dr I don't think he's going to get a good reference from this place.

edit: Bonus justice! I forgot to mention that Steve-O spent his whole lunch when he got back grinding it off his table. Now the name Princess has stuck permanently.

So I used to work at one of those large retail home-improvement stores as a cashier, and one day I messed up pretty bad. On this one super busy Saturday I had been assigned to be at the customer service desk, and since I was fairly new I wasn’t exactly sure what to do when an angry or suspicious customer came up to the desk. Usually when you suspect people of trying to return stolen merchandise you would call over your manager and they would tell the customer that we weren’t going to take those items back. However on this fateful Saturday, I found myself in that situation and I panicked.

**THE ACT**
I had been doing well with no hiccups at the customer service desk, and I was getting the hang of all the duties. There had just been a rush of customers, and my area around my register was quite messy. I was trying to organize everything before another wave of people came in. That’s when this very large, ghetto, and overall unpleasant lady came around the corner with a cart filled with the largest and most expensive cans of wood stain that we sold. My suspicions were already up since she came around the wrong way and not through the front entrance. She makes eye contact with me, and slowly lugs her heavy cart up to my register. Now this bitch then starts to tell me this bullshit story about how she had left over stain from a project and that she didn’t have a receipt, but she would gladly give me her drivers license and take a store credit. At this point I tell her I need to call a manager to get an override for a return of that amount, but when I try to call their phone they wouldn’t answer. I called one of the head cashiers next (the head cashiers were basically glorified cashiers who told people to go to their lunches and breaks) and told him I have to get an override for a return over $100. He simply replied, “Ok I’ll be right there” and hung up. Now this ghetto bitch starts to get all flustered and tells me I need to hurry up. I scan all of the stain in her cart and the total came out to be $636.48, but in order for me to put in on a merchandise card I had to get that override from my head cashier. He came around the corner looking rushed and held out his card for me to scan, I tried to signal to him that this lady was suspicious-as-fuck, but surprisingly he didn’t catch my subtle gestures (I opened my eyes wide and raised my eyebrows). I was too worried about insulting this bitch so I didn’t say anything. I got the override and gave her the merchandise card and she quickly left.

**MY REVENGE**
As soon as she got out of the doors, I called the paint department and asked them to check how many cans of that stain they had on hand. Sure enough they had less than what our inventory now said. I double-checked and asked the associates back there if they had seen anyone take any of the stain off the shelf earlier that day. They confirmed my suspicions. That bitch had taken them off of the shelves and returned them. I was pretty upset; I was thinking I was going to get written up for the first time for making such stupid mistake. Feeling defeated, I went back to cleaning up my area as I wait for a manager to come by so I can tell them of what just happened. Then, by some random happenstance, I looked down next to my register by the phone and see a lone merchandise card. The cards are usually in a pile on top of my register so I pick this one up and look at the back to see if it had been used. Sure enough the security code had been peeled off, which meant it had been activated. My heart started racing, I grabbed the card and went to check the system to see if that was the card I put the return on. I swiped the card and up on the screen pops, “Remaining Balance: $636.48”. Somehow I had grabbed an empty merchandise card on accident and gave that to the ghetto bitch. I gleefully go to the purchase screen and ring up the same items and used the card and re-bought the stain so our store sustained no loss. My day went on and I had no other problems, until the same ghetto bitch comes storming up to my register again. This time she looked livid as hell and started yelling at me with vengeance. Apparently she had tried to buy some top line power drills with her card, but somehow there was nothing on it. I was thrilled I had the chance to get a redo with this bitch, and so I made sure I wasn’t going to screw this one up. I look at her dead in the eyes and make up the best bullshit story I could think of at the time. “Ma’am, after you had left we checked the security cameras and it seemed that you had taken those items off of the shelf and never paid for them in the first place. We were able to call the credit center and take back the money that you stole. We have all of your driver’s license info and you won’t be able to do any more returns with any of our stores without the Loss Prevention being notified.” At this point she screamed at me “YOU DID WHAT?!” then she turned around and stormed out of the store huffing loudly to herself. 

**FURTHER JUSTICE**
I told my manager about it and he couldn’t help but laugh and commended me on not fucking up any further. He called our sister stores around the area and told them about a potential shoplifter that may come in (they always do that when there’s someone trying to steal a lot of merchandise). And the next day when I arrived at work, I was informed that the same lady tried to push out a cart with several hundred dollars worth of stuff from one of our sister stores, and was promptly arrested because they knew she was going to try something like that. I hate shoplifters and I’m glad she got what she deserved.

ShaneL79,80,,179,1cxasb,,1107,"I worked at a large restaurant where it was policy to help other servers clear their tables and get refills on drinks when you could. Not only was it policy, but it was a nice thing to do to help your co-workers. 

I had this lazy bitch of a woman working with me one evening. She was the only person who didn't help other servers at all. In fact I think she put more effort into not helping then the actual act of helping would have taken. 

There was another policy at this restaurant where you can't leave until the closing server checks your section and your side duties to make sure they are all done. Now this lazy bitch, Jen, was best friends with the usual closing server, Amy. Jen usually got to leave early without cleaning her section leaving the mess for other servers to clean up before Amy would allow them to leave.

One day I was called in to close the restaurant. It was Amy's birthday and they needed someone to cover her shift that she booked off. I jumped at the opportunity, mainly because it meant more money, but also because I knew Jen was working.

That evening I cut all servers except Jen. I made sure that each of their sections were left messy and their side duties were not done. They were fine with leaving a mess for Jen because she had done it to them so many times. 

When Jen's last table left she came and asked me to sign her out. I checked and every section was still an absolute mess, including hers, and none of her side-duties were done. I told her that needed to change before she could leave, and she whined about needing to leave soon so she could make it to Amy's party. I shrugged in the same non-caring way she had so many times and told her that she better hurry up then. 

She rushed and did a half-ass job of everything. I checked it with a fine tooth comb and made her re-do it. Again, she did a half-ass job so I made her re-do it. Then a third time it still was pretty bad, so I explained that she is just wasting her time by doing it half-ass. Finally after the fourth time she was done. I let her leave, but it took her three hours to do that and she missed the better part of the party.

The next day I showed up to my normal non-close shift and noticed I was listed as the closer. The manager said the place was so much cleaner than when Amy does it so they were going to bump me up to the closing server position and try it out for awhile.

That night I did the same thing where I allowed servers to leave without doing their cleaning so that Amy would be stuck with it. She bitched, but I played stupid to whole ordeal and made her stay very late doing a thorough cleaning. I did this day after day to both Jen and Amy - whoever was scheduled to be there later.

VigilantInfidel,117,,276,14lue6,,1108,"Not a long one, but sufficiently petty: I was attempting to back out of a parking spot at an ice cream parlor in a very affluent part of town. I happened to have a spot right in front of the shop and, while there were no other free spaces open anywhere up and down right in front of the shops, the back rows of the parking lot were essentially empty.

Like any good freedom-loving American, I checked to make sure there were no oncoming cars and then I proceeded to back out. From out of thin air, this black low-riding sports car (probably driven by a communist) appears and nearly hits me while I'm 1/3 backed out into the street. I stop hard and pull forward again while the sports car doesn't even decelerate in the slightest.

She only begins to acknowledge my existence when she realizes that ""oh right, I'm here for a parking spot and that guy was about to surrender a prime one."" Well, she's already past me at this point and I've once again begun to reverse out into the street. Well, *guess who decides to almost hit me a second time?* (The answer is Mrs. Stalin.)

Once again, I'm 1/3 out into the road when she reverses back and I have to stop abruptly. And once again I pull forward and she passes me completely. But then she stops. And waits... Now despite being home schooled, I realize what social injustice is happening here and I decide that she doesn't deserve my glorious real estate (even though parking lots are pretty much the ultimate form of socialism, am I right?).

So I hold my foot on the brake and she waits. I wait some more and she waits, too. I look back at her and she puts her turn signal on. I put my car in park and just sit there for a while, pondering life, the universe, and pretty much everything, but mainly I'm just staring at her through my window. She starts to make violent waving hand motions at me from behind the wheel. I suddenly realize I haven't checked Facebook in *minutes* and so I proceed to do so. That was about the time Lady Lenin started to honk at me. And not just honk, but lay on the horn obnoxiously.

Of course at this point no one else in the shopping center has any clue what's happening. They all look to see this Karlita Marx just honking for no particular reason in the middle of the road. And by this point, there's a line of cars piled up behind Fergie Castro (okay, now I'm reaching..) and they all start honking at her. Embarrassed and defeated, Girl Hitler gives up and goes *literally around the corner* to the row behind us and parks, which prompts me to back up and give my spot to the lovely Hispanic family in the suv who were waiting patiently next in line.

theirishembassy,67,,291,1pv4qo,,1099,"So, I recently discovered this subreddit and I used to work in a call centre for 4 years (we serviced every major bank in Canada and 100+ credit unions).  I'm thinking about doing up a few of these, but i'll start off with one of my favourites. It's a bit of a long read, but it pays off.


A few years ago we did a two week pilot project for TD Canada Trust called ""the iPod campaign"". You switch 2 monthly payments (a mortgage payment, insurance, gym membership, etc) over to be debited from a newly opened TD account and the bank will give you a free iPod shuffle. For the campaign, I was part of a team of a dozen agents that dealt with these switches, and the only one on staff to handle complaints. We couldn't process any of these switches without an ""authorization form"" that the client signed when they opened their account. This stated they gave us permission to switch debits over on their behalf. Last day of the campaign, I get a few auth forms on my desk, they're blank, no customer signatures, no customer contact numbers, just the account numbers, and the teller/clients names. I call the branch rep twice (our policy), over two days with my last call stating ""unfortunately if we don't receive the forms with the customer signatures by 8PM local time, we will be unable to process the request and the documents will be destroyed for security purposes"". 


Fast forward a week; the branch rep calls me back. ""Hi my name is Jon with TD Canada Trust EasySwitch, how may I assist you today?"" ""Hello, is this the scam artist that can explain when my none of my client's are getting their iPods?"". Bad opening, but I've had worse. I begin to explain that this particular form she was calling about was blank, the campaign was done, no iPod for the client. ""Did you hear that?"" she says. ""We certainly did and frankly that's a crock of shit"", responded the clients. She had two of them in a conference call. Wrong move bitch, wrong move. 



&gt;*ME*: ""Mr. and Ms. _______, my apologies for any inconvenience. As I'd explained to your branch rep in a voicemail last last week, she had sent us a blank authorization form. Without your signature's we didn't have the legal authority to contact any of your billers to process the switch. Had she provided us with your contact information, we could've informed you to go into the branch to sign the form, instead I'd left her two calls over a 48 hour period advising her of this. We could've even processed it the day after the campaign ended. By any chance, did she happen to notify you of any of this?""



&gt;*HUSBAND*: ""She told us we could open the account over the phone and sign whenever we got the chance!""



&gt;*ME*: ""I apologize, you were misinformed. Without the signatures we didn't have the legal authority to make these changes on your behalf. This is a feature in our service to prevent privacy (our term for identity) theft. As the switches haven't been made, you don't have any outgoing payments. I see that your old account with CIBC is still open, so between me and you, this promotion is set for national distribution in the summer..""



&gt;*HUSBAND*: ""So we can close down the account, reopen it in the summer, and apply for the iPod then?"" 



&gt;*ME*: ""I'm not allowed to advise you to close an account down, but technically you could. You may get a question or two from the branch manager about why you're closing down the account a week after opening it..""



&gt;*WIFE*: ""Don't worry, we'll tell them..""



The branch rep interjected with ""uhmm's"" and ""uhhh's"" but it's pretty hard to shoot yourself in the foot when your foots already in your mouth. She lied to countless people thinking she could get a bunch of new clients, and have somebody else (IE: ME) deal with the mess. The next ingoing call I get is from the branch manager, offering to explain the situation to the clients on my behalf. Why? Because the branch rep is no longer employed. That evening I went home, my girlfriend asked me how my day went and I responded with ""I got a bitch fired!"". ",Stories from a call centre: I got a bitch fired.,1390,pettyrevenge
plonce,152,,261,1p0n3m,,1098,"##TL;DR:##  Trained for an Olympic event at an unreasonable client's home causing great chagrin and achieving desired outcome.

This was back when I was 13 and used to deliver newspapers in an apartment complex.

My job was to distribute them by pitching them at the doorstep of each apartment.  I pitched them at such a pace that they tap the door loud enough that an awake resident would hear it, but quiet enough that a sleeping one wouldn't be awoken.  I performed this duty at 5:45 in the morning every day for 4 years without missing a day or being late.

I also took a lot of bullshit from the customers.

One Friday while collecting dues, an already-problem-customer decided to add another thing to her existing shopping-list of random complaints about my service.

This time it was that I was not delivering the papers loudly enough.

Crazy lady: ""The paper has been late *every day* this week!""

Me: ""No ma'am, I can assure you it has never been late this week.""

""You never threw them against my door!  I sit with my coffee waiting to hear the paper land and I never heard them.""

(This is the crazy-lady nonsense part of the story.  After 4 years of the same route, you know exactly what to do, and the subtle nuances of every customer.  You know who's awake at 5.  You know who sleeps till 7.  You know who's unemployed and is home 100% of the time.  You know who needs the paper thrown louder, you know the ones that don't want it thrown at all.  Hell, you even know the ones that want the paper separated into sections and slid under the door.)

""Ma'am, I have always placed them at your door so that it makes a sound.  I do it the same way for you every day.  Perhaps you just didn't hear the noises.  Perhaps you were in another room at the time.""

She was starting to sound more terse - clearly this woman is trying for a fight. ""Ooooooooooh no.  *I sit here every day with my coffee at 5:30* waiting for you to come.  And *you never made the noise.*""

""Ma'am, I did make the noise.  I do it for you the same way every day. And besides, if you don't hear the noise, you can just check to see if it's there.  It will be there before 6 am guaranteed.""

""**But I need to hear it loudly!  That's your job!  I pay for my papers, you are supposed to deliver them so I can hear them!!!**""

(Ok, at this point I have exhausted all reasonable suggestions and have concluded that this tale is clearly more bullshit from a nut-job that just wants to hassle me.  At this point, I figured I had walked her down the path of reason far enough, and I was ready to let her step in the shit.)

""Are you sure?  I can make it extra loud so you'll be sure hear it.""

""Yes.  make it loud so I can hear it.""

I knew what I was going to do.  I thought to myself ""thank goodness tomorrow is Saturday"".  I collected her dues, thanked her and smiled.

I arrived extra early the next morning to deliver the Saturday papers.  4 times the thickness and 4 times the weight of a daily.

I delivered every paper in the complex before hers and saved it for last.  I imagined her sitting there in her nightie at her kitchen table, ass cheeks clenched, her bony knuckles grasping the 5:30 am cup of coffee waiting for the paper to come and make the noise.

Well, it was about to make a noise.

I dropped the final paper, hers, into the bottom of the contractor's trash bag that I had taken from my father's garage.

I had formed what was effectively [an Olympic hammer toss](http://www.freewebs.com/talenter/46816_full-lnd.jpg) device and began to build up momentum.

I dragged the bag behind me as I took 1, 2, 3 steps and twisted my body and arms violently and launched, with as much follow-through as I could muster, the newspaper hammer toss at the base of her door.

###BOOOOOOOM###

I though the door was going to blow off it's hinges.

The shock wave echoed down the painted cinder-block corridors, rattling the light sconces.  The force of the blast caused her heavy door knocker to fly up and come pounding down against the strike plate over and over due to the reverberations.

The echo went on and on for at least 10 seconds.  Maybe more, but I wasn't sticking around to find out.

I took the paper out of the contractor bag, dropped it at the base of her door and headed for the hills.

She switched to automatic billing the next week so I would never collect dues from her in person again.  I knew exactly why.","I'm not delivering your newspapers loud enough? Fair enough, I can fix that.",1359,pettyrevenge

I couldnt figure out why animals were clawing at my window.  But it became nightly almost immediately after that post.
Well, my crawlspace was locked by maintenance because homeless people were having sex in it.  After they locked it up, my roommates and I havent touched the room.  Though, apparently maintenance gave the other duplex a key as well (even though it isnt their crawlspace).

What does the duplex do?

Stop paying for trash and put their garbage under my bedroom.

Today, I found the MOUNTAIN of garbage bags under my room after seeing the crawlspace door open and a fresh bag sitting inside.  

I waited until I knew they were done putting their garbage in my storage area.  

Then, I approached them and said, ""hey guys, WHAT THE FUCK?  I have complained about the animals fucking with me at night, and you never said ANYTHING about putting your garbage UNDER MY ROOM.""  


The girl i was talking to goes, ""yeah...it smells really bad too...and there are a lot of bugs..."" 

well, YEAH--NOW GET IT THE FUCK OUT!

She tells me, ""we dont have garbage cans so we have been missing garbage day and didnt want to put it on our porch because it all smells so bad.""

I said, ""TAKE ALL OF MINE I DONT CARE WE DONT USE THEM BECAUSE WE TAKE OUR TRASH TO THE DUMP! This is NOT okay, ___.  I have animals messing with my windows, this also explains our MASSIVE bug problem and LIKELY MICE.""

What does this fucking idiot do?  PUT THE CANS IN THE CRAWLSPACE AND LEAN MORE GARBAGE AGAINST THEM.

Wow, that is impressive.  

Then, after calling my landlord and chatting with him, I removed all of their garbage, bag by bag, there was at least a months worth in there.  

I sat each bag down on their porch, right outside of their door.  Some bags had GIGANTIC chew-holes from all of the animals feasting EVERY NIGHT UNDER MY BEDROOM.  The bags that didnt?  Well...

I made big holes at the bottom, the length of the bags, so when you set it down, they wont see that they have holes.  Then, when they pick them up, their fucking garbage goes everywhere.

Then, I set the empty cans right next to all of the bags.

FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE NEIGHBORS.

[But here are the pictures I took upon arriving home](http://imgur.com/a/TuJD0).  There are pictures from inside and out of the crawlspace that show garbage still left behind that I did not want to even touch.  There is also a picture to give context and proof that the crawlspace is, indeed, right underneath my bedroom.  

I was texting with my landlord this afternoon, apparently he went over and talked to them, which I think is why the garbage has been pushed into a corner of their porch.  They still obviously have bags stacked, but I assure you, the ones in the trash can were probably a mess to get back together.  He took away their key to the crawlspace and is apparently going to be *talking to their parents* because they're all young and needed cosigners to the house.  He is also buying poison and setting it out tonight for the rats that are in the area, and it's being sprayed for bugs sometime this week.

Mom- Call Mandy.

Me- I thought I was grounded...

Mom- Call Mandy.

My best friend Mandy and I went to different high schools, so she would get home before me which is why I missed her call. I called her and she was crying. She told me her parents were getting divorced. She had been talking about how for the last few weeks the piano tuner from their church had been coming by a lot lately to ""tune their piano"", but Mandy had caught his hand on her mom's leg once while they were talking at the table. Mandy's dad found out she had been cheating and asked for a divorce. 

Luckily it was a Friday, so I asked my mom if I could sleep over there. Her mother was moving out the next morning and Piano Tuner was going to be helping her. Mandy wanted to stay at her house while they moved out because her dad would be out on business, and she wanted to be sure her mom and Piano Tuner didn't take anything that wasn't their's. I figured she needed all the help and support she could get. 

Whenever we had sleepovers we would bake a cake, cookies, cupcakes, or whatever we had on hand. We woke up early and decided to make cinnamon streusel [muffins](http://d3w5aos35qel1w.cloudfront.net/img/cinnamon-streusel-muffins-main.jpg) for breakfast. 

We were mixing our second batch when one of Mandy's dogs leaped up and snagged two muffins. We didn't want him getting sick, and he knew how to get in the trash if he wanted to so we put the two muffins on a separate plate so we would know which ones had been slobbered on.

This entire time Piano Tuner and Mandy's mom were walking through the house to bring her stuff to the car. We went back to distracting ourselves from them. Then, both of us saw in our peripheral vision Piano Tuner snagging a muffin and walking away triumphantly. After he left the house, we checked and it was a slobbery muffin that he took. We were in a fit of giggles. We poured the rest of the batch into the muffin tin and we tried not to laugh as he took another on his way back in. We checked again and he took the other slobbery muffin. At that point, we couldn't stop laughing. 

As he was leaving, he had the audacity to ask us why we were laughing. We said it was nothing and put more muffins in the oven.

RauwolfiaSerpentina,115,,409,1iw9vk,,1090,"This story happened a couple decades ago, but it still gives me the warm and fuzzies when I think about it.

When I was growing up, I got sick a lot. Constant headaches, several episodes a year of vomiting for days, got a cold every time it was going around, etc. After a few years of this, I grew to learn and recognize the feelings that preceded getting sick, or how to tell if a certain taste/smell/sensation would make me feel better or worse.

When I was in elementary school, I was home feeling sick. My mom was irritated, she didn't want to deal with me moping around and whining pathetically. I was feeling nauseous and *really* didn't want to throw up. She kept telling me to take some Pepto Bismol since it would make me feel better. Being someone who had taken a lot of it in the past, I could vividly imagine the taste and texture of both the liquid and the chewables and I *knew* it would make me puke. She kept insisting, I kept refusing. Eventually, she decided to force her hand. I don't think she poured any down my throat, but I think she yelled and intimidated my small self into taking some and loomed over me to make sure I finished all of it.

Now, something I haven't mentioned is that just a few days earlier she had paid to have all of our white carpets in the house professionally cleaned. This was a fairly big undertaking, and took some time and money.

Almost right away after being forced to ingest Pepto Bismol, I knew. *Vomiting was going to happen.* I ran. I honestly tried to make it to the bathroom, or at least to a trash can along the way. Instead, I only made it as far as the hallway right outside of my mom's bedroom door. Hot pink vomit poured out of me, all over the freshly cleaned white carpet. Hot pink vomit, right outside her bedroom. 

You know that feeling, right after you throw up, where for a brief moment all you feel is that fantastic sensation of absolute relief? I experienced that times ten, for it was layered on top of the sweet feeling of vindication, of knowing that I was *right.* I *told* her it would make me throw up, but did she listen?

So I was working one of those big bike stores. You know, with tons of bike stuff, and a full service counter? I was an assembler and a jr mechanic at times (I was never good as the two older guys who worked there). Well, it was nearing the end of the day and the two older guys had left a bit early because they had finished all the big projects that day. I was left with some easy stuff (wheel changes, trip computer installation, and a few final builds to have out on the floor.

A guy comes in (Forshadowing!) and asks how much it would be to put on a seat and a handlebar on his bike. We, of course had our prices on a giant board, but most people don't look anyways, so I told him it would be around $20. He didn't seem very happy, but said that was ok. He says he will go get the bike out of his car.

What he brought in was a bike in a box. As in completely unassembled.

Me ""sir, this bike is in a box...""

Old Cranky Bastard (OCB) "" and?""

Me 'Sir, this is more than putting a seat and handlebars on a bike...""

OCB "" well, the wheels, but I was expecting you to do that for free"" (just the wheels would be a $5 service charge in itself...)

Me ""Well, sir, as you can see on our price board, a full assembly is $120...""

OCB ""WHAT?! That is NOT the price you quoted me!"" (What is this, an insurance company?!)

Me ""Sir, you told be it was just a seat and a handlebar. For a full assembly, we have to connect everything, make sure it all is in working order, and perform our safety check""

OCB ""I don't want any of that shit. Just put it fucking together.""

Me ""I am sorry, but I will have to charge you $120 for that. I can't bend the rules with the saftey checks""

OCB ""WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!""

Me ""he is at the front desk""

Now, this manager was a nice guy, not really a pushover or anything, but would tend to side with the customers on most things. He was pretty good at finding a compromise, however.

A few miniuets later, the manager walks back and says ""why are you trying to charge 120 for a seat and handlebars?"" It's important to note that he sounded more confused as to why I was doing this than angry. I just pointed to the bike. In an old Peugeot box. Manager walks right back to the customer (who had stayed in the front). I don't go up there because I don't want to deal with this guy.

After a few minuets of yelling and grumbling, manager and the guy comes back. Manager says to assemble Thea bike, and we will give him a $20 discount to make the price 100. Now, I am not really happy that we had to cater to this guy, but I don't sign the checks. Doesn't really matter too much to me how much we make off of him. He still looks pissed however.

So, I get to work on this ancient Peugeot bike. I am super happy the screws and everything were in a little bag, because they were all older types we don't really carry (This is important). Anyways, after working on this bike for around 40 minuets, the guy storms back in and asks if we are finished yet.

Of course we aren't!

He then starts screaming at us to take it all apart, he found a different store that would do it all for 15 dollars. Then comes screaming, allegations of ripping him off, telling us that we are just wage monkeys (he actually said that haha).

My manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out. So he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box.

Which is exactly what I did. I took this thing apart in the most heinous way possible, shoving everything into the box. They guy had gone back out to his car to wait on us to take it apart. I was pissed at this dude for wasting my time. Manager was pissed for the lost time and money. Other employee was pissed because they guy was an assjack.

So, every fifth screw I took off disappeared into the garbage. Whoops. Looks like he will have to pay extra for specialty screws. I started to feel a little bad about it. Until I took the box out to his car. He told me I wouldn't amount to much and I just just serve burgers or something. He. Actually. Told. Me. That.

The icing on the cake was a phone call we got e next day from said other store. Apparently, he was saying that we would do it for less than them and they were flabbergasted.

Guess what he had told them?

That he had just wanted a seat and handlebars put on.

specieshumanoid,201,,245,1pxvyh,,1086,"I live in a 4 plex apartment building, and my neighbor right above me kept flicking his cigarette butts down onto my front step. Now he's a chain smoker, so it adds up really quickly. I kept just ignoring him and kept sweeping them off, just going about my business since I don't really like confrontation. But other friends and family started to notice and comment about it. Which made it embarrassing for me and my wife.

I finally built up the nerve and mentioned it to him  and asked if he'd mind not flicking them down. He apologized and it stopped for about a week, but it started again slowly and then it was all back. Well I spoke to him again, nothing. I spoke to my landlord, nothing. Finally I had enough.

I got a grocery bag and painstakingly picked up every, single, stinking, rotting, disgusting cigarette butt and put them in the bag. There were hundreds of them everywhere, in my planters, on the walkway, and all around my car. I went out back where his personal entry door was and dumped them ALL on his step. It felt soooo good.

And surprisingly I never found another one on my step after that.

tryingtoworkoutmylif,156,,285,1pwglb,,1075,"So about a year ago they subdivided one of my neighbors property's, and problems ensued.

So where I live there were three (now four) houses sharing the same driveway, with a fence on both sides so there is nowhere else to go. Now the guy who was building the house came over to my place on day one and explained that here's my number to call, and I will be here the whole time except for my two week vacation in a month.

Well, to build a house it requires a lot of truckloads of cement and various things. Generally the days that they did this they would go to all of the neighbors houses early in the morning to give them some time  to move their car out onto the street so they weren't blocked in. 

A month later, while the guy who I have the contact details for is on vacation, I drive down the driveway, turn the corner (it's an L shape) and find a fracking massive gravel truck there, just pulled up. Now, there's space for the truck to move off the driveway, but he looked new and probably didn't understand the situation. So I get out of my car as he gets out of his cab, walk up to him and politely ask him if he can move the truck off the driveway so we can get access. He just looks at me and goes ""Fuck off kid, real men doing work here. I ain't movin."" I say it again being serious this time and say that I have somewhere to be and that they aren't following the access policy (which all the houses signed). I get told to fuck off yet again, and then the guy starts to try to threaten me. So, I walk away and think, how will I get to meet up with my friends?... (for movie marathon, awesome btw.)

So a few texts later, my friends pull into my driveway as instructed by me, and park directly behind his truck, blocking him in. He had no way out. My friends jump out, lock their cars, and walk towards my place. 

Guy comes out shouting ""You can't park there this is an active construction site! This is illegal, I will call the cops"". I walk up to him, say that since this is now a parking lot according to you, I will park here as I have the right to use it. And to top it off I inform him that what he is doing is illegal, and I'm not as I own the land that we're standing on.

One and a half hours later, when we need to go get more supplies, we find him in his cab fuming to the site manager on holiday and being told that he's in the wrong. 

We go somewhere in our cars, come back and of course he's gone.
When the site manager gets back he comes with the truck driver and they both apologize to me. Even gave me a half dozen beers as a apology gift. Best. Feeling. Ever.

laboheme1984,69,,237,1gfet9,,1078,"For the past 7 years I have worked for the same company. Without getting overly specific, I market our material to agencies, manage our media, do some HTML5 coding and do graphic design work. We are a small company and I am the resident tech person, so I am a jack of all trades. Over the years I have grown to dislike the people that I work with immensely. They have: 

Stolen my food (I am gluten intolerant so I make the effort to make my own food...and people go through my lunch and eat it anyway), stolen my tupperwear, they are completely inconsiderate with my time, they are condescending and I am routinely taken for granted. I have gotten verbally assaulted more times than I can count and I am severely underpaid. I can't even use them as a reference for future jobs because I simply can't trust them - the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference (and my boss agreed to give him a good recommendation), and I heard my boss trashing my predecesor to a potential employer over the phone. Super classy.

I am quitting this terrible job to go back to school. When they hired my replacement, they got someone as cheaply as they could, and the person they chose didn't have any background in any kind of graphic design/media/web. They think so little of my job that they didn't think my replacement needed any experience whatsoever.

Anyway, training this new guy has been an absolute trainwreck. In 5 days he's nearly destroyed our website and he sent defective media to a sales rep and made a fool of her in a large meeting. At this point I assumed that I'd train my replacement and say goodbye to this company for good with minimal drama - they selected someone without a proper background, they can deal with it. 

Last week had been busy since we have clients in, and I brought my personal computer in to help with the load, since my replacement has been on my company computer to 'learn the ropes'. I have brought my personal computer in before when we have been in a squeeze, and I have been compensated ($10 a day, nothing crazy). I brought up compensation this time around, and my boss gets in my face, and says, ""I didn't realize your computer came with a fee. I thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement.""

I had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement, since we had been working in entirely different offices. My boss had even requested that I set up multiple webpages on my personal computer during this time. He was playing dumb and lying to my face.

I didn't say anything because I knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldn't be constructive. However, I did think, ""You have made a HUGE mistake."" 

I didn't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement. I was working in the respect that I was going over things that my replacement didn't understand (which was a lot, lol), but I wasn't able to work independently since my replacement and myself were sharing one machine.
At one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me wasn't done, and I said, ""Well, since I am sharing a computer with my replacement, and he's been really busy with the clients, I haven't had a chance to get to it."" My boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake - and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake, it was too late. 

Since I wasn't there to shoulder the workload, the under-experienced replacement floundered, the entire company looked incompetent and we lost future jobs with the clients (there were two clients, which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost) that we had in our office. I watched the world burn. This past week was my last week, and this was a sweet way to go out. 

TLDR: I bring in my personal computer to help make a busy week more manageable, my boss refused to offer the most minimal of compensation, so I don't bring my computer in anymore and watch all hell break loose.

They were your typical ""look at me"" girls, you know caked in a thick layer of fake tan with bright bottle blond hair and wearing skirts the size of a tea bags.

Just as they passed by me one of them pushed her friend into me causing me to stumble. I turned round and told them to be more careful when the leader of the gang said to her friends amusement ""fuck off you fat peado"" I let this go as it's not worth the bother and walked away only to hear them laughing saying ""that's right walk away fat boy"" 

I really wanted to kill the little fuckers but thought it's best to leave it. After meeting my girlfriend a few moments later i told her about these girls and how angry i was. Do you mean those girls over there ? she asked pointing in the group now hanging around the jewelry section. 

Yeah, that's them. Well you should inform security on what they did. Better still tell security that you seen them put things under their clothes. Well bugger me, my girlfriend is a evil genius.

So that's what we did, went up to one of the guards and lied our arses off about these girls putting things like earrings and rings down their bra's. We hung about for a few moments to see the girls be surrounded by security and other staff members and be taken through the stores staff only doors. At this point we made a bee line out of there so not to be asked any questions by staff.

We hung about a short distance from the store to see if the police would show up and not 5 mins later two officers drove into the car park and made their way into the store. I'm not 100% sure if they did get stripped searched or not but i would like to think they did. At least it would have put the end of their fun for the night.

she-hulk,112,,218,1bih1w,,1075,"I've got a lot of these stories for you guys. I'm pretty vindictive, but in true Canadian form I'm also pretty passive aggressive. This usually leads to lots of petty revenge. 

This story though, is by far my best revenge. It's long, but it's a good payoff. 

When I was 17, I moved across the country with my then boyfriend (now husband). I was pretty psyched when I got a job at A&amp;W because it was my first real job and the pay was really good (great compared to my former province, shit compared to the pay scale in this province). I was working day shift and my manager told me it was very important to keep my own record of my hours because the computers didn't work to login. 

After getting my first paycheque and being short 8 hours I realized why it was so important. But the owner assured me the hours would be on my next cheque. 

I had worked there for about 2 months before being promoted to evening manager, with a fairly substantial raise of about $4/ph. I was still owed about 24 hours of pay. Technically my boss always put my missing hours on the next cheque, but then I would be missing even more hours from the current pay period. 

Things started getting really shitty. Some of our kitchen staff quit and instead of replacing them he just moved around the 3 remaining kitchen staff so that we only had one person in the kitchen per shift. We were also really short on staff so I ended up working the counters in the mornings (7-10) alone and then coming in for my regular evening shift (3-11). Apparently my raise was only in name because my last 2 paycheques had my former salary on them, my boss assured me that it would be on the next cheque. 

Then came stampede. For those of you who aren't familiar with the Calgary stampede, it's the biggest event in the city. It's a week long rodeo and festival where thousands of people flood the city, drunk and wearing cowboy hats. Our A&amp;W was right downtown so needless to say it was a very busy week. We still only had one kitchen staff and me working the morning shift, the day manager came in early to help with the counter and we tried all the staff to see if we could get extra bodies but only one staff came in. 

Breakfast was a nightmare. A&amp;W breakfasts are real breakfast made to order, eggs, bacon, French toast, none of it premade and there was no time to premake it anyway because the store was packed pretty much round the clock, so with 1 person full time in back and one floater it was taking 8+ minutes per breakfast and the store was lined to the doors and the drive through lined up right into the street. We called the owner and told him he needed to come in right now because we needed him and his wife to help us. We were drowning in angry customers. 

30 minutes pass and we call him again. ""I'll be there right away"" is his famous line. Another 30 minutes and he's not here, we call his house and get VM so we assume he is on his way. This is great because he doesn't live far so he should be here in 10 minutes at the latest. 

It's now 10am, 2 hours since we first called and no answer on his house phone or his cell. We've had lots of people walk out, we've had people demand refunds and leave but the store is still packed and there is still an hour left on breakfast, but we haven't had a chance to prep lunch, not even cut up the veggies for burgers so we were still fucked come lunch. 

I look at the day manager and said fuck it, I quit. He says ""you know what, fuck this I quit too"". We call the boss again and leave a message on both lines telling him we quit (along with 2 other staff, the only one that doesn't is the 1 kitchen staff) and we will stay for another 30 minutes to give him time to get here but then we are walking out. 

30 minutes pass and no word from the owner. We lock the doors and tell the customers in the store that their breakfast is free since they all have been waiting for so long and we are closing the store once all of them are served, but they have to take their meals to go. 

We serve at lease 50 free breakfasts (at around $10 a piece) once the store is empty we do our cash out, the other manager and I look at the previous schedules to confirm what hours the 2 employees are still owed and gave them the cash out of the cash out, took our hours owed (including my raise) and left a receipt in the cash out with our signatures detailing where the money went, but the cash out in the safe and left. People were still coming in the drive through and trying to get in he door, confused to why the store would be closed in the middle of the day during stampede. 

I didn't get a call until 2 hours later (after the lunch rush) from my former boss claiming we owed him all the money he lost while the store was closed/for the free breakfasts. I told him he was well informed about what was going to happen, we knew he got the message because we had filled his inbox and couldn't leave any messages but when we called to tell him he store was closed the inbox was no longer full. He shouldn't have tried to call our bluff because we weren't bluffing. 

Not only did we make sure that some of the staff actually got paid what they were owe (costing hundreds) but he probably lost out on $15,000 worth of sales or more from the store being closed for 3 hours and missing the lunch rush (which on a normal day brought in about $5G but during stampede could easily bring in $10,000). 

This being Calgary in 2006, I got another job the next day. Working as a secretary at Parks Canada making $17/ph and never having to deal with cheap bosses or angry customers again. ","Great revenge against a cheap, scamming boss.",1293,pettyrevenge
ryanjames01,110,,231,1do4s7,,1068,"I was out one night having a few drinks with some friends when I check my phone to see I had a dozen missed calls from a random number. Thinking nothing of it, I continued my on with my night.  

The next day, I find out from a female friend why I had been getting all these calls. I had told her in the past that if a guy was ever creepy towards her and asked for her number to just give him mine and I'd deal with him.  

She was in a bar with a friend, just enjoying themselves and having a few drinks. This guy comes up to her and starts hitting on her. Immediately comes across as sleazy and arrogant. He's making her and her friend so uncomfortable they decide to leave. They're on the third floor and it's packed, so it takes them a good ten minutes to worm their way through the crowd and down all the stairs. Douchebag follows them the entire way, while the girls try to ignore him.  

They get outside and he starts following them up the road. They're getting a little worried and it's at this point he confirms their suspicions by yelling out ""it's girls like you are the reason girls get raped.""  

So they're pretty fucking scared at this point and don't know what to do so they both stop. They're in a crowded area so they'll be safer there than if they keep walking. He catches up to them, they start chatting and defuse the situation. He asks for one of the girls numbers. Not wanting to give it to him, she gives him mine instead.  

He then CALLS HER PHONE and DEMANDS TO CHECK IT to make sure it's ringing and she didn't give him a fake number. Somehow, she convinces him it was right.  

After hearing this story, and realising he thought my number was my friends, I decided to have a bit of fun with him. Throughout the week I sent him text messages pretending to be my friend. Apologising for being standoffish as I wasn't feeling well that night and yes I would love to see him again. With the help of my female friend who he threatened we led him on majorly throughout the week

For context, he lived two hours away and was only in town for a special ocassion that night.  

I somehow managed to convince this guy to get on a train for two hours, book a hotel in the hopes of getting laid and come meet me in a bar at a 9pm.  

9pm roles around and I'm chilling in a bar down the road with some friends having a few drinks, female friend was there with me, waiting to see what happened.  

He texts me that he's there at 9pm. I let him stew for half an hour, all while receiving texts and calls that I obviously didn't answer. I send him one brief text that I'm running late and that I'll be there soon. It placates him for a while. We manage to keep him there until 11pm, alone in this bar. It's at this point we do the big reveal. I send him a message saying (from memory) ""This isn't (female friend). This is her guy friend. Don't ever threaten to rape my friend or anyone else ever again. If I hear about you doing anything like that again I'll go straight to the police. Consider tonight a lesson.""  

As you can guess, he went APESHIT. Dozens of calls (which went unanswered) and abusive messages. The best ones were when he threatened to have his ""cop buddy"" arrest me for some made up reason.

Several years ago a major hurricane blew through my hometown and the government issued a damage repair to all houses effected by the storm after evaluation through insurance companies (something to that extent).  Construction contractors took advantage of the situation going door to door offering their services.  Contractors get money, everyone gets free repairs, why not?  Whole neighborhoods signed on and work began.

My parents were getting their home repaired and after a time realized the amount they were quoted for was too high so they planned to break the contract and find someone else to do all the repairs AND replace all the shutters and window framing for the same price.  While on the phone with the contractor, he tells them they're willing to to do all the extra work for free so my parents stay with the original contractors.

After many many months the work was done and the guys came to collect, except they didn't replace the shutters and window framing.  My father withholds the money because they admit to lying about the extra work in order to keep the contract, but refuse to do it because they didn't write up the new contract for my dad to sign so they're not obligated to do it yet wanted our money.  This devolved into arguments with them threatening to sue us.

A couple days later after discussing this with the family we have them over for a meeting and agree to pay them extra but discounted amount to do the shutters and framing.  They come back and finish the work.

When the time came for them to receive their pay they visit the house and my mother gives them the check.  They realize that the amount was for the original work without the additional pay as agreed.  They get pissed.

teuker,164,,428,1r5efr,,1066,"Once upon a time I was a graduate student in a liberal arts field. Now the department I was in was, to put it mildly, rife with squabbling petty professors more concerned with marking their territory and playing favorites among the grad students. One professor had it in for me. She didn't much like my theoretical approach that I took in one of her seminars nor did she like my prospective dissertation adviser. Every two years in a graduate student's time there, they undergo a review. At my fourth-year review, as I was told later on by a professor who I was friendly with, she complained about me being a misogynist, a comment that was entirely out of line and that NO ONE backed up at the meeting.

It's a balky system and occasionally has issues with cross-listed courses that end up in requiring me to to go manually fix them for the faculty.

ashinkusher17,150,,323,1glc63,,1057," I've lived in the same house for the last 16 years. It's a two family house and my landlord is an ok guy but can be a dick about things. When we first moved there, we weren't allowed any pets and could not park in the driveway. I understand you don't want animals ruining the house and what not, but his reasoning was his 30 year old son is ""allergic"" to cats and dogs, he lived in the basement we live on the top floor. There is no way he would even be affected by any of the animals, but your house your rules. We also weren't allowed to park in the driveway, a bit of an annoyance because when we first moved in the landlord said it would not be a problem. My mother being a single mom raising two kids didn't have a car at the time so that wasn't much of an issue for us.

 Fast forward a couple of years and we get a car but can't use the driveway. My mother tells him he promised we could and the landlord says he never said that and we can't use it. The rent goes up during the years and my mother speaks with him again and he says ok sure you can use it, as long as it doesn't affect my daily routine. My mother is out of the house by 6am every morning, and he is a retired old man who usually does work around the house and will walk to the grocery store etc. So it never messed up his routine. 

A few months ago he tells us he we can't park in the driveway anymore because his sons need to go in and out and it's an inconvenience to them. They usually block the driveway do what they must and leave. So I didn't understand what the issue was. 

One of his 4 sons lives in Greece and has come to visit for about 3-4 months. My landlord being an old man does not have use for the internet and most likely doesn't know what it is, but his son would like to check his e-mails,skype his family,probably jerk off, in general use his computer. In order to do that you need wi-fi, unfortunately for him I'm the only one who has the wi-fi password ( my mom and sister just ask me whenever they need help with computer stuff, including setting up the wi-fi for their laptops.) The son asks my mother and sister and they both say ""you must speak to ashinkusher17 about that he's the only one who knows it.""

keenedge422,110,,307,1j2nvd,,1049,"**The setup:**  
While in college, I also worked full time for the university IT help desk. As anyone who worked full time through college can tell you, it can make scheduling time to talk to professors a bit tight, so I had to become a pro at sneaking minutes here and there for questions about class(with a lot of walk-and-talks) and sent a lot of emails. Most professors were incredibly understanding. One? Not so much.  
**The offense:**  
After class, I approached the professor as he was packing up his stuff with some questions about a particularly complicated bit of material. 
 
Me: ""Hi, sir, I was wondering if I could ask you a quick question about something we went over last class.""  
Prof: ""I'm sorry, no. I'm very busy.""  
Me: ""Of course, I understand and I wouldn't want to hold you up. I'd be happy to walk with you so I don't keep you from anything. It's just I tried emailing you an--""  
Prof: ""Ugh, I abhor email.""  
Me: ""Right, sure, which is why I thought I'd ju--""  
Prof: ""Look. Let me make it perfectly clear. I have clearly defined office hours when you can come by and ask me any question your heart desires.""  
Me: ""Of course. It's just that I work over at the help desk and my work schedule completely overlaps your office hours so I can't get by to--""  
Prof: ""Yes yes, that sounds like a terrible problem. It's just not *my* problem. I have over 600 students a semester; if I let you encroach on my personal time, then I'll have to do the same for everyone and it'd be chaos. That's why keeping a schedule is so important.""  
Me: sigh ""of course, sir. I'll figure it out.""  
(note: this little lecture on the importance of strict scheduling took longer than answering my question likely would have.)

**The Revenge:**  
A week of so later, in that same class, the professor had barely started into the lecture when the podium he was running his powerpoint from threw a few errors and the display shut off. A flurry of random button presses, colorful language and a mournful ""this is why I hate computers"" later, the prof was unable to get the display to come back up. Irritatedly, his eyes swept the classroom until he found me.

Prof: ""You! You work in IT, right? Do you know what's going on up here?""  
Me: ""Of course, sir.""  
Prof: ""Well then get up here and get this going again.""  
Me: ""I'm sorry, no.""
The entire class spun to look at me and his eyes bulged.  
Prof: ""... NO?!""  
Me: ""That's correct, sir. You see I have very clearly defined work hours at the help desk. If you want to come by during those, I'd be happy to help. It's just that I support 32,000 people each semester and if I provided support for you during my personal time, I'd have to do it for everyone else and it'd be chaos. You understand, right?""  
Prof, clearly mad: ""But if you don't, I can't --""  
Me: ""Yes, sir, and that's a terrible problem. It's just not *my* problem. I'm sure you understand. As you told me just recently, keeping to a schedule is VERY important.""

The classroom was dead silent and the professor stood there, seething with fury and staring me down, and puffed up as if preparing for an epic meltdown... then I saw the flash of recognition of he realized I'd just parroted back his own argument, nearly verbatim, and he just started laughing, tears streaming down his face.  
When he finally composed himself, he just said ""Fine, you win. You..."" he stared narrowly at the rest of the class for emphasis, ""and ONLY you, can ask me questions outside of office hours. No one else. Now will you PLEASE come fix this?""  
Me: ""Of course, sir. I'd be happy to.""

**Epilogue:**

While I was up front, he leaned if real close to speak to me.  
Prof: ""You know I could have kicked you out of my class for that, right? Maybe even gotten you fired.""  
Me: ""Sure. But then I could have just remotely deleted every file on your hard drive, destroying years of work you almost certainly don't keep backed up anywhere else.""  
Prof: ""Wait... you can't do that... can you?""  
Me: ""I hope you never have to find out.""

duppyconquerer,65,,220,19j3nb,,1047,"When I was in my early twenties, I worked at a pretty chaotic and depressing workplace. The industry as a whole and company in particular were sinking fast, and although there were a lot of cool, talented, nice people working there, the upper management were bullies and the environment was just toxic.

In my job, as a low-level assistant, I had to interact a lot with our accountant, who was also the de facto HR guy. Although he kept to himself a lot, in the course of our many emails about vendor payments everyday, we discovered that we shared a taste for dark, absurdist humor. Our daily, existentialist emails about accounting glitches and payrolls and the general sadness of our company became, for me anyway, bright spots in a grey workworld.

Because he was also HR, he knew that I made a minuscule amount of money and was kept just below fulltime so that I couldn't get healthcare. I also didn't get any paid vacation.

Eventually he left for greener pastures and my days were a lot sadder because his replacement had no sense of humor. Then, I got an exciting new job! After a week, the exciting new job went down in flames and I had to contemplate going back to the sad place (they really wanted me back).

Then my last paycheck from them arrived. A month's wages for one week of work. When I looked at the breakdown, I got paid out for several weeks of vacation days--days that I absolutely did not have. Before leaving, my HR friend had booby-trapped my account to essentially give me a severance package when I left. The company was such a chaotic mess that no one ever noticed or cared.

It was enough money to live on while I looked for a better gig, and because of him I didn't have to go back to the bad place.

In my group of friends, the DM is responsible for the game itself and picking dinner. I fucking love lasagna and I cook it like I'm some variety of boss so one game weekend I cooked up a big ass lasagna. Of course everyone pitched in with money or a side, that's how the world works.

The house we play at is owned by the brother of a friend (BOAF) and he has a wife who I will abbreviate as DC. Figure for yourself what DC is, it's a choose your own adventure game with insults.

The lasagna had just come out of the over, it was cooling and it smelled and looked beautiful, the garlic bread is going in the oven and there chips and dip out, everyone has their beer and their smoke except me. I'm responsible for an entire fantasy world, I like to keep my wits about me. It also helps me catch them doing stupid shit so I can cleverly penalize them or reward them if they commit a failing-win but I digress.

We're out on the patio and DC is sitting just inside the back door on the couch. I was talking shop with the guys and somehow we were talking about how one of the hydraulic lift tables we use to transport caskets has a shitty wheel that gets jammed and makes subtle maneuvers difficult.

DC: Why don't you just fix it instead of crying about it?

I can ignore her, which she fucking hates, I can say I dunno how and appear incompetent which isn't really true anyways, or I can say the first thing that comes to my head, which she ended up fucking hating.

Me: Do you know how to repair every piece of equipment you use on the job?

DC: If you're gonna take that attitude with me then you can just leave.

I've heard stories. This wasn't a warning, this was her telling me to leave. Now. I already know the score but I'm the DM, the game doesn't happen without me and I brought the lasagna dish so if I go, it goes and these guys get stuck with garlic bread and chips and no game.

Me: Look, DC, sorry I snapped, that was rude of...

DC: I SAID GET OUT!

Chocks have been pulled, I am clear for take-off.

Me: Fine, but if I leave all these people here have no game, I can hold this game elsewhere and it's not like I don't have anywhere else to go, but if I leave you'd be ruining the night for everyone.

DC: Not my problem, BOAF, can I speak to you upstairs?

So I go collect my shit, my campaign module, my books, my dice, and I walk them out to my car. I come back in the house as she's walking back down stairs.

DC: I thought I told you...

I cut her off, she hates that too. Her alpha shit holds no power over me.

Me:Yeah yeah, I'm getting the rest of my shit.

DC: Well hurry up, I wanna eat and I'm not doing it with *YOU* here.

I laugh. I roar laughing. I had to stop moving because I was laughing so hard.

You see, she didn't know. She knew what was for dinner, but she had no idea whose dish it was, Who prepared it, anything. She had come downstairs after it was in the oven.

I grab the lasagna and she asks what I thought I was doing. With a big grin on my face I say...

""It's my dish, I prepared it, (name of other friend and his father) are going back to his place to eat it""

DC: ""Well cut me out a piece before you go.""

Beepolai,47,,245,170ig1,,1037,"I took my two-year-old daughter to an indoor inflatable park today (padded floors, lots of those giant inflatable bounce-houses and slides, lots of fun to be had).  There are two areas, one specifically for ages 3 and under, and the other for all ages.  We were pretty overwhelmed by the number of kids at the all-ages side, so we went to the toddler area for some slightly calmer bouncy fun.  

There are only two small bounce houses in the toddler area, and when we walked in there were three young women (late teens/early twenties) laying in one of them, taking up nearly half of the bouncing area, staring at their phones and generally being in the way.  Being mostly non-confrontational, I stayed my tongue as my daughter bounced around, oblivious to the douchery as she played in the unoccupied half of the inflatable.  

Then the most glorious thing happened... in order to make use of the entire area that was available, she decided to just bounce on these inconsiderate bitches.  She was happily jumping all around them, on top of them, grabbing their faces for support, all those things that toddlers like to do.  She let them know that they were in HER bouncing zone, and if they didn't like it, fuck it, she was bouncing anyway.

penguin_2,97,,272,1a8ryh,,1039,"I got married a couple of years ago, and we booked a 5 night stay at a great resort in Jamaica for our honeymoon. We flew out of St. Louis the day after the wedding, change planes in Atlanta, and then on to Jamaica. Or at least, that was what was supposed to happen.

**The Beginning**

For some reason, Delta Airlines was entirely unable to figure out how to get an airplane from St. Louis to Atlanta. There were three or four flights that afternoon and every single one of them was delayed, all for mechanical reasons. By the time we got to Atlanta, the last flight to Jamaica for the day had already left, so we had to spend the first night of our honeymoon in a Best Western instead of the all inclusive resort I had shelled out for.

**The Complaint**

Since we're on our honeymoon, we decide that we'd like to sit down and have an actual meal in the airport instead of just grabbing a sandwich, so we went to the only actual sit-down restaurant in the unsecured area of the airport (it was one of those TGI Friday's/Applebee's knock offs). We get a table, and then I actually take a good look at the meal vouchers the airline gave us. Two vouchers, each worth $6, for a total of $12 for the two of us. The cheapest thing on the menu at the restaurant was $10.

So I was mad. Instead of being on a tropical beach with my new bride, I was stuck in the airport in Atlanta, and the airline wouldn't even buy us a decent meal. So I went back to the ticket counter to complain. I wasn't rude, I wasn't obnoxious, but I was forceful. I told the attendant that the vouchers weren't even worth enough to buy a plate of nachos, and asked him what they could do about it. The attendant looked sympathetic, and told me he would go talk to his supervisor to see what he could do.

**Victory 1**

So I waited. He was gone for almost 15 minutes. I was starting to think that he had either forgotten about me or was avoiding dealing with me, when he came back with something in his hand. First, he gave me two travel vouchers worth $100 each for future Delta flights. Then, he handed me a whole *stack* of meal vouchers, 25 of them, each worth $6. I thanked the man profusely for his help and returned to the restaurant feeling victorious.

**Victory 2**

Meanwhile, my wife had been chatting with the waiter in the restaurant and told him about the delay in our travels and how disappointed she was (she had never left the US before, so flying to Jamaica was a pretty big deal even without the honeymoon). I returned, we ordered and ate, and then gave the vouchers to the waiter to settle the check. When he returned he told us that in addition to the food, he had gone ahead and put our drinks on the vouchers as well, which he wasn't really supposed to do. So the entire meal plus drinks was free. I gave him a *really* good tip (cash, of course, not vouchers).

**The Revenge**

So at some point I started reading the vouchers carefully. I'm not a lawyer but I am pretty good at understanding legalese, and I made two discoveries. First, the vouchers expired in three days, so if we didn't use them before we took off in the morning, we wouldn't be able to use them at all. Second, nowhere on the vouchers did it say ""non-transferable"".

When we got to the airport in the morning, we got ourselves some coffee and muffins. After we ate, we still had 10 or 12 of the vouchers left. So I started handing them out. I'd go up to people, ask them if they'd had anything to eat yet today, and if they said no, I handed them a voucher and told them to, ""Go buy breakfast, Delta's paying."" If they had kids, I gave them 2. I kept at it until I was out of vouchers.

**Post Script**

On the way back to the US from Jamaica, I attempted to use the travel vouchers to upgrade us to First Class. The woman at the counter had to call the airline office in order to redeem the vouchers, but she was unable to get through to them. She upgraded us anyway because ""we had attempted to pay for it"", and let us keep the vouchers.

tl;dr **You** get a muffin! And **you** get a muffin! And **you** get a muffin!...

curtbag,89,,280,1j3s8g,,1034,"So yesterday my friends and I spent the day at Canada's Wonderland in Toronto. There is this one ride called the Leviathan which is the newest roller coaster at the park and extremely popular. There are 3 trains and when one train takes off, another one is done its track. So anyways as my train is finished it's course we pull up into the station behind the other train.

However, some jarhead with a spray-tan is giving the employees a hard time. He has an arm cast and is not allowed to ride but will not leave the train because ""he already went on the ride earlier"". No matter how many times the workers told him about legalities and the danger they would be in, he continued to swear and holler at the workers (with little kids around no less). At this point, the workers eventually begin to pull him and his friend out, but not before the guy spat on every open seat on the roller coaster. At this point he had held up the ride for about 15 minutes and there's nothing worse than impatient Canadian ride warriors.

Best part? While he was getting up his phone dropped out of his pocket, onto the floor of the coaster, nearly tipping off the edge of the train. Now, my buddy and I who were both front seat in our train and front seat in the action yelled at the employee that his phone was right there. The worker went and picked it up, held it up for everyone to see and he whole queue line just cheered and laughed at this dope. The worker even pretended to drop kick the phone out of the station. The worker then went to put it in the lost and found and when our spray tanned amigo came storming back for his ""brand new s4"", every single person acted like they didn't know what happened. Of course, security comes at this point and escorts the two out of the park.

DressWrecker,147,,266,1qldws,,1030,"Long but worth it (I hope). Throwaway account in case anyone I know reads this. 

Prologue: The rental situation in this city is horrific, so I decide to save a little money by moving into a two-bedroom apartment with a friend of a friend. The situation begins to go south barely a month into our one year lease, with new roommate (let's call her Klepto) starting out by being just a little nuts, and progressing into stealing my things- clothes, money, cosmetics, even underwear.  And I don’t mean borrow without asking, I mean disappear into her clutches never to be seen again. Instead of taking the penalty for breaking my lease, I decide to wait out the rest of the year. I buy a lock for my bedroom door and move most of my things into my bedroom, except for sofa, TV, Blu-Ray, etc, which stay in the living room. 

The Story: In the final days of our lease we each begin to move out, when I come home from work and find Klepto’s things gone – along with my TV, Blu-Ray and everything else that she had had access to. Now, none of this was brand new stuff- most of it was my parent’s castoffs or second hand purchases- but there was no way I could afford to replace them. Also, I had no way to prove that these items were mine (second hand).  I knew it would be her word against mine, and when I called her demanding my things back this is exactly how it played out. 

The Revenge: This could have been the end of just another bad roommate story, but Klepto had left one last, precious thing to move out: her wedding dress. Klepto was getting married in two months. It was too good an opportunity to pass up, and The Dress went with me.  It didn’t take too long to get the first phone call. Over the next few days I ignored at least thirty phone calls from her. I was prepared to just trade for my things back, but then I got a registered letter from a lawyer, demanding the return of the dress. I really didn’t want to blow the issue up any further, so I got out her beautiful, delicate, designer lace dress and prepared to return it.  I stuffed it into the smallest box possible, about the size of a  shoe box. I could hear fabric ripping as I crammed it in. But that’s not it. I just so happened to have a friend that was headed to Europe, and was very happy to put the dress in her suitcase. When she arrived I had my friend send the dress Cash On Delivery. I can only imagine the look on Klepto’s face as she finally got her dress days before her wedding, and then not only had to pay for the delivery, but also needed to get it cleaned, pressed and prepared for her big day.

snazzypantz,58,,208,1e0mkg,,1029,"Was just reminded of this and thought it belonged here: 

So a while ago, I'm working at the front desk of a hotel. It's a couple hours before check-in, but people check in early all the time. If we happen to have a clean room, we'll get you in there; if not, we get all your info, take your luggage, and give you a call as soon as your room is ready. 

So on this day, we had a convention in. Convention people generally get in early, drop off their luggage, go to the convention and grab the keys for their room when the day ends, around 5. Not this woman. She'd tried to check in at 10 am, got annoyed that her room wasn't ready, and then proceeded to check back once or twice an hour. Each time she asked, myself or my co-worker would tell her, ""We'll call you when it's ready."" 

She comes up AGAIN, her 10th or so visit to the front desk, says, ""There has to be ONE clean room by now,"" and at this point I was willing to bend my ""don't reward bad behavior"" policy and upgrade her into whatever room was available just to get her out of my face. We had oversold the convention rate rooms by a few rooms anyway (low floor, views blocked by other buildings, usually not as quiet because of street noises) so we were going to have to upgrade a couple of people anyway, so I thought: fuck it. She's huffing and puffing about how long she's waited and SURELY there is a clean room by now, and I check the computer. There is fabulous corner room (a bit bigger with massive windows on two side) on a high floor with a spectacular view. It's one of our coveted rooms, but it's available and I'll turn an unhappy guest into a happy one and everyone wins. 

So I tell her, ""Actually, you're right! We do have an available room, and..."" Before I can finish, she throws her purse on the counter. 

""MY ROOM IS READY? I HAVE BEEN WAITING HERE FOR HOURS! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE CALL ME! YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALL!"" 

And I say, ""Well, yes, we did say we would call but...""

""BUT NOTHING. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN WAITING! I HAVE CHECKED BACK AND YOU PEOPLE SAID YOU WOULD CALL!"" 

""But Ma'am, let me explain...""

""CALLLLLLLLLL! YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALLLLLL!"" 

It went like this for a bit, me trying to tell her what happened, but she would not let me explain. She kept chanting YOU SAID YOU WOULD CALLLL over and over. Now, I was pissed that I had even tried to help this woman out. I just wanted her to shut up and leave. So I pull a trick I've used before.

""Ma'am, we did try to call you. Is your phone number 555-555-5554?"" I tell her a number that is one number off of her real number; they usually say, oh, ok, simple mistake, my real number is 555-555-5555, I apologize for the mix up, buy them a round of drinks at the bar, and everyone is happy. Not this woman. 

""YES, THAT'S MY NUMBER. I NEVER GOT A CALL."" I was confused. Did she mishear me? So I repeat the wrong number again, being sure to emphasize each number, so she could see what had (not really) happened. 

Again, she claimed loudly that that WAS her number, and this time she said her room should be free because we are idiots who made her wait for HOURS because we couldn't make a simple phone call. My manager is peeking around the corner, actually laughing at me, and I am now flummoxed. She wants free stuff and is not going to back down. She called my bluff.  Suddenly, it dawns on me. 

""Ma'am, do you have your phone on you? Could the ringer be off?"" She said it's on, is still screaming. So I say, ""And the number is 555-555-5554, right? We, let me just call it and see what the issue is."" 

Now her face freezes, as she realizes that she just painted herself into a corner. I call the fake number and not shockingly her phone doesn't ring. As I'm still on the phone, I say sweetly, ""Is it ringing? It's ringing on my end. Could you check it? Maybe you have some missed calls?"" 

She doesn't answer, just picks up her purse, and asks icily for her room key. This is the first time since I told her her room was ready that she hasn't yelled. But now I'm pissed, and I am not about to let her have this room. Instead, I find one of the dreaded ""25"" rooms. These are rooms that we never give out unless we are sold out; they are right next to the elevator, they are tiny, they have no desk, and they don't even have closets. Just little armoires. They're being eliminated during the next renovation, too, so they still have all of the old tvs, alarm clocks and outdated bathrooms. Because no one uses them, they are usually clean. 

So I book her into this room, smile brightly as I hand her the key, and wish her a happy stay. 

POSTSCRIPT: Of course she called down ten minutes later, irate again, and I let my manager take the call. He told her that if she'd like to move, she could certainly do that, but she would have to wait until after check-in and he would see what we had available then. She never bothered calling back.

CooterSquirrel,105,,153,13zs3n,,1031,"Just discovered this (wholly awesome) sub, and figured this story was worth reposting - I had originally told this tale in a comment on another sub a few weeks back.

When I was 15/16 I worked at a local video rental place. It was privately owned and was bootleg as hell - pretty sure the owner used it as a front for something shady, but that's neither here nor there. The boss was too cheap to pay more than one person per shift, so I had the slow Wed/Thurs night shifts all to myself. We were in this wiiicked rich, yuppy town (Concord MA) and 90% of our business consisted of local soccer moms bringing their kids in for a movie night. Most of these women were terrible people - overlords to their spoiled flock who would throw credit cards around without thinking twice and would condescend everyone they deemed ""beneath"" them.

We had a very basic computer system at the time, and there was a built-in function that wouldn't allow someone to rent another movie if they had over $10 of late fees on their account. The employees had the ability to overwrite this, at their discretion, or to lower the fees if they thought it appropriate. Generally speaking, I was the guy who would waive any &amp; all late fees - reason being that my boss was a cheap fuck, and I didn't worry at all about making money for him... if the customer was nice to me I'd waive their fees, no questions asked. Anyway... One day this woman comes in with a bunch of kids, if I remember correctly it was 5-6 roughly 12-13 year old boys. The kids were running around, pulling things off the shelves, making lots of noise, punching each other, pissing off other customers, and pissing me off as well. The woman didn't do shit about it, she sat there gossiping on her cellphone not caring about the scene her kids were causing. Being a fairly timid &amp; non-confrontational person by nature I didn't say anything, and just figured I'd clean up the mess when they left.

So the woman finally comes up to the counter with like 8 different movies, a few video games and a bunch of candy. She's standing there on the phone still, shoves the stuff at me across the counter and doesn't even acknowledge my presence. So I look up her account.... Boom. $120 worth of late fees and four titles rented for 6+ months and still not returned. So I tried getting her attention, saying something like ""excuse me, ma'am...ma'am?"" while her back is turned. She gestures me off. So I stand there and do nothing, waiting. She finally hangs up a minute or so later, turns to me and says something snarky like ""well what's taking so long??""

So I explain, ""ma'am you have a very outstanding fee on your account and I can't let you rent any more movies until this is paid and the missing movies are returned"". She flips a shit. Starts ranting that her daughter rents things in her name, never returns anything, doesn't pay fees, and that she herself has done no wrong and the fees should be cleared and she should be able to rent etc etc. I nod but say, ""this account still owes $120 and I can't allow you to rent until it's paid. Company policy ma'am, I'm sorry but I don't make the rules.""

She starts going off again, saying ridiculous things like ""I know the owner he'll wipe out the debt in a heartbeat you'd better let me rent or I'll complain to him about how terrible his employees are and you'll be *fired*"" etc etc. I tell her he's out of the country (which was true) and can't be reached (not true), and she still owes $120 (getting truer by the second). She bitches some more and finally pulls out the card. We had this ancient machine that, for reasons unknown to me, would only read a magnetic strip correctly if you wrapped the card in a plastic grocery bag. I couldn't explain to you why, but it was the only way the damn thing worked.

So, as you can probably guess, I ran the card with no plastic wrap. Denied. Tried it again just for looks... Denied. I printed out a receipt, and asked if she had cash. She didn't, and she was ripshit about the card. I showed her the receipt saying ""Card Not Accepted"" and feigned indifference. She asked (er, violently demanded) that she speak to a manager. I happily informed her that I was the manager on duty and was indeed the only employee in the store. She stormed out and walked across the street to the bank... came back a few minutes later with the money and practically threw it at me. I took the payment.... and said ""now, about those overdue movies... I don't suppose your daughter would like to return them for you so you can rent these movies?"" I got the worst death glare I think I've ever received (and my mother can practically shoot lasers from her eyes) and the woman abandoned her stack of movies and stomped out. Not sure if we ever saw her again but at the time 15 year old me was so proud of myself for staying cool under pressure and fucking with this woman.

And seriously.... FUCK overpriviledged soccer moms

I was playing a Gun Game for the first time and as soon as I first said something on the mic and my female voice is heard, this guy (Asshole) immediately lays into me, calling me a ""dirty cunt,"" ""loose pussy"", and reminding me to get back to the kitchen, but not before sucking his cock.

TokisCodpieceBZZZ,132,,234,1h37ag,,1024,"So I used to work at a well-known coffee chain inside a grocery store, and we had a new practice put in place: if you don't receive a receipt from us, you get your money back.  Yeah.  This is a thing.  Since lots of people just don't want a receipt from a $3 purchase, I got into the habit of placing all receipts on the counter.  Customer could take it if they wanted it, and if not I'd toss it.

So one day this lady comes in, orders a medium hot coffee and a coffee roll.  I ring her up, and she immediately starts complaining about the price.  I tell her sorry, coffee rolls cost more than donuts and I don't make the prices.  I put the change in her hand and the receipt on the counter, but make note of the fact that she's reading our little ""receipt or your money back"" sign.

About 45 minutes later I'm in the way back of the store, and my coworker pages me back.  I come rushing, thinking there's a huge line of people, but it's just that lady from earlier, claiming she didn't get a receipt and she wants her refund.  Well, I knew for a FACT that I laid it on the counter.  My coworker has already gone through all of our trash bins and couldn't find it.  On a hunch I went to a nearby trash bin at the store's pharmacy.  I dig through some papers, half-drank coffees and half-eaten donuts and find the receipt, which she'd clearly taken and thrown out herself, and hold it out for her to take.

""That's not my receipt.""

""Ma'am, I remember your order.  You ordered a medium coffee and a coffee roll, which I remember because you didn't like the price of the coffee roll.  We got 12 coffee rolls today - 6 plain, 6 frosted.  I know this because I've been here since 5:30 this morning when I unpacked them myself.  We now have 5 plain, 6 frosted.  This is your receipt, which somehow migrated to the trash on your side of the counter despite your never having received it.  I'm sure it was just an oversight.  Have a nice day.""

Spartan745,193,,413,1d9zrz,,1028,"Okay so this happened sometime last year. A few fraternity brothers (they're cousins) invited me to one of their friend's birthday dinners. It was a nice place. It had great food, had a great time. On the ride back, one of them (let's call him Simon) said, 



""Hey Spartan, did you forget something at the restaurant?""



""No, I don't think so.""



All of a sudden he pulled out my wallet. Apparently, I had left my wallet (which was stupid on my part) at the restaurant and thankfully he grabbed it before we headed out. 



""Oh thanks man, I really appreci-""



""Woah, woah. I found this wallet, don't I get a reward or something?""



""Uh.... How bout a 'thank you'?""



""Nope, that ain't gonna cut it.""



WTF.



Now given, I screwed up and was grateful that someone did grab it, rather than me forgetting it, call the restaurant before it closed, and then having to drive back on my own time to pick it up. But this is bullshit.



""Simon, seriously, I'd like to have my wallet back. It was my old man's."" (dad passed a couple of years ago due to metastasized pancreatic cancer)



""I don't give a f***.""



This was big no-no for me. You can call me names, and pull pranks on me, that's fine. I've done it to him too and we all take it in stride (was not okay with it when I first joined the fraternity). But when you don't give back something to it's rightful owner, especially when it they have sentimental value over it, that's a line that shouldn't be crossed.



After a debacle of threats, bargaining, etc. He said I had to pay him $20 at a wedding of another fraternity brother's that was coming up in two weeks. I got my wallet back, but I was **PISSED**...



I thought of ways I could get back to him. Sure, I wanted to beat the living daylights out of him, but that would have been too much. I've never had the opportunity to come up with any revenge scheme... But then it hit me. If he wants his $20, I'll give him his $20. Even if it was messed up I was a man and I will meet up to my end of the bargain.



So on the drive over, I went into a bank with a $20 in my hand. As I got to the teller, I asked for $20 in pennies. The teller gave me a weird look at first. I told him it was for a project for my economics class. He just shrugged and said ""oh cool"". I had to make some BS story on how I was using pennies in my made-up econ class. Before I got to another bro's house, I stopped by a gas station and asked for a couple of plastic bags.



Once I got to his place, I got changed and brought out the box of rolled pennies and the plastic bags. I unrolled each and every one of those motherfuckers into the bag. By the end of it there were plastic sleeves everywhere. 



We go to the wedding, had a great time all the meanwhile he's like ""where's my $20"". I'll get it to you, just have to stop by the ATM I say. Finally, we get to the reception, eat some good food and enjoy ourselves. 



Hey Spartan where's my money?



Oh right, let me get it from my car



He get's back to his table while I go to my car to get the money. When I came back, I dropped it in front of him. It made a huge thud and crash as it hit the table and then some of it fell over with pennies falling all over the place. At first he was stunned and then was all like ""WTF what is this?"" His girlfriend and surrounding brothers were pissed too. Then I explained to them what happened and why I gave him $20 in pennies. Then, they give him the death look and saying things like ""WTF is the matter with you?"" ""Why couldn't you be a decent human being and just give him his wallet back?"" etc. etc. Finally he comes back to me with the bag of pennies and says



""haha, you got me spartan. I was just messing with you, you can have it back.""



""No that's fine you can have it, we made an agreement that I would give you $20.""



""This isn't $20""



""Yeah it is. It's legal tender, you can use it wherever you want.""



Hands him back the bag and he walks away shoulders slumped over, possibly due to embarrassment or the weight of the pennies. I smirked when I saw him bring it back to his car, while his gf was bitching at him. Some of the bros gave me major kudos for planning this out. While he's not the most hated brother in our chapter, he's been known to be a serious dick sometimes. Best $20 I've ever spent.




TL;DR- Went to dinner w/ fraternity bros, forgot wallet, one of them demands $20 for bringing the wallet back. Wallet has sentimental value got pissed. Decide to give him $20 in pennies, bring it to next event we're both at. Embarrass him by dropping bag of pennies onto table, falls everywhere, his girlfriend and other fraternity bros got pissed at him.",You want your $20? Here's your *bleep*ing $20.,1441,pettyrevenge

I'm a pizza delivery driver
...
**End of Prologue**

**Set Up to the Revenge**
I was delivering a pizza and cinnapie to a customer. Pretty routine. I had delivered there once before earlier that week, so I already knew where she lived, but also that I wasn't going to get a tip, which is shitty because of how far she lived. I got there and found her sitting on her front porch with two of her friends and her son. I took her order out of my trunk and before I even reached her, she loudly exclaimed ""Where is my soda?""

I double checked her receipt and said there was no soda on her order, just a pizza and cinnapie. She didn't believe me until I showed her the receipt. She was still giving me hell, ""Well, I did order a soda."" I asked how she ordered and she said by phone. Well, I assumed whoever took her order just accidently forgot the soda or just didn't hear it. Human error, it happens. At least she wasn't charged for it. I told her I could call the restaurant and get this fixed, but she straight up told me not to even bother and that she would do it.

Well, she got through to the restaurant and explained the situation in the rudest way possible, even referring to me as the ""pizza boy"". Really? I'm 23. Well, my manager offered her the same offer I did, fix the order and have me drive all the way back to the restaurant and back with her Mountain Dew, which she was all for until she heard how long it could potentially take. You see, I wasn't going to just go back and come right back with a soda. No, I would have to wait for my next delivery to be ready before I could leave. She wasn't having it. Up until that point, she kept on going on and on about how she can't eat pizza with something to drink. In my mind, I just thought to myself, ""well, why not just go and get your own drink and save me my precious time. Your not going to give me a tip anyway, so this would be a big waste of time and gas on my part. That's kinda inconsiderate, considering this wasn't my mistake."" I wasn't mad at the person who made the mistake, shit happens, but she was so rude to me and my manager, who is trying her hardest to make this upset customer happy, and to no avail. And, while all of this is going on, her son (about 3 or 4) was tugging on my pant leg and pulling on the the pizza bag... AND ALL THREE WOMEN JUST STOOD THERE AND WATCHED HIM DO IT. ""Lady, get your kid off of me and under control, wth"", I thought to myself.

Finally, she just gave up and hung up on my manager while she was still talking, saying she would just pay for it as is. She commented on how stupid the whole situation was and even said that she could probably do a better job that half the people that work there. Every little thing she said just irritated me and she wasn't even trying to upset me. Nope, she just continued to treat me like I wasn't even there.

**The Revenge**
Her order was on a credit card. Company policy for all drivers is to check the card and a form of ID before handing over the order to ensure this isn't identity theft. After all that, I asked for her card and ID. She said it's her husband's card and he's at work. When I heard that, it was like opportunity for petty revenge just manifested itself in a physical form. It was too perfect.

""I'm sorry, ma'am, but I need to see the card""
""Well, I can't show you the card, my husband is at work""
""Well, ma'am, I'm sorry, but I can't let you have this order then.""

Oh, it was a fury unlike anything I had every seen before. She was irate. She was yelling at me, demanding the order. I said that if she could get the card, I would let her have the food. She told me her husband worked about an hour away, there was no way for her to do that. I told her this was all I could do and she was furious.

""I'm gonna report you to your supervisor!"" Oh, you mean the one you hung up on, I'm sure she will take your side.
""I'm gonna get you fired!"" All my managers love me, good luck with that.
""I'm never ordering from you again."" Good, more time spent on reasonable customers.

I got back to the restaurant with the order, explained myself to the manager and he just smiled and gave me a look that said, ""you magnificent bastard"".

**TL;DR**
Customer was upset over a little mistake on her order, was rude and inconsiderate to me and one of my managers. Denied her the order when she couldn't produce a credit card.

atworksonospacedicks,299,,326,1cya3d,,1018,"I saw a post earlier about a coffee shop and it reminded me of another bit of petty revenge I had. 

I too worked at a coffee shop in college. Our shop brought in a whole slew of people, many of them college age. I always worked the afternoon/closing shift when we got a lot of college students coming in to study. There was this one guy who came in often. Truth be told, he never wronged me. However, the guy was genuinely an asshole. The first time I served him, he referred to the people out front as ""faggots"" (I hate that term) and was making derogatory comments about women. This guy was very conversational and he went on to tell me about how he was training for a triathlon. I believed him as he was fit and rode his bike to the store. This guy viewed his ""latte"" as his treat in the mid-afternoon after his work-out. 

After listening to this guy be a genuine asshole for a few minutes whilst talking about working out and being healthy, I went ahead and made him his latte. Except I made a breve. For those who do not know, a breve is a latte (espresso and milk) made with 1/2 and 1/2 (cream) instead of milk. A large breve with flavor is about a thousand calories. The guy took a sip and LOVED it (I'm sure they're amazing). He loved it so much he came in often and would always point me out and say ""THAT GUY. HE IS MAKING MY DRINK!!!"". He literally thought my ""way"" of making the drink was the difference... like I had some weird ability. Little did the derogatory asshole know I was feeding him liquid fat and sugar. I hope his triathlon went amazing. ","Don't be a dick, I'll make you fat.",1344,pettyrevenge

Then she also takes a few other items and keeps them in her hands. SO I wait till she moves on and go and grab 1 of each thing she pocketed.

Then I head up to the register as I see she is using another classic tactic of buying some things to throw off the store employees who might think she has taken something.

I tell the person on register that I will take this one.

First I ring up each of the items I know she has in her purse, and put them down on the floor. She smiles hands me her stuff,I ring them up and give her a total.

She looks shocked and says ""That doesn't seem right this stuff shouldn't cost this much?""

I replied ""Oh it doesn't mam I added the cost of the 3 items in your purse."" Smile.

Anyway, I digress. I would often attend a lunch class held at the school. This was a great class because it was smaller so I would get more 1 on 1 help. This is where I was driving to at the beginning of my story.

Enter douchbag (D). I was on a two lane parkway about to exit to the road where my school is located. Out of nowhere, D cuts me off from the left lane to make the exit. He almost clipped me. As I laid into my horn D shot me the finger and brake checked me pretty bad (I had an older car at the time and had to swerve off to avoid hitting him). 

Anyway, I brushed the incident off and continued to make my way to the class. But that is when I saw D in front of me. He seemed to be making the same turns I was. It wasn't until he pulled into the parking lot and got out that it occurred to me... He's in my class!!! And must be new!! (Didn't recognize him).

As I got out of the car a few cars away, D gave me the look of ""you wanna go!?!?"" That was until he saw me completely get out. You see, before you reach black belt at my school, you have a white uniform, like the one he was wearing. When you reach black belt, you may also wear a black one. Well I was a 2nd degree at the the time, and my uniform was a nicely faded grey - a sign I had been there a while. 

D noticed my uniform and the greatest oh shit face descended upon him. I just laughed and went past him into the school. 

Now I know what you're thinking... I kicked his ass right?? Well no, I didn't. But he did puke from doing bag work with me, and I threw him around like a rag doll during sparring. The only part of the guy that was hurt during class was his pride. And I loved every minute of it.",Unexpected Martial Arts Revenge,1298,pettyrevenge
malhibou,61,,215,1llkhr,,1006,"BACKSTORY: I had a nightmarish housemate my junior year of college, who we shall refer to as NH. She was passive aggressive (bitchy post-it notes all over the house, asked other housemates to bring up problems AH had with me so she wouldn't look like the bad guy) and seemed to think that because she had moved into the house the year before, I was more like a long-term guest than a real housemate. NH was a senior and would always leave a mess, saying ""you'll understand when you get to senior year, there just isn't time to clean up right away"" but would insist I had to do my dishes the moment I'd stopped eating. We shared a bathroom that was connected to her room but had another door to the outside hall. If I did something wrong, like forget to turn off the fan after my shower, or wash my toothpaste spit out of the sink completely, NH would punish me by locking the outside door to the bathroom from the inside, then leave for class, locking her bedroom door so there was no way I could use the shower. I had to keep all my toiletries and toothbrush and towels in my room so I could use the other bathroom (which 3 other girls were sharing).

STORY: Towards the end the fall semester, I was throwing a dinner party for the people who were going to be in the spring play with me. I like to cook curry from scratch, which can use a lot of pots and pans and chopping boards. I'd set my chicken in marinade and gone out to get the ingredients for raita. I guess NH didn't like the fact that I had set up my (clean) work station ahead of time, because I returned home to find everything gone. All the pots, pans, and chopping boards were missing. My guests were set to arrive in minutes, and I was now having to MacGyver chopping boards out of cardboard and clean paper. I found a note that said ""If you can't take care of my stuff [*bullshit, all of it came with the house*] then maybe you don't get to use it? :(  love NH"" I managed to make do with borrowing a neighbour's pots and pans, but was furious when I found out she'd hidden all of ours under her bed and locked herself in her room, listening to me freak out.

REVENGE: Depending on how many credits you've completed, you're given a very strict time slot for registration. People who live on campus are forced to use the campus internet, which is stupid slow and crashes a lot, which force-quits all of your class selection. As off-campus people, we were safe from that. Well, *I* was. NH wasn't. I found out what time her registration slot was, then with one minute to go I unplugged the router. I heard NH screech, then I plugged it back in. 2 minutes later, I did the same thing and scampered off. This time she came stomping out and I heard her smacking the router around. We played this game for about ten minutes, before I heard her run out the door and start her car, presumably driving to campus to register. 
She ended up getting waitlisted for almost every class. I regret nothing.

a_v_p,61,,287,1ml5ui,,1005,"Background:

My office is on a quiet street with a painted yellow curb out front. When I say quiet street, I mean it's half a standard city block with a dead end, so we don't get a lot of traffic. Our parkades are all over the place, so when someone forgets something at the office, rather than re-parking in a parkade, they park their car out front for a few minutes to run in and grab whatever it was. This usually isn't a big deal (quiet street, remember), but the bylaw officers disagree, and many of my co-workers have been ticketed for illegal parking at a yellow curb.

The setup:

One day, I left for lunch and saw a city parking enforcement car parked smack in the middle of the yellow curb. It was actually blocking the wheelchair dip (shame!). I couldn't see the bylaw officer around (you know, ticketing cars or something), so I took a picture of the car and went out for lunch. When I came back an hour later, the car was still illegally parked, and again, no bylaw officer to be found. Took another picture of the car and continued into my building.

I have no idea where that person was, but I can guarantee you they were not doling out parking tickets. We're 4 blocks away from a major (metered) shopping street with plenty of legal and much more convenient places to park. I suspect they were off eating lunch or something.

The revenge:

Since I love a little schadenfreude after lunch with a healthy side of petty revenge, I get back to my desk and email the city's parking enforcement department. I detail that 1) one of their officers has parked illegally; 2) for over an hour; and 3) this sets a poor example when so many of us have been ticketed (yeah, I laid it on thick). I included all said pictures, of course.

The result:

A week later, I heard back from parking enforcement! They confirmed that the bylaw officer had indeed parked illegally, and explained that illegal parking is allowed if the bylaw officer was in the midst of their duties. Since the officer apparently wasn't in the midst of their duties, the office also confirmed that they had been reprimanded for their actions. They also apologized (bonus!).

That was 6 years ago. Haven't seen parking enforcement around since. Peace was thus restored to the land.

TLDR: Parking enforcement officer parks illegally, gets reprimanded, hasn't been seen since.","Ticket me, will you?",1292,pettyrevenge
PuddingTeeth,62,,236,1iddr7,,1007,"**Background**

I work in a big international company, instore as a part of the warehouse operative (basically we do everything for everyone). The manager of the warehouse team is a ~~really nice person~~ cunt. She employed her son full time when he turned 18 and gave him his own pick at what hours he would like. So now he has become her whipping boy when she is around (never), but when she is not he does as he likes. He orders people around, shouts at people and sits on his big fat ass and does nothing at all.

**The Actual Story**

So the other day after feeling bad all day i told him that if i feel this shitty i will not be coming in tomorrow and i will call his mum and tell her. So i carry on working the rest of the shift, i think he's cool, i dont know why everyone slags him off. We are locking up and he asks me if i smoked weed. I said oh yeah im going to smoke some when i get home. We carry on talking and he admits that he smokes to. Shift ends.
I call in sick the following day because i feel really shitty. So when i return to work 2 days later i found out he told his mum that i ""couldnt be arsed to work"" and i was going to lie to get the day off.
Manager pulls me aside bollocks me. He spreads around work i lied to get the day off.

The same day the manager bollocks me, i also get a random locker search. I have some items in my bag that i bought earlier instore. They didnt want to see the reciept, instead they sniffed through my bag saying they where looking for something in particular (obviously the weed).

So by now i know that he snitched on me to his mum twice. i then decided i was going to have some fun with it.

**REVENGE**

So then i asked him if he wanted to buy some cocaine (Something he said he takes all the time) from me. I will be bringing quite a lot in tomorrow at work so he can buy. I hinted that i would have about half a kilo (LOL).

So when i get to work scan in i get a call from the manager to meet me in the locker room. By the time i get in there three private security officers are following me from the staff room. Then i go into the locker room there are a further 8 officers and 1 drug sniffer dog. I get made to open my locker and empty my bag. During this time the manager and her son are standing in the locker room with me smirking. Also the regional manager is instore so he is in there to.

No drugs in my bag. 
Store gets fined a lot of money for wasting time. 
his mum gets demoted for calling in the search
he gets the sack and trys to fight me. 
he gets arrested for assault. 
he gets 7 months in prison.

A nice added bonus to my last pay packet. 
I leave the company the next week to go to University.
We are even.

**Prison**

Basically i was coming in work one day and he was waiting for me in the staff area. I thought nothing of it and just got changed when i was getting changed coincidentally the a security guard was just starting his shift to. So then when the guy saw me i was with the security guard.
He walked up to me and basically punched me in the back of the head whilst i was walking away (cheap shot). But it was all on camera and the security guard was a witness to it all. His mum got a new job after this.

vixitknight,33,,279,1mv83p,,1005,"Been lurking around this sub for a few months, thought I share a story from few years ago. Althought I am not sure if it count as petty.

**Background:**

About 5-6 years ago, my grandfather came visit us in the State. He stayed with us for about 4 months. One day, while he was rearranging our gardens, he collapsed and we rushed him to the hospital. The ER doc said it was some sort of infection, and had to stay for the treatment. We set up a schedule so at least one person is always with him in the hospital.

**Offender:**

The resident was absolutely horrible. He was rude, demeaning, and borderline racist. He will often completely ignore our questions or concerns. More than once, I saw him making fun of other patients and even nurses. One of the nurse told us that since the resident's father was one of the head of the department who is also a war buddy of the Chief Physician, he gets away with a lot of things. No one likes him, but they can't do much about it.

**Revenge:**

One of my close friend visited us at the hospital. He mentioned that his dad sat on that hospital's board of directors. Upon hearing that, I told him everything I seen/heard about this resident. My friend was disgusted and immediately called his dad. Two hours later, his dad, the Chief Physician, and the Attending were in the room making sure my grandfather is doing okay. My grandfather, been his usual kindhearted self, was trying to convince them that my friend and I exaggerated the situation, but the statements from the nurses was more than enough. I am not quite sure what really happened afterward, but I never saw that resident around that part of the hospital after that.",There are always people more connected than you are,1284,pettyrevenge

He decided to message my recent ex-girlfriend, saying that we should get back together. This caused a shitstorm that I had to deal with, and I wasn't too happy. One of my friends who was also sitting at the table told me that he'd been messing with my computer, and I put two and two together.

I was pretty livid, but I decided that revenge was a dish best served cold. I waited until he was hosting a party at his place, and I put my plan into action. I had a friend serve as a lookout and I went into the guy's room. His computer wasn't password-protected, and his Facebook was automatically logged in. I proceeded to go down his friends list and find girls with pictures of them in swimsuits. I tried to pick ones he didn't talk to a whole lot, but went to our university. Bonus points if it was a group of girls. I 'liked' about 50 swimsuit pictures. I made sure to 'like' pictures of his exes that I knew of. I watched his Facebook friend count decrease by 7 over the next day.

Comms,151,,242,1g19jh,,1002,"Does it count as petty revenge if the target didn't specifically do anything to me, personally?

A few years ago I went back to school to get another BA because the first time around my GPA could be charitably called ""aggressively mediocre"" and I really wanted to go to grad school. My wife had a full time job at the time so I didn't need to get a part time job or anything but I get bored easily. I applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasn't particularly demanding work. It was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking IDs of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest. It was part of the campus safety initiative. Most of the time I just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last call—this is in Canada so it's pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age. Occasionally, I was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked. I didn't mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with me—who has money for that shit?—so this was not my favorite part of the job.

As an aside, I tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard. Fuck the man.

Anyway, one day in the late fall—still above freezing but not by much—I was outside the engineering building and I saw a newish BMW 3-series—or maybe it was an M3, I don't recall so I'm just going to say it was an M3 for brevity—parked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags. As usual, I approach the car slowly, like I'm sneaking up on it. I discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive. I've found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud, blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd. It's better to sneak up on the car, confirm that it is, in fact, illegally parked (or has an expired pass), walk away, write the ticket, and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper. 

&gt;Be me, meter nazi

&gt;Use stealthy ticket

&gt;It is very effective

I wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off. I did another walk around the rear parking lot and then, because it was near the end of my shift, I returned to that same building because there was a Tim's inside and I wanted to grab lunch and a coffee. I go inside, get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke. I'm standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg)—I don't actually know what these things are called—drink in one hand, sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket, smoke in the other hand, and just zone out. Next thing I know there's some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly. I zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the M3. He's this skinny dude, wearing a [puffy vest](http://www.gap.com/products/res/thumbimg/quilted-puffer-vest-blue.jpg), and he's got fancy hair. I figure he's probably 18 or 19. 20 tops. He's got the yellow envelope in one hand and he's all, ""Fucking shit, fuck fuck, dick, cunt, shit, fuck, motherfucker, etc."" 

While he's swearing and having a bit of a spaz, he's also looking around, presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mind.

Oh wait, I'm the meter nazi! And I'm like 30 feet away! Still smoking. Sandwich in my pocket, coffee in the other hand, parking ticket printer slung across my chest. Well shit. 

&gt;Be me

&gt;Be at the end of your shift

&gt;Expect to be yelled at by Puffy Vest Fancy Hair


I steel myself for the eventual tirade. Policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations. Our interactions should consist of ""yes sir/ma'am"", ""no sir/ma'am"", ""I understand, sir/ma'am"" but overall being firm about why they received a ticket.  He swings his vision around several times but doesn't seem to spot me. I'm not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory, blue, campus security jacket, and a *ticket printer*. He keeps looking around. Left. Right. Left. Right.

I take another drag.

For whatever reason, he doesn't see me. He angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car, bleeps the car with his remote, *and heads back into the building*.

So, I'm still standing by the [smoking pawn](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-22DySWZ92tE/TefG5ONiZXI/AAAAAAAAA2o/pf35mfKs20o/s1600/smoking_pawn.jpg), sandwich in my pocket, half-full medium double-double—the old medium, not the new upsized medium—with one drag left on my smoke. So I finish my smoke, feed the pawn, and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich. I'm sitting on the bench, eating my sandwich, drinking my coffee, and staring at this M3 that is still parked in the handicap space.

""I'm gonna finish my sandwich, drink my double-double, *have another smoke*, and then I'm going to give him another ticket"", says I to myself.

""It's a trap"", replies my brain, making a very good point.

""I dunno man, this is too good of an opportunity to pass up.""

""I'm just saying""

""How could it be a trap? What, he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a [dance off](http://nycxplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/West-Side-Story-2.jpg)?""

""Do whatever you want, just no concussions.""

My brain made a valid point. This would be an excellent trap. I pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth, wash it down with my now lukewarm double-double and light up another smoke—Du Maurier Light Kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning, no doubt—and stare at the entrance to the engineering building.

No sign of Puffy Vest Fancy Hair. With one hand I start typing out the ticket on the printer but don't press the ""print"" button yet—if I hit the button it saves the data and there's no way to undo it once that happens. I wasn't yet ready to commit to this course of action. I finish my second cigarette, pull out a yellow envelope, take a breath and hit ""print"" as I start walking toward the car. The thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and I quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper. 

Nothing happens.

No ambush.

No screaming.

No Puffy Vest Fancy Hair.

All that buildup for nothing.

I check my phone—if I recall correctly, it was a motorola flip phone of some variety—and shift ended a few minutes ago. I'm not technically in any hurry to get back to the office, we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so I'm not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying. I use the camera phone—with a whopping 640x480 resolution—to take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper. Then I walk into the engineering building, get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area, and I hope that this kid isn't in a three hour class. I'm now here for a show. I'm going to get yelled at, it'll be a huge scene, I'll have to be all professional about it, but seeing Puffy Vest Fancy Hair have another spaz is totally worth it.

""You're an idiot"", says my brain.

I let my coffee cool just for a bit before I take a swig. Of course, I forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin. Son of a bitch. I put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as I hear another stream of, ""CUNT FUCK MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK"" erupts from the vicinity of the M3. 

""WHO THE FUCK DID THIS?!""

""WHAT THE FUCK?!!""

There's Puffy Vest Fancy Hair: Sack of fast food in one hand, jumbo fountain drink in the other—ah, to have the metabolism of a 19 year-old again—He's whirling around, trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm. He's now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by. For some reason, he still hasn't spotted me. I'm standing a mere 30 feet from where he is spazzing. I am right beside the smoking pawn, wearing a blue jacket that says ""Campus Security"" on it. I have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest. For some reason, his gaze never lingers on me at all. After a few more seconds of spazzing, he gets in his car, throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds away.

Why he didn't see me is inexplicable. The only hypothesis I have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else. Maybe a [high visibility vest](http://www.legionsafety.com/high-visibility-safety-vests.jpg) or maybe something [like this](http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/pics/interceptor.JPG), I dunno.

I don't recall how much those tickets  run (a few hundred I think) but that kid had one expensive day. My boss did tell me that the kid's father called in pretty pissed about the tickets. I had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because I figured he'd probably ask my why I wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day. My boss explained to the kid's father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle, remove the ticket, and leave, it counted as a separate parking incident, thus, two tickets were warranted.

CreatrixAnima,106,,214,1isbxc,,996,"I used to manage a convenience store and we hired this woman - lets call her Evil Whore, or EW for short.  EW looked good on paper, but she was not a nice person.  EW worked mornings with a lady I will call Ann.  Ann's son John worked afternoons with me.  


One day, John told his mom something rather surprising and his mom, shocked, confided in EW.  By the end of the week, EW had outed John to the rest of the staff and embellished how Ann found out to include her walking in on John and another guy.  Fortunately, the staff loved John and rallied around him, but what a nasty thing to do!


In addition to being a bitch, EW was also an alcoholic.  (One time, she brought her six-year-old son to work, where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop.  Finally, a coworker - a sweet girl who liked to make people happy - bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid, who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is vodka, lemon juice and sugar.)  


Anyway, although things started out alright, eventually it got to the point where, if we scheduled EW to work on a Monday morning, she failed to show up a full 50% of the time.  It had been about 6 months since we hired her, which, coincidentally, was how long she needed to work before being eligible for unemployment benefits again, when we stopped scheduling her for the 6-2 shift on Mondays.  We gave her the 11-3 instead, which, obviously resulted in her losing some hours.  EW did not like that.


It was about 11:00 at night and I was at home when my phone rang.  It was EW, drunk and yelling at me about her hours.  She called me a stupid bitch a few times and kept repeating a simple mantra: ""FIRE ME FIRE ME FIRE ME!""


So I eventually hung up and I called my boss and told her what had happened.  We talked a bit and decided EW was more trouble than she was worth, so I called her back and said ""I've thought it over, EW, and I have decided to take your advice and fire you.  Goodbye.""


But that isn't the revenge bit.  The revenge is when she filed for unemployment.  I know a bit about how bureaucrats work, so I decided she wouldn't be getting unemployment benefits this time around.  We contested her claim and gave the Unemployment Office my contact information.  When they called, they asked me why I had let her go.  It went something like this:


Unemployment Guy: ""EW says you cut her hours.  Can you explain why that happened?""


Me:  ""Well, EW does a good job when she's there, but unfortunately, I think he has an alcohol problem.  She hasn't been dependable on Monday mornings, so we decided to let her sleep in.


UG:  ""But she was a good employee other than that?""


Me:  ""Yes and no.  She's good at the work, but she outed a gay coworker to the whole company last month and the last straw was when she called me at home and started swearing at me.  She called me a bitch while I was in my own home.  I don't have to put up with that!  I was in my living room and she's yelling at me saying 'Fire me, you stupid bitch,' and I am not going to be called a bitch in my own home.""


UG:  ""Wait... she asked you to fire her?""


Me: ""Yeah.  While calling me a bitch.  In my own home, no less!""


UG:  ""But she said the words 'fire me'?""


Me: ""Over and over again.  But I seriously don't need to be called a bitch in my own home.""


UG:  ""But she asked to be fired?  Okay, I think you've answered my questions.  Thank you.""


I hung up with a huge grin on my face.  It was a week or two before the letter from Unemployment came: EW was denied and would have to get a job.  Boo fucking hoo.

So I'm a jock. But not an asshole. There's obviously a difference. But some people can't make that distinction. You see, in high school, we're all intolerable shitheads without a clue of what we're going to be in life, or who we really are. That's why I hate it when people make assumptions about me without getting to know me first.

**The Backstory** So there's this girl I've been to school with since about 7th grade. I've always been nice to her and her friends I'm not the kind of guy to intentionally ruin someones day by being an asshole, because I mean well and try to keep my mind open. Let's call this girl Suzy. Suzy is very socially gifted. She's in with the popular girls, dates the popular guys, but is generally a very immature person (despite how pudgy and smug she is). (She denies the holocaust existed, even after one of my father's friends, a survivor offered his personal testimony to our 8th grade class.) Suzy used to smile at me in the hallways, but I didn't really pay her any attention. I didn't really connect with her. We never hung out, she was just a face in the yearbook.

A couple weeks ago, Suzy messaged me on facebook, (EDIT: here they are. http://imgur.com/a/Yfpnp   the OP delivers) out of the blue. She said I should kill myself, that I'm an asshole, and DESERVE to get hit by traffic and LIVE, so that I can suffer. (I still have those facebook messages) That hurts, she doesn't know me at all. And she's obviously not mature enough to get to know me. So I'll show her just how mature I can be.

**The Revenge** Like I said, Suzy is very socially gifted. And that's what she craves, attention. So my opportunity struck in the library when our class was working on a project. That dumb cunt left her facebook open. I changed her privacy setting so that only she could see her statuses. She went from 60+ likes a day to zero, and it's been like that for a month and a half. Every time i see her stare at her smartphone with a look of sheer horror on her face (as, no one is liking her statuses), a shudder of pure ecstasy runs down my spine. I'm evil. Don't judge me.

They decide to meet for lunch. My mom arrives to the restaurant first, parks her car, and is waiting for dad to get there. While she is waiting, some guy flies into the parking spot next to her, opens his door, and *bang*. His door hits the car mom was driving. 

She does the reasonable thing, gets out of the car, laughs it off, politely asks for insurance information (the dent was big enough, car was nice enough, it might've cost more than the deductible). The guy looks at the huge dent, and says ""It's not that big of a deal, don't worry."" And he just walks into the store without another word. 

Shit. What the hell just happened? Mom panics, not sure what to do. This guy just messed up the car that dad bought for mom, refused to give insurance info, and is now eating in the restaurant they are planning to eat at. She feels terrible. So she calls dad, and tells him what happened, worried he will be mad. He says only this, ""Move your car."" 

""What? Why? Don't you want to eat somewhere else?""

""Just move your car.""

So she moves. A minute or two later, dad pulls in. He drives a ~~work~~ daily driver car. A POS Honda. He parks next to the asshole's car, shuts his car off, grabs the door handle, and SLAM. SLAM. SLAM SLAM SLAM. He hits this guys car with his door, hard, over and over until it is obvious the door is *fucked*. 

Then, he calmly walks into the restaurant with mom following him. They get sat close to the asshole. Dad remains calm, unphased. The asshole left before they did, and dad never heard about it again. I assume this guy didn't have any insurance at all.

Tl;dr, if you door ding someone, offer insurance info or cash. Don't be an ass.

Edit. This blew up since I went to bed. Thanks for the comments! And whoops, I didn't mean work car, I meant a daily drive. You know, just a beater that barely cost anything, doesn't look good but still runs.

2nd Edit: Thought I'd share a story that is much more petty. I got white-girl wasted towards the end of high school. Friend drove me home (he was sober), and since my parents were home and I was being insanely stupid, he told me as strictly as he could ""Go straight to bed. Don't do anything else, just go to bed and sleep.""

So, I went inside, shut the lights off. As soon as is car left, I giggled like a maniac and showered. Fucker told me to go to sleep, I wasn't having any of that. So I showered. Then went to sleep.","Revenge over a car door ""ding""",1223,pettyrevenge

ThatThar,82,,225,1ija0i,,986,"Back in middle school, I was a percussionist in the band. Every year, there'd be some super big band festival that schools from all over the nation would travel to in order to compete, then spend the next day at a local theme park and watch the awards ceremony. In my 8th grade year, the majority of the band didn't feel like traveling, so we opted to compete in the festival being hosted in our town.

Flash forward to the festival. We played 3 songs. I don't remember them too well, but I do remember that towards the end of our last one, I had a solo. No big deal. I had practiced the solo hundreds of times. When the time came, I started the solo off beautifully. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I see a bright white light, like one of those keychain flashlights. This distracted me a thew off my timing very noticeably. As I was walking off stage, I could feel my director's eyes burning a hole in the back of my head. 

After the performance, he pulled me aside in the hallway and asked me what the problem was. I told him that someone had shined a flashlight and it threw me off. He told me to go tell the director of the high school band, which was where the festival was being hosted. So, I walked down to the bandroom and explained what had happened. He asked if I could identify who had done it. I didn't get a good look at the kid, but I did see that it was someone in a group of Hispanics wearing floral shirts. The director said that he'd figure something out and I went on to watch the other bands perform.

The group of kids who messed up my solo weren't just spectators who decided to color coordinate for the day. It turns out that they were a percussion ensemble who had came from Miami, Florida. Our band flew to any location past Atlanta, so it was safe to say that they likely spent a large amount of money to come perform. They played steel pans. When I recognized the group, I relayed the information to my director, who passed it on to the high school director.

Apparently, when a director says that shit will get done, it gets done. Word had made way to the director of the festival and the director of the Miami ensemble. Before the night was over, the Miami director apologized to me and promised that if they find out who did it, that kid will face punishment. The next day, at the award ceremony, I found that the band had been disqualified for ""unsportsmanlike conduct"".

[deleted],118,,174,1aawkj,,982,"I work in an office mainly comprised of men. Rich, assholic men with serious issues against women (especially in the workplace). Recently, I’ve been having trouble with the head hauncho here. We’ll call him Dick. Unfortunately, Dick pretty much owns the company so going to HR for a wink or a comment about my cleavage is kind of pointless. But it’s OK, I have tough skin. And petty revenge…

Dick is the only one here that uses the ice in the bin that the freezer makes. Most of us are pretty happy with the ice cold filtered water that’s readily available and don’t need ice.  For the past few days, I’ve been sticking frozen green beans in the very front of the bin where he can’t see. This makes pretty much all of the ice in the bin taste and smell like green beans (You’d never know the power of a green bean until it’s in your water supply).

 I’ve heard him complain about the green bean flavor several times now and yet he can never find it because I'm always really careful to take the green bean out before his usual refill times. Today he went postal and took apart the whole freezer looking for green beans- and even threw the ice bin in the dishwasher. He just replaced the ice bin and turned the ice maker back on… Better go replace the green bean… heheheh.

Update: He's called maintenance in our office building because ""There's something that smells like vegetables in the water"". I considered intercepting the maintenance man to let him in on the joke but he'd probably tell him. Thoughts? Suggestions?

Update 5/17/13: A coworker just used a bunch of ice after bashing his knee into a plotter. The green bean turned up and luckily, I interfered before he could run to Dick's office to ""solve the mystery"".

FredFltStn,51,,343,1qou04,,975,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**FREE STUFF -** I'm convinced that reddit is the best community on the net, and I'm trying to kick start Christmas by giving away free T-Shirts from my company. When you're done with this story, please read [this post](http://redd.it/1qn3fi) to find out how you can help out a child for Christmas and get a free shirt.


**STORY:**  In Florida, we get our fair share of rain, especially in the summer. During light showers, it’s business as usual, but when the wind and the rain really pick up, we batten down the hatches. We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped on.

One afternoon, we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind, rain, and lightning. It really came up on us fast, and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time. I grabbed all of my help, and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruined.

We managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage. We did however get totally soaked. 

while all of this was going on, my cashier was still ringing out customers, and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent. No offense, but in a lighting storm, **I** don’t even want to be in a tent in a parking lot.

Of course, that’s about the time we lost power. It was early afternoon, so we didn’t really need lights inside of the tent, and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), so they don’t cut out every time the power fails. 

My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door. About 30 minutes later, the power still hasn’t come back on, it’s still pouring outside, and the UPS’s give up the ghost and run out of juice.

Not a problem. I was a boy scout, and I have a backup plan for my backup plan. My parents RV has a generator, so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to. It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that, so I can’t just flip a switch and make it happen. but it's doable.

My dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch. While I’m out in the storm, one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tent.

At my counter, screaming at my cashier is uber bitch (UB). She’s pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase, just because the registers are dead. My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly, and they would ring her up as soon as possible, but UB didn’t want to hear about it.

This particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point, and her father is one of my best friends. She’d actually graduated high school, and was home from college on summer break, working for me. I always joke with her that she’s the boss, and I’m just there to do her bidding.

My cashier is keeping her cool, but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation. UB demands to check out **NOW**, because she has somewhere that she needs to be, and I need to take care of it.

I’m soaked to the bone, and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent, so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that. She actually had a pretty big purchase, and when I told her the total, she didn’t believe it. She wanted to see my phone to verify. She then went down the list of stuff, at least 30 items, and questioned each price. 

When she was doing this, she actually found a mistake I had made. I had entered in an item as $9.95 when it should have been $19.95. The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phone.

You should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her. I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her, and then gave her the new HIGHER total. I should mention that the entire time, there’s a crowd of people around watching the scene, and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happened.

When I told her the new total, she lost her GD mind. She started screaming at me that it was my fault, and that she shouldn’t have to pay for my mistake. In fact, she should get a discount for having to wait so long. I let her yell for a good two or three minutes, just standing there expressionless.

I’m tired, I’m soaked to the bone, and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch. I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf, then I turned to uber bitch and told her, “You’re going to need to go somewhere else, because you’re not allowed to shop here anymore.”

I turned to my cashier, in front of the customer, and told her, “Don’t sell that bitch anything.”

She left, screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rain.

**ONE YEAR LATER**


The same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent. It’s the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before, and she’s shopping with three or four other people. To be honest, even after seeing the lady, I didn’t place her face. If my cashier wouldn’t have recognized her, I’d have never noticed she was there.

**CASHIER:** What would you like me to do?

**ME:** It’s up to you. You’re the boss.

The lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout. When UB got to the register, my petite 20 year old female cashier stood her gound, looked her dead in the eye, and told her, “I’m sorry, you may have forgotten, but you’re not allowed to shop here.”

Stone. Cold. Baby.

The lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word. I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group. In the end, one of the people in the group paid for the stuff, and they walked out confused as hell.

convenientalias,53,,190,1efq2b,,970,"Well, I was in high school at the time. The girl was one of those obnoxious sorts of people that become more and more difficult to like with every time she opened her mouth. And unfortunately, she never shut up. This girl was constantly rattling off how bitches need to stop giving her attitude, because she don't take shit from no one, and other, similar phrases. And she was LOUD.

So one day, the teacher forgets something from out of the textbook, and so this shy Asian boy, who probably spoke up twice altogether throughout the whole semester, raises his hand and tells the teacher what he had forgotten.

And of course, the girl has something to say.

""OH MY GOD, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH A SMART-ASS? THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS!""
She'd given me a lot of attitude, because I sat right by her and she gives EVERYONE attitude, but that was far enough to where I felt obligated to do something.
Naturally, this girl also went to the bathroom to text all the time, claiming ""girl emergencies"" at least once a week, but of course, that excuse works every time, because a male teacher has to let her go, on the off chance that she's actually not lying. And then she'd come back and whisper Facebook drama to the girl beside her. Go figure.

I guess her period excuse was why it dawned on me that I was holding a red pen, and I got kind of inventive. While she was out in the bathroom, I took my red pen apart and tried to extract some ink. I couldn't make it happen, so I took a piece of lead from a mechanical pencil, dipped it in so that thick, goopy red ink stuck to it, and I broke off the wet part of the lead and tossed it onto her chair.
She came back and sat right on it, and it took all the willpower I had not to burst out laughing until the bell rang. It had smeared beautifully all over her white pants, right around the crotch, yet she walked out completely unaware. My life felt complete.

I knew the owner of the club, and some of the guards, so I told a guard that I thought he might be dealing drugs in the bathrooms to get him thrown out. Little did I know that he was selling drugs in the bathrooms, and things get a bit out of hand.

The guards check it out, and realize that he is selling drugs, so they try to stop him. He punches one guard and locks himself in one of the stalls (and even though he is in the bathroom he does not think of flushing the drugs).

The police comes and while arresting him, he breaks one of their noses. He was charged and convicted of aggravated assault, assaulting a public official, resisting arrest, selling cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and weed.

-not-that-guy-,105,,204,18tsj0,,968,"My first post in r/pettyrevenge, sorry about the wall of text…

My 4 year old daughter was invited to a birthday party for one of her little friends that just turned 5.  The party was hosted at an amusement center that has multiple bounce houses and other large inflatable slides and obstacle courses.  Parents are encouraged to partake in the activities with their children so you can help them if needed.  As a father that is very involved with my daughter and her activities I played in the bounce houses with her.

There was this one girl, I believe a cousin of the birthday girl, that was about 7 years old, I will refer to her as QB (Queen Brat).  QB had the attitude that if you didn’t do things her way, it was the wrong way.  Being that she was one of the older kids there she tried to get all the younger girls to follow her and do what she wanted to do.  Now imagine her displeasure when a bunch of 4 and 5 year olds don’t want to listen to her and do what they want.  QB immediately started acting out and being a general pain.  If she was going up a ladder to a slide, she would stop in the middle of the ladder and not let any of the other kids pass.  Seeing her actions, and me not being one to make a scene with a small child, I simply told my daughter to play somewhere that QB wasn’t currently causing problems. 

All was well until we were moved to another room with different bounce houses and activities.  As the kids are playing, I notice QB is laying in one of the bounce houses by herself.  The look on her face was that of utter defiance as she refused to play with any of the other kids because they would not listen to her and follow her.  Unfortunately  this was the bounce house that my daughter wanted to play in, so to make sure nothing went wrong, I entered the bounce house with my daughter.  We started jumping and kicking some small soft balls around and the following conversation between me and QB occurred.

(Try to read QB’s side with an entitled attitude.  Try to read mine with a calm, caring, monotone father)
QB: STOP JUMPING! I am trying to just lay here and rest…
Me: This is a bounce house and its meant to be jumped in.
QB: But I am trying to lay her by myself!
Me: Sorry, we came here to play and we are going to play.
QB: THIS is the ONLY place for me to lay down!
Me: Go lay on the floor.

We continued jumping and playing with the balls that were in the bounce house and QB would try to grab and hold onto the balls to keep us playing with them.  This continued for maybe only 5 more minutes when my daughter wanted to move to another activity.  She started for the exit and QB decided that she wanted to exit first and pushed my daughter out of the way.  Before this, I was only slightly perturbed by QB, now she pissed me off… How could I get some petty revenge on this little demon child?  I didn’t have to wait long…

There was a small arcade machine in the corner of the room called the CYCLONE.  The cost of said machine was $2. You then stand inside said machine and close the circular door and then the machine creates a vortex of wind that supposedly simulates a cyclone.  There is even a wind speed indicator that tells you how fast the wind is blowing.  QB see this machine and starts playing with it, however she has no $.  I see her out of the corner of my eye asking her grandma if she would pay for it, but grandma refused. That’s when I called my daughter over and pointed to the machine and asked her if she would like to try it…

Take that QB, hope you enjoyed watching my daughter in the CYCLONE with a huge smile on her face…

VigilantInfidel,139,,184,15w3ia,,973,"**Background info:** I work security for this business research campus. The campus is closed overnight so droparms come down at every entrance and the only way to gain access to campus is by swiping your ID badge at these roadside pedestals near the gatehouses.

For the first hour of my early morning shift, these droparms are still down and all employees are required to badge in no matter what, but as entitled as everyone is who works here, they all try to tailgate the first guy who badges in so they don't have to swipe their cards. I can't do anything about that. Worst still are the people who don't even stop at the pedestal; they drive right up to the closed droparms, expecting me to open it for them.

**Petty revenge #1:** So I just stopped opening it for them. I let them sit there as long as they want, waiting for me to let them in. I used to wait about twenty seconds (an eternity itself in traffic time) before walking all the way out there to their cars to talk to them. But now that it's cold I'll just wait inside my warm shack until they reverse back up to me.

Inevitably, I have some variation on this conversation with tools like that:

*Spoiled Adult:* ""Hey! Aren't you going to let me in?""

*Me:* ""Oh, I'm sorry. The signs clearly state that all visitors must check in here before I can allow them onto campus.""

*Spoiled Adult:* ""I'm not a visitor! I'm an employee! Don't you recognize me?"" (Note: I usually do recognize them but I've learned that nothing pisses off self-righteous people more than not acknowledging their status.)

*Me:* ""Sorry, but I don't. There are over 8,000 people who work on this campus alone. Anyway, all employees are required to badge in before 7am. If this is your first day, I'd be happy to direct you to the Photo ID Office."" (If they hate not being recognized as an employee, being called a ""dumb newbie"" is even worse to their egos.)

*Spoiled Adult:* ""It's not my first day!! I've worked here for over 20 years! I come through your gate all the time!""

*Me:* ""Good, so then you have no excuse for not already being familiar with the security policy. Now if you'll go ahead and swipe your badge, you've been holding up the queue and I need to get it moving again.""

*Spoiled Adult:* [indignant scoffing and/or obscenities, but eventual compliance.]

Even if there does start to become a line, no one ever gets mad at *me*; the other drivers get pissed at the guy who thinks he's so important that he gets to waste everyone else's time. I have to admit, there's a certain bit of schadenfreude in seeing a grown-ass man driving a Porsche being scolded like a child.

**Petty revenge #2:** This happened the other day. One particular obscenely overweight female employee is always difficult to security and yesterday she kept speeding around campus and tailgating people -- though campus police can't do anything about it unless they catch her themselves. I tried to stop her whenever she came through my gate but she ignored me each time and I have no real authority to do anything else about it. Then, right before the lunch rush started, I saw her tailgating another employee really closely down the long road that led up to my gate. The first driver stopped at my gatehouse to complain about it:

*Employee:* ""Hey, can you say something to the woman behind me? She's been riding my ass all the way down [the main street] and then down [the side street]!""

*Me:* (I look back and see the tailgater has hot take-out food in her passenger seat and is obviously in a hurry to get back to her office to eat it. I look back at the employee and notice he has his daughter in the backseat.) ""You know, I've been trying to stop her all day because she's been doing the same thing to everybody. She refuses to stop and I honestly don't have the authority to do anything about it except write down her license plate.""

*Employee:* ""Really? Well damn.. (Suddenly he seems to get an idea.) Hey, is there anybody behind her?""

I tell him no and I smile as I realize what he's probably about to do. He turns to his daughter and asks her to tell me about *every single toy* she got for Christmas over the break, which she does excitedly and in great detail. And then she goes on to excitedly tell me about what they all did for the New Year's holiday.

Meanwhile the tailgater is fuming inside her car behind them and tries to honk her horn. I give her the hand signal for ""hold on"" and go back to listening to the little girl. Eventually Tubby McLeadfoot gets fed up and does a U-turn to go in one of the other campus gates. As soon as she's gone and the girl finished her story, I thanked the father profusely and they drove merrily along onto campus.

TL;DR: Street justice got served, fool. *Twice.*

thinstatic,90,,255,1lvs0x,,963,"So, I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but my fiancée is. I enjoy the movies, they're good enough on their own, and I didn't mind going to see them with my gf. However, we went to midnight openings for the last couple of movies - if you've gone to one, you know where this winds up - kids. Late at night, hyped up on sugar, caffeine, and life-high. Yeah, it's part of the experience, and yeah, there are always a few obnoxious ones in the crowd; Most times, you can overlook it. Kids are kids, and it is a midnight showing of HP, after all.

However, going to see the final movie, there was one kid in particular, just the worst person imaginable at a movie theater. He was probably 14-15 years old, the loudest, biggest, most yell-at-the-top-of-my-voice, attention-grabbingest kid I've seen in a long time. So obnoxious, his friends looked embarrassed around him.

Anyway, doors open, we all move in, get snacks, get seats, and watch the movie. From the first lights out, kid gets out his ipod and starts playing angry birds. With the sound ~ 1/4, 1/3 or so. Not loud, but enough so that the ten or so people around him can hear it, and be distracted by it - including myself, sitting right in front of him. I asked him to turn it off, cool, he put it away.

And got it out again less than a minute later. Asked him to put it away, he did. For another few seconds.

This went on for about fifteen mins, with other people getting pissed off, probably five or six people upset and asking him to cut the crap. I finally left the theater, asked the manager to do something about it; They sent ushers to walk the aisles and make a presence, but he hid the ipod until they left, then right back out it came.

An hour into the movie, he finally gets tired of us all yelling at him, and puts it away for good. After the movie is ruined for a bunch of people - the distraction had made us miss a lot.

Revenge: Right after the movie, after draining two 32 oz sodas, I saw him head for the bathroom, ipod in hand. I waited a few secs, then followed. Sure enough, he was standing at a stall, playing ipod while takin a piss. I 'accidentally' bumped him, knocked his ipod into a urinal full of his own piss.

He spent a while trying to decide whether it was worth it to get it back out, and I saw him as we were lined up to drive away, trying to get it to turn on again. I don't think it did.

ThePepperBoy,118,,346,1acb0b,,959,"I like to go on Omegle sometimes when it's late and I don't feel like sleeping to have conversations with people. For those of you who've done it before, you're familiar with 90% of it being full of horny assholes who are only out to find girls who will give them pictures of their tits.

I set one of my interests to what is known to be a pretty girly show which we'll call ShowX. (I'm an 18 year old guy, but love the show) 

Anyway, right away this stranger says ""heyy asl pls?"". I sigh but I give it to him and of course he disconnects right away.

Several minutes later after a few more failed conversations I get another person who likes ShowX. First words they type are ""heyy asl pls?"" Now I'm starting to get ticked off. He's obviously using this show as a way to find girls. 

I decide to play along and tell him I'm a girl from the US, age 19 and big surprise! He doesn't disconnect. Perfect. I ended up spending 15-20 minutes flirting with this guy and leading him on until he asked to video chat. 

*It was time to mess this fucker up*

I signed up for a new account quickly, launched it and added him. I'm a pretty skinny guy, not a lot of muscle or fat from years of swimming, so I decided to use that to my advantage. I got one of my old Speedos and made a makeshift thong. I focused the camera on above my knees and below my shoulders, requested the cam and then spun away from him.

For a little over five minutes I was shaking my ass at him to which I'm pretty sure he was jacking off to judging by the sounds he was making, before I finally spun around and showed him what I really was.

JesusSwallows,108,,139,1443ky,,961,"This is my mom's story. She's been a flight attendant for almost 35 years now and has earned numerous accolades from her airline and high-level frequent fliers for her phenomenal service. I've never met anyone who works harder or who loves his/her job more.

She is an extremely patient person as well, and can usually diffuse a tough situation and calm folks down (her thinking being hey, everyone just wants to take off and get to Boston/Anchorage/Honolulu on time). Technically, however, post-9/11 the FAA granted flight attendants a lot more jurisdiction over whether P.A.L.D.s (Passengers Acting Like Dicks) fly or not. My mom hardly ever exercises this authority (certainly not as much as other flight attendants), but the douche canoe in this story earned it.

My mom was working her favorite trip - Portland to Maui - and was greeting passengers on a Thursday morning flight boarding in PDX. The airline had recently begun flying to Hawaii, so things were festive (Hawaiian music playing, free Mai Tais, even new Hawaii-themed uniforms for the flight crew). Everyone was in a great mood, passengers and crew, until this guy boards.

He's immediately rude, loud, crude, and obviously drunk off his ass. Behind him is his exasperated young wife, towing a horse-sized diaper bag and their two young, tired-looking kids. The guy remarks to my mom ""You gonna get those drinks comin', hun?"" and laughs like a loon as soon as he steps foot on the plane.

Once they get seated (the guy refuses to sit down or help his wife get their two kids situated), this guy will not shut up. He begins calling friend after friend and has the ""Yo bro, guess where I am right now?"" conversation with each, complete with LOUD profanity. There are a lot of families and young children on this flight, including his own.

All his antics so far are annoying, yet no reason to kick him off the plane. That comes when the guy refuses to put away his phone, meaning my mom can't close the door, meaning a delay, meaning less time my mom has on the ground in Maui to snorkel (this bitch LOVES her some snorkeling). Another flight attendant had asked him politely three times, the third request receiving a ""Jesus, calm the fuck down!""

Oh heeeeeelllll no. My mom PAs the crew in the back galley saying she's booting him. This guy will only get drunker, and any aggression towards flight crew is not fucking tolerated. She prepares to go into the cockpit to get approval from the pilot to deplane the guy. Pilots can be notoriously uncaring about what happens behind the cockpit door -- ""just take care of it"" is a common response to complaints -- so my mom was prepared to have to argue her case.

But she remembers this flight's captain is Steve, a seasoned pilot who's flown with my mom for 30+ years and has always been famously protective of his flight crews (he always buys dinner for the crew at the hotel, he gives my mom a Christmas present every year, and his connections in Seattle helped me get my first job). Awesome guy who won't let anyone do anything to ""his girls"" -- and says so again to my mom. She heads back to deal with Asshat McGee.

She informs him, simply and quietly, that his behavior has thus far been unacceptable, that the captain has deemed him a security risk, and that he must deplane. This guy naturally goes apeshit, screaming things like ""So you're gonna ruin my kids' vacation? What the FUCK!"" My mom maintains her composure and tells him that the airline will book him on the next flight, provided he deplanes peacefully (without security) and sobers up.

The guy continues his tirade, when my mom sees his now crying wife starting to pack up the toys around her kids who had finally calmed down. Seeing the distraught look on her face, she tells her, ""Ma'am, there is no need for you or your children to deplane. Your husband can meet you in Maui if he takes this evening's flight."" The wife looks a bit torn for a second, then turns on her husband with a look of pure ice. ""Don't ruin this.""

My mom's been divorced, so she and plenty other women know that look. They also know that the ""this"" could mean anything from that flight to their entire marriage. My mom also lives fully to the mantra ""Don't you dare fuck shit over for your wife."" Whatever it was, it worked; the guy grabbed his carry-on, muttered ""Man, this is bullshit"", but deplaned. They were able to take off only 10 minutes behind schedule.

While the kids cried a bit at their dad leaving, they soon settled down. My mom ended up talking to that woman quite a bit, and comped meals for her and the kids. The wife was embarrassed and extremely apologetic, but the flight crew and even neighboring passengers consoled her. My mom gave the woman a bottle of wine from first class when they landed.

A few weeks later, my mom got a call from her supervisor. Two separate high-level frequent fliers on that flight had written to the airline commending her for how she handled the situation. My mom got a congratulatory letter from corporate and a small bonus (almost unheard of for flight attendants nowadays).

TL;DR my mom kicked a guy off a plane for being a doucher.

Sorry for writing a novel. I could have shortened this, but I like to narrate. I've got loads more PettyRevenge stories from my mom's years of flying if people are interested.

**Edit:** Thank you all so much for your feedback! I'm glad you enjoyed the read, even if it was a long one (nothing irks me more on reddit than 2000-word submissions that could have been written in 200 words or fewer). My mom truly is a phenomenal flight attendant, woman, and mother; this is only the tip of the iceberg. I have many more actual petty-revenge stories from her years of flying; I'll post them as comments in a separate post (thanks for the suggestion, /u/PigletChops!).

Also, shameless plug - please remember to do as the frequent fliers in this story did and **commend exemplary service you receive from airline staff to the airline** -- not just flight attendants, but gate and ticket agents as well!

NukeDarfur,93,,188,19ifue,,959,"I used to work the night shift at a hotel in a tourist area.  During the summer, every hotel in town would sell out every weekend.  Even the crappy roach motels would fill every room, usually with poor bastards who didn't realize that the rooms at the decent places needed to be booked far in advance.

Inevitably, every weekend we would get dozens of people showing up without a reservation assuming we would have rooms available.  When we informed them that we were sold out the reactions would range from ""Okay, thanks"" to the ass clowns who said something to the effect of ""You're going to have to do something, because I need a room.""  

The latter reaction is the one that always really pissed us off, not just because they were rude, but also because they were stupid.  Were they not aware that we are in the business of renting rooms to people?  That this is how the business makes money?  We didn't have some secret wing of the hotel that was only available to the people who really insisted.  We had X number of rooms, and once those rooms were spoken for, we were out of rooms to sell.  Seemed simple enough to me.

Anyway, the one night I'm working the night shift and this car pulls up under our canopy.  These four young guys who looked straight out of the frat club come stumbling in obviously hammered.  They tell me they need a room, and I tell them, sorry, we're sold out tonight.  Instantly the one guy jumps in with ""That's not going to work.  We need a room, and you're going to have to figure something out.""  I simply replied in my most assertive tone ""Look, I don't have any rooms, but two miles down the road is a Sheraton, and I know for a fact they have plenty of rooms left.""  They considered it for a moment, and turned around and left.

There wasn't a Sheraton two miles down the road, but thanks to what some of my later check ins who had driven the same route told me, there was a DUI checkpoint.",One of my prouder moments.,1147,pettyrevenge

TheLostCaterpillar,120,,184,1azisq,,957,"So my Aunt is one of those really ""fancy"" people. Her apartment is somewhat bland and smells like a boring vanilla candle and is full of cabinets of fine china that she never uses. (hopefully that paints a good enough picture). 

All my life I was told by my aunt that she was a judge. Just recently I found out that she isn't a judge, but rather only works in the courtroom/legal process (which is totally fine!). My parents have never called her out on it because other than work she doesn't have a significant other, child, etc. 

Recently my college football team made it into the orange bowl. I go to NIU, which isn't the best school out there but there is nothing wrong with it. You can get a great degree there. At a family event she was talking to me in a group of people and decided to throw out ""Well at least you finally have a reason to be proud to go to NIU!"" 

I was livid. Who does she think she is, knocking my education like that? It's not like she is a genius in any regard. 

My sisters boyfriend was at the event and so I went to him and asked him to grill her about her judge position. It would seem more natural coming from him as he doesn't know her yet. 

In front of some of her friends and some of my family he went at it, asking her about her degree, where she went to school, what she does everyday, etc. 

Finally after dancing around his questions only to be met with persistent ""curiosity"", she had to admit ""Well I'm not actually a judge, I don't have a law degree per-se...""

50andcankick,37,,174,19zbtk,,947,"This is a petty revenge from a job I had back in 1976 (15-16 yrs old). I was a chef's helper in a fine dining restaurant. Our chef had quit and some guy (Willy) who fancied himself a chef was hired to replace him. It was obvious from the first day of work that this guy did not know what he was doing. 

It was an insanely busy night. I was in the kitchen, putting up bowls of salad, prepping garlic bread, doing prep work etc. and Willy comes racing into the kitchen, realizing he hadn't prepared the prime rib for the evening's menu. He shoves the roast into the oven and asks me what temperature setting to turn it to (whaaaa?!?).  He is fumbling with the wrong dials and actually turning the oven on to broil.

I spent a few months tweaking recipes I found online until I felt I had unlocked maximum deliciousness. I bake quite a bit, but the carrot cake is sort of my specialty and I sell it to a couple of local restaurants every so often. My coworkers, especially my boss, are crazy for it.

I work in a small private language academy. My boss is a bit of a psychotic control-freak and one day, in a move to enact some petty revenge of her own, she locked the door to the copy room and hid the key in her office. This was to punish all the teachers for leaving the door open between classes, which I guess bothers her because she is afraid students will go inside the staff room and mess with the photocopier and/or other things we use for class. Never mind that this childish behaviour affects the students more than us by depriving them of class materials.

SpacedCowb0y,88,,169,18514s,,944,"This isn't my story, it's my dad's.

My dad has been renting a room from his work friend, Kurt, for nearly two years now. Kurt is married, but until recently his wife lived in another city. They weren't technically separated, but weren't together anymore either. She is CRAZY.

One day this woman showed up on their door step in a ""Honey, I'm home!!"" fashion, and moved right on in. This was two weeks ago and since then she has made a consistent effort to make my dad and David, the other roommate, feel unwelcome. She even told my dad that she and Kurt were trying to have a baby! My dad congratulated Kurt, who obviously hadn't heard the great news just yet. HA!

She walks around saying things like ""Are you gonna clean that up?"" and ""Is that the way you found that?"" and sighing and ugh-ing and generally being a pain in the ass. She even told them that she didn't want to hear their alarms in the morning because she doesn't have anywhere to be and therefore doesn't want to be disturbed. THEN she posted notes on my dad's and David's doors listing the new HOUSE RULES. By then they'd had enough of her shit. Here's where it gets petty:

**#1**
One of the rules on her list was that the bathroom doors must remain shut at all times. Even when the bathrooms are unoccupied, the doors need to be closed.
My dad takes it upon himself to open the bathroom door whenever he possibly can. He sees a closed door, he opens that shit.

**#2**
another rule of hers was that my dad and David had to take all their belongings out of the common areas and store it in their bedrooms. What she didn't know was that nearly ALL the furniture belonged to my dad and David. The only things Kurt owned were the dishes in the kitchen and a recliner in the living room. My dad and David have now moved all THEIR stuff into their rooms, leaving her with nothing but a recliner and some cookware.

**#3**
She uses the internet/watches cable constantly. All day. The internet and cable TV that MY DAD pays for. He decided, while moving his belongings, to change the WiFi password and move the cable box to his room. MUAHAHA!

**TLDR;** My dad's roommate's crazy wife moves in and starts all kinds of shit, he gives it right back in the most petty, most satisfying way.

UPDATE # 1:  Dad came home last night. (He works in another city, hence the renting, but he still lives with us on the weekends.)  He said crazy bitch is acting like none of it happened, and discussing taking a Skiing trip with Kurt.  Dave has started looking for a house to rent, and Dad is probably going to move in with him if the twat doesn't go soon.  Kurt says he's AFRAID OF HER, since this has happened before and HE LANDED IN JAIL before she left.  Apparently things got somewhat violent.

This night was a ""hate"" night from the outset: I wasn't in a good mood, wasn't getting a good vibe from the music, had just spent 20 minutes queuing to check my jacket, and had immediately lost all of my friends in their pursuits of various girls. Not the recipe for my ideal night. To top it all off, I somehow managed to find myself continuously next to or near a group of three obnoxious, over-entitled girls, of whom on was particularly drunk.

After an hour or so I decided to cut my losses and leave, and found myself in the (now 40 minute) coat queue with these wonderful ladies just behind me. At first, they made a not-so-subtle attempt to skip straight past me in the line, but this was blocked with some careful manoeuvring of my substantial bulk. A short while later, I noticed that the particularly drunk member of this coven was using me as a convenient leaning post while she texted somebody on her phone. Willing to accept that sometimes we do things subconsciously whilst inebriated, I turned to her and politely asked if she would mind not leaning on me, on account of my bad back. This request was met with a savage ""Fuck OFF!"", followed quickly by a yelped chorus of ""Yeah, fuck off!"" from her harpy brethren. Being already disgruntled, I was rather put out by this unsportsmanlike behaviour.

So the next time I felt her lean forward for a moment to talk to her friends, I took a step forwards and enjoyed the anticipation of what was sure to happen when she tried to lean back again. She hit the floor, I tried to hold a straight face long enough to establish she was uninjured bar a bruise and a damaged ego, and then I enjoyed the rest of the jacket queue, quietly chuckling to myself all the way.

TL;DR - Bitch hit the floor.

AnneArchy713,45,,267,1npa5y,,942,"I took my daughter to the store tonight, and as usual, we visited the toy aisle. I was making my way towards the princess dolls when I came to an opening in the aisle and noticed there was another cart coming. So, like any decent person, I stopped and let the other woman pushing her cart through. She saw me move out of her way, but she didn't acknowledge me. 
Whatever, she was rude, but I'll survive. 
I followed her down the aisle and she stops right in front of the display where my daughter wanted to look. But she pushed her cart over what part her girth didn't already cover. My daughter and I waited patiently for her to move her ass and we talked about the dolls for a few minutes.
When she still hadn't moved and my daughter was getting impatient, we just walked to the next aisle. We stood there while my daughter was ooing and aweing over the McStuffins toys. She kept hugging the one doll she already owns, but, as we were getting ready to continue on down the aisle, here comes wide load and her trusty cart. So I position myself just as she had done in the previous aisle. My daughter in the cart hugging the lamb doll covering most of the grounds and me to the side covering this lady's target. She kept making remarks about the things right in front of me, and I kept talking to my daughter about the lamb. She waited and waited and I stood there and stood there. Finally she gave up and moved along. I moved along too, but with a little bit of petty satisfaction warming my little heart. ",So you won't let my daughter look at the princesses?,1209,pettyrevenge
bluescrew,227,,385,19pbnd,,945,"This happened in 1998.

I was 17 and dated a 19-year-old, ""Josh,"" for a month. I was impressed because he had moved out of his mom's house, wore a suit to work (retail furniture) and drove a new truck. I was a complete virgin at this time but I read a lot of my mom's romance novels. We would make out standing behind his truck in my mom's driveway. He was the first person to go up my shirt.

One day he came over and asked me to sit on the front porch with him. I was excited to see him because I'd been grounded for sneaking out to meet him so he'd been going to the pool hall without me the past few nights. He asked if I knew someone named ""Lisa"" with long dark hair. I mentally went through everyone in my class. No Lisa. He kept asking me if I knew this chick. Finally he said he had met a girl named Lisa who knew me. She told him I was a super slut. He had already had his suspicions that I wasn't what I claimed to be because I was ""too good"" at making out to be a virgin. This only confirmed it. He also believed I was lying when I said I didn't know her. He did not want to be with me anymore. He took his garish class ring back and drove off in his truck. I cried for hours. Not because of losing him, but because this was the first I had ever heard of someone going behind my back and calling me a slut and I felt completely blindsided and betrayed. (I know, I got lucky that it didn't happen until 17. I was an early bloomer physically but a really late one socially.)

The next day I was still thinking about it, of course. It finally hit me. Lisa. The chick with long dark hair from my church youth group who dropped acid in the bathroom at my 15th birthday sleepover. I hadn't really invited her over much after that. In fact I hadn't talked to her in two years. We were two grades apart at school (she was younger) and never saw each other. That's why I couldn't figure out who she was when he mentioned it.

*(Side note: Over the next couple months Josh noticed my little sister working at the movie theater at the mall. The way it's set up, she sat at the front desk in a big picture window right by the curb. He started driving by a lot. And staring. And coming in to talk to her a lot while he was ""just hanging out at the mall."" He never asked her out because she had a boyfriend, but through her I learned how he was doing in general (besides stalking my little sister). Details to follow.)*

Three months after the breakup I had an awesome new boyfriend. One night our plans got canceled and we went to the pool hall where I had hung out with Josh. I didn't see his shiny truck outside though, so I knew we were safe to go in.

We weren't safe. Josh was there.

Worse, he saw me and kept trying to get me to look at him and beckoning me over with a finger. I finally told my boyfriend and friend that I would be just a minute and walked across the room to see what he wanted.

He wanted to apologize. To say he should have believed me. To say he's found out since then ""what kind of person"" Lisa is. To ask me to take him back.

I waited out his spiel. Calmly perched my fantastic ass on the edge of his pool table while he was talking. Finally he ran out of steam and I looked him in the eyes.

""It's okay, Josh,"" I said. Waited a beat. ""Because I'm not a virgin anymore.""

I pushed off, walked back across the room to my new boyfriend, and gave him a nice sloppy kiss. Josh never tried to talk to me again.

**Epilogue**

Here is what my sister told me later about him:

He had lost his job and was now working at McDonald's.

He had had to move back in with his parents.

He had had to give the truck to his uncle who took over the payments.

He still dated high school girls because no one older was gullible enough.

And here is what I have found out by accident about Lisa:

She shows up in the city paper's Most Wanted section from time to time for drug dealing, prostitution and failure to show up in court.

I've been with ""new boyfriend"" for 14 years now. We're married.

**Edit:** Wow, I didn't realize how many details I would be able to drudge up from my memory about this by posting the story and answering all the questions. I just now remembered ""Josh's"" last name, which I think is my cue to call it a day.","Dude who dumped me for ""lying""",1330,pettyrevenge
QA_Avenger,77,,256,1i7zwc,,939,"This, dear Reddit, is is a story of justice. A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments. &amp;nbsp;

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it.   
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. To make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. After all, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus:  
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche, its Derp at &lt;Company&gt;. Just calling abou...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;Company&gt;. Hows it going?  
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously MY fault.  
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well, no. You'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look, you're supposed to follow the specification I'VE written, so just do it! I don't want to hear about this again until its done!  
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (He can read minds?!?) I then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction.   
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. They've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. Because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, Greg from CS calls me up says he's got an issue with Douche. Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be. This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah, I did the verification process on it. What do you want to know?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah, that's what I thought when I read the documentation. Ok, leave it with me and I'll let Douche know.  
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long, Steve (the account manager for Douche) storms into QA and straight into Boss' office. There's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually I'm called in.   
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp, what did the specification say about this?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. On the way back, I see Boss trying to calm Steve down.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then, this is an API that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve, You might want to look at section 21 on that document.  
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK, wait there.  
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in Acceptance Testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
***The Prestige:***  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued, I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone, explaining to Steve what needs to be done.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve, I have Derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is?  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp, we really need to get this sorted. You worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. We're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday. We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here.  
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp, seriously, you HAVE to help me out here.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, Steve lets me go back to my desk.
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;, Derp spea...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I need you to do this.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I'm sorry, just help me out.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The End:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So, Derp, this is Herp. Another project manager for &lt;Client_Name&gt;.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.  
  
Tl;DR: Douche PM for client writes Spec for API. SPROC logic makes no sense, PM thinks he's infallible. QA Tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. Client doesn't test the API, signs it off anyway. It hits the fan, release date is ruined. PM is in DEEP and pleads for help.

encaseme,147,,206,199h8t,,943,"This happened a few years ago, but I still think back on it fondly.

I was driving into the city (it's a small city) on a two-lane road in the shopping area, so there's 3 lanes at stop lights, with the left most being left-turn only. I was in the left lane approximately a quarter mile from a stop light, driving quickly (this was a few years ago, I was still in that 'drives too fast' stage younger folks go through). There's very little traffic on the road, but one car behind me. 

The car behind me didn't seem any out of the ordinary, it was a few car lengths behind me; but suddenly it is passing me on the right side, then sharply cuts across the front of me to get into the far-left turning lane before the light, causing me to stab my brakes. I was just thinking ""WTF is with this guy"" to myself, wondering why they couldn't have just waited the extra 2 seconds to get into the turning lane behind me? The light at the intersection is red, so we're pulled up next to each other. I realize that there is a woman in the idiot-car with all the windows down yelling at me, so I roll down my window, she's saying ""What do you think you're doing, little boy?"" Which makes me laugh because I was in my early-20s, and she was probably in her late-30s, maybe early 40s, and I had no idea what perceived injustice I had inflicted on her. She starts ranting and raving with all kinds of ridiculous language; when I notice a quiet little boy in a car seat in the back of her car, he has a book and glasses, and seems to be ignoring the woman's outburst. I say loudly:

""HEY KID"" and he looks up at me, ""Your mother is an idiot, you don't have to listen to her anymore!"" The woman gets this SHOCKED look on her face, and just makes flabbergasted noises, then shrieks at me like a banshee, and turns left on a red arrow.

I live in Los Angeles, CA and work comes from over a hundred cities, from Oxnard to San Diego.

I get there around 7:30 so I wait the 30 minutes before I begin working and start at 8 o'clock sharp. 10 minutes later one of the houses neighbors interrupts me and says, ""good job, you managed to wake everyone up in my house"". I apologize for the inconvenience, completely understandable that its a Saturday and people just want to sleep, but I've got a job/schedule to keep on.

It was a long trip with three connecting flights, the second of which was a layover in Philly. We stopped for a bathroom break in the airport (you know, as you do) and I noticed the girl ahead of me had left her purse in the stall. I called after her with little success, she was already gabbing away on the phone. I took a couple steps away from the stall and called her again, still no response. So I gave up my stall, despite the fact that I had to pee like a racehorse, and chased after her. I tapped her on the shoulder to tell her she'd left her purse. She turned around and before I could get a word out, gave me the finger. Now I understand that you're not always in your best mood in an airport but seriously? So you know what? No purse for her. I left that thing in the stall right where I found it, because fuck you too lady.

Edit: Wow, thanks guys :) Just to clarify (since GoldenDeLorean pointed it out) the reason I didn't do anything to the purse and just left it where it was, was because I'm only 90% sure that it was hers. I remember her going in with one and leaving without one but there's still a chance I could have been wrong and really fucked someone else over because of an error in judgement.

Jasper and Sammy are our two cats. They're Ragdoll cats and brothers. Jasper's a little scrawny and a bit more 'dominant' while Sammy's quite fat and an absolute wuss.

Earlier Sammy was having some dryfood as a snack. He was just sitting there, nomming away at the bowl of food, minding his own business. Jasper came along and decided he wanted some food too, so he just pushes Sammy out of the way and starts eating. After sitting there for a minute, Sammy gives up and goes to lay down.

Later that night, the cats had gone to bed. I had to go to the bathroom, so I went through the laundry to get there. The laundry is where the cats baskets/beds are. When I was done and was washing my hands, Jasper got out of his basket and jumped up onto the washing machine to try and get me to pat him. As I did, I saw Sammy quickly get out of his basket, steal Jaspers basket and bury his head into himself to look like he's fully asleep.

Jasper tried to force himself back into his basket, but since Sammy is so fat, he couldn't fit and had to make do with the other basket.

The guy we found to fill the empty room seemed alright at first, but it all went downhill fast.  It started with him eating our food.  All of it, and never buying any food to replace what he ate, or food of his we could eat in revenge.  Then he was late with rent, or didn't have it all.  Then came the borrowing money.  

Finally we had enough, searched around and found him an easy job and we took turns shuttling him to and from work to help him out.  Rent was still late, he still asked to borrow money, but atleast now he bought himself food so we didn't feel bad about him starving.  Great right?  Wrong.  

He never cleaned up the dishes from what he cooked.  He would use 5 pots and pans and leave everything on the stove until one of us got fed up and cleaned it.  He cooked a big ass meal and left it all then went home for fall break.  We took the pans and left them in his room, it smelled like hell when he got back, but he still didn't change.

I got the cell phone number that I currently have over 10 years ago. I used to live in the 941 area code and have since moved but kept my number the same because it was too much to go through and call 600 people and tell them that it changed (I'm in construction). Ever since, I've gotten phone calls for a tree service that has the exact same exchange and extension, but is from the 863 area code.

This guy must not have his area code on the sign on the side of his truck and must also do quite a bit of work in the 941 area code. I lliterally started receiving calls for him the day I turned my phone on and continue to this day to get at least two per week. At first, I would tell the caller that they had the wrong area code and give them the right one... then after I continued to receive his calls I started calling him and telling him every time I got a call for him.. I'm too damn polite I guess. At one point he even offered to pay me $5 for every call I forwarded to him. I never saw one red cent of that.

Anyway, after a couple of years of doing this, and watching my minutes on our plans get eaten up.. I decided, hell, I'll start referrring them to a friend of mine in that area who has a lawn service... and he will DEFINITELY pay me for it..

ProfessorBrainPenis,53,,212,1kinle,,925,"I live in Arizona where the summers are brutally hot. Here it is against the law for a restaurant to deny water to anyone, paying customer or not. This summer I was working as a student doing odd jobs that require walking around in the heat for a few hours at a time.  Usually I remember to bring a water bottle, but this particular day I left mine in the office. After walking around all morning I was parched.  I decided to stop at a Greek restaurant for a water cup before continuing my day. I walked in and noticed the woman who I assumed to be the hostess sitting at a nearby table.  I will now refer to her as Bitch Hostess, or BH for short. She looked up  at me when I walked in but made no attempt to get up. I then saw that she was on her cellphone.  

Now I am usually a very quiet person.  But that day it was 115 degrees out, I had been making deliveries and I was  thirsty as hell. I gave a small cough to try to get her attention, which she ignored. Then I said, ""uhm excuse me?"" To which she sighed loudly and looked up at me.  Our conversation was as follows:

BH: Yes, can I help you?

Me: Yeah, can I get a water cup please?

BH: We only serve paying customers, sorry.

Me, starting to get irritated: Okay.. Could I buy a water then?

BH slowly gets up and walks to the front counter where Ive been standing for a good five minutes now: Sure, we only carry waters to go in our imported glass bottles.  so itll be $4.50 plus tax.

At this point my fucking eyes nearly bulged out of my head.  I had eaten at this restaurant once previous, and I distinctly remember my server had put the rest of my drink in a styrofoam to-go cup, so I knew she was lying. This is when I thought of my revenge.

Me: On second thought, you know, Im kind of hungry. Could I get a table?

BH sighs and acts like Im asking a huge favor, not you know, to do her job.  She leads me to a table near the front and tells me my server will be right with me. Im overjoyed to see that I have a clear line of sight to where BH is sitting from where Im sitting, and I know she can see me too.

It takes a few moments for a serve to come by my table.  When she does, the first thing she asks is what I would like to drink.  I clear my throat and wait for BH to look up from her phone again.  When I know shes listening, I smile sweetly and ask my server for a water, please.  I can see BH's face shrink up a little. Her nostrils flare and I can tell she irritated.  I smile sweetly at her and wait for my drink.  When my sever returns with my water, I asked very sweetly if I could actually get it in a to-go cup, because Im really in a hurry.  My server happily complies and leaves to switch cups.  

BH is openly glaring at me now and I can not suppress my grin.  My server returns with my water, in a styrofoam to-go cup no less and leaves again to give me a chance to read over the menu.  I gather my things, and my goddamn water, leave a dollar on the table for the server and stand up. I walk to the door, turn around to BH and cheerfully say: Thank you for the water! Boy is it hot outside. 

The look on her face was priceless. She was fuming and her mouth wide open just staring at me as I walked out.  That water was the most refreshing drink I think Ive ever had. 

TL;DR: Bitchy hostess wont give me some water, I stab that bitch and fart on her grandson. 

-Sorry for any typos, Im on the mobile app-

EDIT! I'm a girl, so the smiling was extra vindictive. It was awesome to watch BH's face turn so red. Also, there apparently isn't a law that states you must give water! My bad guys! BH still sucks. ",Ill take a water please.,1137,pettyrevenge

My dad, like a lot of dads, is really into gadgets. One of the thingamajigs he carries around is this tiny but powerful flashlight. It's like the light from a regular flashlight concentrated into a little beam of death.

One night, the whole family is in the car. My little sister just got her driver's permit, so she's behind the wheel. Mom has shotgun, so Dad is in the back seat with me.

brodysho,148,,247,1dnrfz,,912,"**Backstory:** My neighbor and my family have had it out for each other since day one. He is a fat, lazy, arrogant son of a bitch who loves his lawn more than his own kids. Seriously, he mows the thing in those stupid little patterns and this shit is the greenest I've ever seen.

**The Wronging:** Between both of our property lines, this douchebag planted about 80 evergreen trees as a sort of fence. Well, my dog loved to shit right next to these trees for some reason (on our property of course). My neighbor would get pissed as hell and come onto *our* property and shovel the dog shit up and throw it farther into our yard. It was annoying, but not dickish enough to get a response from us. One day, this prick shoveled the dog shit, and threw it. Only this time, he threw it at our fucking *house*. It was splattered all over our tan siding and even in our driveway.

**Revenge:** That was the last straw. Knowing this motherfucker loved his lawn more than life itself, I exacted the perfect revenge. I snuck out one night and walked over into his lawn. His grass was sooo perfect that you could literally cut out a section with a knife and pull it up like carpet. Well, that's exactly what I did. With a friends help, we cut out a 25 X 25 foot square in the middle of his lawn, took all the grass and threw it on top of his roof. The next day, he stormed onto my porch and knocked furiously. He looked as if he was about to cry. My mother answered and the asshole demanded to see our shovels because ""he will bet there is dirt on it"". My mom replied, ""of course there will be dirt on our shovels you idiot, I don't use it to bake cakes. Get off my fucking property."" Funny thing is, I used a pocketknife to cut it all up. I wish I would've taken pictures. Dickhead.

**Edit:** To answer some questions, we cut up the grass and ripped it up by the handful. Then we threw all the little pieces on the roof as we went. It took about an hour to do, but being as I had a friends help, we managed to do the roughly 25 x 25. Sorry for the confusion!",Your lawn is so nice. It'd be shame if...,1159,pettyrevenge

Was working in broadcast journalism and had set up a series of interviews with politicians to respond to a major story that broke over night. Except that those interviews I set up were being handed to someone else and instead she told me I had to go and talk to orphans and ask them how the economy was effecting them. I laughed, and said ""No, Gary can do the orphan story, I'll do MY story, thankyouverymuch."" At which point she launched into a tirade, belittling me and basically speaking to me like she was my mother. This has happened a bunch of times. I hung up and texted her.

out-of-phase,56,,185,1ogixw,,910,"A few years ago I was driving across the country to Seattle. From Ohio (where I live), it's a good 5 day drive if you go at a good pace but don't exhaust yourself. It was winter time and I was driving through Montana. I'd been driving for a good 10 hours and it was starting to snow pretty hard. Since I was approaching the mountains, I figured I'd go ahead and pull over at the next motel I found.

I found one at the next exit -- a local place that looked quaint and pleasant and didn't seem to be too crowded. I had some work to get done, so I asked if they had wifi, and they said yes. I checked in, made some coffee, and pulled out my laptop.

After connecting to their wifi, I noticed that it was *monumentally* slow. I'm talking dial-up, AOL 2.0 slow. Slow to the point that even a simple page, google.com for instance, would take close to a minute to load, or just not load at all.

I called the front desk and told them their internet was acting up. The dude who answered sounded irritated, huffed at me and told me not to expect too much because this was a rural town and it was the best they could get. I politely asked him if could at least check on the router for me -- he sighed and said, ""The IT guy ain't here, he's the one who knows how to reset the router."" I heard giggling in the background, and he hung up on me.

There was no way I was going to get any work done. I had to view my email in old school HTML, and even then it would take forever, or not at all. I was pretty irritated, so I decided to try something. It was a long-shot, but it was at least worth a go.

I opened up my browser and typed in ""192.168.0.1"" -- nothing. I tried ""192.168.2.1"" and voila! I was presented with a login screen. I typed in ""admin"" for the username and ""password"". Wrong. I tried again without entering a password, and bam! I was IN.

My initial plan wasn't very sinister. I was just going to try to remotely restart the router. But then I found something interesting. They were cutting the bandwidth for the guests, and allocating almost all of it to the front desk. They were even kind enough to label the front desk computer ""front_desk"".

I reversed the settings, so that the front desk was getting almost no bandwidth, and the guests were getting the majority evenly. Then I changed the router's name to ""Best_Guest_Internet_Ever"". To top it off, I changed the router admin password.

I got a lot of work done after that. The wireless stopped a couple times -- I'm assuming because the guy at the front desk was unplugging and plugging back in the router, but after that it stayed steady. I have a feeling he didn't know how to do a hard reset.

[deleted],26,,167,1cs2xo,,911,"About 15 years ago I waited tables at a casual steakhouse where servers cleared their own tables (no bussers.)  There was one douchebag waiter (let's call him Carl) who would always leave without cleaning up his section first, as we were supposed to do, so anytime someone took over for him, he'd jolt out and leave an apocalyptic mess that the server taking over the section had to clean up.  

We'd all complain to management, but whenever they talked to him he'd claim it was an isolated incident and that he didn't mean to leave a mess, it'd never happen again, etc.

One day, I happened to be working a day shift and Carl was closing.  I was waiting for my last table to finish, a huge table, a party of 10 or 12 people.  Several small children.  They spilled drinks, melted ice cream, crumbs, all kinds of crap everywhere.  I'm talking all over the table and on the floor.   It was frightening.

The head of the table tipped me very generously and they started to get up to leave.  At that moment, I saw Carl walking in to the back break area to put his apron on and get ready for his shift.  I could smell the sweet aroma of revenge.

I walked into the management office and said ""Carl's finishing up my section now, so I'm leaving, okay?""  The manager on duty said ""yeah, sure.""

I told the hostess ""Carl's on and he'll take care of table 32 (or whatever number it was).""

Then I walked out and watched through the window outside as Carl was told by the hostess that he was cleaning up that horrid mess and then proceeded to flip the fuck out.

Most of the people work, a few are retired, and some have children. Everyone tries not to be a jerk, out of sheer common curtesy(?), and it works for the most part.

Geotis,119,,187,13vno4,,911,"Here's my personal account with a private school that had corporal punishment.

EDIT: This was in Southern Mississippi at the time.

When I was in 7th grade, I was in a private ""christian"" school. Spent the 3 years there. I was spanked many times due to ""problems"" they had with me, including ""demonic"" drawings I made during free time. (They were drawing from the video game, The Legend of Zelda.)

I was spanked for many issues that were non-issues but a biased problem they had or came up with. I was always spanked by the vice principal, normally a male, but witnessed by the offended teacher, normally female.

One day, I had enough. I was spanked for ""fighting"" with another student. (We were playing flag football, he got pissed and physically punched me. I did not respond and we were tattled on by two girls who witnessed and improperly reported the incident.) The vice principal paddled me (it was always three licks) and I turned around, severely angered by the injustice that happened and said, ""you will never strike me again."" The female teacher who I had issues with and was the witnessing party said something along the lines of, ""we'll spank you until you finally learn your place."" I said with all the bitterness I could muster, ""The FUCK you wont!"" The assistant principal, who was paddling me at the time swung me back onto the desk and said, ""you just bought yourself three more licks.""

Before he could swing, I grabbed the long scissors he had on his desk and swung at him, nicking his hand in the process. I swung erratically until he and the female teacher vacated the room and locked me in.

I knew I was in deep shit, so I decided to make the most of the situation, figuring I'd make a point as I went down. I took some autographed bat off his wall and destroyed his office, breaking everything in the room, the nicknacks on his desk, the windows, the phone, everything. I spent a good ten minutes in that room until the police arrived. I surrendered to them without any problem.

This led to the local media getting involved, which worked out to my benefit. The media investigated the school and reported on the issue of the opposite gender witnessing my punishment, the improper reasons for my punishment, and the fact that most of my teachers did not even have a college education.

I was expelled for the incident, but I already had my revenge. I caused a major embarrassment for the school, so much so that they had a high degree of students withdrawn from the school (which caused them to lose a lot of money in tuition funds) and also caused them to change their school name.

It was worth having to repeat the 7th grade. I enjoyed public school from then on.

TL;DR: FUCK THEM ALL!

EDIT 1: Here's some FAQ:

To be honest, my parents didn't believe me up until the incident because of my ""troubled history."" Now looking back, they can see the obvious catch-22 flaw in their logic.

When they picked me up for the police station, they were furious. Ironically, I was given a spankin from my father. My parents had what they called a ""two-for-one"" deal, if I get a spanking at school, I get a spanking at home. Keep in mind, this is the deep south Mississippi where Christian values overrules critical thinking and obvious logic.

It wasn't until the T.V. station called my parents and requested to do an interview with me or them. My parents refused, trying to shield me from any public damage. My parents tune was changed when the reporter basically laid everything out for them, basically proving everything I was saying the whole time, something that doesn't happen very often.

During my time off, as I was expelled, my parents sent me to a counselor. After about a week, I was diagnosed with some type of depression resulting from a repressive atmosphere, and that a drastic change was needed. This is when they decided to send me to public school. The problem with that was that my parents, during my private school days, used public school as a ""threat"" for problems related from school: poor grades, punishments, calls from teachers. They spun public school as a prison-like atmosphere in the roughest part of the ghetto where I would be surrounded by ""blacks."" (Keep in mind I'm the deep south of Mississippi, the REALLY racists part.) The concept of public school had forever been etched in my mind as a sever punishment for the poor and bad. So, when the counselor recommended public school, by parents were faced with another problem, trying to convince that this was not a punishment and was going to be good for me. I spent the time up until the next year of school in a deep depression because of the lies and threats my parents spun towards me.

As far as the teacher's lack of college degrees, no one knew. It wasn't until the tv report that that knowledge was hidden. I can't remember for sure, but either the fact that they were a ""private"" school may have skirted state requirements or that they were discovered and had to make drastic changes. Either way, all my former teachers either quit, or were switched to other position-titles that didn't require degrees like librarian and such. Either way, the school changed names to avoid confusion with this dilemma. (Ironically, the church under the same name as the school, kept its tarnished name.)

If it wasn't for the counselor or the television station's intervention into my already repressive life, I would have been in a worse situation afterwards. I found out that I loved public school (as you don't get any real-world interactions), black people are not the poor-evil people my parents led me to believe (this is cliche, but one of my best friends through high school was African-American, much to the dismay of my racist parents), and that my chaotic-problem child ways were nothing but the over-exaggeration of the private-school's staff.

With all that said, I love my parents, and after all that's happened and the time leading afterwards, they have ""grown-out"" of their ultra-conservative ways. However, I do hold the staff from that school mainly-responsible for my lingering physiological problems (still have a streak of fear shoot through me every time I hear the phone ring at my parents house subconsciously believing it's a teacher calling to get me in trouble). I hope they have already, or will pay in the future, for the unnecessary damage they've caused me and my life.

Someone from a chain deli store who came out to also throw her trash out said something like ""Seriously fuck these assholes, I'm so sick of this!"" So I said ""want to get some revenge?"" So we proceeded to climb in the cardboard dumpster (it was dusk and chicken chain had closed, along with just about all the other stores) and pull out all the unbroken down chicken chain boxes, throw our stuff in, and put their boxes in our trash carts, and then place them in front of the front door to the store and at the backdoor that opens to the hallway where we take the trash out to the back. I called the property manager and told her that chicken chain had left several boxes in the back hallway that were unbroken down and had raw chicken in them and I would call the health department if something wasn't done because it will attract rodents. The next day when the chicken chain manager got in she came over to ask me if anything strange happened and if we had boxes in front of our doors when we came in too. I told her no and that the person who did it was probably tired of you putting your boxes in there without breaking them down. She looked confused and left.

CapnScumbone,166,,205,1e524t,,899,"One of my former roommates who is actually an awesome guy in general was a vast monster of a person. He was about 6'6 and over 400 pounds of pure entertainment. He had a fondness for my chili, and would tend to help himself to it rather more than would be fair. We had a few arguments about it, and I laid down the law that he was not to eat ANY of it without asking. He continued to poach and hamburgle, so I began adding more hot sauce. He continued to poach, so I escalated the severity of the hot sauce every week. Eventually I got entirely sick of this, made a HUGE batch, and added most of a bottle of 'Z', an oily black concentrated extract of pure burning misery. I told him in no uncertain terms not to eat it.

Not only did Landfill eat it, he ate the entire thing. Over a gallon and a half of chili. I was enraged. I ran to his room to confront him, and was assailed with the most miserable stench. What he did to the bathroom can only be described as a holocaust of feces. He recreated the Hungarian sludge disaster. There was feces and vomit in the back of the linen closet. The smell of feces and vomit was strongly scented with pure capsaicin. I open his door and there is a vast fetal heap laying on a orange-stained, flattened mattress. His eyes are crimson, a filth-soaked towel under his freely running mouth and nose. He weakly gestures towards a stack of money on his table. It was over twice what I paid for ingredients.

I worked in a high-rise building and a few people did not understand elevator etiquette, particularly letting people off the lift before entering.

One woman was particularly bad about this. She was older, probably in her 50s and just a miserable person. For one reason or another, we always found ourselves running into each other, sometimes quite literally, over the course of years that I worked in that location.

Every time she would sigh and give me an indignant “Excuse me.” 

Now I’m a pretty easy going guy and it takes a lot to get me frustrated or angry but over the years, this woman had me hot. I tried to change my routine to avoid her but it seems like she just rode the elevator all day. I would still run into her at least once a day, every day.

Word came down that I was moving to a new location. I wasn’t even planning this, but on my last day there, I ran into her again. The same indignant “Excuse me.” Not having matured past the age of 13, I let out a fairly nasty beer fart into the elevator. “No, excuse me” I said, exiting the elevator. As the elevator doors closed, I watched her face change from surprise to absolute disgust.

So it was 11:45 and I was just arriving back at Papa Johns after finishing my route. It was a Saturday night and I wanted to get back home to the wife and kids. It was only me and my manager clean up as it was a very slow day.

All of a sudden, we get a call from a very rude lady. She needs two large pizzas and a 2 liter bottle of Coke as soon as possible. This lady lives at the edge of our territory, about 30 minutes away. I look at my boss to see if I can just tell her we're closed. 

He says no, we must serve this lady. It is policy. I sigh to myself, but it is my job. 

So we heat up some pizzas in the oven that was going to be dinner for me and my manager, and I grab the Coke and head out to the customer's house. At about 12:25 I arrive. I answer the door and immediately she complains why I had taken so long. She demands free pizza. I say no, that is not policy and I cannot do that.

She gives up, and just wants the pizza. I give her the pizza. I go get Coke from car. When I arrive to the front door with the Coke, the woman starts to act crazy. She specifically ordered Fanta, she says. I show the woman, on the receipt, she had ordered Coke. My manager took the order, he heard Coke.

She demands free pizza for this. I tell her again, ""This I cannot give. You can either take the Coke, or I will take the Coke. No refund.""

This woman is still acting crazy, so I decide to call boss and explain situation. He says, ""You must drive back here and grab a Fanta and deliver it to her.""

This is the moment where I had given up getting home while my wife was awake. I tell the woman it will take another hour before she gets her Fanta. She is fine with that.

I drive back and I grab the Fanta. My boss says sorry, it is policy. I understand. There is no problem.

I have never shaken soda before. There is no reason, it fizzes and explodes. I had a reason this time. I shook that soda up and down, left and right. I shook it with one arm and drove with the other. I released all my anger onto that soda for 30 minutes. Shake. Shake. Shake.

I walk up to the door while still shaking the soda. There is no anger anymore. Just shake. The woman opens the door. I give her the soda. I tell her to have a good night.

She is thoughtful enough to leave a tip. 2 dollars. I take, thank for business, and go back to my car.

On the way home I receive a call from my manager.

""Can you believe it? Now the woman's making up a lie that the soda exploded in her face to get a refund. I can't believe people these days. Sorry for keeping you up late for this bitch, James.""

StevenA3000,119,,215,15akv9,,880,"It was easter weekend and my girlfriend (of a year) invited me to her parents house for easter dinner. She lived 9 hours away and I was the only one with a car, so naturally i drove us there and back. I missed easter weekend with my entire family, just so i could finally meet her family for the first time. I really wanted to spend easter with my own family because there were relatives from out of country that i had not seen in a few years, but I chose to meet my girlfriends family instead.
The weekend went fine and we returned home without any problems.

However the next day my girlfriend went out to a birthday party for one of her friends i didnt know, so i stayed at home and just hung out with a few of my friends.
My girlfriend ends up getting black out drunk and returns home, puking on and off for hours (she always ended up this way when she drank). I take care of her for a little while until one of our mutual friends sends me a text saying we need to talk.

He came over to my house the next morning, informing me that my girlfriend had had sex with a dude at the party. I was furious. One day after meeting her entire family, she decides to cheat on me. So right after finding out i decide to confront her about what our friend had just told me. She owned up to it all, and telling me she also had sex with 2 other guys throughout our relationship, one of the guys she banged was my neighbour, and to make it worse, it was on my own birthday.

I broke up with her on the spot.

I decided the only thing to do was facebook inbox her mother. I started by saying thanks so much for the easter weekend and it was great to meet her family, then i explained that her own daughter had cheated on me with a few guys and that we are no longer together.

Her mom flipped out and eventually her entire family found out that she was a whore/cheating girlfriend. She hated the fact that i ruined her image of herself for her family, and her image her friends had of her.

She also ended up getting an non-permanent STD from this guy, making her life even worse for the next month or so. Dodged a huge bullet there, because i would have likely got it if i hadnt broken up with her that day.

Telling her mom was extremely petty, but it did feel good to fuck up her life a bit, after what she did to me.

lethalaudio,52,,210,1ggrj4,,883,"A few years ago when I was still with Verizon Wireless, I was in the store for my next phone upgrade.  They were packed as usual and was settling in for a long wait.


It wasnt long into the wait that I began to take notice of a small group of children, maybe 6-8 years old, and running around the store laying their hands on each phone, being loud, and trying to one up each other on the amount of toys or games they had.


Unattended children already annoy me and here's a group of them stuck in the store with me.  Great.   But it got worse.


The loud brats kept going over to one phone in particular to play that ""Crank that"" song by Soulja Boy.  Sometimes back to back.  The amount of hatred that I have for that ""song"" is astronomical.  So they're just rubbing salt in the wound now.  And they wanted the whole store to hear.  They maxed the volume on the phone to the point where the speakers were bottoming out.  So yes, it was loud.


After about the 4th or 5th time of them circling back around to the phone and having a loud dance off, I looked at my wife and said ""I have to deal with this.""  She wasnt sure if I was going to deal with the children or the phone so she was slightly concerned.


They all had their backs to the phone when I picked it up and the song suddenly stopped, they spun around and looked up to a 6'2 215lbs scowl.


Not one of them said a word and my focus stayed on the phone as I went through the menu and did a factory reset on the phone.


Feeling quite accomplished, I walked back over to my wife and sat down and explained what I did.  We both sat there watching the kids trying to bring the song back and finally giving up after about 5 min.  My wife glanced around the room and said there were quite a few people watching them and giggling to themselves.


The icing on the already delicious cake was when one of the kids went to their mother.  She was about what you would expect of someone that would let their kid annoy everyone in a store.  Around my age at the time, 25ish, and obviously not that interested in being a parent.  The kid whined about the phone and then looked around the room to point to me.  I was watching out of the corner of my eye when he pointed and his mother looked up to me with a squinty look that you typically give an unfamiliar far off noise youve just heard.


Fortunately for me, my stature is already intimidating, Ive been 6'2"" since junior high, and the default setting for my face is an expression that always looks pissed off.  Its just the card Ive been dealt and Im always asked if Im mad at something and have to reply with a laugh and ""No, this is just my normal expression"".


So when I saw her squint in my direction, I turned my face toward them with enough speed to tell them that I was watching indirectly and gave her a wide eyed stone face stare.


I could have stared straight at them while the kid whined, but it wouldnt have been as startling.  The snap to reaction I gave her should have planted that thought that I was going to keep an eye on them.


Pretty sure it worked because when I reacted to her look, she jerked back and looked back to her brat, grabbed him by the arm and sat him down beside her.


Every so often I would catch her glancing in my direction, to which I would reply with a slow glare back, but she would snap back straight before I fully got around.


Thats when I learned just how uncomfortable people can be when they realize they're being watched.

Burnonestein,83,,280,1lqfvm,,881,"When I first finished college with my education degree, I started work as a substitute teacher.  Usually it was pretty easy when I was at the high school and middle school levels, but K-5 is not something that I am overly fond of.  

I got a gig for a few days in a row because a teacher had to go on leave for something.  The first day with the class was fine, but I could tell there was one kid who was going to try and be a brat. He was the kind of kid whose parents bought him two monster energy drinks to bring to school *daily*, and he had enough TapOut gear to choke a medium sized donkey. 

The affront: The second day I was in the class, this kid starts to lose it. He is shouting and running around the room in all his pudgy, pig-faced glory.  I tell him to stop. He doesn't. I send him out of the room to the principals office, and he is there for a majority of the rest of the day. 

When he came back into the class, he started in with his shenanigans again as soon as he came back (with about 15 mins left in the day) he looked me in the eyes and said, ""you can't do anything to me, you are a substitute teacher!"" I was fuming, but didn't let it show. In my head, I was 95% sure that I could fight him and win, but I let it go because I am a full grown man.  

The revenge: He had these pens that wrote in different colors than they were labeled, and he made sure that *everyone* knew about how awesome they were. He would tell kids how much better his parents were for buying him those pens, and how amazingly cool he was. 

At the end of the school day, I took every single one of his precious colored pens and put them in a completely different classroom on a different floor. I put them into a student's bag who I knew was a great kid, but their family didn't have a lot of money.

idiotcookbook,128,,250,1ewoud,,879,"  So, my next door neighbors are quite loud, mostly around the evening when I'm trying to sleep, Usually drunken singing and crappy guitar playing. (As in deftly strumming and hooting and hollering to music)

  They got a new cat last night and they kept me up past 1am by meowing back at it every time it meowed therefore egging it on so it meows more... (this would be cute in the day time... not while I am trying to sleep)

My petty revenge? Oh its so sweet and simple and deliciously petty. ""What did you do?"" You must be asking.

 Well here's how it went:

*Picked up cell phone, text the apartment manager (no not at 1am... during the daytime when he does the early morning cleanup around 8:30am) ((no he cant hear the loud noises either because he is in another building)) ""Did you see the neighbors new cat? I can hear it meowing through my walls, sounds really cute.""* Sounds harmless right? NOT. Now the apartment manager will have to charge them a monthly pet fee! Petty revenge is served!

OK let me put something to help you people out who obviously don't know what PETTY means...

I have tried to talk to them nicely, I have gotten the manager involved and tried to make a truce, i HAVE tried beating on their door at 1am on a night that i work at 5am the next morning to ask them to stop. It doesn't work because they are DRUNK that means that they don't know what the fuck they are doing. So instead of constantly trying to work out peace with them I do petty things like tell the manager about the new cat.

My job is already low on hours because my boss doesn't want to give medical insurance , I'll be damned if I'm going to loose more hours or even get fired because I was LETTING my next door neighbor be douchebags because its the NICE thing to do.

Geotis,174,,250,1buyoe,,871,"A little background: on the 29 year old male not only has several food allergies, but is an all around picky eater. So, for me to find a restaurant that will cater to my needs and wants is pretty difficult, but if and when I ever did you find one, I am a very regular and loyal customer.


One of my favorite dishes I like to eat is a good ole Southern-style steak and potatoes. One of my allergies is a severe cheese allergy (not a milk allergy; I'm not going to get into a discussion or an argument with anyone online, just take my word for it) and I've never been fond of large chunks of garlic.


This one major-chain restaurant that I found offered this meal at a reasonable price. The only alteration I had to make what's to the potato. In the morning, they would take the potatoes out of the refrigerators and add cheese and garlic to them. The manager there was nice and said that she would happily prepare my potato by taking a fresh one out of the freezer and microwaving it, bypassing the additives that I could not eat and did not like. All I would have to do is ask for the manager when I was seated, and she would take care of the rest.


This was not a major problem for the manager. It could easily be done, it just required a little extra effort on her behalf.


So I made this a weekly tradition. I would take my girlfriend-at-the-time out for lunch, make my special request, enjoy my meal, and leaving nice tip for the managers and waitresses efforts.

I did this for a good year. 

Then one day, when I ask for the manager, I was greeted by a younger lady. I was told that the previous manager had been shifted to another restaurant. I proceeded with my order. When I made my special request, I was told that was not possible. I told her about my history with the restaurant and the previous manager is she quickly retorted with a story that they had switched difference food suppliers, and that the cheese and garlic was added prior to the freezing process it was delivered to them prenate. I was irked by her callousness but succeeded my goal of eating a cheeseless potato.


Flash forward a month or so, I traveled about 60 miles north to visit my been girlfriend at her college. We go out to eat at the same name restaurant. Once we were seated, I notice that the manager was the same lady from my hometown restaurant. she comes over and takes my order, asking if I wanted my usual.


I hesitate a moment, informing her of her restaurants change in policy. She informs me that there has been no change, the new manager straight up lied to me, and that manager has been known to be lazy and a liar. She further tells me that she only gets all her ass to serve customers only if there is a group of eight or more, and she only cares for getting the large tips at the efforts of her help.

Armed with this knowledge and a birthday coming up in the near future, I gather my parents and a group of my friends (totaling 14 people in all) for my yearly treat of a birthday dinner.

Before going into the restaurant, I discuss my plan with my entourage. everyone goes in with their knowledge of what's to come.


We are all greeted and seated by the manager. she goes to everyone around the table and takes their drink order. Everyone suspiciously orders water with no lemon.


After everyone had their chance to look at the menu, everyone places the order with the manager. are you insisted everybody go ahead of me as I was "" still deciding.""

After everyone that placed their order, I make my move. I order my state with my plane potatoes. She immediately tells me that that is not possible. shop in slightly disappointed, I asked her why that is. She gives me a similar yet slightly different excuse than she did before. When she finished, I said that was funny because the previous manager (I drop her name, which seems to spark an aura of worry) is a good friend of mine and still works for the company and that she told me that that story was a load of bullshit, and that's a feeling my order as requested it is easily capable. 

Irked by my ever so clever game, she defiantly refuses my order as requested. I sheeplishly ask since it was my birthday, and a special occasion, if an exception to be made. She seem to enjoy telling me ""absolutely not.""

 I slump my shoulders and defeatedly say ""alright."" and with my command, everyone at my table stands up in unison, almost as if we had practice this all before. 

Realizing she's about to lose a big payday, she quickly backpedals like I have never seen. she says that she'll go back and check with the cook to see if an exceptions can be made.

Curiously I ask her, ""but I thought you said ' absolutely not?'"" She says, ""well... let me just double check!"" I thanked her and asked her if she didn't mind.

She quickly scampers off to the kitchen, during which we all leave because we had a reservation at the restaurant across the street.

One lazy (duty) Saturday, I was getting changed in my berthing to go and get ready for chow. As I go to put on my cover (hat for you non-military people) I find that it has disappeared. Now, normally I am not one to misplace my things, especially items such as my cover. (Cannot leave the ship without it/go into the hangar bay) I continue searching the immediate area in an attempt to locate it, but I cannot find it. I also did not have a spare one on the ship at the moment due to the fact that I keep most of my uniforms off the ship at my apartment. 

Cue 5 minutes later, I receive a call from our departments head office. Our Chief called down to inform me that he had found my cover in the office. No big deal, just get to the office and avoid other Chiefs and Officers that are in a bad mood and looking for an excuse to fry a sailor. Halfway up the ladder wells leading to the office, I pass B. 

Now mind you, before this, I had nothing against him. I knew who he was, I just didn't hang out with him. But he stops and asks me if I ever found my cover. The fucker took it from my rack and brought it up to the office. I immediately confronted him about taking it from my rack. Of course, he doesn't deny he did. He just thought it would be ""funny."" Well we'll see who gets the last laugh. 

Remember when I said I worked as an IT? That comes into play. We had our own special proxy server on the ship that gave us fine grain control over who could go where, what time they could go to those websites, etc. So, armed with the knowledge that this guy is an avid Redditor (seen him on it many times in the office while he was on watch) I logged into the proxy server, and blocked him, and only him from accessing imgur.com, livememe.com, and memegenerator.net. 

Approximately an hour later, he comes into our office and specifically asks why he cannot access specific websites. His biggest mistake however, was that he completely skipped the chain of command, and immediately asked the question to my division officer who was also in my duty section. 

The (lets call him DivO from now on) DivO, being the cool guy that he was, instead of calling him out on his serious breach of military protocol, asks him what websites he cannot access. After explaining what websites they were, and why, the DivO just looks at him and says ""First off, stand at attention. Second, you failed to use the chain of command when Petty Officer spbeeking was in the same room. Third, why are you accessing these websites that serve no purpose other than to take up our (very limited, gifs are almost impossible to load, forget about youtube) bandwidth?"" The kid had absolutely no answer. After getting chewed out by my DivO and leaving, he looks and me and says ""was that you spbeeking?"" ""Yes sir."" ""Remind me never to piss you off.""

-My DivO is awesome. Also found out later that he is also a Redditor.

I (A 16 year-old Highschool student) recently flew home on an airplane packed to the brim with people. I, being a poor motherfucker, sat in the very last row with my backpack on my lap. This whole flight was extremely delayed and overbooked, arriving about three hours later than intended. Everyone was tired, everyone was pissed off. 

Then the plane landed, and we were held on the plane for a couple minutes while they de-boarded the first class people first. I was not aware of this, and as soon as the seat-belt sign turned off, I jumped out of my seat and got about halfway up the airplane before the line of people getting up and getting their luggage stopped me. So there I am, bulging backpack on, no semblance of manners, blocking off four rows of seats with no way to get out. 

I apologized profusely to everyone, and they all grumbled about how stupid kids of today are and all that stuff. The guys behind me looked like they had just come from a biking trip (athletic frame, biking shirts, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, Bike Locks). They were especially quiet, and didn't talk much, only glared at me. When things had finally sorted themselves out and I walked shamefully up the aisle with the line of angry passengers behind me, I noticed that the biker dudes didn't looks so grumpy. Huh.

Fast forward an hour, I'm home and starting to unpack. I turn to my backpack to get out my carry-on materials, and find that EVERY ZIPPER HAD BEEN COMBINATION LOCKED SHUT. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Those smart-ass sons of bitches had exacted perfectly deserved revenge on me, and all I could do was laugh. I ended up having to cut the zippers to get my stuff out, but it was still hilarious. Needless to say, I will now be waiting my turn on any and every flight I ever take from now on.

The store is packed, and apparently people weren't moving fast enough for Her Royal Highness, Rudie-Patootie the 3rd, and she barrels past me at mach 10 with her shopping cart, smacking my bag of delicate edibles with her stainless-steel battering ram in the process. 

Well, I *never.*

5 minutes later in a different aisle, I'm looking at the goods for sale, when I see who but the Queen of Rudeness herself coming down the laneway. So, I decide to teach that bitch some manners.

As she's coming down, I step right into the middle of the laneway, because, oh, this package of instant pudding mix is just *so* interesting, and I *must* have a closer look. This of course causes Her Royal Highness to slam on the brakes. After about 5 seconds of her awkwardly trying to squeeze past me, she **finally** has the sense to clear her throat and say ""er...excuse me please.""

""Oh! I'm so sorry, I didn't even see you there!"" I say, my voice utterly dripping in sweet, sweet sarcasm. ""Please, by all means!""

Prior to the competition, they provide a feast of a breakfast for all volunteers. Afterwards, they have a buffet of Chick-fil-a, Chipotle, Which Wich, and countless other options. This is above and beyond what any volunteer should expect, but the sentiment of providing for your volunteers is right on.

I'm generally a pretty non-confrontational person, and the kid was like 4 or 5, so I just decided to sit there, hoping he'd stop. However, after about a half hour of this, I turned around and quietly asked his mother if she could get him to stop. She said something to the effect of ""HE'S JUST A LITTLE KID HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY BETTER BLAH BLAH BLAH."" Perhaps he doesn't know any better because his mother didn't teach him any manners. Anyway. After that, I left the theatre momentarily and asked the person at the concessions stand if I could have a booster seat. I got it, brought it back, and sat on it, effectively blocking the kid's view. He stopped kicking my seat after that, and they couldn't change seats because the theatre was very full. I sat there for the remainder of the film, satisfied in the knowledge that I am a terrible person who ruins the movie-going experiences of young children. SUCCESS

sconnie64,171,,207,1n9569,,858,"Yesterday I was working out in my school's weight room, it has been a habit for me for around 6 years so I'm no stranger to gym culture. I was doing some power cleans on one of the many platforms and was having a pretty good lift. Until the track girls showed up, wearing make-up carrying cellphones and wearing highlighter colored EVERYTHING to workout (you know the type). 

There is a policy at our schools workout facility where any in season athlete can kick a non-athlete off of the equipment, I don't like this rule, but i knew what i was getting into when i bought my membership. Back to the story. I was on my last set and a group of 3 track girls show up to my platform and tell me to ""Get off our platform"" I say i have one more set and i would be happy to after that. As i am preparing for my final set they inform me that they can kick me off of any equipment they need I tell them that only applies to in-season athletes, Track is a winter and spring sport (Including indoor season) not a fall sport. I get the response ""It's our weightroom, we are doing you a favor by letting you stay in here."" 

At this point i have had enough of their shit so I finish my last set with them glaring at me and promptly drop about 230 pounds of barbell at my feet, turn around and say ""all yours"" and walk away (keep in mind this is an olympic-style bumper plate weight set designed to be dropped repeatedly).

meow_mix8,116,,183,1f9fmq,,856,"This story comes from my uncle. I hope you like it! I'm new here, so I hope this is just the kind of pettyness for this sub. Anyway, when my cousin was young, she was a terror to everyone. She was selfish and mean. If something did not go her way, she would scream and cry loudly until someone yielded and gave her what she wanted. She was an only child. 

Her uncle (and mine) was born to a family of 8 children. In that environment, there is not much room for bratty selfishness if your siblings can gang up on you and humble the crap out of you. So he was babysitting my cousin one day (we'll call her BC for bratty child) when she was 7 years old. Now, she believed that any object of interest belonged to her. Every toy another child played with, any book you were reading, any food any anything. It was hers. Her favorite word was ""MINE!""

My uncle was not going to put up with this and decided to plan a devious and petty revenge. If she wants to play that way, then my uncle was going to stoop to her level.

My uncle walks into the room with a paper bag in his hand. BC cannot see what is inside.

BC: ""What is that?""

Uncle: ""what is what?""

BC: ""The bag! What's in the bag! Give it to me! IT'S MINE!!""

Uncle: (with extremely calm voice) ""no...no this is my bag and you cannot have it.""

BC's face crumples into rage as she turns red and starts to scream at the top of her lungs.

BC:"" MINE MINE MINE! GIVE IT TO ME IT'S MINE!!""

Uncle: ""No, BC, you can't have everything you want. This is my bag and everything inside it.""

BC is havin' none o' dis. She lies down in the floor, screaming and kicking her legs and pounding her fists into the ground. Tears streaming down her beet red face. It's a wonder she doesn't lose her voice. My Uncle continues to calmly assert his claim over the bag to BC for another five minutes. Which is a long time to deal with a brat of such magnitude. He has the patience of a saint. A devious saint. Finally, my Uncle yields.

Uncle: (smiling) ""Okay BC! You can have the bag. It's yours!"" (his smile turned from calm to evil. BC doesn't notice)

BC jumps up from the floor, all anger wiped from her face and replaced with the smugness of a spoiled victor. She smiles and gives my Uncle one of those ""I knew you'd give up, I always get my way"" looks. BC greedily snatches the paper bag away from my uncles hands and excitedly opens it like a child on Christmas morning. Her smile replaces surprise, then shock. Her face turns white as she realizes what just happened. 

BC: ""W-what I, b-but I... It's empty!""

Uncle smiles back at her.

BC: ""Y-you...YOU TRASHCAN HEAD!!""

Yes, that was the worst insult my cousin knew at the time. The shame was too great for her. She bolted to her room and slammed the door, giving my uncle complete and utter peace and quiet for the remaining hour or two until her parents came home. Victory at last.

And for those wondering, my cousin grew up to be the sweetest most loving person. She is a wonderful sister, daughter, and friend. She still can't believe she acted that way when she was young, but trashcan head became a running joke in my family for years to come. Good thing when bad kids are humbled enough, they can turn out alright!

Edit: thanks for such great response! More petty revenge funny stories will come soon!

mw19078,162,,111,1bhw6y,,861,"This was a few months ago, finally got around to posting it. So I had just started getting into philosophy and history, and was doing a lot of reading. I had heard nothing but great things about kindles, so after a few days of research I ended up getting the regular one without the backlight. I really wanted it because I was going on a long road trip, so I went to best buy to pick one up. It worked great for my trip, and I was really happy about it. About a month later, I go to bed and turn it off, going to its ad screen. I put it on my nightstand and go to sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I grab it to finish a chapter before work. When I push power, half the screen goes on and half stays stuck on the ad in this weird ink looking mixture. So I take it to best buy to get it replaced.

Get to best buy, and of course the line is 20 people deep. Oh well, I just sit back and wait. After literally 30 minutes I get to the rep and explain the situation, she takes one look and says I broke it, must have dropped it. Tells me I am Sol and ""should have bought the warranty."" I asked for a manager and was told the same thing. At this point I am practically foaming at the mouth with anger. 

After a number of unheard complaints I called amazon in a last ditch effort. My jaw practically hit the floor when she told me I'd get a replacement shipped for free in one day.

Now as happy as I was about this, I really didn't want it anymore through best buy, so I came back to the store to see the same bitch behind the counter. Came up, returned the new one amazon sent me, and told her thanks for not telling me about the amazon warranty. She didnt say a word. 

Then I returned the 700 dollar TV I had just bought from the same store. Her face when I pulled out the receipt and asked for help with it out of my car was pure gold.

imkirok,42,,110,12hjfw,,848,"So this all happened when I was in middle school. I was having a grand old time riding my Razor scooter around my apartment complex and thought I would ride by the pool and see if my friends were there. My friends were not there, but there was a kid who was a few years younger than me, maybe 3rd or 4th grade.

Anyway, for whatever reason this kid ran up to me brandishing some shitty made in China water gun, the kind that can shoot maybe a few feet. I was fully clothed and didn't wish to be squirted with water, and I said as much to this kid. But no, with the biggest shit eating grin on his face he squirted me with water and ran away. Annoyed, I rode my Razor scooter back home and changed my shirt.

A few days later my mom and I were driving by Toys R Us and I asked to go inside. Somehow I managed to convince her to buy me a $40 Super Soaker, an absolute beast. I could hardly contain my anticipation on the drive home, the fires of revenge burned bright in my heart. 

We got home later that day and I immediately went off on a scouting mission to the pool, booking on my Razor scooter as fast as it would go. I get to fence separating the pool area and look inside, sure enough the kid was there and he was actually running around squirting people with his shitty water gun still. It was perfect.

I hustle home and fill up my massive Super Soaker and make my way on foot (it was too heavy to ride a scooter with) to the pool. I get to the pool and pump this motherfucker until it can't pump anymore. I open the gate, walk in, and beeline straight for this kid. 

He has his back turned but as I approach and people behind him see me and exclaim at the size of my water gun he also turns in curiosity. As soon as he turns I unleash a massive torrent of water at him, it's as if somebody turned on a high pressure hose because that's how badass this Super Soaker I got was. He yells ""stop"" and futilely puts his hands up to try and quell the torrent, but it won't let up. He begins to cry but still the torrent doesn't let up.

Finally, the Super Soaker ran out of pressure and stops, and the kid is sitting on the ground sobbing. My dark work complete, I leave.

flatfrog,70,,121,18w2gd,,847,"I used to room with my best friend, her boyfriend, and his three friends.  The ONE bathroom was beyond disgusting.  Apparently aiming was something only done with a gun while hunting.  They never bought toilet paper and weren't even considerate enough to replace an empty roll with a new one from the stash (I bought) under the sink.  Besides the fact that they were inconsiderate slobs, they guys would devour all of the food I purchased.  One time I made lasagne (from scratch).  I took it out of the oven and set it on the stove to cool.  While it was cooling I figured I had time to shower.  During the twenty min. I was showering those assholes ate the entire pan.  I was fuming and they thought they were hilarious. 
After a month I had had enough and decided to move out.  My best friend moved at the same time because she had caught her boyfriend cheating.  The guys were at work while we packed boxes and loaded them in the truck.  In addition to taking everything that was mine, (including toilet paper) I also packed up every newspaper, magazine, and paper product I could find.  When everything was safely in the truck I went back into the house and proceeded to bake a large pan of brownies containing the secret ingredient, ex-lax.  The guys came home from work just as I was pulling them from the oven.  I told them I had to take a load of my stuff to my new place and I would be back to get the brownies and ""some other stuff"" in about 30 minutes.  They exchanged looks and grins amongst themselves and said, ""Ok.""  I left and came back 30 min later; just long enough to pop my head in the door and see an empty pan of brownies. 

At the request of many I am editing the follow-up into my post.  A few months later my friend got back with her boyfriend for a short time. (She had bad taste in men, but was a loyal friend and never ratted me out.) She said that after three months the house still didn't smell right and there were several large, dark stains on the carpet that had not been there when I left. Her boyfriend told her that while they were broken up, he and his buddies all got food poisoning at work. (They all worked in the same restaurant kitchen .) His words to her were, ""Horrible explosive diarrhea."" As I type this, I feel an overwhelming sense of pride to report that numerous pants were shat, a bucket and trash can became improvised commodes, and t-shirts utilized for wiping.

calibur_,110,,206,17akqr,,852,"I was just reminded of this while chatting with some friends. I know it's a wall of text, but trust me: it's worth the read.

When I was a child I was severely dehydrated because I had no natural thirst. In attempt to get me to drink more often, I was allowed to take a small cooler to school that contained different types of juices, which I would be more inclined to drink than straight water. This generally worked out fine, but my second grade teacher was a real miserable bitch. She was grossly fat (morbidly obese), always wore sleeveless muu-muu dress-things that displayed the horrific growths in her unshaven armpits, sported a steel-wool mustache... You know the type.

There are many examples of shit she did to me: constantly keeping me inside during recess, kept me from going to lunch one day (I went home and told my mother about that one, so it never happened again), she *cut my fucking hair* in class when one of the other kids got gum stuck in it, but the constant battle was the drink cooler. At first, she tried refusing to let me drink in class. I was accustomed to having drinks at my desk and was always quiet about it, never spilled, and never taunted the other kids about it... mostly because I really hated drinking, even delicious juice, and never saw having a ""special circumstance"" as something worth bragging about. When she was overruled by the principal/my doctor's note, she started enforcing random rules about the drinks. One instance I remember was while we were trying a new juice... only it turned out to not really be a juice, but was a weird Jell-O consistency thing in a bottle that was similar to a Mondo drink. I've always been repulsed by Jell-O (IT'S FUCKING CREEPY DON'T JUDGE ME ;_;) and the taste made me gag even if the consistency wouldn't. I wasn't allowed to throw it away: I had to finish it in front of the class, gagging and crying the whole time. Keep in mind, I was not the only object of her torment throughout the year. There were a handful of other students she loved to single out and humiliate.

My attitude toward this hateful bitch may come across as petty, but I *loved* school until I had to stay with this bitch eight hours (or longer, when she kept me after school, too) a day for nearly a full year. She killed my love for school, I won't even begin to guess how she contributed to my subsequent depression and severe anxiety, and I struggled right up until the day I graduated.

**The revenge**: almost twenty years later, I am a receptionist (and a returning college student!) at the front desk of a nursing home. One of my duties is control of petty cash, which includes releasing funds from a resident's private account. I come in one morning last autumn to see a familiar surname on our resident roster. Curious, I check his personal information. Sure enough, his spouse is a certain miserable bitch who tormented me and destroyed my budding passion for academia.

One of my other duties is to accept guest meal orders. It wasn't really intentional, but the circumstances were perfect when she came down the first evening looking for food. She showed up at my desk with labored breath (from that *dreadful* elevator trek down one floor down from her husband's room...) and asked about how to get dinner. I patiently explained the ordering process (two choices for full meals, a full variety of à la carte items to choose from, etc.) and took her order. When I told her it would cost $5, I got a blank stare.

""But my husband is staying here.""

""Yes, and his meals are covered by the cost of his stay here. As a visitor, your meals are not.""

""Well, that's stupid. I don't have any money down here."" Annnnnnd it hits me. 

""Of course. It's possible to withdraw the money from your husband's private account. Would you prefer to do that?""

""*Annoyed sigh* YES."" This could be a beautiful thing. Due to a recent unrelated incident, we were cracking down on family members accessing a resident's private account. So naturally, I respond cheerfully...

""Okay! Are you your husband's Power of Attorney?"" OH, THE HATEFUL GLARE. YES.

""No, my sister is."" Internally, I'm so excited I'm practically squirming. I don't even wonder about why her sister would be her husband's PoA (though I later check out his information and see that the sister is his *health care proxy*, which is completely different)... Of course, I remain coolly professional.

""Unfortunately you aren't authorized to withdraw money from his account, then,"" I manage an empathetic frown as I pull out a withdrawl form for her, ""however you can take this and have him sign it, then have one of the nurses witness it, and bring it back! Once that's all taken care of, I can order your meal right away.""

""But I'm his wife! I have authorization for all of his bank accounts!"" YOUR TEARS ONLY MAKE ME STRONGER, BITCH.

""Yes, but this is a personal account through the care facility, we are very careful about the security of these accounts as a patient's trust in all aspects of the care they receive are of utmost importance to us. It also prevents any legal complications that may arise from miscommunication."" She tries to argue some more, but, wielding a vocabulary full of syllables, I quickly send her waddling back upstairs. I know, by this point, that all of the nurses will be busy performing their evening care duties and she will have to waddle from one end of the unit to the other to find one that isn't elbows-deep in bathing, changing, or feeding a resident. It's almost half an hour before she returns, panting for breath and covered in sweat.

I made that bitch go get a withdrawl request every single time she wanted to feed that fat fucking face, 3-4 times a day.

daneinthecity,38,,150,14bwn1,,846,"So, a couple of years ago I was at a bar with some friends, and I got bored and was going to meet up with some other friends at another bar. This second bar was just down the road, about a brisk 5 minute walk, and is a very busy spot in my city (pretty big lineup most nights, especially weekends). Now, I do admit, I was a little drunk, but nothing major to the point I was making a fool of myself.

Anyways, I depart from my friends at the first establishment, and start to walk to bar 2. I dont usually go to a bar myself, and nobody else does really my age or in my city. So I guess I kind of look like a loser while Im going to the second bar. This group of really good looking girls (4 of them) walk by me. I innocently smile and say hello.

Well, I guess that was a demonic move, because one of the girls turns around and starts yelling at me, calling me names, and pretty much just making me look like a loser (which i already kind of looked like i guess because I was alone).

Whatever. 

Fuck it, no big deal.

The girls move quicker than me and move on ahead of me. All of a sudden, a green crisp $20 bill flies out of the purse of the girl who yelled at me. It floats ever so majestically towards me in the strong wind, and I happen to grasp it out of the air gracefully. Now, I would typically be the gentleman and return the money to whoever dropped it, but this female was so rude to me just a moment ago that i instead thought: ""fuck dis bitch yo! dis mine!""

anyways, i keep walking, theyre in front of me, all good. They arrive to my destination before me and park their cabooses in the end of the monstrous line that has formed in front of the establishment, and throw nasty glances back at me (meanwhile Im just playing it cool and on my way).

I waltz in front of the entire line, pass those bitches, and walk right up to the bouncer, give him the patented ""sup-bro-hand-slap-one-shoulder-hug"" maneuver and make my way into the packed bar.

Last year, I was sharing a flat with a friend of mine - I have since moved in with my girlfriend, though we are still good friends. 

Due to working different hours, we would generally buy/cook/eat our own food. Every now and again, I would buy bag of nuts/raisins/other snacky food. Sometimes, I would share, sometimes I wouldn't. Flatmate never bought snacks, but I was fine with this. Sometimes though, he would use the last of something we would share (toilet paper, for example), but would not replace it. This annoyed me.

So, one day, I buy a large bag of delicious, salted pistachio nuts in shells, which I put in a bowl with the intention of them lasting a few days. The bowl is placed on the table in front of the couch and I tell Flatmate he could have some if he wants. Flatmate proceeds to eat some nuts and put the shells back into the bowl. No problem, except he keeps eating them and eating them until there are only about half left. By this point, I've only had about a handful and decide to tell him to take it easy, as I would actually like them to last - *pistachios aren't cheap*. He stops.

The next day, I return late from work to find that he has finished the remaining nuts, leaving me with only those inevitable closed little bastards that you can't break into - there are usually a few in each bag - and the empty shells. This annoyed me, having specifically requested that he leaves some for me.

Knowing my flatmate, he will have gained some enjoyment from eating them all in my absence, which irked me more.

I took my revenge the next time he was out by distributing the empty shells throughout his bedroom and personal property, including his pillow cases, duvet, mattress, socks and toiletry bag amongst other things...like his milk and yoghurt. 

The pièce de résistance though, was depositing a few of those hard little shells into his running shoes, underneath the foam insoles. Not so obvious that you can feel them if you put your hand in, but hard enough that when you run in them, it's uncomfortable.

It took him weeks to find most of them, but he didn't find the ones in his running shoes for months, during which time he complained that he had found running uncomfortable and that his calf muscles hurt - I assumed this was from adjusting his running style but I may be wrong. He found them eventually, but said nothing.

I scratch my head at that, tell her hey, I know you're having financial difficulties, but I normally only get my lawn mowed once it's a couple of inches higher.  I pay her another $50, chalk it up to Shelly being usual dumb Shelly, and fuggitaboutit.

But suddenly Shelly is everywhere, showing up at my office when she knows I'll be there and begging for cash, saying that she ""was in the neighborhood, and noticed that the lawn needed mowing"".  My secretary points out that Shelly has shown up 8 times in the past 6 weeks.  On a whim I check her Facebook page, and notice that every time she has just been ""in the neighborhood"", she and her friends have gone and gotten drunk that night, taking selfies in some not-so-cheap clubs.  So much for ""financial difficulties"".

**EDIT:  To everyone saying ""well you're a doormat"" or ""wow you're dumb"" I thought I was giving charity to a young single mother about to be homeless.  I thought the $350 was keeping her from starving while still letting her retain some dignity.  Fuck me, right?**

I email Shelly and tell her that under no circumstances is she to be on my property unless I call her first.  I change the lock on the shed that houses the mower, and figure this will solve the problem.

The next day (according to my neighbors' story):

Shelly stops by my house, knowing I am at work.  She tries to unlock the shed with her key, and notices the lock has changed.  Screams bloody murder and kicks things.  Notices that MY BEDROOM WINDOW IS PARTIALLY OPEN, and climbs in.  Apparently she didn't find the new key, because she left through the front door a few minutes later - leaving my door wide open for anyone passing by.

She ganged up on me when I got home, and started screaming that I owed her money ""for her time"" because she would've mowed the lawn.  Um, what?  I reminded her that I'd already told her NOT to come over unless I called first.  She demands that she is not leaving until she gets her $50.  I tell her she can wait all day if she wants.  She then starts crying, saying that she doesn't even have the gas money to drive her car to the gas station; that she was planning to use the money to walk into town and buy gas.  I tell her, ""Oh, so you weren't planning to go to [big well-known concert] tonight?""

The look of shock on her face is priceless.  I know damn well she was planning to go with her friends, because she was stupid enough to rave about it on her Facebook page.  She pouts and stammers and sits in her car.  I go inside and turn on the TV.  It takes her half an hour to admit defeat and speed away.  So much for not having any gas.

The best part of this was telling my little brother.  He was stunned.  He said he was considering getting back together with her, but this behavior killed that possibility.","Stupid bimbo scams me, is dumb enough to brag about it on Facebook.",1106,pettyrevenge
likewhatalready,98,,195,1gazf1,,844,"This is the kind of petty revenge story that I'm sure will bring in some haters, but this IS about being petty.  


Back when I was in high school, I worked at a local Stop and Shop as a 'porter' (cart bitch and mess cleaner). I hated it a lot, but I liked some of the people I worked with and it was a really easy job where I got to fuck off a bit and just hide behind the store or something and listen to music or watch movies on my iPod.  


I hated it, though, in large part due to the customers. If you have ever worked in a food store or any service job, you already understand. People are miserable, people are rude, and they will take out their frustration on the minimum wage high school student.  


More often than not, I worked the 6-10 closing shift on carts. They had 4 hour shifts and I wasn't home from school until 3:15 or 3:30 most days, so I never could work the 2-6 shift. This story takes place during the night shift.   


I was pushing a long line of carts, maybe about 20 of them. They become a bitch to steer at this point, but it was more efficient. Maybe. Probably not. But the managers didn't like us doing this, and I did it just to feel rebellious. So I'm pushing this line of carts, and I have it angled perfectly to go into the store vestibule where the carts are. It's going to be flawless. I just gotta get it up the slight incline (pain in the ass, but good for water runoff).  

This is where Douchebag comes into play. Douchebag comes flying into the parking lot off the highway in his Nissan Versa. Cool car bro. Anyway, he's definitely driving at an unsafe speed for a grocery store parking lot. I'm about 1/4 of the way into the road (really just the space between the store entrance and the parking spaces) and pushing the carts pretty hard. Douchebag doesn't care and doesn't slow down. He finally realizes he's not going to make it (I wasn't really aware of how fast he was going because it was in my peripherals) and slams on his brakes and honks his horn. He then just drives up the curb behind me and goes around the long way of the parking lot.  


I was on my way back into the parking lot and he was on his way into the store when we crossed paths. He's probably in his late 20s or early 30s with a goatee, sunglasses (it's like 9 pm in February, get real dude), wifebeater and tatted arms. He looks at me and says, ""Watch where you're going with the carts, fatty.""  

So that was pretty uncalled for. It didn't bother me that much because the guy is a loser and people are rude anyway. But I still want revenge this Douchebag because it's a pretty shitty way to treat people.  


I walked over to his car, stuck two fingers down my throat, and vomited up stomach acid on his driver's side door handle.

Verveblade14,214,,344,1fpax9,,840,"Background: I'm an 18-year-old Canadian man.

A year or so ago I met an attractive, dark lady. Her allure was in her mysterious ways. We had some chemistry, but after a brief sexual encounter, we decided that we should remain friends instead. We were both under eighteen (her 16, me 17) and she wasn't supposed to be dating (or at least, that's what she told me).

Fast forward a few weeks and not only has she stopped talking to me altogether, I find out that she's got a new boy toy. I was a little hurt, alright, but whatever, you get used to that sort of thing.

Now, she'd always told me stories about how she could get into bars and clubs, since she looks older than she is, and claimed to be friends with a lot of the bouncers. I'd never been to a club, but I took her word for it. 

Fast forward to last weekend. I'm experiencing clubbing for the first time (DDing for some friends). Well, she shows up. I immediately feel all that pent up frustration towards her come shooting out of my chest, much like how many of the patrons would feel while spending the night next to a public toilet. I try and get her attention, but as I approach the group she's with, she quickly darts away from me and refuses to acknowledge my existence.

Wrong move, bitch.

Being sober in a club doesn't have many advantages; however, the bouncers are always willing to listen to a sober man's word. So when I told one that I'd trade him the location of an underage drinker for a Coke, he happily obliged. I pointed her out, and watched from afar as her fake ID was checked and declined. After a small shouting match, I watched as her and her entire posse were escorted out through the back doors.

Needless to say, it was the best Coke I'd ever had.

But then it's clear that she has to figure out what she wants, and the what the 3+ kids in the car want as well. Okay, whatever. It happens. But then she has each of the kids shout out their own order. Why would you do this?! Have the person at the speaker order! Otherwise I have to ask for them to repeat themselves a billion times because they're too far away from the speaker for it to completely pick up what they're saying.

Anyway. It takes about a minute or two for them to look over the menu. Then each kid takes about a minute each to decide what they want, and even once that's done she doesn't know what she wants. Annoying... but at least the cooks are able to start making the stuff the kids want while she orders.

So after a bit of ho-humming she decides she wants a cheeseburger meal. Awesome! Finally done with the order!

.... Nope. Now she's decided she doesn't want one of the kids meals and wants to make one of the meals just larger fries and drink, and instead of a cheeseburger she wants a hamburger. This means we have wasted junior meat and buns and chicken nuggets. Not to mention the cheeseburger has to be remade because you can't just scrape the cheese off...

ninja8ball,94,,265,1cm2qt,,835,"Today, everyone, I finally have a story to share with you!

***Tl;dr.*** *Bitch threw bleach on my clothes in the dryer and she got what was coming to her.*

I joined the Air Force in 2010 and went to my first duty station in 2011. I was stationed at Osan Air Base. Anyway, between joining and getting to Osan, Tech Schoolers usually spend much more on nice things then they probably should. I, too, fell into this trap. I had been poor for the last few years, so having a steady income was great. I purchased neat shirts with a bunch of Air Force and Career Field regalia on it.

Well I settled in nicely to my first duty station, made some friends and even had a girlfriend. Things were pretty good. Girls, sometimes very catty, end up in petty disputes. My girlfriend was not immune to this. This girl, we'll call her **B**, was passively fighting with my girlfriend **L**.

One day, someone stole **B**'s fleece jacket out of the dryer while she was away from her laundry. This wasn't uncommon; people left their laundry in the community laundry room and accomplished errands on their day off. Unfortunately, because of the fighting between my **L** and **B**, my girlfriend was probably first to be blamed.

I can attest that she never had her fleece because, 1) she had her own, and 2) I never saw a third fleece around either my room or hers.

Anyway, sometime in the early spring of 2012, **B** decided to get back at **L** for [not] stealing her fleece jacket. **L** decided to get some of my laundry done and because she was a night shift worker she did her laundry overnight. Like a great girlfriend, she threw in some of my things too, including my uniforms and pricey, tech school t-shirts. When **L** joined me in bed for a bit, before I woke up early in the morning (this is when she planned to pull my laundry out and give me a fresh sand-tee to wear to work), **B** threw bleach in the dryer on (mostly) my clothes, ruining it all.

I suppose it could have been anyone. **L** said she had seen her up and about while **L** was doing stuff and hanging out with other night-shifters. Later on we did catch wind from one of her fickle friends that gave us some circumstantial evidence to further our assumption, nothing concrete however.

My clothes were ruined. **L** lost some stuff too, unfortunately it was mostly my stuff. There wasn't much room for recourse because I didn't have any concrete proof, and my First Sergeant (the sympathetic uncle in the ~~military~~ Air Force* family, if you will, who has some pull between family members) was unwilling to do much about it.

Fast forward to about an hour ago (10:00a.m. CST), my (now) ex-girlfriend **L**, who is still on good terms with me, messages me out of the blue. They're currently deployed together somewhere in the desert. She had this to say to me:

""hey just wanted to tell u what happened to me today...**B** is deployed with me and someone was doing laundry today...just letting u know when she walked away i kinda maybe spilled a little bleach in her washing machine. thought that would make ya smile. l8r""

tlf9888,54,,178,1exip8,,834,"My husband and I had gotten a gift card for Olive Garden, a couple months go by and we finally decided to use it. We were seated and our waitress introduced herself, she seemed really nice, she also seem relatively new. She gets us our menus and asks us if we want anything to drink, I ordered a glass of wine, she carded me (I'm 24) and she goes off to get it. In comes in the bitchy waitress (now referred to as BW); she demands to know, from me, if our waitress carded me, I told her she had and she stalks off. Our waitress is trying to bring my wine when BW stops her within earshot of our table and demands to know from her as well if she had carded me because 'that girl looks 17, are you sure her ID isn't fake?' She assured her it wasn't and that I was indeed old enough to drink. From that moment on BW wanted to complain about everything she thought our waitress was doing wrong. Side note; I've been a waitress, I know it can be stressful at times but it was pretty slow when we were there and I thought our waitress did a great job. BW complained about everything she could; I personally overheard her say our waitress was going fast enough (she was), she didn't talk to us (she talked plenty, I don't go out to eat to converse with the staff all night), she said she put to much wine in my glass (subjective, but I wasn't complaining:D) and had told her on multiple occasions that she could do better. It seemed as though she just wanted to tear her down. That became aggravating because I thought she was doing really well, regardless of her being new or not.

The revenge:

When we finished our dinner we had tipped our waitress 30% because she did very well and we thought she deserved it. On the way out I stopped at the hostess stand and asked for the manager. It took him awhile to get up front but by the time he did BW was near enough so she could listen in (assumedly, of course). I told him, in a voice loud enough for BW to hear, our waitress had done an amazing job and deserved to be recognized for her great work. The look on BW face as we left smiling at her was priceless.

**Background:**
I'm a 21 year old warehouse and shop stocker for (insert famous soft drink company here). I often visit shops for additional work to be done there, thus entering the public.

**The Incident (not an album by PT):**
I was stocking a local supermarket called Víðir. Now, there is a tradition here for young kids, of 4-11 years, to raise money for themselves by creating widespread pockets of super-shitty thrift shops (native: Tombóla). They usually gather outside stores as it is a good place to get customers. 

As I was leaving the store, two boys of maybe 6 years hollered the traditional line ""Do you want to buy items from us?"" to which I curtly replied ""No thank you"" and moved on towards my car. I had not taken five steps when one of them yelled ""You're a fucking cheapskate!"".

Now to interject briefly. I really hate bratty, disrespectful children. Almost nothing irks me more. I was about to tell them to ""Show some goddamn respect!"" when a petty plan suddenly formed in my head.

I decided to put on an act of reacting very childishly. ""Oh, OH?!? Cheapskate? I'll show you cheapskate! How much for the whole fucking thing?"". They were stunned. So I repeated myself: ""How much for the whole lot?!?"". One of them said ""5000 krónur (which is ~40USD)"". I said ""Well for that price you better help me move it to my car"".

They were getting really excited at this point. ""Yes of course we will move it for you!!!"". I nodded acceptingly. They shook uncontrollably, barely containing their glee and began laughing and cheering to one another. Not before long, they would be stuffing their pockets with brand new toys and candy.

I made a flourish of producing my wallet all the while smiling at them. They were still laughing joyously over their success in business. Then, in my outstretched hand was my Credit Card.

""Eh... we can't take those. Don't you have any money?"" one asked.

""I can't pay by card? Awww... that's too bad."" I said in a mocking patronizing way and I walked away. I didn't look back. One of them shouted after me, incoherently, in an angry, sobbing voice.

I decided that I would try to run to the next bus stop to catch the bus there.

So I sprinted hard. I sped round the corner at full tilt, cut across an open green to take the most direct route possible, stormed through a mass of waddling pigeons, and hurdled a waist-high metal gate.

In turn, the bus driver got unlucky with the traffic lights.

Completely out of breath and feeling like Jason Bourne, I managed to reach the next bus stop about 10 seconds before the bus arrived, and I stepped one foot out into the road to make sure he had no choice but to stop.

So my 11-year-old little brother was born 2.5 months prematurely and despite the doctors giving him marginal chances of surviving, let alone developing normally in the event that he should survive, he did and is fully functioning, except he lacks in certain areas, such as drawing and crafting. He draws worse than a 5-year-old in kindergarten, but he can't help it.

The teacher was mortified, blushed harder than Maybelline, but finally managed to stop stuttering and shaking and came out of the class to meet my mother. Just a note: at this point, she had no idea who my mother was or what she wanted, she was just shitting bricks because she knew my mother had heard the how she talked to her students.

So they started talking about my little brother and her remarks and once my mother was done explaining his situation regarding shitty artwork, she handed the teacher her business card with a date and time on the back and told her to be sure to show up.

GeneralDisorder,172,,424,1gusyr,,819,"My kid spent two years in nursery school. She loved it. It was good for us parents too (get the mouthy 5 year old out of the house... hell yes, we'll pay for that service).

The problem though... We had some snooty rich parents (rich here meaning upper middle class) who must have thought that giving gifts to everyone you know was what you do for birthdays. So all 30 of these kids had a birthday. Even the ones whose birthday wasn't during the school year. 

And of course these mothers (in true pinterest fashion) decided they needed to outdo each other. So the favors became more elaborate and more annoying. My kid brought home so much plastic shit for our dogs to chew on it was a damned outrage. I know they either meant well or just likes shoving candy and annoying shit down other people's throats. Still. Every birthday, every holiday, and sometimes just because my kid brings home some bullshit and yells ""It was X today and I got Q from K."" (X is event, Q is annoying gift thing, and K is kid's name who brought it)

My sister came up with a great idea. She said ""you should figure out something glittery to send home with all your kid's classmates"".

We tossed ideas around for weeks before deciding on... 

**SAND ART!!**

Not just any sand art. Oh no. Sand isn't near messy enough and it doesn't stick to everything. We found glitter to match the sand colors and put little baggies together, stuffed them inside baby food jars and tied one bag to the outside. We would have stuffed all the bags into the jars but they weren't big enough. 

Well, the teachers thought ""OMG, so cute and clever..."" 

We didn't have issues with any of the teachers so we instructed the teachers ""do not let the kids have these until it's time to leave."" But we didn't say why until later. When all the other kids were gone we let the secret out as to why we sent Sand Art home with all my daughter's classmates. The sand bags were roughly 25% glitter. Each and every one of them were shimmering, glittery powder kegs just waiting for some impatient tot to grab, rip or spill all of this glitter all over themselves, all over someone's car, someone's house...

MHC-II,72,,218,1oq671,,824,"I worked in the service department at a certified German auto dealership for a year. It was fun job because I got to drive some amazing cars. I was the guy that handled all the money in the service department and took care of the loaner cars. This meant that every customer in the service department got funneled to me. When I wasn't handling clients' cash, I made sure every loaner car was clean and fueled up. It's a simple job, but we're constantly busy. I was able to keep up with the work and keep customers happy, so the manager was always happy to have my back when I needed him.

We had some pretty cool customers. For example, we had a guy with a Carrera GT invite us onto his yacht to watch the 4th of July fireworks. We also had a nice little lady that brought in a plate of ""better than sex"" cake for us every time she visited (this cake really was better than sex). The vast majority of our clients were pleasant, but I've had my fair share of difficult customers as well.

Other than getting to drive 911's and M3's all day, the best part of my job was the petty revenge I got to dish out on the difficult customers. Normally, the car I loaned you depended on the car you brought in (Mercedes gets a C class, Porsche gets a Panamera, BMW gets a 328i, Audi gets an A4). However, the management gave me discretion to deal with customers that were a pain in the ass. We had a couple of Hondas that we kept around just for the difficult customers. If you gave me shit, I might ""run out of Mercedes"" and give you a Honda Accord instead. Hondas are great cars, but there's something about going from German to Japanese that annoys entitled pricks. Of course, it's never my fault that we ""ran out"" of Mercedes, so there's nothing they can do about being stuck with a Japanese car (other than huff and puff about it).

If petty revenge were a competition, I had a winning streak that would have put George Foreman's boxing record to shame. No difficult customer went unpunished. Like George Foreman, however, my winning streak had to come to an end. Our new service writer told me that an out-of-towner hambeast needed a loaner car while we serviced her Mercedes (the new guys always got the new customers so they could build up their clientéle). By out-of-towner, I mean this lady drove two-and-a-half hours north from Irvine to reach us. Kinda strange, but whatever.

Hambeast walks over to my department, where I go over the rental car agreement with her: don't damage the car, no pets, $20 flat fee, etc. When I got to the loaner fee, she flipped her shit. Everybody in proximity turned their heads as she shouted about the $20 fee (Jesus Christ lady. If you can afford a Mercedes, you can certainly afford a $20 rental car). I'm given discretion to waive the loaner fee (if it's a really good customer), but I refuse to give her a free car. She storms off to New Guy and makes him waive her loaner fee.

Whatever. She got her way and didn't have to pay for the car. Hope she enjoys her free Honda... OH. SHIT. We ran out of Hondas, and only had a Mercedes left for her. I had to give her the Mercedes now; there was nothing I could do about it. I knew I was defeated, so I downtroddenly handed her the keys to the C-class loaner car. She snatched the keys from my hand, grabbed her dog out of her car and placed it into the loaner car (NO PETS!!!) and drove off victoriously.

Later in the day, New Guy handed me a pair of loaner keys to check back into the system. They belonged to Hambeast's loaner car. I went over to inspect her loaner car, and found the front seat covered in fur and vomit (I'm only 90% sure it was the dog's fault). Hambeast was nowhere to be found. New Guy ringed her out while I was busy with other customers, and gave her back her own car. This was a huge no-no because I have to check the rental cars for damages before giving the customer back their own car. Hambeast circumvented the loaner car inspection, got her own car back, and escaped before I could discover the dog vomit.

As soon as I told my manager what just happened (and have him ask me why the hell I didn't give her the Honda), he picked up the phone and called her. He demanded she come back to the dealership and pay to get the car cleaned; she refused. You can fuck with the employees all day, but never, EVER fuck with the manager. He banned her from the dealership on the spot. When she heard this, she shrieked in a fit of rage and hung up on us.

Remember how she lived 2.5 hours away from us? Well, we called the dealership in Irvine and asked if they knew about her. They laughed, and told us she was banned from their dealership. They told us that she moved on to the next closest dealership. When they got sick of her shit, she got banned and had to get serviced at the next dealership. Then the next one. Then the next one. She pissed off so many dealerships that she had to drive 2.5 hours north (or jump the border to Mexico) to get to a dealership she wasn't banned from.

Unfortunately for her, the next closest dealership was a 2.5 hour drive north of us. This was great for our business because we covered a large geographical area. But for Hambeast, that meant that if she needed her car serviced, she would need to take another 2.5 hour drive on top of the 2.5 hours she had to drive from Irvine. Five hours of driving just to get to the northern dealership. Joke's on her, though. We warned the northern dealership about her, and they pre-emptively banned her.

We never heard from Hambeast again. Mercedes customers are fiercely loyal to the brand, so there's no way she would sell the car just so she could get another brand serviced in Irvine. Some say Hambeast is still driving up the coast of California, looking for a dealership that'll put up with her shit. Others say she traveled to Nevada to get her car serviced. Either way, New Guy learned a valuable lesson, and never made that mistake ever again.

I work in a movie theater. It's one of my first jobs and I get along pretty well with my do coworkers. All of them except one. Lets call her Suzie. Suzie started working here a couple of weeks after me and I would say that I have learned faster than she has at how to do things. Despite this, Suzie thinks that everything that she does is perfect. She also thinks that she can boss everyone around. Yesterday, she was talking to a customer about how everyone working yesterday with her should have been fired because we all suck at our jobs and are useless. Also, she tried to tell a manager what to do, but once she noticed that he was a manager, she was the perfect angel.

The revenge:

Last night, to close the concessions stands, people are supposed to fill up the ice next to their registers. Some of my coworkers nicely asked me to get it for them since the closest ice machine wasn't working and you had to walk quite a distance to get to the other one. I was more than happy to do this! As I was about ready to go get ice, Suzie turns to me and says ""Hey asshole! Thanks for asking if I wanted ice too. Get me some because mines empty."" Okay whatever I'll just fill up the bucket with ice then. So I trek to the ice machine, fill up a bucket with ice and come back. I should mention that Suzie's register was at the end and mine was right next to hers. So I decided to start on the close registers. By the time I got to mine, I had just enough ice to fill it up. She was helping someone and didn't notice that I didn't fill her's up too. Fast forward to when the manager is checking all of the registers. Hers is the last and he says that she doesn't have ice. She turned and glared at me then started on the journey to get ice. Serves you right.

So I have a roommate, we'll call him Mike, and he is in the national guard as well as being enrolled in the same university as me. We live with two other people in an apartment off campus, fortunately our lease allows us to pay a flat rate for water, electricity, etc... at the beginning of the month. This means we only pay two bills every month, rent and internet.

Being the only responsible person in the household I take care of making sure internet is payed on time personally every month then ask everyone for their parts (11$). Unfortunately Mike doesn't like to pay me for his part of the internet, and I have to ask him regularly. Well October comes and passes and I see not a penny, then November and December come and go. At this point I'm irritated so I confront him.

Me: Mike I really need your internet money

Mike: I don't have it, The Government hasn't sent me my check yet.

Me: When are you going to get it?

Mike: Tomorrow, but I have bills I need to pay. Money's tight.

(this really pissed my off because i know he has spent more money on alcohol in the last week than he owes me for three moths of internet)

Me: I know for a fact you only pay two bills monthly, and internet is one of them. And money's tight for everyone, especially when i spotting you month after month.

Mike: Well I'm not going to pay because **I have to buy books**

Me: Fine...

Assuming they are from the old owners I pick them up and trash them. A few days later I go into the back and notice there are more butts. It's obviously from the neighbors because of where they have landed. Annoyed, I pick them up and trash them. 

That night I take the dogs into the back to do their business. It is late and I see that there is a boy in the neighbors yard, probably 16-18, smoking. I quiet down and wait until he finishes. Sure enough, he throws it into my yard when he is done. He then lights up again. Throws it over. While I am there he smokes 3 cigarettes and tosses them all into my yard. 

I go up to the fence and say politely. ""Hey dude, can you stop throwing your cigarettes into my yard?"" 

Then, nonchalantly, he says ""fuck you."" And goes inside. I was furious, mostly annoyed.

Now that my collection has grown I decide that it is about time to take revenge. Thinking that no one is home, I take the bag of cigarettes, hop on the fence and dump them every where. I had not noticed how manicured their yard was until that moment. It was pristine, well it was before I dumped about a thousand cigarettes all over it. 

I go inside, grinning ear to ear. An hour later there is a knock on the door... I answer it. It is the mother and father of the boy next door. The woman, who saw me from her window, asks why I threw all my cigarettes into her yard.  Her husband looks like he's going to kill me. I told her ""They aren't my cigarettes they are your sons. He throws them into my yard every night and I was just returning them."" 

""That's not possible"" she says, ""our son doesn't smoke!""

On this particular day, I noticed the one I was heading for was out of order because of the large yellow bag placed over the pump handle, so I pulled forward to the second one. About a minute after I stepped out of my car, a huge truck (this is the south, so it was one of those extended cab, elongated side view mirrors, all the bells and whistles kind of truck) pulled up directly behind me and simply waited. There were other pumps, but no. He wanted this one. I don’t mind people waiting but the problem with this guy was that he had his headlights on. Since it’s a suped up truck, his headlights were directly in my eyes. So not only am I now feeling a little freaked out by a guy idling his bigass truck at me, but I can’t really see and the sound of his engine is making me uneasy. I continued on with attempting to get my gas.  I swiped my card and noticed that the buttons weren’t really responding right on the keypad. Every time I tried to enter my pin, the screen would simply refresh. That’s when I looked down and noticed that someone had tied a plain grocery store bag around the hose to the nozzle in an attempt to indicate it was out of order, but the bag had fallen and looked like another piece of trash on the ground. Keep in mind I had been standing there for about 5 minutes fiddling with the buttons and that’s when I heard the man laughing. 

He had his head leaned out his truck window while he smoked a cigarette and said something to his passenger about “Women can’t pump gas”. After hearing this, I felt no particular need to inform him that the pump was out of order. I simply got back into my car and I pulled around to another pump on the other side of the station and watched as the man went through the same game I had. He fiddled with the buttons, repeatedly swiped his card and attempted to enter his numbers, with none of it working. He was pretty persistent too, because by the time I was done filling up my entire tank (from empty), he was still standing at the out of order pump, scratching his head and pressing buttons.

She was also obsessed with the Philadelphia Phillies, so she was immensely pleased when they made it to the World Series one year (this being back in 2008).

I was stuck in the rather uncomfortable situation of having to live with my ex for a further 6 months after splitting up, to run down the lease on the house we were renting at the time. We had been in a rough patch for quite a while, however she secretly initiated an online relationship with some guy in the US she was talking to, and planned to head over there to knock boots with him that Christmas, without telling me where she was going or having the decency to split up with me first. Somewhat luckily for me, I suppose, I found out through some snooping that she was planning this before she got the opportunity to cheat on me. Anyway, enough back story.

Within a month of breaking up, I'd met someone else (my current fiance), but my ex made up a ""rule"" that my new GF couldn't come over to the house or stay over, even if my ex wasn't in that night. (Unluckily for her, I'm a lying bastard and broke that rule frequently.) She generally did her best to make the remaining months living with her infuriating in a great number of ways, inviting other randomers over she met from the internet without asking me and letting them stay alone in the house when neither of us were in, threatening to up sticks, leaving me to pay the rent by myself if I dared complain about any of her bullshit, etc., etc. I was more than sick of the sight of her by this point.

Now, time for the petty revenge I got to exact on her. I was doing a bit of pubic topiary with the kitchen scissors in the bathroom one evening before heading out to see the new GF. I finished up, left the bathroom, and put the scissors next to the sink to be washed up later. My ex-GF is cooking in the kitchen at this point, and asks ""are you done with those? Can I use them?"".

Quick as a flash, I respond, ""sure"", and within seconds, she's using those scissors to cut up some chicken for her dinner. In my head I'm just screaming ""HAHAHA, you're eating my pubes, bitch!!"".

Unfortunately I never got round to telling her this story before she moved out for good, nor the time my current GF and I did it on the dining table there. Ah well.

I figured out a long time ago that from a time/cost standpoint, it takes me longer to feed the little reward tickets back into the game than they are worth, so I usually let them dangle and some kids would come behind me and ASK if they could have them. I usually say yes. These kids that ask politely usually are usually rewarded with 2-10 tickets, sometimes more if they are really polite (I will go out of my way to make sure they get other tickets).

Sometimes though, some kid that has watched me will walk right up as I am working on the machine and try to take the tickets without asking, or will demand the tickets hanging out of the machine. When those kids step up, I will tear the tickets off the machine (or demand them back if they already tore them off) and let them watch as I walk over to a trash can and throw them away. Sometimes I will even let them watch the painstaking process of winding the tickets back in as they watch their free ""prize"" slowly disappear back into the machine.",Don't be a brat.,939,pettyrevenge

Sure, no problem. I made the drink according to spec, and handed it out the window to her....which is when the problems started.

""Excuse me, I ordered a DIET caramel blended coffee"" 

Well yes, lady, that is what I gave you.

""But this has caramel drizzle on top."" 

Actually that's how they're made. But hey, I'm the lowly peon here, so I apologised for the mistake and gave her two options. I could make up a fresh one really quick, or I could scrape off the caramel drizzle. It'd take away a little bit of the blended coffee, too, but it wouldn't be much, and it'd be a lot faster. Drive-through girl obviously goes for the second option, since like many drive through patrons she's in a perpetual rush. Easy fix, I scrape off the caramel and hand her back the drink.

But no, that's not good enough. ""Uh, I want a new one."" What? Why? ""You took out too much of the blended coffee."" I want to note here that the blended coffee was still within a centimetre of the edge of the cup. But fine, the customers always right.

At this point I have to wait for the blender to free up again, and by the time I get the drink out to this girl I have to comp the next person in line. All because she had to get her diet caramel-less caramel blended coffee that goes all the way to the edge of the cup.

12 years ago, I was an A-level student at a ""technical college"" here in the UK studying for my IT and Business a-levels. A friend of mine had another good friend (Who we shall christen ""Ronald"") who was just a general pain in the ass; Head right up his own backside, sense of entitlement, self-declared funnyman and quite sure he was the tough bloke type.

After a few months of borderline attempted bullying (He wasn't bigger than me, whoops) and of me just ignoring it, I snapped, pinned him against a wall in front of about 40 people in a canteen and calmly told him that next time he laid a finger on me, I'd break both his arms.

The attempted bullying then changed to snide remarks thrown from range and nothing but politeness to my face. Fair enough I don't care about that. I'd made my point.

Finishing school, I made it to University and he didn't, but he made sure to go off on one at a few of us about how he was going to get a job working for his uncle, he'd make money, we'd fail hard, the usual rubbish. Completely forgot all about it until Friday night.

My pregnant fiance has had 2 cravings so far - Chicken McNuggets, and Pickled Onion crisps. So Friday night is now McNugget night! And lo and behold, who serves us but Ronald! He gets the order wrong. Forgets my drink. He doesn't recognise me at all (The beard helps). When I'm leaving, I calmly say ""Nice seeing you Ronald, been a while since we were at college together. What ever happened to your job with your uncle? I ended up getting a masters, guess it worked out!"", smirk, and walk out while he stands there with his jaw wide open.

I applied to this one agency and, upon arriving for my interview, noticed that everyone there was young and perky and cute.  Not being young, perky, or cute, I wasn't surprised that when  I emailed my interviewer to follow up, I never heard back from him.  Ok, c'est la vie, movin' on...

A networking contact had gotten me the interview, so I sent him a polite email to thank him and let him know I hadn't gotten the job.  He (unbeknownst to me) sent his contact at the agency an email to follow up.  That person then sent me a scathing email that I needed to stop ""siccing"" my network on him and that he would never, ever hire me and that I should never contact him or his agency again.

I moved on and found another job at a similar agency, got great experience, and am now working as a corporate recruiter at a great company.  Guess which agency has huge turnover amongst the young and cutely perky, and whose young and perky new associates contact me constantly to ask if I'd be interested in a job there (now that I have the mythical experience base).  I've told them every time that I was told to never contact them again so they probably shouldn't call me.

JudgmentalOwl,44,,307,1mtgjm,,796,"I want to make one thing clear before I tell this story. I never considered the girl this is about my friend, and in all honesty thought she was a rude cunt. With that knowledge in hand, let's continue.

My girlfriend's brother's ex wrote all over my car window with a dry erase marker telling me to stop parking like an asshole and pull up more when I parked on the street next to her house.

What this bitch had to have realized is that the reason I never pulled up was because if I did, I'd have to park under a tree that a bunch of shit eating pigeons hung out in. I made that mistake only once and my car was promptly covered in pigeon shit because of this.

I'm guessing she knew this too, but instead of just parking on the other side of the street and walking her fat ass an extra 30 feet to get to the house, she felt it prudent to draw all over my car in an attempt to passively and aggressively intimidate me into pulling forward so that she could claim the spot. A spot mind you that had always been a first come, first serve sort of spot.

I confronted her about this, asking why she felt the need to deface my property by drawing snide remarks all over my car windows instead of just talking to me about it like an adult. She laughed in my face and in the bitchiest tone she could muster said, ""Oh, I was just joking. Couldn't you tell?""

I simply smiled and told her that I didn't like to park under the tree because the pigeons living there dropped more shit from their perches daily than bombs the Luftwaffe dropped on London in all of WW2. I told her the spot is first come, first serve, and that I never once complained when she snagged it first.  I then told her to please wash the marker off of my car and all would be forgiven. Of course, the bitch refuses to clean up her mess, and proceeds to laugh in my face some more. At this point I just walked away because I was starting to get pissed.

Fast forward about a month and I still think about what this bitch did every time I see her pasty, fat face and Sonny Moore wanna be hair cut. So I'm pulling up to visit my girlfriend and notice that super bitch is parked in the good spot, so I park on the other side of the street. As I am getting out, I notice my SO's brother's car is gone and guess he and thundercunt are gone for the day.

As I am walking past the demon bitches car I get this gloriously mischievous, devious idea in my head. I immediately walk up to her door and try the handle and guess what friends? Yes, you got it. She left her fucking door unlocked. I quickly disengage the parking break and proceed to push her shitty civic underneath the pigeons shit stained lair. I giggle like a school girl the whole time and hustle inside when the deed is done. All that is left for me to do now is wait.

Turns out, whore tits and the brother were having a beach day so her car was underneath the shit zone for a good 8 hours. By the time they came home in the evening her car had been covered, caked, and slimed with a full days worth of pigeon excrement. She stormed into the house demanding to know who moved her car. I proceeded to laugh in her face, exclaiming, ""Oh, I was just joking! Couldn't you tell?"" I had the biggest shit eating grin on my face and the whole family just burst into laughter. Needless to say, she was upset with me and stormed off without another word. That day was one that I basked in the glorious light of victory and one that will never be forgotten.

I don't work in retail anymore, but this happened yesterday and it belongs here. 

I was at the local small grocery store for one item. I bought said item and got back in the car. As I was preparing to leave, I see a woman push her empty cart near the sidewalk. The cart corrale was just as far away as the sidewalk, but for some reason this lady thought the sidewalk was the proper place for the cart. Since it was on a slight hill, and a mighty winter wind was blowing, the cart began to roll into the street. The lady watched it roll a few feet and then turned and walked back to her car. 

I'm pretty interested at this point. Will the cart roll into the street? Will a car hit it? Will it hit a car? Will the lady chase after it? 

Yes. 

No.

She was taken to the side right then and there and told, that despite her 'queuing' for 30 minutes, she would not be allowed on to the ride. 

My two friends and I actually took what would have been their places, and had a fantastic time on the ride whilst they watched and glared at us from below.",Queue jumping? I'll wait right until you get to the head of the queue to call you out.,946,pettyrevenge
dongholio,90,,169,1kqgmn,,780,"I was reminded of my own Frys incident from this post:

[Fry's story](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1koky8/my_time_is_worth_your_money_mr_frys_associate/)

Fry's sales associates work on commission.  If they help you pick out something, they hand you a printed ""receipt"" to take to the cashier along with your item, so they can get commission.

When I step into an electronics store, 99.99% of the time, I know exactly what I need and where it is.  That being said, my interactions usually go like this:

&gt;Sales:  ""Hello sir, do you need any help today?""

&gt;Me:  ""No, I got it.  But if you want, you can tag this so you can get the sales credit.""

&gt;Sales:  ""Oh thank you!""

Because it's no skin off MY back to let them earn their bit, right?

A few weeks ago, I had a rather large and expensive battery back up supply and a new monitor in my cart...  Pretty big ticket items.

&gt;Sales:  ""Excuse me sir, I need to scan those items for you, you can't leave this department unless I give you a receipt to take to the register.""

&gt;Me:  ""Nah, I'm OK.""  (Because if she had asked if I wanted help, I would have given her the commission.  But demand it, and pretend that it was policy?  Fuck that)

At this point, she walks over with her hand-held scanner, scans the items anyways, and staples the sales commission sheet to the monitor box.

Well.  On the way to the register, the paper may have gotten torn off and tossed into the bin.",Be helpful? Here's your commission! Demand it? No commission for you!,949,pettyrevenge

One night, he kept taking jabs at me at the dinner table while I was visiting. I was feeling particularly vengeful, so after dinner, while I knew he was getting ready to hop onto Xbox live, I logged into the wireless network at my parents house, and filtered all of the MAC addresses of his Xbox, laptop and phone so that he couldn't connect to the wireless anymore. And then I left to go home.

She was still in the car obviously waiting for somebody who ran inside. I parked my car in what was left of the first spot, right at the nose of her SUV, almost touching. She'd have to back up to pull out. When I got out of my car she waived to me, which I returned with a glare and continued in to the store. 

I completed my shopping and when I came out she was still there waiting. After placing my goods and the 10 foot long CVS receipt into the car I got out my phone and began to pretend to take pictures from all angles. 

She rolled down the window and asked me ""JUST WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!"" 

I replied: ""Gathering photos for my website, RICH BITCHES WHO CAN'T PARK DOT COM""

superjew619,89,,144,18raed,,773,"I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while, and after last Friday I finally have my chance to shine.

I've been working crazy hours recently at my job...coming in at 6:00 AM and leaving around 7:00 PM. I dodge most of the rush-hour traffic on my way to work, but I get caught up in a bit on the last leg of my trip home.

I left work around 6:45 Friday night. The roads were pretty clear, up until a major junction of two highways. There's a big exit on the right for this highway and, being near the tourist capital of the US, people tend to not know where they're going. I always shift over to the left lane before I hit this intersection so I'm not part of the weaving mess of cars.

So now I'm cruising in the left lane. Its dark, rainy, and I'm still going about 5 over the speed limit. Its here that I can see the traffic backup starting about a mile down the road. I let off the gas a bit to prepare to slow/stop for the gridlock. Now someone pulls in behind me from the right lane and decides to drive about 3 inches from my bumper. I'm still cruising at about the speed limit, watching the gridlocked mess ahead of me get closer. This guy decides to not flash his high beams, but leave them on, blinding me. This continues for a minute or so. He finally passes me (on the right) right before we hit the gridlock.

So he comes skidding to a stop and it is here that I decided that the visibility was in fact, pretty low...and I do have fancy HID headlights...so I decided to leave my high beams on. While we were gridlocked. Behind this guy. For the next 8 miles.",High beams highway revenge,917,pettyrevenge

hockeychick44,92,,179,17rruh,,768,"I am currently enrolled in a Chemistry 2 lab at my University, and my lab partner is a thick-headed moron.  
I wouldn't mind working with someone who doesn't understand the material, but he's not *just* stupid. He's lazy, and he's an asshole.  
Examples:  
  
* First day of class, he blunders in 15 minutes late (to an 8am class), shouts his apologies loudly, and then refuses to take the quiz because ""I just transferred in from [another Chemistry 2] class, so I shouldn't be responsible for this quiz."" (all the classes cover the same material). The TA made him take the quiz anyway, saying she wouldn't grade it, and he got a 90% anyway.  
* Second day of class, one of the girls at our table asks if he can move his chair closer to the table so she can walk by, and he shouts that he can't possibly move a chair (with wheels) so she (a 100 pound, little asian girl) can walk by. He then mumbles something rude about her when she walks away.  
  
So, by the third class, I've had it with this guy. Its a Friday morning lab, and I'm not a morning person, so my patience is already worn thin. He decides that he wants to get out of the lab as soon as possible, so he decides that we should only perform the experiment once instead of 3 times so we can get out of there, and just fudge the data.  
Now, I'm all for taking shortcuts, but this is just plain dishonest. But, he's a big guy, really intimidating, so I become a pushover and let him do this.  
The first time we (I) did the experiment, I ""messed up"" and requested that we do it a second time. So, after this, I had data of two experiments, and he had nothing, since the lazy ass won't write anything down.  
As he is surfing twitter on his iPhone, I take out a sheet of paper and say ""I'm writing down the data for your lab report,"" and completely skew my data so his is all off. Add ten here, subtract 4 here, take the average wrong, etc.  
He snatches the paper off the table and runs out before 10am.  
Since it is a 4 hour lab, I still have 2 hours to finish the experiment by myself and do the report. So, I finished it, did the report, and gave it to my TA before 11:15.  
  
I can't wait to see his face next Friday when he gets a big, fat 0 on his lab and I get a perfect.

out-of-phase,80,,137,1h09vg,,768,"So, as someone who has adult ADD, for years now I've been prescribed Dexedrine ER (extended release). I just moved into my current apartment three months ago, and to help with the bills, I found a roommate via craigslist. Let's call him Ron. Ron seemed like a decent guy. He's in his mid-twenties like me, is a musician like me, said he was a clean guy, had a decent 9-5 job downtown. Everything seemed like it would be great.


It was right about a month after we moved in -- one morning I went to take my pill for the day, and noticed that it seemed like there were a decent amount missing. I counted, and sure enough, I was short by 10. I only take 1 a day, every morning before work at 7:30 AM on the dot, and I've never given any out, so I knew something was up.


I asked Ron about it casually, not wanting to sound accusatory. ""Hey man, I just noticed I'm missing a bunch of my ADD pills; have you had anybody over recently who might've taken some? I'm not pissed, just curious!""


""Nope."" He sounded totally uninterested, and didn't even look up from his laptop.


""Alright man. Just checking."" I shrugged it off, even though I knew *someone* or *something* had to have removed ten pills from my bottle. I decided to start keeping them in my room instead of in the bathroom cupboard, just to be safe.


Because of this theft, I had to go 8 days without my pills. I take a relatively low dose, so it wasn't that big of a deal (I didn't go through any sort of withdrawal that I'm aware of), but it certainly threw me off at work. I work with computers and have to deal with quite a lot of text -- something that without Dexedrine I find almost impossible to do without my mind wandering haplessly.


When I finally got my prescription refilled, I made sure to count them out. There were exactly 30, the correct amount for a month. I decided to start counting them every 5 days, so that I could (hopefully) notice if any went missing with some sort of accuracy. Sure enough, when I counted for the second time, I noticed that there were 5 missing. I began to think it could be Ron; I usually keep the door to my room closed, and none of his friends seemed like the type who would go through a stranger's room.


On top of this, Ron and I were already at each other's throats. He turned out to be a lot messier than he initially led on. I'm not very anal about cleanliness; the policy I had adopted with him was sort of a ""do whatever you want in your room, just help me keep the kitchen and living room clean"". He had a hard time adhering to this policy: he would never do his dishes until there were no clean dishes left; he would leave beer cans and pizza boxes all over the living room; he would use my shampoo, bodywash, toilet paper, and *towels*; and he was always so late on rent that I'd have to cover him for a couple weeks each month. He'd torrent things, stream videos, and use so much bandwidth that I could barely use the internet connection *I was solely paying for*. Ron was turning out to be not a very nice person.


I confronted him about the pills again, and this time I was very forward about it. ""Ron, do you have *any idea* why I'm missing 5 of my Dexedrine?""


""No man, would you fucking leave it alone? It wasn't me, okay?"" He was incredibly defensive.


""Alright, alright. If you are taking them though, I need you to stop. I shouldn't have to hide my pills in my own apartment."" I was trying to keep my cool.


""Whatever dude. I'm heading out. Later."" He left.


I decided if I couldn't get him to admit it, and if I couldn't find out who it was, I could at least make them pay for it. I had a plan. I bought some empty capsules from a vitamin shop, and some maximum strength ex-lax pills. I went through the pain-staking process of opening the dexedrine capsules, and putting the little beads into my new capsules. I ground up a bunch of ex-lax pills and filled the old dexedrine capsules with the ex-lax. I only made 7 *fake* dexedrine pills, as I was feeling lazy and it was hard to get the old capsules to stay put back together.


After putting the fake pills back in my original bottle, I put it back on my desk exactly where it would normally be, and put the real Dexedrine in a baggy and hid it. The fake pills didn't look too believable, but I figured whoever was stealing them probably wasn't examining them very carefully anyway. Now it was time to wait.


A mere *three* days later, I get home from work, and go and sit at my computer. I notice that *all* of the fake, ex-lax filled pills are missing. A few hours later, I hear someone go in the bathroom. I immediately hear some of the most awful, disgusting noises I've ever heard in my life, along with some pretty intense breathing/groaning. I go and knock on the door, and say, ""You okay in there?""


""Ugh, yeah, I just have the shits man. *Reallllly* bad shits. It's gonna be a while, sorry."" Lo and behold, it was Ron's voice coming from the bathroom. Victory was mine.


Ron has since moved out. After not paying rent for a month, I explained the situation to my landlord and he asked him to leave. But, for the next two days after the original diarrhea episode, on more than several occasions I heard Ron groaning in the bathroom. I can only assume that he didn't make the connection between the pills and his shits, and continued to take them. Moral of the story: don't steal shit from your roommates, and don't take pills that aren't yours. Not only is it potentially dangerous, but (in Ron's case), *it's just a shitty thing to do.*


**TL;DR: My ass of a roommate keeps stealing my pills, I swap them with laxatives, and instead of a buzz he gets massive diarrhea.**

However there is one secretary that takes great delight in making my life difficult. Let's call her Gargantua because she is large and unpleasant. Gargantua is known as the office bully but because she is the most senior partners secretary, there's not much anyone can do.  

Gargantua has decided recently that I am her favorite target. She hoards her dockets, doesn't tell me when she is out of special order supplies that she keeps at her desk and then complains to my supervisor about turn around times, tries to give me her dictation projects and then take credit for them, makes snide comments about my clothes and is generally just a pain. Her hoarding of her dockets has caused me to be reprimanded. 

So I decided to get even. I've been slightly unscrewing one of the lights above her desk so she'll ask for it to be replaced and then tightening it back when engineering comes to replace it.

therealac,32,,156,1iwc8v,,767,"My husband worked for a company that required him to be on call every other weekend. He sometimes worked up to 70 hours in a week. He was a good employee, he was on time, dependable, helped with certain jobs when he didn't have to - nothing to warrant the treatment he received when it was time for him to move on from the company. 

As soon as the company discovered that my husband had put in his two weeks, his managers treated him like shit. They cut his hours as much as they could in the first week in an attempt to punish him (no hours = no money). Because they had already cut his hours so low, he decided to not work the second week and help me pack. Our son was barely an infant at the time and I had no family around to help, so it was the logical decision for us.

The second week a big job came in and they needed him. My husband said no. A few weeks later, when it was time to receive his final paycheck, we received a check in the mail that said ""VOID 000.00""
My husband wanted to let it go (??) but I knew that shit could not be legal. Sure enough, I found the state and federal laws and discovered that ""deductions"" from a paycheck can not total more than minimum wage. Translation: People have to be compensated at least minimum wage for the hours they worked. You can't just take shit from them. 

So I sent an email, explaining that I required all contracts my husband signed and all the deductions that were taken from his paycheck. They sent me an email that explained that they took out 700 dollars worth for uniforms and tools and ""Damage at a job."" The uniform stuff was legit, the tool stuff was iffy, but the vague ""damage at a job"" was definitely not legit. My husband had not signed a document that acknowledged he was in possession of the tools (my husband said that he did not have any of the tools they claimed he did, nor was he aware of any damage he had done. They had not made him aware during the course of employment, but when it was over, they decided he was responsible.

I called our state's department of labor, read them the email, and asked what I should do. The department of labor person was all, ""Ohhh no. Get yo money girl. Give them this information (information about the laws) and if they don't send you a check, we'll give them a call.""

So I sent an email. The email I received back was something along the lines of ""Well he caused 40,000 worth of damage at a job, so we're being nice enough by only charging him 400."" I sent an email asking first of all: What job was it? When did it occur? Did you charge the other employees for it? Please send documentation of the damage, proof that it cost what they claimed did, proof that my husband was in possession of the tools they claimed he was in.
I received no response.

Called the department of labor back, and that afternoon I received an email from the company.

I took that moment to creep my truck over to the right.  Not to stop him, but because I knew something he didn't.  Right in front of me was a St. Louis County cop car, and I didn't want that asshole to see him.

Anyway, there's this Junior in my Freshman Algebra class. Let that sink in your mind for a second. Not only is he a complete idiot, he's a jerk, the kinda guy who always wants your gum and says ""nah screw you"" if you ask for some of his. Anyhow, in that class we were having a big midterm test that I had studied quite a lot for. I sit next to him, and he always copies off of me. And he makes it completely obvious as well, he even asks me to move my arm sometimes. Anyway, when I sit in my seat in the begging of class, the first thing he says to me is ""Dude, I didn't study for this test at all, and I might need some help, if you know what I mean."" Then he smiled this smile that basically said ""I'm going to copy off of you and you can't do anything about it."" So I go to the teacher and politely ask to move seats. She says yes I can, so I go take a seat in the back where no one is near me. Before the teacher hands out the test, he asks to use the restroom. She says ""Yes, do it quickly please."" She explains the test and how we sit quietly after we finish and no food or cell phones ect. As she is handing out the tests, I see the jerk come back in the class room, and I kid you not, sit RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I stand up to move back to my old spot and the teacher immediately tells me ""Please stay in that spot until the test is over."" I walk back and see the jerk with the biggest smug grin on his face. At this point I'm pretty pissed, and before I start the test I try to think of what I could do to screw him over.

The test is composed of two parts-The test booklet, and the answer sheet. I look over at him and sure enough, he is just staring at my test booklet, waiting for me to start writing down answers. I start solving the problems and writing down the correct answer on my answer sheet, but on my test booklet, in big letters, I write the incorrect answer. Sure enough, he copies down the wrong ones. I do that for the duration of the test. But my revenge was not yet over.

The next day, we all came in and the teacher had a graph on the smart board. She uses a program that show all the test scores in a way that is anonymous. Most are in the 90-70 range, but all the way on the right is 1 single 8%. I was smiling the biggest smile as I saw the look of horror on the jerk's face as he got his test passed back. Moments later he turned to me and said ""Man, that test was pretty hard, wasn't it?"" I looked at him and smiled while saying ""Not really."" I casually moved my hand so he could see the 92% on my paper. His faced turned the brightest colour of red and he just turned and stared forward for the remainder of class. And the icing of the cake was hearing the teacher talk to him about it as I left the room. I didn't hear all of it, but what I did hear were the words ""Lowest score on this test EVER."" And that is why he doesn't copy off of me anymore. :)

Everything went fine for him. Everyone was keeping it quiet and until it started throwing errors at weird times. Suddently IT starts getting all sorts of emails requesting these errors to be fixed.

My sister is openly gay, and has been for 7 years. Everyone in our family knows, and everybody is happy for her coming out. After all, how does it affect them?
Everyone is happy for my sister, except for my Grandma.
My Grandma is a nice caring lady, a vegetarian to care for the animals (important), always looking after people, and don't get me wrong is a great woman. Except for the fact she is ridiculously homophobic, to the point that if a character in her favorite show turns out to be gay, or even the actor, she stops watching it immediately. Everytime she visits, she gets into a rant on who homosexuality is wrong, and everyone's going to hell and the usual rubbish. All of this, in the presence of my sister. The outcome is normally my sister being uncomfortable, and us steering the topic, but we've confronted her about ""keeping her views to herself"" and warned her not to talk about something so personally, so negatively. 

THE INCIDENT:

One particular visit, we were ready to have our Sunday roast and she got into the usual rant on how she saw a ""poofter on the bus"" and immediately decided to get off and wait. Oh, also note that my Granddad, her Husband, thinks homosexuality is fine and is proud of my sister. She then started berating how that if people don't change their viewpoints, they're going to hell, and their's no excuse because ""It's a choice!"".

THE REVENGE:

Instead of giving her a nice helping of Quorn (Vegetarian meat replacement), my sister decided to give Grandma a nice big helping of roast chicken, and drowned her plate in chicken gravy. Of course, my Grandma, none the wiser ate everything on her plate, and asked what kind of new brand the ""meat"" was. At which point, my sister said ""Chicken and chicken gravy"". Grandma was devastated and started spluttering how she's a vegetarian, at which point my sister exclaimed ""Oh, but vegetarianism is only a choice!"" and gave her a big shit eating grin. Grandma's face proceeded to turn crimson, and worked out why this had happened. She then muttered something about going to the bathroom, where we all had a good giggle.

TimAus,47,,195,1n5ugj,,761,"Many years ago a few friends and I were out drinking. I was in a round with two of my friends, one who I've been friends now since we were six years old. We'll call him Chris because that's what his name is. The other friend is Ryan.

Things were going smoothly. We were all finishing our drinks at roughly the same time and everyone was doing their part to make sure there was a drink in front of the other two when it was their turn to go to the bar. Suddenly Chris decides that he doesn't want to go to the bar to get his round. Ryan and I are shocked at this turn of events. ""But it's your turn, Chris"". ""Nah, I'm out"". 

I guess it's OK to opt out of the round. Ryan goes to the bar to get a drink for the two of us. We finish that and I get up to go to the bar. Chris says ""Can you get me a JD"". This really sent me into a spin. The nerve. ""You can't just jump back in the round like that"". To which Chris replies ""Just get me a JD"". That was the last straw. Game on, mother fucker.

So I head to the bar and Ryan follows. It was here we decided to enact a plan which was aptly named ""Operation Dry Hump"". I came back to the bar and gave Chris his drink. Ryan and I sat there and pretended like nothing was wrong while Chris sipped away like the happier cheap fucker that he was at that moment. The face he made really irked me. That face you make when you taste the alcohol. The one where you scrunch your face up. ""Enjoy your drink, mother fucker"" I thought to myself. 

Little did Chris know, he was drinking a tiny little glass of coke with ice. It turns out that when you are tipsy enough, you don't actually notice that there is no JD in your drink. For the rest of the night Chris received one JD and coke from himself and two small glasses of coke from Ryan and I for each round.

For the next six months we carried this on. We'd wait until Chris was a little bit tipsy and then start substituting his drinks with little glasses of coke. It was surprising how well it worked (and how much money I saved!).

When Chris found out he stared blankly for a good five seconds as the last 6 months of his life replayed in his head. It was magnificent watching him come to grips with how perfectly and completely we had made him pay for his indiscretion.

bilged,46,,142,1f12hz,,755,"This happened several years ago but still makes me chuckle. I worked in a control/monitoring function at a financial firm. We had a system that monitored transactions, and if an issue was found, it would send an email to the person responsible for issues with that particular account. The monitoring team and the ops person's manager would get a summary email organized by team. 

So one day a mistake occurs. It turns out that an email address was in the system wrong, an issue was missed and it cost the company some money (not a huge loss but enough to raise some flags). We promptly correct the error and institute an auditing process to make sure it doesn't happen again.

However, this isn't good enough for one of the account managers. He basically goes off in a big rant to all the team heads about how the monitoring system can't be trusted and how people aren't doing their jobs. He then demands to get email copies of issues reports. Keep in mind his role is really quite separate from the ops group.

So we add him in as a CC in the system, but instead of just the summaries, he's now getting a copy of every email the thing generates. 2 days later he humbly comes by our little cube and asks to be taken off the recipient list. We checked and he was getting about 500 emails per day.",Revenge on overbearing manager,897,pettyrevenge

That was one of the first papers) She actually took me outside and asked me if I actually believe in such nonsense and I said yeah.  

Well she didn't like me after that, she would pick on me constantly, I was late once and absent once while many others would come in late all the time and miss classes, yet when I did that she raised hell (lol) and just tried to embarrass me. A few times I let my friends copy my homework and I'd get a lower score than them.
One day I told her that my answers were the same as other people's on a homework but I got points taken off and they didn't. She first accused me of cheating and then wanted me to show her who has the same answers. I declined not wanting anyone else to fall under her radar.  

So that was a very brutal semester for me, I tried to work my ass off to at least get a C. I would answer all her questions about the readings, I participated in all the discussions. She told me I didn't and a girl gave her a WTF? look and when asked what's wrong she defended me saying that I'm always prepared for discussions, probably more than most people there.  

A few of my friends from my table tried talking to her midway through the semester, and their assignments started to have slightly lower scores.
By the time the final paper came I was super pissed but decided to just make that the best paper I've ever written, even though that was only a 5-8 pages essay. I worked my balls of, I had people from the Help Center read it, I had my English professor read it (He knew what was happening and decided to help me because she and him didn't get along well) and he fixed the hell out of it. I of course wrote about how I don't really believe in God, but also how I like different religions and what we can take from the bible etc.  

Bitch gave me a C on that which is what I had in that class. I went straight to her office, she wasn't there so I waited. Then my English professor came by and asked me what I got. He looked pissed as hell even though he is the nicest guy in that school I got kinda freaked out. He told me to come back at 5, and said that he has a meeting with her then so to just come into his office.  

I go in, she gives me a dirty look as usual, and he asks me to sit down next to her. He actually printed out copies of my paper and made her read it out loud to him and tell him what was wrong with it. She tried to refuse but he was the head of the department. I think he was just doing this for fun but he would stop her every once in a while saying things like ""This can't be right. Oh no it's good keep going"" or ""Wait do you think that's correct? Does that sound right to you?"" We were in there for like 30 mins and after we went through the whole essay he asked me to step outside.  

The people passing the office looked mortified as they heard the professor yell at the nun, call her names etc while I tried my best not to piss myself from laughing.  

He then called me in, and went through the paper with me again showing me that I missed a comma here and there, and then just commented me on the good ideas and then turned in my newly graded paper.

As I just came out of the bank I wanted to make sure I had my papers in order thusly not putting it in reverse the second I got in my van.

BEEP BEEP goes the Caddy. I look over my right shoulder and see the car with blinker on to go into my spot when I leave. I continue reading my deposit slip and hear BEEEEEEEEEEP. I wait a few more agonizing seconds (for the Caddy owner not me) and drop 'er down into reverse.

I begin my painfully slow backup. And then pull a three point back up turn to get myself straightened up. However, on the third back up I inch slowly towards the Caddy and as I get pretty close I hear BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP. I continue on my reverse journey and see the Caddy start to reverse to avoid me all while horn a blaring. 

Just then, another vehicle pulls in the lot. Remember I am slowly backing up and so is the Caddy. Caddy stops and I get as close as I dare. Just then, an elderly lady drives in the wrong way and eyes my now vacant spot. She stops, looks at me and I wave her in. It was the only spot vacant in the small lot (street parking is plentyfull but is meter parking and the lot is free).

I know the driver of the Caddy did not see the lady take the space as they were staring at my backside. At this point I noticed my rear window was a bit dirty so I pretty much emptied the washer fluid onto my back window and the hood of the Caddy. I slowly pull away and reveal my magic.

I work at a special needs baseball facility. We have fields for people with special needs, and regular baseball fields for people without special needs. 

I'm a manager in the concession stand at the fields, so I have some power there, and am relatively high up. I also have a sister that was playing in a game. So whenever she came up to hit, I wanted to get some pictures of her. 

I walked up to the fence behind the plate, and crouched down and got out my iPhone and started taking pictures of her. Behind me, there was an obese lady with her obese husband, sitting about 10 feet behind me in the shade, with their lounge chairs or whatever. The lady said to me, ""You can move now. She's done hitting."" I was kind of confused, because I didn't think she was talking to me. Then she repeated herself. I turned around and said, ""Is this your son hitting?"" She said no. Then I said, ""If your son is up, I'll move. But she's not finished until she touches home plate. So I'll take my pictures, then I'll be gone. If you really have a problem with it, go to the concession stand and complain to the manager.""

tealighttrees,78,,120,13kw5g,,756,"I was doing laundry the other day, at a laundromat that was uncharacteristically busy. There were few dryers available, so I placed my basket in front of the dryer I planned to use in literally two seconds. I just needed to grab my clothes from the washer and transport them to the dryer. Seriously. Two seconds. 


So I grabbed my wet clothes and turned back toward the dryer (a mere 5 feet from me) and some woman had come up, kicked my basket across the laundromat and was loading her laundry into my dryer. All of the other dryers were taken, so this meant I would have to wait 20 - 30 minutes for a dryer to be free. I was really busy that day, and in no mood to deal with her shenanigans. 


An important thing to note about the dryers at this particular laundromat: if you don't hit the start button when you close the door, your time still counts down, but your clothes don't actually dry. 


So this woman puts in 5 or 6 quarters, presses the start button and then heads out for a cigarette or some such. I take this opportunity to open the dryer door, which stops the drying process, and close it again without hitting the start button. 


I watch the dryers like a hawk and as soon as one becomes free, I load my stuff up. In 20-30 minutes the woman returns to her dryer, finds her things still sopping wet, assumes the dryer is broken, and as such -- in her eyes, anyway -- there are no dryers available. She has to sit and wait for nearly 45 minutes before a dryer becomes available.

proROKexpat,190,,428,1lmuzf,,757,"In my senior year my entire math class cheated off of me (at least 80% of them) it got to be annoying and my teacher didn't really seem to care. So I hatched  plan most of those kids needed a really high score on the final to pass for the year.

The final was something like 25% of your grade and with a 98% in the class I could afford to fail the final

However many of the students needed to ace this final to pass for the year. So I completely bombed on the test, I got every single answer wrong on purpose and the majority of the class failed. 

Something like 7 kids in the class had to redo senior year because of their cheating ways.

After the teacher graded the tests he had a little chit chat with the students about this is what happens when you cheat, it'll bite you in the ass. He also gave me a B to keep my GPA up since he knew I bombed the final on purpose. 

Now whenever I consider cheating on something I think about those 7 kids who got to repeat senior year cause they cheated off of my work.

Edit (notes)

1. Cheating was done openly, kids next to me would blatantly copy and then pass their test. A few times in the semester I just handed my test off to some kid and told him to have fun.

2. It was a remediable math class I got placed in (believe me I was no over achiever) 

3. This was the 2nd and last year of teaching for this teacher. Met him a few months later and he had found a job at a IT firm. He really didn't give a shit.

4. Grade system was: 25% Quiz 25% homework 25% semester project 25% final so if you copied my quiz you got 25% if you turned in half your homework you got another 12.5% (homework wasn't graded, just accepted) and if you got say a 70% on the semster final you got 17.5% and that left you with 55 which basically meant you had to do well on the final.

They scammers told me they worked 9-5, M-F, so when I picked up the phone on Saturday morning I was surprised to hear my ol' pal. ""Sir, let me tell you. About your Windows security. We need to help you."" Etc.  I started by telling him how impressed I was that he was calling me on a Saturday, but he assured me his office was open to help me. 

I was planning some errands and didn't have time to muck about with the computer, so I told him it was a bad time. Would he offer to call back? I was curious to see how he'd respond.

He said something about Windows warranty and activating it. ""Well now, my computer is ... let me think ... two and a half years old? My cousin gave it to me for Christmas ... it wasn't this past Christmas, I know that, but was it the Christmas before or the Christmas before that?""

""Sir!""

""My cousin knows more about computers and he picked this one out for me, but ...""

""Sir! Let me tell you ...""

""I figure it's been at least two years. How long does a Windows warranty last? It's only like a year or something, isn't it? I'm sure this one is expired.""

""Sir! The Windows warranty needs to be activated.""

""You know, my fridge had a *ten* year warranty. That was a good fridge and it lasted longer than ten years. I think we got at least fifteen years out it so I didn't mind when it didn't work so good any more. I tell you, though, it was a pain to move. I'm just glad ...""

""Sir! Please, let me help you. You need to activate ...""

""So the warranty is no more good, right?""

""No. Sir. Please. You need to activate the Windows warranty and it will cover you for three years for ten dollars, five years for fifteen dollars and a lifetime warranty for twenty dollars. Which one do you want to choose.""

""Ten dollars for one year and only twenty for lifetime? That's a good deal!""

""No sir. Ten dollars for three years ..."" he repeats the script.

I ponder over whether or not to get a new computer and he assures me that the warranty can be transferred to the new computer. How convenient! I tell him how happy I am to hear that and if he can tell me how much a new computer costs since my cousin, etc. He says three hundred bucks for a new laptop and the warranty can be transferred. 

He wants to know if I want the three-year, five-year or life-time warranty. I muse again about whether I should fix this one or just buy a new one. I mean, if the warranty will fix this computer than I don't need a new one, but it would be nice to have a new one and my cousin would be impressed, etc.

He pesters me for a decision and I have to admit that I'm not sure and really should discuss it with my wife because she uses the computer, too, and maybe I should ask my cousin, etc. He does his best to interrupt me but I keep rambling in in Grandpa Simpson mode.

""Are you married?"" I ask, hoping to throw him off his script.

""Yes sir. Now, I need you to make a decision. Do you want the ...""

""So you know what it's like, right? You can't make any plans without ...""

""... or the lifetime warranty. Sir! I need you to make a decision!""

I go about something else and he's practically yelling into the phone about needing me to make a decision and which credit card I want to choose. I string him along for as long as I can, but I really do need to get going. 

""Well, you know, I'm just heading out the door and I only picked up the phone because I thought you were my sister. She was supposed to come by this morning and I don't know if she's late or ...""

""Sir! It will only take a moment. I just need you to tell me which credit card ...""

""You see, I have this ceiling fan I bought and it doesn't work. I was going to return it yesterday but the weather was really bad and if I don't return it today I might not be able to so I have to really get to ...""

I swear I heard him yell ""Shut up!"" at least once. I pretended not to notice and suggested we should try again another time after I talk to my wife and maybe discuss the situation with my cousin because he knows about computers, etc., etc. 

I had the bastard on the line for at least half an hour. I have a recorder around her somewhere. If I can get it working, I'll try to get the whole conversation recorded next time. Sorry I can't do voices and am a terrible stand-up comedian, so it won't be funny ... just petty.

After the kids go back outside I peek out the window to see what is going on. 

I see 5 boys walking by. They give my kids the finger and call them names. One of them walks into the yard and kicks my daughters barbie. Another kid says that his Dad is a member of the township board so he's allowed to go into any yard he wants. (The kids dad just shows up at township meetings and complains all of the time. He is not a member of the board.) Then they walk away to make another trip around the block. My daughter is so pissed off at this point that her hands are in fists and I'm worried (or maybe hopeful) that she is going to hit one of the kids.

Here's where it gets petty. I call my kids inside and hand them each a bag of cotton candy that I had left over from the fair. The bags are huge and I know I'm going to have to deal with the after math of them consuming to much sugar but I don't care at this point. I send them back outside to enjoy their treat. Then sit and wait for the revenge to happen.

Of course the kids walk by again but before they can say anything my son yells ""Look What I Got"" and holds up his bag of cotton candy. The boys are all the sudden friendly and ask if they could have some. My son smiles and shakes his head, but my daughter being the sweet and forgiving girl that she is, is thinking about it. That's when I stick my head out the door and say ""You can't share any of that. I don't know if there parents will let them have it.""

Tightanium,87,,250,1pm6r8,,747,"I was out running errands last weekend, enjoying my time off from a stressful work week. I was walking out of the grocery store when I see a middle aged lady with grocery bags. she was looking through them, probably for a specific item because she made this face and began rummaging through her purse. she had maybe 5 or 6 grocery bags, and when she decided to go back in (i'm assuming for the missing item) she started taking the items out of their bags, placing them in her car, and just dropped the empty bags on the ground and locked her car and went back in.


okay bitch, game fucking on. 

it was time to do some recon. I snag the bags she left, put them in my car, and go in to see how far along she was on her second store trip. she was in the back of the store, in the dairy, milk, frozen section. PERFECT. I had AT LEAST 15 minutes. I headed to the tools/appliance section and immediately looked for some duct tape, clear tape, masking tape, whatever. 

I grab the clear tape, since it's by far the best (the kind that you use with tape guns) and I check out. I look around at the registers for the lady but she isn't around, meaning she's still shopping. again, PERFECT. I go out to my car, and grab her bags. the way she was parked made it so that she would walk up to the front of her car, she wouldn't even see the back. so I took the tape, cut some off, and taped one back to the underside of her car in the very back. I made it so that maybe if for some reason she was back there she might not see it. I proceeded to do this to each of the bags, so that when she gets going on her journey the bags will just be flapping in the wind and she will never know until someone tells her or she investigates herself. so I waited in my car for her to come out, and as luck would have it she didn't even get near the back of her car. she started it up, and zoomed off out of the parking lot. I follow her for maybe 2 miles, as I turned off the street toward my place, she still hadn't noticed, and the 6 bags were just a flappin in the wind.

I didn't really want to stand behind her Royal Highness, so I tried to walk past her but her god damned bags were in the way, and she was standing right in the middle of the path.

Now I'm pissed. It wasn't enough that she took up the entirety of the escalator, which in itself was almost commendable seeing as she was the size of my arm. No, she had to be intentionally rude and obnoxious while expending the same amount of effort in shooing away a fly to dismiss me.

There is an excellent smoothie stand at the top of the escalators I knew Ms Shit-For-Brains was heading towards since she was prattling on about whatever crossed her mind, which I presumed only ceased when something was put in her mouth.

They get victims to allow a remote computer to access their machine and install whatever spywear and malware they want. I had some free time so I thought I'd entertain myself.

When he said he wanted me to open my computer, I told him ""OK, but this will take a little while."" I'd make all sorts of metal-sounding noises and grunt occasionally. ""OK, it's open. Now what?"" It took several minutes of nothing happening and my naive descriptions before he clued in to the fact that I had taken the case off my computer and unplugged it from everything. Actually, I was just doing the dishes. 

It took several more minutes to get the case back on and figure out which wires went wear. ""You know, my cousin set this up for me so I don't know about it so much. It's pretty hard, you know."" 

""Now how is it you know that my computer has problems?"" He goes on about TCP/IP and whatnot and I'm baffled, of course. ""Does that mean Microsoft is spying on me? No? That how come you know my computer is so slow."" He goes on about junk files but his pronunciation is so bad that I hear something entirely different and have to make him spell it phonetically. ""Oh, *junk files*. I thought you was saying something different.""

My computer is very slow, naturally, so it takes some time to boot. ""OK, I'm putting in my password ... dang, I spelled it wrong. Just a minute. Dang, I got the big letter key stuck or something. It does that sometimes. Say, how come they have that key anyway? Why's it so big? How come it's so much bigger than the Delete key? I use the Delete key a lot more than that one. Hell, I never use that one.""

Can I control stuff with that? My buddy can control his TV with his computer. Is that what that's for? That should probably be a big key if it's so important ... bigger than that big letter key, anyway.""

He hands me over to another tech and I have him go through the issues about my computer again and he has to step me through the process.

When I press the Windows key, I'm careful to release it before pressing ""r"" so instead of the ""run"" dialog box, Windows pulls up all the  programs starting with the letter R. It takes some minutes for the tech to figure out what I've done. I finally get the Run command. I'm supposed to enter a web address and he gives me every letter phonetically and makes me repeat it back. ""Yeah, I got it, shown my pc, spelled SHOWN ... MY ... PC."" He hears that as showmypc and can't figure out why it's not working. After several re-spelling we get it right. 

At this point I'm editing some images and can quickly jump between his requests and my real work on the computer. So, I'm not wasting too much of my own time.

""Yeah, well, something popped up, but it's all white. What? Oh, it says something about not being able to find it."" After some re-tries I ask if my computer should be connected to the internet.

He's still on the line when I get back. ""Naw, she says she's too busy. I don't know why she so busy when this is so important."" I ramble on about something. I have no luck connecting to shownmypc (of course) so he tells me he's going to transfer me to another technician. During the transfer I hang up. He calls back a few minutes later, apologizing about losing me. 

I make the new tech run me through the commands to get to ""run"" and I screw 'em all up again. Just when we get to the point where he can almost taste the access to my machine, I start into a rambling story and hang up. He calls back a minute later and apologizes. I go back to my story and just as we get to the climax, I hang up again. 

Before he gets a chance to call back, I call a talkative friend and spend an hour shooting the breeze. Within minutes of hanging up, the phone right. I let the machine get it, but the caller does not leave a message. It rings again and again and still no message. I'll wait until later today and pick up the phone and make up a good story. 

I wonder how long I can keep this fish on the hook?

purdueaaron,61,,152,19qve0,,746,"I used to work as a data entry drone at a mid sized office.  Mind numbingly boring, but hey it paid the bills in college.  In this office there was a guy that was the jokey joke guy.  He would hide annoyatrons and whoopie cushions, all that jazz.  Well, Jokey Jokerson found a Shock Pen some place and was working it through the cube farm.  The guy across the hall from me had gotten zinged with it and it wasn't a light zing.

A couple of days after he got hit, I found that my couple of pens were out of place and a new shiny metal cased pen was there in their place.  I quickly deduced that Jokey was trying to get me.  I politely returned his pen and told him I didn't want to play the game.  Went back to my desk and thought it was over.  He got found out and called out.

That Friday the pen shows up again.  I again take it back and tell him that he doesn't want me to play his game because I play to win.  He chuckles and says ""Whatever, I'll get you with it soon enough.""  Being so challenged I stopped by the supply closet and took a couple of pens that matched the one that Jokey used.

Over the weekend I gutted out a pen and rigged a Booby Trap firecracker into the body of the pen so that when the cap was pulled off it'd pop.  Nothing explosive, just a sharp crack.  However I decided that I would give him a final chance.

It was about a week before I saw the pen again. Jokey had played his hand well, but I was ready for him.  When the pen showed up again I went back to his office to return it he wasn't there.  So not only did I leave his shock pen, but I dropped off my rigged pen while also taking his matching one.

About an hour later I can hear him talking loudly on the phone and then BLAM! followed by a string of profanity and then a rapid apology.  Turns out Jokey Jokerson was on the phone with a client and went to write something down.  With a phone in one hand he put the cap of the pen in his mouth and pulled to open it.  That sharp crack was amplified just right somehow in very close proximity to his face.

He came by my desk and demanded to know if I had rigged the pen.  I put on my best poker face and let him know that I'd have no idea where to buy a trick pen like that and that I hope that he's ok.  And man these tricks are getting crazy in here I wonder if they should stop before someone gets hurt.  Somehow I pulled every bit of deadpan that exists in my being and kept it perfectly straight faced.  He later blamed it on another guy he kept trying to hit with the shock pen.

Dumb_bunny,37,,111,138e68,,742,"I had just turned 18 when I ran off and married my high school sweetheart. It was really against everyone's wishes but our own- and rightfully so. It was truly a horrible decision, but we were young and in love. 
It was much to his mother's dismay, as well, that it happened. She was a very young mother and he was her only son. She must have felt like I was taking him away from her. I would, time and time again, receive emails from her describing how great of a wife she was to his father, and how I could never live up to that. She would say insensitive things to me, and even subtly imply that I was not good enough for her son. Needless to say, I never really had a rapport with her at all.

And yes, our marriage went downhill, and we split. The divorce was painful and rocky for both of us. It was a mutual decision because the stress of rushing into adulthood was too much on our relationship. I didn't hear from his mother much anymore, and started to get over him, while we were going through our divorce. This is when I found out from a mutual friend that while we were married, my ex husband had an affair- with a child on the way!

This really made things much harder to cope with, as the divorce was nearly over, and I was almost done with the whole ""mourning"" process of it all. 

To top it all off, my ex husband's mother found out where I worked, and would show up about once a week, pretending that she was there for ""business"" reasons, when she would just sneer at me while otherwise pretending not to know me.

Turns out, she knew nothing of the little ray of sunshine my ex husband had created with his bang buddy, which set up a lovely retort when she finally chose to speak to me. She finally approached me, and stated, as if to clarify, ""So I heard it was my son who decided to divorce *you*."" And although my stomach twisted into a million knots, and I felt like I could toss a whole slew of angry word vomit her way, I simply stated: ""I heard it was your son who decided to make you a grandmother."" Her expression- and the silence- oh, it was golden.

burnafterreading91,77,,127,130jf5,,735,"I'm going to preface this by saying that we all most likely drive above the speed limit. However, most of us aren't stupid enough to take it to the extreme.

Last night, I'm about to get onto the freeway, and this king douche passes me on the shoulder going at least double the speed limit, to cut in front of me getting on the entrance ramp. I'm honestly surprised he didn't clip me with his car...he really pissed me the fuck off.

Once we get onto the highway, he moves over to the left lane and starts booking it. He's in a Ford Taurus though, so 'booking it' is subjective. I easily catch up to him (sports car), and I flip on my brights (high beams + rally lights) to get his plate number, most likely blinding him in the process. At this point, we're probably going 110, and I must have irked him further, because he slammed on his brakes and reduced his speed to 20mph, cutting over when I would in an effort to hit me / run me off the road. I finally get in front of him and easily outrun him trying to chase my ass down. 

Now I'd been on the phone with dispatch for a few minutes, letting them know exactly what was going down. They informed me they had an officer waiting on the next entrance ramp for him. I timed coasting down to the speed limit, so when this colossal douche shot by me (while swerving into my lane, mind you), he did it directly in front of the cop. He immediately got lit up, and I drove by with my dome light on and my finger up high.

Petty revenge felt good. I don't give a flying fuck if anyone speeds, I'm a lead-foot myself. But don't endanger other lives, and don't drive like a complete twat.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that the dispatcher said that he (or at least whoever the car was registered to) had outstanding felony warrants, and told me to back off.

YesYouCannot,204,,218,1r7zub,,733,"So I have an 11 year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat, especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction. If you tell him to get off his PS3 at 2am on a school day, he'll chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over. Sometimes when you give him helpful advice he'd palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what you're telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn way.

Anyway, the other day he was at home on a school day. I woke up when his mum (he and his mum live in the house with us) had already left for work. I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home (something he does a lot, and something she gives in to a lot). After having to experience this many times, I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS3. I decided that even though I wasn't certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day, I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother (my mum and owner of the house) entitled him to a bit of karma... So I turned off the router. He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either. It was great. The entire day he was at home, I heard barely a sound from his room... also, the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the better.

Later during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house (some 6 hours after he had been awake), I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends. It was very civil and didn't involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when he's gaming with them. I was impressed by his good behaviour. He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet. He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone (his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour). I palmed it off and said I didn't know because I didn't want him to know how easy of a solution it was, but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house. I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home, he had been relatively good today (compared to other days) so I figured I'd cut him some slack.

As I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left, he approached me, asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it. He was very polite at this point, so I was quite happy to help him. I continued to say I didn't know what was wrong with the internet but I'll check soon, and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS3 to his mobile for internet. He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me ""You can't do that. I've tried it and it doesn't work."" I told him yes you can. I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time. I told him my friends connect their PS3's to their mobiles all the time too (a lie, but I just wanted him to know that you can do it). He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PS3's cant do that. So I told him that if his PS3 connects through WiFi, then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet. I spent around 5 minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him. I ended up snapping at him. ""Fine. You know what? If you're going to have that attitude when I try to help you, then I'm not going to bother checking on the internet."" He didn't say anything, went into his room and angrily slammed the door. I didn't care and just left the house. He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet, and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me. Not only that, but I intend on doing this to him every time he's at home from now on. I can't wait for his school holidays to start where he'll be at home all day without internet.

Also, I found out later that day that his mum didn't even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher. Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games, so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drain.

I went up there with 3 of my closest friends a few months ago to spend a week partying, dining and shopping. I have a girlfriend and I've always been extremely loyal to her. Unfortunately every one of my friends are single and they enjoy watching me suffer as they go around hitting on girls.

My best friend, lets call him G, is the definition of a homophobe. Every time we go out, he takes pride in telling girls I'm his gay friend and I hate women. All my friends find it fucking hilarious. After we arrived home from our trip, I had enough. 

He had a HUGE party a few nights ago and was trying extremely hard to get this one girl, lets call her S, to sleep with him. It seemed to be going well for him and it looked like she might be interested in spending the night. When he introduced me to her, again i was the ""gay friend""... That was it. I left the party and went home, planning on just going to bed when it hit me...

My little sister is 10 years old. She loves art and I knew she had a shit ton of glitter. I grabbed about a water bottle full of glitter and went back to the party. I quietly walked up to his bedroom and knew what I had to do.

You're probably thinking Ohhhhhhhh he's gonna dump the glitter on his bed HAAAAAA. NOPE, I know for a fact there's no way he's going to have sex with this girl in his AC-less house without putting his ceiling fan on. So I dumped all the glitter across the tops of all 4 blades of his ceiling fan and returned downstairs to enjoy my handywork.

I spent the rest of the night wing-manning the shit out of this girl for him and they went upstairs to do the do. Not 10 minutes later we hear 2 screams as he runs downstairs, shirtless and COVERED in glitter.

VigilantInfidel,54,,108,14w5kd,,724,"In the retail business system, the customers are made up of two separate but wildly different groups: the polite, who make your life easier, and the assholes, who are here to fuck shit up. These are their stories.

I was behind this lady in the grocery store in an upscale part of town. Older lady, dressed nice, but totally oblivious to anyone else's personal space. You know the type: she emerges from the end of an aisle at breakneck speed without yielding to shoppers who have the right-of-way or even looking down to see how many children she's run over. These sort of people aren't unheard of but this one particular bird kept repeatedly doing it to people, and somehow to me specifically. More than once she nearly sideswiped my cart and one time she even managed to plow straight into me after she exploded from the end of an aisle. I received a very curt ""excuse you!"" from her for my troubles.

If this had been all it was, I would have chalked it up to her being an inconsiderate person but she started scowling at me after the first time she violated the Law of the Lanes. Add in the fact that she blocked people from passing her in what were not even narrow aisles, and then had the nerve to hold up the express lane with her *way more* than ten items to dispute sales prices with the cashier, and you officially had a Grade A &lt;redacted&gt;.

I beat her out of the store because my line -- while longer and not Express -- went faster by virtue of not being filled with a-holes. An elderly lady on one of those store-provided motorized scooters had driven one out to her car (which was parked far away from the handicapped spot, since those spaces were full) and was attempting to return it to the store's lobby but it was apparently running out of juice. Done putting away my own groceries and forgetting about the Harris Tarder (get it?) for a minute, I offered to take her scooter back to the store so she wouldn't have to. [Important note: these scooters can only be operated if you sit on them and will lock up the wheels when not in use or powered off.]

Well, guess who I discovered was parked in a handicapped spot despite clearly not needing one, nor having the tags or placard for one? In a bit of fortuitous timing, the scooter I was riding was essentially dead and unmovable about a space away from this piece of work. She finished loading up her groceries into her suv and I got out and used all my most manliest muscles to heave the scooter forward until it sat right behind her rear bumper, with only the front of it peeking out so it'd be visible from her rear view mirror. Okay, so it wasn't *that* heavy but it was heavy enough that she wouldn't be able to move it by herself.

Anyway, she saw it in time and thankfully didn't back over it but she screamed at me from out of her window as I walked away, alternating between demanding that I move it, insults at my social standing in life, and incredulity that anyone would dare hold up a woman whose time was as important as hers. I just waved politely back at her and yelled ""excuse you!""

greenmash,91,,108,12uojt,,723,"Ok, so reading a story on this subreddit about a kid smashing his 64 reminded me of something that happened years ago.

This was when the Nintendo 64 was only out for a little while, so few kids had it in my area and pokemon cards were incredibly popular. 

One of my friends got a 64 as a gift from his mum. Back then they were on welfare and she was supporting 3 kids - so this 64 was a big deal for him. 
We had been sitting down playing it for damn near 8 hours straight. From memory we were trying to do Wave Race time trials or some shit. - Anyway, his aunt and uncle turned up for a visit bringing along his little cousin. This little cunt - for lack of a better term - was spoiled by his parents something fierce. He got away with murder - Ok not murder, but he could tell his mother to ""Fuck off bitch"" and she wouldn't bat an eyelid. He always got what he wanted if he threw a big enough tantrum. 

So they turn up and my friend and I are trying to ignore him as best we could and focus on the game. His cousin started bugging us to have a go - constantly. We told him no several times cause we were playing. He goes off and yells at his mother to tell us to let him play. She comes in and asks if he can have 1 go. We reluctantly agree. 

He started trying to do a particular course in a set time - and failed. Again and again and again. He eventually got so angry he rage threw the 64 controller at the wall - it shattered. The only controller barely a month out of the box destroyed by this little shit. 

My mate was devastated. I could almost see tears but before they started the look in his eye flicked to anger and he was going to get his revenge.

See, this cousin of his loved pokemon cards to the point where he carried them around in a little case with him. And his most prized possession was a charizard. They were rare as fuck and he had 1, out of the hundreds of cards his parents purchased for him, this was his most important card. 

This cousin had this smug look on his face as if he was saying ""What are you going to do about it?""
This was when my mate calmly stood up, walked over to this pokemon case, opened it and took out the charizard. 

Instantly the cousin flips and starts demanding it back. 
My mate refuses and holds it out of reach.
Cousin runs crying to his parents demanding he give it back. As they all walk in my mate drops his pants, bends over and firmly shoves this charizard card up his own arse (Well, not the whole card but a good section in the hole and the rest trapped in the crack when he clenched)

He then took it back out, put it back in the case with the other cards, and shook it up. 

I was completely gobsmacked. I mean, it was possibly the funniest thing I'd ever seen at that point but at that exact moment I was frozen in the sidelines looking at the reactions of the aunt, uncle and cousin. 

The cousin flipped his fucking mind. I have never seen a dummy spit like this. He screamed at my mate, screamed at his mother and father calling them ""Dumb shits"" for not doing anything. Started punching walls kicking the furniture and at one point his own dad.

Then something happened I never expected. His father (the uncle) caught him mid tanty, flipped him over and proceeded to smack his arse red raw. He then pulled out a $50, gave it to my mate to replace the controller and left - son still under his arm crying.

One night we were out at the bars and my friend is doing his thing and talking to a group of girls from the sorority with the “rich girls” reputation. One of the girls in the group (we’ll call her Susan) had heard about George, and did not approve of his ways. She proceeded to tell him how she felt and then finished it off with a brisk slap to the face. George may have been a player, but he wasn’t stupid, so he gave up and moved on. After a little while we decided to head on to the next bar. Unfortunately, when we left the bar those sorority girls were outside waiting for a cab. George, now a few more drinks down, couldn’t help himself and went back to talking to some of the girls. Susan came over and slapped him even harder. 

Side note: The cops in this small campus town were mostly assholes, and they clearly had nothing but contempt for guys in fraternities (I knew from experience). However, I had previously worked in the campus legal aid office, so I knew that the cops had to respond to complaints.

At this point, I had to act. I told her that it wasn’t okay for her to assault people, and she slapped me. I explained to her that she was breaking the law and told her that if she slapped me or George again, I would call the cops. She apparently didn’t believe me (or was too drunk to care), so she reared back and slapped me as hard as she could. 

I called 911 and reported the assault. Since officers regularly patrolled the campus bars, a cop was there within minutes. I calmly explained the situation to him and told him that I wanted to press charges. The cop didn’t approve and berated me about my lack of manhood. But I knew that as long as I wanted to press charges, the officer had to go along with the arrest. By now the girls’ cab had come and Susan had gotten in. The cop pulled her out of the cab, then cuffed and stuffed her. She quickly figured out that it no longer was a game, and started to cry. After the cop put her in the cruiser, he came over to take our official statements. I had no intention of actually filing charges, but I used this time to get a little more revenge. The cop was incredibly annoyed, but I made him go through all of the questioning while Susan sobbed in the back seat. And then finally, when he was about to take her downtown (literally), I waived my charges and she got to go free. 

TL;DR: Rich girl slaps friend twice, then when I tell her it is wrong to assault, she slaps me twice. I call the cops and she gets cuffed and stuffed before I waive the charges.

asshat_backwards,66,,147,1bgoku,,724,"Standing in line for about 20 minutes at a downtown D.C. post office -- a typical wait, and as usual, only one window open. I'm next up when a harried-looking 50-something assmunch in a power suit walks right up to the window, shoulder to shoulder with the lady already there taking care of her mailing needs, and proceeds in a loud voice to ask through the small plastic window hole whether this is the post office that sorts mail for the XXXXX Zip code, and that he got a notice to pick up his mail somewhere or other, and is this the place?

The clerk behind the window, clearly no stranger to D.C. power player wannabes, tells the man she's dealing with a customer, and to please get in line. He repeats his question, even louder. She tells him he's being rude, that he needs to get in line like everyone else and she'll help him when it's his turn. She then goes back to helping the lady.

So assclown stands directly behind the lady customer, mumbling loudly that he just has a simple question, for chrissake, HE's not the one being rude, isn't this typical of D.C. and federal bureaucracy, has to stand in line for an hour to ask a question, blah blah blah. 

Now, I happen to know that there's another employee circulating, helping people with forms and to use the automated machine at the front of the store -- I had asked him a question when I came in. And as I'm next in line and on my lunch break, I don't want Mr. Fucknuts messing with MY precious time. So I tell him, ""Sir, I believe there's another employee in the lobby who can help you -- that guy in the blue sweater,"" and hook my thumb at said fella. Dickhead looks at me, then turns and walks back to find the guy -- without acknowledging or thanking me, of course. I can hear him back there haranguing the poor worker as I wait. 

Now the customer at the counter is finishing and I'm getting my stuff ready and wallet out, when Dr. Douchely returns. Now he's my pal, standing at my shoulder, saying that guy couldn't help, can you believe this place, just need to get a question answered, he's sure I won't mind if he just gets this thing taken care of, what IS it with these people? *These* people. 

OK, I was annoyed before, but now I'm pissed.

So as the lady at the counter moves off, he starts to step toward the window, and I step up with him. He gives me a look, and I say, ""I think the line's over there,"" and point. He steps up to the window anyway, and starts talking to the lady. She promptly tells him to get in line, puts her ""Closed"" sign up on that window, comes over to the window where *I'm* standing and starts helping me. Shithead-in-suit makes a grumphing noise and goes to the back of the line. The clerk and I have a delightful transaction, commiserating about how many self-important assholes there are in this town (loudly enough for those in line to hear) and then I head out, making sure to make full eye contact with Mr. Douchetastic. Nice petty win for US Postal Service and myself, not so much for rude self-important dickhead. ",Post office prick,871,pettyrevenge
wafflesareforever,62,,117,16tjor,,720,"Longtime /r/pettyrevenge lurker here. It just occurred to me that one of the stories I like to tell fellow web design geeks is a perfect fit for this delightfully passive-aggressive corner of reddit.

Back in 2005 I had a full-time web development job and was also doing some freelance web design on the side. I managed a few of my clients' websites on a shared hosting account and would occasionally review the built-in analytics to see who was hitting my sites and what they were looking at. This was before the days of Google Analytics. 

One day, I noticed a significant amount of traffic coming from [Xanga](http://www.xanga.com/), which appears to be some sort of blogging community now but back then was basically a MySpace clone. I figured out that all of the traffic was coming from one *very* active Xanga profile, which was using an image hosted on my account as its background image (it was a Smurf, which he had tiled in the background, making the page pretty difficult to read). I was annoyed in the most petty sort of way - how dare he hotlink *my* image and use *my* bandwidth! 

I perused his profile and discovered that he and all of his friends were all born-again evangelical types who inserted pictures of Jesus into every other comment (of which there were dozens posted on a daily basis). Jesus was everywhere on this profile. It looked like a bunch of Jesus clones were partying with the Smurfs. 

Suddenly, it hit me - the background image for this page is *on my server!* I can change this kid's profile background to anything I want!

I considered my options. Goatse immediately came to mind, but given that this kid was in high school, I couldn't bring myself to do it. Same went for any other porn/gore/etc - too mean, and not particularly funny. I then realized that the image he was hotlinking was a gif - animation was in play! The possibilities were endless.

I opened the Smurf image in Adobe Fireworks and turned it into a repeating pattern so that it would look exactly the way that it did tiled in the browser. I then turned it into an animated gif that every twenty seconds flashed an image of [Linda Blair from The Exorcist](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/447/the-exorcist-73209.jpg), kind of small (about 200px high), near the middle of the page. She'd only appear for a half-second so you'd just barely catch a glimpse of her. Then I told a bunch of friends what I had done and we enjoyed the show together in an AIM chatroom (oh 2005, I miss you).

I'm not sure how I was expecting them to react, but these kids *freaked the fuck out*. I don't think any of them had any idea what The Exorcist was, so to them this was just a terrifying demon inhabiting their online hangout. A common comment was ""I don't know what's happening but I'm praying for you and crying."" Not one kid had the technical wherewithal to figure this stupidly simple problem out. If they had just reset the profile's design/theme/whatever-Xanga-called-it, the bad face would have been gone forever. Instead, parents were involved and there was talk of consulting with their church. This went on for two days, and then the profile was deleted. 

Sadly, I don't think they even learned the lesson I was attempting to teach: Don't hotlink someone else's images, kids.",Don't mess with a web designer,837,pettyrevenge
FredFltStn,109,,255,1qz5am,,719,"**BACKGROUND:** I own and operate my own retail store. It's actually a seasonal fireworks tent, but not like any fireworks tent you've seen before. It’s 2400 square feet of fireworks heaven, where the party, and the insanity, climax at midnight on the 4th of July and New Years Eve.

**STORY:**  Josh is one of the guys that work for me every year at my fireworks tent, although I have to use the term “work” loosely with Josh. He’s a tall, skinny, 19 year old high school dropout, who would rather be lighting up than working given the choice. His parents are two of my good friends, which is the ONLY reason he still works for me.

When we’re working, I spend and unreasonable amount of time playing the “Where’s Josh” game. It’s like “Where’s Waldo”, but usually involves Josh sitting out of sight in the back of the storage container or “going to the bathroom” for 30 minutes. I know that if I’m not watching him, there’s a 86% chance that he’s sitting on his ass somewhere avoiding work.

Josh always owes people money. Friends, family, enemies, me, the list goes on and on. Since I’m pretty much his only source of regular income, and I only work him about 6 weeks out of the year, Josh is perpetually broke or in debt.

Last year, his mother let me know that Josh owed them some BIG bucks, several hundred dollars. They were making him pay for the repairs from when they were out of town and Josh had drunkenly stolen his father’s car, and then conveniently wrecked it into his mother’s car. Sadly, just another day with Josh. 

I talked to Josh about it and he seemed embarrassed, and asked me to work him as many hours as possible so he could pay his parents back. Feeling sorry for him (I’m a sucker); I let him pick up extra shifts.

I gave him his paycheck after the first week of work, and reminded him that he needed to pay his mother back. He assured me that he would. He then cashed the paycheck on blew the entire thing on fast food, liquor, and “herbs”. His parents were disappointed, but not really surprised.

I gave him hell after I found out what he’d done, and he assured me that he was going to pay back his parents with the next paycheck. I’m a sucker, not an idiot, and I know Josh too well. 

From July 1st on, we work a TON of hours, since that’s by far our busiest time of the year, and everyone’s happy when payday arrives. I hadn’t forgotten the fast one that Josh had pulled with the last paycheck, and I mentioned to him more than once that he needed to cash his next paycheck and give the entire amount to his parents.

On payday, I walked up to Josh carrying my checkbook and said, “Is this entire check going to your mom?”

He of course assured that it was, and danced around like a kid on Christmas while I filled out the check. I told him the amount, folded the check in half, handed it to him, and thanked him for his help.

About 20 minutes later, I got a text from Josh that said,
&gt;You bastard.

Apparently, Josh and several of his friends went to a check cashing store to cash his check and start the party. They had already made plans to hit the beach and get wasted after they cashed the check, but the store wouldn’t cash it for him.

My text response back to Josh was:
&gt;What? I asked you if the entire check was going to your mother and you confirmed it. Per your request, I made the check payable to your mother. Thanks again for all the hard work.

the_dudeth,36,,120,1coykx,,722,"I work within a University campus, as such we usually get calls from parents asking about their child's information, grades, GPAs and whatnot. For this reason the state has instituted a nondisclosure act, meaning that if the student does not want to give you the information themselves we are not allowed to either. This is to obviously protect the students privacy, and most parents or caller understand once we explain this to them and have no further issues. 
However, once in a while we seem to get a caller that does not understand that we can not give them the information no matter how loud they yell or how entitled to that information they believe they are. Legally I cannot give you this information without the students permission. It is to the point that I could be fired if I do. 
I had the delight of dealing with such a customer today. No pleasantries exchanged as per the unwritten code of phone conduct. Nope, just straight demands to know a students GPA and enrollments status. Well hello to you too mam. I then went ahead and informed her, as nicely as I could, that sadly we did not have her on record as a information recipient but that if she could contact the student and have them list her as a recipient we could gladly give her the information. 
The, um, wonderful lady on the over side of the phone then decided that rather than be understanding what she needs to do is berate me. fast forward to ten minutes of her yelling about how she is the godmother of the child, how she raised him and filled out all the paperwork for him, questioning my own intelligence and finished by saying that if her child did not hide anything from her how dare I, a simply inbreed phone pusher deny her the information she wanted.
I decided I was past the point of calling my supervisor and that I would handle it myself. I let her know that inbreed phone pusher as I may be I still cannot break federal law and I suggested that if in fact 
the student did not hide anything from her that she could ask the student directly. This did not go over well as she began to wind up again I simply told her that I could not give her that information but I would gladly help her with anything else. She promptly yelled that no she did not want any help from a idiot like me and thanked me for making such a large issue out of nothing. I told her your welcome and then heard the phone slam down. Now, I don't react to insults well, but my hands are tied by what is considered job etiquette so what can I do? I was about to give up and just fume to myself when I realized that I had all the students information on file including his phone number, and that being the caring and courteous worker that I am I should notify the student that a screaming harpy is illegally pursuing his information. The student was not at all pleased to hear about the snooping into his account and informed me that the only reason that she was calling for was because he refused to give her his left over scholarship money which he had told her he had not received (thus the GPA requirement), something that she had forced from him before. He then also told me that he and her family had spoken to her before and informed her that is she did it again they would pursue legal action, something he confided he and his family were quite eager to do and that this was the last straw. He sincerely thanked me for this information and I told him that I was simply doing my job and to have a wonderful day.

Working at a restaurant you learn that a lot of people have little idiosyncrasies and preferences that can be a bit annoying but more often then not it's not a big deal in the least. In fact, if you're any good at your job it can be pretty rewarding to make someones night with a little extra thought. There are however, those people, who are thoroughly aware of the dynamic and take advantage of the situation. They use their night out to work out some deep rooted sadistic tendencies no-doubt instilled by what can only be assumed to be a horrific existence. Sadly, when you get a table like this (and they're so easy to spot) there's really nothing you can do but take it, it's not worth losing your job or getting the managers mad at you and losing the much needed hours. 

A little while ago I was working a shift at a very busy, large restaurant at a very popular tourist trap. The kind of place that doubles the price of your entree because we have a pretty view and claims their staff is a big family that exists only to serve. Anyway, a friend of mine gets a table like this and they're honestly beyond the average degree of terrible. Anytime something displeased them they shouted, as if announcing it to the rest of the guests and my friend would turn beet red. They'd got upset at things like, 

""Her fork is cold, how come I don't get a cold fork?"" 

""Well, Ma'am, traditionally we only provide a chilled fork with salads, but I'd be happy to bring you one.""

""Don't be making excuses. Don't give me attitude because you fucked up and I'm calling you on it. Just get me the damn fork.""

Ridiculous things like this. Or throwing a fit because this particular seafood restaurant didn't have tater tots. 

""What kind of ""classy"" place doesn't give the customer what they want?""

There was a problem with everything. They were the kinds of people who started setting in the ground work for a free dessert before they step through the doors. And you could tell that they were good at what they did, they must've been given free desserts at every meal for years. It's the only explanation for frankly impressive level  of obese they'd become, considering how cheap they were. 

Well our city had realized they could make loads off tricky parking meters/rules and we'd get a lot of questions from our customers needing explanations. Another important detail to note is that while there were expensive meters and parking lots near the restaurant there was a MASSIVE hill a few blocks up where you'd have to park if the place was busy. Easily a 20 minute walk up this steep hill to the nearest parking spots. And it seems that they people had to park waaay up there. At one point, near the end of their meal, the guy waves me down and asks, 

""What time is it safe to park without filling the meter? It's about six now, it's fine, right?"" 

Knowing full well that parking was free at six, I realized this was an opportunity to get in some petty revenge. I looked him dead in the eye and said, 

""Oh, gee, I'm not exactly sure, but I'm pretty certain it doesn't end until 8. You know, we're so busy around here, I think they made it later then normal. And if I were you, I'd check just in case, they're very strict about ticketing around here...""

The guy rolls his eyes, wheezes, and lifts himself out of his poor chair.

I saw him like 45 minutes later, red faced and sweating. His buddies ended up having to wait for him before they ordered dessert, but by then I guess they were too tired to try and scam us for a free sundae.




TLDR: Obese man was cruel to his waitress and I pretended not to know the parking laws so he'd have to trek 20 minutes up the hill, only to realize metered parking had ended hours ago.

This was 6-lane road near several shopping centers and multiple intersections jammed with cars, very slow going.  My goal was in sight, however.  If I could just make it through the next light, I could hit the freeway onramp and get out of here.  As luck would have it, the light turned red just as the car in front of me crawled through the intersection.  Stuck for another 5 minutes.  My own irritation was interrupted by a loud honk from behind, and I glanced in my rearview mirror to see a middle-aged woman in a lifted Ford F250 gesturing wildly at me, as though I cost her the light.

I just smiled and prepared to ignore her, until I noticed the red lights of a fire truck and EMT heading our way from behind, trying to make their way through the traffic jam.

What she didn’t notice through her rage (but everybody else on the road did), was just as the light turned green, the EVs had swung into the opposing traffic lanes which had cleared out. It was obvious they were going to hit our intersection and swing back into our lanes which had cleared out ahead of the intersection during the red light.  The only thing I could do was sit tight, keep the intersection clear, and stay out of the way.

I keep a small container of coupons next to my register, because certain purchases qualify for a coupon that customers can bring back for later use. Most customers know to keep their hands off, but this kid dumped all my coupons onto the counter because he wanted the paper clips and rubber bands attached to the container. His mom told him to leave my stuff alone and placed everything back, but he did it again two or three times. Finally she pushed the coupons out of his reach, and this kid had the nerve to jump and swipe across the counter to reach.

My ticket put a solid dent in my pitiful after-school-job finances, so I was really hoping the experience would be worth the investment.

We got inside, and the house was pretty packed. That was totally okay, we found a few seats off to the side and made ourselves comfortable. The seats themselves were white leather and rocked back and forth like La-Z-Boys. Also, the room had theater seating, so that each row of seats sat a foot or so higher than the row in front of it.

Cue the group of obnoxious weasel dudes who came in and sat right in front of us. They were loud, chewed with their mouths open, threw stuff, etc, but hey - the movie hadn't started yet.

About five or ten minutes into the actual movie, I gave up on patience and let my petty side take over. I lifted my feet, placed them firmly on the back of his seat, and jammed them all the way forward. I held them there.

He tried to push back, to no avail. He was stuck in a pretty awkward position, I definitely had the advantage as far as torque or whatever.

SaySheSaid2,65,,153,16un0q,,710,"So long story short, my ex-husband was a real prick when he left me and the kids. 

On the same month I lost my job due to too many absences (mother was terminally ill) then my mother passed away and at the time husband drains the bank account and leaves me (telling me over the phone on the day I returned from my mothers services in Baltimore) that he wants a divorce. 

He worked a low wage job and was college student when we met and he had very little. When he moved into my place, all he had was his antique dresser, suitcase with his clothing and a bookshelf. 

He rarely contributed to *any* household expenses so when he left, I told him he was taking only what he brought in- suitcase, bookshelf and dresser. I had him sign a statement that he took all of his belongings and there was nothing left he was entitled to. 

A few months later I get a letter from his attorney demanding I send an itemized list of all items we purchased *together* during our marriage. 
My blood boiled  at the site of this after what he had done to me and the kids. 

So the beautiful internet helped me. I went to sites that sold some crazy sex toys and devices and made a list of 300 items we had ""purchased"" together and sent the letter to his attorney and stated I could drop them off at his office whenever he was ready to receive. 

Never heard from his attorney on the matter again. 

Fast forward to after the divorce and ex is still a bitter asshat- I get a letter from his new attorney claiming some BS that I am not in compliance with the standing court order for visitation because I had moved and did not inform the courts of my new address thus a ""direct violation of the order by not advising the court 10 days after move"" 

It's not that I was hiding, my ex had the address, he was picking the kids up and dropping them off at the new address, he just wanted to be a dick.

The letter also stated that he was represented and that I am not to have direct contact with *his* client. 

Oh, thank you for opening that door! Cha-Ching! 

So, I called his attorneys office and asked about the hourly price for services and how much a phone call or fax would be to read. 

The attorney charged $300.00 per hour and each call, if under 15 minutes and each fax would cost $75.00. 

So I came up with the dumbest questions and most ridiculous things to fax his attorney for: 
Oh, let your client know I will be 15 minutes late from work today so he may have to wait to get the kids. 

I lost the insurance card, can you get a replacement? I think our son left a toy, can you check with your client. Did his clothes get dried with downy, cause he is having allergic reactions, etc.

I walked out to my car one day to go grab dinner and I find that some chump in a BMW parked so close to my driver side door that I would have had to be a coked up Olsen Twin in order to fit between the gap between the doors. I also noticed that he had his window cracked a bit.

I was hungry and now angry, so I walked back to my house, fired up MS Word and printed 20 copies of: **YOUR PARKING JOB FUCKING SUCKS!** in 64 point, bold Arial font.

I then put 4 on his windshield, facing inward and outward and then threw the rest into his car through the crack in his window.

foobnum,41,,154,180ghf,,711,"I love this subreddit!  I have a story for you guys:

This story took place just over 10 years ago.  I worked for a pretty upscale hotel night manager for a few years.  I had two other night auditors on my team, one of them being the relief night manager who had become a really good friend.  This hotel had a real bitch of a GM but working nights I just heard the horror stories from the day staff and I never really had to deal with her until one morning when she came in really early with the operations manager to have a talk with me.  Apparently they read the key log from a previous night and wanted to know why I was going in and out of a vacant guest room that had been left dirty by housekeeping.  I explained my laundry machine had broken down at home and I was washing doing some laundry at the hotel while on my shift.  I was severely reprimanded and threatened to be fired which was a bit excessive in my opinion by I understood that it was wrong.  I was a loyal, hardworking employee and that was the only thing I had done wrong, a lapse of judgment by me.

Fast forward a year later and I am finding that working nights is not working out for me anymore, I have trouble sleeping during the day and its really taking a toll on my health.  I love the hotel and the company though so I stick it out until two day opportunities open up.  One is a daytime duty manager position on the front desk and the other is an accounts payable position.  I have the experience and knowledge so I interview for both and am told by the controller and the front office manager that they both want me and I just have to make a choice.  I am quite excited and I have a meeting with the bitch GM to discuss where to go but during the meeting she puts the brakes on my daytime employment dreams.  She tells me she doesn’t want me in either position and she wants me to continue working nights.  I explain my reasons for wanting a day position and she says I will not get any of those positions but she will find me a housekeeping or janitorial job in the day if I really want to.  

FUCK THAT.  That night my drunk girlfriend pops into the hotel to visit and we let ourselves into the bitch GM’s office and have sex all over her desk, not cleaning anything up after.  I type up my resignation giving two weeks notice.  Upon seeing what was happening the relief night manager says, and I quote, “fuck this shit, if you are quitting then so am I!”  He types his resignation as well giving his two weeks notice.  We want to be fair to the third night auditor so we call him up the next morning and explain what happened and he decides to give his notice as well.  The next night the three of us are scheduled and we celebrate by showing up a few hours late and quite intoxicated.  We make it through the shift and the three of us spent the remainder of our two weeks notice either calling in sick or taking lieu days.  Having the whole night audit team up and quit with no notice left the hotel fucked.  We heard stories of the operations manager working nights and even the GM having to pull night shifts because there was nobody else, never mind the lack of training and the fact that nobody else knew how the night procedures.  

The aftermath… the positions I applied for were both filled by hiring from the outside.  The girl who was hired for the DM position was fired within a couple weeks for sleeping with one or more or the bellmen.  The accounts payable person was fired about 6 weeks in for being useless.  I went on to find a great job for an extremely great company as an accountant and they are paying for me to become a CGA.  I still see the old bitchy GM around town and I make sure to give her a big smile and wave.

TL;DR: Bitch GM holds grudge, fucks me over so I fuck someone in her office, fuck over her hotel.

This story is actually one my friend did several years ago.  We were in Blockbuster back when they were still a pretty successful company and picking out video games to get us through the weekend.  My brother and I were walking along and our friend went to the next isle.  This guy and his girlfriend come up and the guy (slight spray-on tan and a douche clothing getup to match) says,

""Damn man, you're pale!  Get outside more!""

Without missing a beat my friend (who really isn't that pale, maybe a 7 out of 10) replies in a great fake 'pissed off' voice,

""I have cancer!  This is a side effect of the treatment!""

The douche can't move as my friend walks away.  His girlfriend starts smacking him on the arm and telling him what an asshole he is.

About 10 minutes later the guy approaches my friend, very nervously and apologizes in hushed words as his girlfriend watches from a distance.  My friend replies just as quickly as before,

""I don't have cancer, you're a tool...""  And walks away.  The guy couldn't move again for a bit.  I don't know if his girlfriend heard it or not, but the look on his face told us that he certainly felt like a tool.",Blockbuster Douche,827,pettyrevenge
Magiobiwan,209,,368,1pydwf,,699,"There are 2 things that really annoy me when driving: tailgating and not using your turn signals (THEY'RE THERE FOR A REASON!!!). This morning, on my way in to school, someone made the mistake of tailgating me, in my little passenger car, in their lifted pickup. Despite the fact that I was going 5 over already, they were RIGHT on my fender. So, taking a lesson from what you other petty people have done, I begin slowing down. First I go the limit, and I drop down to 10 under before the person takes the hint and backs off. I speed up again and continue on my way. Then as we near a school zone in the middle of town, the guy gets right back on my tail and is really POed.  
It's worth mentioning at this point that I have certain *connections* within the local Police Department. Being a Cadet/Explorer can help with that, and I happen to personally know the Motorcycle cop who does traffic. What do you know, he works this shift! SO, I call up dispatch and report a dangerous driver, etc. The traffic cop was in the area (on the other side of the block), so he pulls around and JUST as he gets into sight, the tailgater gets annoyed so much that he passes me illegally, going at least 35. That's quite the spendy ticket. Add in following too closely, and he's paying a good chunk of change. He got pulled over, and the cop texted me to let me know he gave him a wonderful ticket.

owl_me,49,,151,1qaehw,,706,"There was a kid in my APBio class that was a real jerk, but was a huge suck up to the teachers so he never got caught (Let's call him Ben) One of the girls in our class asked Ben during lunch what the homework was for that week. There actually wasn't any, but he decided to tell her that there was a huge assignment, and picked the longest most complicated problems he could find in the book to tell her to do. She proceeded to tell all her friends so they would not lose points, and 5 of them spent hours trying to finish the insane assignment before it was due (generally assignments were due on friday and he gave them the false problems on thursday) 

The girls were obviously distressed and went to our teacher Friday morning to ask about some questions they couldn't understand. Our teacher informed them that there had not been any homework assigned, and that their classmate had obviously lied to them. They were obviously pissed, but the teacher told them not to worry, and he would handle it.

When we walked into class that day he discreetly handed everyone who walked into class a small note that said ""Please pretend you are getting out homework to turn in and do not say anything to Ben. Act natural."" We all complied, and started rustling papers and grabbing stuff that looked convincing.

After the bell rang our teacher said ""Okay bring up your homework everyone. And you had two weeks to do this instead of one so I am not taking any late excuses this time"" He then pointed to the board where the homework is usually written, and sure enough there was an assignment written there, with a due date and an asterisk saying *please remember this assignment is worth double points because it is over 2 sections!

We all got up and turned in our 'homework' then sat down, and Ben was sitting at his desk looking stunned. Note that homework was worth a lot in that class because the assignments were really long and in depth, and the tests were all real AP questions so it was difficult to get a great grade, so he weighted homework more so our GPA's were not screwed. Ben gets up and in a really scared voice asked what he should do about the assignment. Our teacher says ""Well it has been two weeks and I did remind you last friday, so I am sorry you will just have to take the zero on this one."" 

Ben ""But, what will this do to my grade???""
(He was the type who maintained straight As since kindergarten by sucking up and cheating off people, but got really freaked out about grades)

Teacher ""Well we have only had 50 points so far and this assignment is 50, so you have an F now, but there are still 2 tests and 2 homework assignments, so you can get a C or B most likely.""

Ben is freaking out and basically in tears, his 'good student' image shattered. The class just resumed and we watched him squirm the entire period. At the very end our teacher told him the truth and we all cheered, and he told Ben not to give out fake assignments in the future. It was a glorious moment.

ShaneL79,120,,128,16d4ub,,696,"A few years back my wife and I worked in the same area and car pooled together. All of the lots were full so we always parked about a 25 minute walk to our buildings. I don't mind the long walks, but some days the weather makes it pretty painful. 

We were parking here for about a year or so and we got to know the other vehicles in the lot. We worked longer hours than most other people and were usually amongst the first to arrive and pretty much always the last to leave. There was one other woman on our same schedule so we ran into each other a lot.

Our city sucks for cold snaps. We were about a week into a cold snap that was staying constantly below -35C and felt like -45C with the wind chill. Pretty horrible conditions, but that is where I live.

One day I got to my car and realized my engine block heater stopped working. My car was frozen and needed a boost to get it going. The problem was we were in an area where there are few people around. The only two vehicles left in the lot was mine and this woman's. We had a rough idea that she should be around soon, and sure enough she was. 

I had my booster cables on my battery waiting. When she arrived I asked her if she could boost us. ""Nope"".

Normally I would chalk it up to it being a jerk, but this time my wife and I were freezing and had a 25 minute walk back to our office which was closed. Meaning other than getting lucky and finding someone, we would likely need to wait for a tow company to boost us. So I asked her again and reminded her how cold it was.

Her response: ""No, you should have plugged it in"". Then she drove away before I could explain that it was plugged in. This is extremely rare to have someone so unhelpful in Canada. In fact it was a first for me. 

I was livid, but I decided to go to the nearest main street and wait for someone to drive by. An hour later I found the first car. My wife let me keep the warm clothes and she went to the lobby of the office to stay warm. Some nice guy pulled over and boosted me and we made it home - although I am sure my ears had a little frostbite on them.

The next morning the weather was equally bad so we decided to take my wife's car. It was less reliable but it had command start that worked great. So we just programmed it to start every 30 minutes just to keep the engine warm enough.

Once we arrived at the lot I noticed the woman's truck was already there. I went over and unplugged it just enough that there was no connection, but it still looked like it was plugged in. Then we went to work. I forgot about it the whole day until I was walking back to the lot in the freezing cold.

When I got to the lot there were only the two vehicles again, mine and hers. My wife started her car without a problem and while we were waiting for the car to warm up the woman appeared. On cue her truck has a very slow turn-over that only slowed until all that was left was a clicking noise. Same thing that happened to my car the day before.

We waited a minute and to our surprise she had the nerve to ask us for a boost. I told her that she should have plugged her truck in, then drove away. 

That was the last time I seen her at that lot. 

**TL;DR** - Bitch wouldn't help us in extreme weather, so we forced our fate on her and wouldn't help her either.

Cupinacup,29,,135,1onm5f,,693,"I hate parking garages. Sure, they're convenient, but they're often overpriced, have bums, and the people who park in them are awful. Fortunately, the parking garage at my university only suffers from the last of the three problems, so 2 out of 3 isn't bad. I give it a D.

At any rate, I often park on the second to top floor, 5 (or 4th, for you weird Europeans) because a) I can get close to the stairs and elevator, b) I don't have to waste 15 minutes to find a parking space, and c) people on the top floor don't park like Hellen Keller. However, as I am often reminded, that doesn't stop them from being shitty human beings.

Now I usually take the stairs, but this past week I've been taking the elevator mainly because I've been fairly under the weather and don't feel like overexerting myself over something as pointless as getting to the bottom floor faster when the elevator will do just as well (after all, the elevator in this garage is fairly slow). And for the most part, people this week on the top floor have been generally polite. Except for today.

As I get out of my car, I see a couple waiting at the elevator maybe thirty yards away. As I hustle over, I hear the *ding* and the doors slide open. The girl pushes a button inside the elevator, then the guy reaches over and holds down the ""door close"" button. I was maybe five yards away when the dude gives me a smirk and a little wave of the hand. What an asshole.

I'm still feeling somewhat ill, but at this point I've had enough. It's early in the morning, some turd on a bike cut me off, my oatmeal had exploded in the microwave, the coffee maker was busted, and now this guy didn't even have the common courtesy to hold the door for a couple seconds. Well fuck him.

I sprint down the stairs, taking them two or three at a time. I race over to the elevator on the fourth floor, hit the down button, then run back to the stairs. Down to the third floor I go and I hear a ding from the floor above. Not just satisfied yet, I hit the elevator button on this floor too, then down to the second floor, hit the button, then down to the ground floor. My work is done.

As I walk out of the parking garage, I hear the elevator ding again and the doors slide open. The guy steps out and looks over in my direction with a scowl on his face. In return, I give him a little wave and the biggest shit-eating smile I have.

InfamousBLT,112,,139,16c0ba,,695,"Driving home from work, I ended up getting out later than usual so traffic was already tapering off from rush hour. One of the main roads I take was closed for construction, so I took my own nice, relaxing detour through some side roads. I'm tooling along, about 3-5 over the speed limit, whatever...just want to get home, when some jackwad in his Mustang GT blows through a stop sign behind me and comes speeding right up my chuff. 

I guess he wanted to go faster? He can deal...I'm on a somewhat unfamiliar road, it's getting dark, the road is twisty and hilly and I'm already doing 45 in a 40. Deal with it guy. 

Deal with it he does not. Spends most of the time swerving around behind me, honking, flashing his lights...whatever. I don't have time to deal with some meathead trying to impress his bimbo Snooki wannabe in his convertible.  The best part is there is enough traffic coming the other way, and enough twists and turns, that there is no way for him to pass. I hate slowpokes just as much as the next guy, but 5 over isn't that unreasonably slow.

So I finally make it to a point where the road splits into 2 lanes in my town (familiar territory! Yay!). There happens to be a stop light right at that point, so we both get stopped at the light. He pulls up next to me and just starts RAGING. Then he starts revving  his engine. Okay...so you want to race? Suuure, like that's going to happen.

It's then that I notice, behind a little hill just up the road, the tippy top part of police cruiser's lights. There's a cop up there...and the road is about to hit 35. This is a well known speed trap. I'm sure this guy doesn't see him because he's too busy cussing me out.

So I rev up my engine and finally make eye contact with the guy. Oh yeah, let's race! When the light changes I drop the clutch in (manual) and let my tires spin a bit to give him reason to lay his foot down as he takes off, and then I slowly pull forward. He probably got up to about 70 MPH by the time he passed the cop. In a 35 MPH zone. That's reckless driving folks.

Cop wastes no time in flying out, sirens and lights going. Pulls him over not a quarter of a mile down the road as I went by, still doing about 5 over.

AmaterasusBrush,42,,127,1n3uu8,,694,"I live on the border of Texas and Mexico, and every day thousands of people cross from Mexico to Texas. Because there are so many people, there is a special express lane in which you can pass with usually zero line. In order to use this lane, you have to pay $400 a year per car + ~$80 per person, and go through a background check. Since most people use this lane to go to school and/or work, the biggest rush is from 7-9 AM. Even though it's the express line, you can still be in line for 45 minutes before crossing (which is still a lot better than the 2+ hours you take in the regular line). A 2-lane one-way street goes perpendicular to the bridge, at which point one of the lanes turns into the line, while the other lane continues. This means that there is no protection from people who want to cut in line.


To the story: today the line was especially long (like maybe 2km), and after 30 minutes I was almost at the turn to enter the bridge, when I saw the Hummer behind me leave a small space in front, and another car rush in from the other lane and cut the Hummer off. The Hummer blared its horn, but y'know, what can you do? So this means the asshole behind me shaved 30 minutes off of his commute, while making everyone who was still in line's commute longer.

Of course, watching this, I couldn't help but do something about it. After allowing the line to advance a little bit so he would think he's golden, I turned on both of my blinkers, edged closer to the sidewalk, and stopped completely. It's not uncommon for cars to overheat after standing in line in the sun for so long, so I watched the guy curse and start maneuvering around me into the other lane. As soon as he was next to me, I accelerated and stuck ridiculously close to the car in front of me.

MrSnap,136,,158,14ijp6,,692,"I apologize for wall-of-text and if this one is a little too technical.  This involves a somewhat popular card-based trading game (MTG).  I tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read.  Plus, I don’t remember them all.

I usually am not the one to take revenge since I’m risk-averse.  However, in this case, I found it was the most logical thing to do since I knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw me.

There was this fellow in my high school.  His name was David.  He was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole, a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheater.

Often times during lunch hour, students would get together at the tables to play card games and such.  I usually got involved in these games as well.  David did too, but not as often.  

When he did, I watched him.  Honestly, this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating.  I remember distinctly watching him play a game of Magic: The Gathering with another student and I would watch him take 2, 3, even 4 cards at a time when he should have only been drawing 1.  His opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what David was doing.  I just kept my mouth shut.  Pretty soon he had something like 20 cards in his hand while his opponent had 4-5.  It was very ridiculous.

I usually avoided playing with him, but I must have played with him at least once.  He would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it.  Of course, he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me I got it wrong.  He would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation.  He would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong.  Playing him was an exhausting experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the game.

It was 1995 at the time, and I had played some Magic: The Gathering (MTG).  I was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before I even got involved, and people with money held all the power cards.  I had dropped my own money in the new expansion “Fallen Empires”, which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the game’s history.  Therefore, I was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since I didn’t see how I could ever catch up.

A guy I knew, Alex, decided to organize a starter pack tournament, where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack.  This sounded like an interesting variation on the game, and I thought I might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game I was quickly losing interest in.

Incidentally, David joined this tournament.  Now, his reputation was well known by Alex, but he let David join anyway.  The logic being that he needed people, even if those people were assholes.  There was only something like 5 people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with that.

Can you guess whom my first match was against?    That’s right.  It was fuckface himself:  David.

Now, I didn’t want to lawyer and argue with David the whole game since that was no fun at all.  If I was going to play him, I wanted to completely royally screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament.  A sort of preemptive revenge for the shit I know he was going to pull on me. 

Knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities.  I felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game.  I needed to stack the deck in my favor, so to speak.  Let me explain what I did.

So, each player was given a starter pack and one booster pack (MTG Revised Edition for those who care).  This gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks.  Most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent.  Any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weak.

In order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards, you need to strip out all the fluff that was going to do you no good.  So your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile.  You only played with your active deck.  At the end of the game, the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the loser’s active deck or your reject pile.  It’s the winner’s choice.    This is important later.

My deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a Demonic Tutor.  It essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want.  If I ever got this card, it would be my key to winning since I could pick out the only monster I have that actually does damage.  So now I have two chances of winning.  If I draw my monster or draw the Demonic Tutor.

David also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well.  I think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much.  I don’t remember what card it was, but I remember it did him no good against me.   My goal was to completely win the match and then pilfer his Precious Rare “at random”.

To prepare, I took my uberpowerful Demonic Tutor card and oh so gently, put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card.  This way, if you put it in a deck, you can see it stand out from all the other cards.  You only see this if you know what to look for.  

When we met for our match, we get to browse each other’s cards so we know what to expect.  I browsed through his deck and took out his Precious Rare to admire.  While David was too busy looking through my cards, I put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck.  I didn’t have time to check if it stood out, so I crossed my fingers.

Next we shuffled our cards.  Since I could see where my Demonic Tutor was, I shuffled it carefully so that it was below the 75% mark in my deck.  So when he cut my deck, there’s a good chance that the Demonic Tutor would end up near the top.  If I didn’t end up getting this card, I have a second chance of getting the monster instead.

Luckily, when he cut my deck, he cut it above my Demonic Tutor’s location, so I was good to go in that department.  Next, I cut his deck, but since I could see where his Precious Rare was located, I made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldn’t show up during the match.  David was too self-absorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentions.

Things are going well so far, and I’m starting to feel bad for David.  I’m starting to question whether what I’m doing is the right thing.  These doubts are quickly erased by subsequent events.

We start to play.  My job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat.  And try he did.  He tried to do the whole multiple card-draw on me.  I called him out on it.  David tried to act like it was an accident.  This got the tournament organizer’s attention and David a verbal tongue lashing from Alex.

Alex basically told David to stop acting like an asshole and play the game.  This had the effect of crucially destroying David’s credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side.  I shined a spotlight on his douchey ways, so to speak.

Next thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules.  Of course, I made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called Alex over again to adjudicate.  Alex told him he’s full of shit and ruled in my favor.

Soon enough, I had the Demonic Tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top.  By this time, I had all that I needed but the monster.  I pretended to act joyful and surprised when I threw down my Demonic Tutor and went rifling through my deck to get that monster.  David’s face started to go red and his body was very agitated.

The next round, I threw that monster on the table with gusto!  I celebrated with “Yes!” and “I can’t believe it!”.   The other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck.  They were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me win.

The best David can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster.  Knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his Precious Rare safely at the bottom of his deck, I was inwardly confident, but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one out.

Every subsequent round, I would attack him with the monster, pinging his life down.  Of course, during this time, nothing good came out of his deck.  Slowly, his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grew.

Then it was over.  I celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style.  David was so mad he was shaking.  Whenever he spoke, he was petulant and angry.

While I was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune, David had already planned and executed his next cheat.  He took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended.  If you recall, these piles are supposed to be separate so that I could choose which pile to pilfer from.  By mixing them up, he reduces the chance that I’ll randomly take any of his good cards, including his Precious Rare.

I immediately called him out on it as he’s mixing them together.  He starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them.  I make a big show of arguing and acting like I was cheated.  Honestly, it didn’t matter that he did this since I could still see where his Precious Rare was.  This final act of cheating showed his petulance and completely ruined any reputation he had in the room.

I called over Alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution.    Clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device, so the damage was done.  Alex called David an asshole for what he did, and Alex tried to placate my hurt feelings.

Acting hurt and angry, I told him “Fine!  Let’s get this over with.”  David had a smirk under his face, thinking he’d finally pulled one over on me.  Oh, how wrong he was.

While making a show of concentration and trepidation, I spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card, but changing my mind a couple times.  Finally, “at random”, I pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the Precious Rare.

Immediately David let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent.   He quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room.  But I had his Precious Rare.

Everyone was overjoyed that I had completely and totally demolished David and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time.  We all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved.  Honestly it was the highlight of the tournament.

David dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him go.

I never told anyone about my deception.  I think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against David to deliver justice.

tl;dr  I outcheated the cheater by knowing the future.

That's not how it works, you bitch. You ask me first. I would have said, Yes, of course you can have a Hot Pocket. It was just the last straw.

Rick, Laura, and I moved into the house and lived peacefully together for three years. Then Laura was getting a bit...nesty, and convinced Rick (her boyfriend) to set up a rent-to-own deal with the landlord. They were buying the house. We agreed I'd be moving out within a year. Overnight they decided that I was their tenant instead of their roommate.

They threw my food out of the refrigerator, they got two dogs and when I didn't want to take care of them said ""YOU are the one who wanted a dog!"" I said I liked dogs. They went out and got two big dogs, neither of them are house trained, one tried to bite me, and they wondered why I didn't want to sit home all weekend watching them while Rick and Laura lived life to the fullest. They decided we had to move rooms. I got shuffled down into the basement.

One night I came home at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. You know, maybe it was even 3 AM. The next day Rick demanded to know when I got in, and said that was too late to be coming home because it woke the dogs up.

kilcunda,85,,115,14dtol,,679,"**WARNING: WALL OF TEXT AHEAD! Also, this was a long time ago for me, names are replaced and whatnot.**

I was on a piece of playground equipment known as the 'Jetty' at my local primary (elementary) school in grade 2, enjoying some time to myself during lunch. This ~~kid~~ entitled little shit from the year below me - We'll call him Trent - decides that he wants to play on the Jetty instead. He strides up to me and tells me to leave, to which I tell him that I was here first but I'd be happy to share it with him. 

Trent didn't seem to like the sound of that idea. Instead, he chucks an absolute tantrum and wails at me with language no five or six year old should even know, let alone repeat in public. I try my best to ignore him at first, but then he started pushing me. I made the fatal mistake of pushing him back just as a teacher walked around the corner - We're both dragged of to the principal's office. The whole walk there he keeps leaning over and whispering to me; 'Oh, you're in *so* much trouble now"".

The principal sits us both down and calmly asks us one at a time to tell our stories. He starts with me. I calmly tell him the abridged version: Trent wanted the playground to himself, I offered to share but he hit me. When it's Trent's turn, the *little fucker* breaks down and cries like a baby seal getting clubbed while watching the Arctic equivalent of Bambi's mum's death scene in slow motion. He tells the principal about how I threw him off the Jetty, called him names and swore at him (""I... I don't want to say what he said. It was the F-word but I don't want to say it because I know it's a bad word Mr. H, he was just so *mean!*). 

I sat there, wide-jawed and absolutely gobsmacked at this lying little turd, watching the principal hug him and tell him everything's going to be alight. Mr. H kept glancing at me like I was some sort of devil-spawn sent from hell with the soul purpose of making poor little Trent's life utterly miserable. I try telling him that he's lying, but it's just no use. After all, I was the older kid in the situation - I should have known better, right?

The principal asks me to step outside his office to have a chat with him in person. He tells me how disappointed he is and how ashamed I should feel for hurting poor innocent Trent. I was given a punishment I wouldn't have (at the time) wished on my worst enemy - Garbage duty with Ms. Hanzel. 

Ms. Hanzel was a rotten old lady that seemed to absolutely despise students. She was about sixty years of age and physically looked like a female version of Jabba the Hutt with glasses (**EDIT**: Anodesu suggested [Roz from Monster's Inc](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110515131745/pixar/images/4/43/Roz.png). - Much better example!) . I could constantly hear her shouting at her pupils from outside the halls, she would scream like a damn banshee and wouldn't stop until someone started crying. One time she (apparently) grabbed my younger cousin by the wrist and yanked her outside when she tried to ask a question during 'silent time', leaving a large red mark all down her arm. But that's a story for another time. The point was, Ms. Hanzel was an absolute witch, and I was going to spend the next few hours picking up rubbish in front of all my peers with her.

The principal walked me outside her office and made sure I knocked on the door before heading back to check on poor little Trent. I slicked inside, dreading talking to the wicked she-beast inside. I had a little note with me asking her to give me rubbish duty until the end of the day, then to send me back to the principal's office after school. She looks at it briefly, hands me a plastic bag and stares at me for a good thirty seconds. ""What did you do?"", she asked me. Frustrated and scared, I broke down crying. Between sobs I managed to tell her about how Trent lied to get me in trouble. She sat down, and I'll never forget the story she told me.

She explained that back when she was my age, many teachers would spank students for misbehaving. She told me how the boys would usually get a paddle across the butt, but the girls would get a smaller but still painful ruler across the back of the hand. One day when she was at school, another girl accidently knocked over the teacher's inkwell and blamed it on her. She got 10 hard spanks to the back of the hand (Demonstrating the first three with her ruler in mid air, one after another). She told me how much she despised this disgusting little girl, and how badly she was treated for the rest of her time there.

Then, she went to the bin in the corner and poured it's contents in to my plastic bag. ""I believe you. Go back to class, I'll tell Mr. H that you picked up all the rubbish you could find, okay?"". I couldn't believe it. I was standing right in front of the nastiest teacher in the whole school and here she was giving me the equivalent of a royal pardon.

To make an already long story short, I did go back to class. At the end of the day I got another yelling from the principal and a call home to my parents, but it wasn't until the next day that everything fell in to place. I was on a different part of the playground when Ms. Hanzel came storming by with a little boy at her side - Trent. I was overcome with an emotion I didn't recognize then, but one I now associate with sweet, sweet revenge. I strode up to the Jetty and played on that damn thing all lunch while Ms. Hanzel made the little shit pick up all the rubbish down below me. I don't know what she got him for, but she made sure I could see the brat at all times, and more importantly, the little brat could see me playing on the playground he so desperately wanted to himself. I like to think that she helped me achieve the revenge she never got.

**TL;DR: Feral kid wanted playground to himself, tried to fight me then told principal that I punched and swore at him to get me in trouble when I wouldn't give him what he wanted. The school's most evil teacher doesn't fall for his lies, shares a touching story with me and makes the little shit watch me play on the playground while he picks up rubbish, enacting her own long-overdue childhood revenge in the process. No one asks for tree fiddy.**

Despite her poor luck with her first roommate she decided to place an ad to find a new roommate. She went through several interviews and finally found a really nice  - or so we thought - girl who seemed down to earth. 

Being new to looking for roommates we overlooked a couple of things that we really shouldn't have. For example, on her move-in date she was supposed to have damage deposit and first months rent. She had the rent, but no damage deposit. She said she would have it that night, but it took about a week until it was all collected.

Through the first month my wife noticed this girl was a complete slob. Her room was just a series of garbage bags packed with her lifes possessions and she never cleaned up after herself. 

The roommate came home one day with a cat. My wife didn't mind since she only has me stopping her from becoming the cat lady with 50+ cats. The problem was the roommate never fed the cat. She would leave for days on end with no one taking care of the cat. My wife always took on that responsibility. Good thing cats are pretty resilient.

Then, as per their arrangement, she was supposed to pay the rent prior to the first of the month. That date came and went, and she had only paid about a third of the rent by the time the next months rent came around. 

At this point my wife hadn't seen her roommate in weeks. We only knew she was there because she is a complete slob and left a massive mess in her wake. Finally my wife had a sick day and managed to see her roommate and asked for the rent money. The roommate said ""yeah I will go get it right now"". She never came back that night. 

We knew she was getting the boot at that point. The next day my wife went to class and came home to an empty apartment. Her roommate moved her stuff out and even took the kitten she never took care of. No forwarding address, nothing.

We were out about $1000 in total. After about a week of searching we managed to get her parents number. After explaining the situation to them they gave us the phone number where she was staying - but not the address. Reverse look-ups weren't as easy back then (at least to me).

My wife called several times and received some pretty rude responses from her now former roommates boyfriend. At this point we were suing her for the money she owed us and needed to serve her the papers. So without the address this was pretty difficult. 

After a bunch of unsuccessful calls, I decided to try myself from my home in a different city. I called and the boyfriend answered. I told him he has a chance to win a brand new big screen TV if he can answer three skill testing questions. I made up some BS match question and a couple other BS questions that I didn't even listen for his answers.

I then told him, congratulations you've won the new TV. He said ""BS, this is a joke"" and I re-assured him it was no joke. I told him the TV would be delivered in a couple of days between 6pm-9pm and asked where he wanted it delivered. He gave me the address. I said we would have someone come by and confirm the address this evening and asked if he would be around. He said his girlfriend would be. My wife went directly over there and rang the buzzer. When she answered she said she was there to confirm the address for the TV delivery. When the former roommate came to the door my wife handed her the court papers and walked away.

sie_liebt,49,,121,18wvrd,,679,"I always pegged by boyfriend as a cool headed, patient individual. Last night he told me a story that showed me a side of him that I did not know existed (and is deliciously evil!). 

As he explained, in their youth, guys are kind of confused/terrified of women. As they get older, most guys go through a transitional ""asshole"" phase, like a rite-of-passage, when they realize girls are just people and not all that scary/special. He happened to be in that phase while he was in law school. 

He and a friend had gone to a local bar and, while there, met two young ladies (too young to be in the bar but utilizing fake IDs) that they seemed to really hit it off with. From what he explains, the night went well. They partied after the bar, had a blast, drank and partied until 6 or 7 AM, and passed out, although they didn't hook up (save your breath - he has no reason to lie about this as we share laughs about most of his ""exploits""). The next morning he and his friend drove home, feeling successful. 

They each wait the requisite three days before texting the girls, only to receive no response. No big deal. They shrug it off. He calls again a few days later and again receives no response. His friend has no better luck with his chick. Eventually they move on/let it go/forget about them. 

Weeks later they go to that same bar, accompanied by a female friend of theirs. It was packed, but they manage to score three chairs at the bar. He and his guy friend hang their coats on their chairs and leave their female friend inside while they go smoke. 

When they return, who is sitting in their chairs but the girls from before, accompanied by two new guys. Annoyed at being brushed off, he immediately approaches the girls and asks what was up, why they had dodged contact. The girl he had liked responds smarmily with, ""It is what it is."" He says that's fine, but could she get out of his seat because he and his friend were sitting there. She brushes him off again and replies, ""I said it is what it is,"" and turns to her ""date"" to ignore my boyfriend. 

That sent him over the edge. To allow guys to pay for all of your drinks, party with them, pretend to be friendly then ignore them, and then be a complete bitch when bumping in to them was unacceptable in his eyes. 

Attending a law school in the South, he explained that there were cops that pretty much patrolled all the local hot spots. He found one and explained to him that a girl in the bar had been bragging about using a fake ID and, as a law school student, it was his obligation to inform the authorities. The cop asks what she looks like, and my boyfriend explains that she's a pretty blonde girl. The cop looked at him like he was crazy (as my boyfriend said, ""stared at me like what are you doing bro?"") and asked how he was going to know which girl it was. My boyfriend just told him he would give her a hug ""goodnight"". 

He walked back into the bar, gathered his friends, and then (acting as if it was an afterthought) returns to the girl and says, ""Look. No hard feelings. Have a good night!""

He said the look in her eyes as she watched the police officer approach her from over his shoulder was priceless. She went to jail that night after being dragged out of the bar by a cop and having the contents of her purse dumped all over the street in public.

His only excuse was that local calls were free, but he was ignoring the fact that the landline itself had a monthly charge. For the rest of that school year, my dad took the cord with him to class.

Except for some reason she focused all her energy on me, so for a long time, like years, I had no friends in my class.
I did have a neighbour who was my friend. She was a year ahead of me, so I didn't see her much at school, but she was cool, always invited me to birthday parties where none of my bullies showed up.
One time, she defended me in front of the bullies. It was pretty simple but pretty awesome, since no one else had stood up for me before.
My neighbour friend fell out of touch when she moved away. I was 12.
Recently I looked up the bully on Facebook to see what she was up to. I had kind of hoped she would get fat and miserable and work at Walmart. She's still pretty, with a new baby and a husband and their own house in a nice neighbourhood. Yes, I got all that from Facebook. I was a bit disappointed. I thought karma was better than that.
Then I looked up my neighbour friend. She's an engineer now, living in Switzerland and working on the CERN supercollider. Cool. Like, probably the coolest person as an adult I can say I knew growing up.
That's when I realized the smug feeling I was hoping to get from seeing my bully miserable wasn't nearly as satisfying as the sweet feeling I got from finding out my saviour was successful.

Henge,122,,228,1h878t,,670,"This tale takes place several years ago at a Renaissance Faire.  My friends and I had been there several hours. Watching the shows put on, walking around, looking at what the venders were selling, eating giant turkey legs and having a ye olde good time. My friends wanted to see the afternoon joust so we meandered our way in that direction. We got there with plenty of time to spare so my friends are doing things like taking time finding a place to sit, getting on line for beer and checking out what is on this side of the faire. Near the jousting field they have a blacksmith shop and demonstration area. Since the joust was soon the guys working there are just hanging out. 

I'm looking at stuff and eventually strike up a conversation with the guys at the blacksmith booth, who are around the same age as me. I'm asking stuff about how they got into metalworking, how long they have been doing it and stuff like that. I've done some gold/silver smithing in my time so we are talking about our experiences.

Now would be a good time to interject some relevant information. I am female, mid-twenties and like many people there, I was partially in renaissance garb. In other words my ""huge tracts of land"" are lookin' good. But not obscene because this is a family place, too.

My friends wandered off to watch the joust so it's just me and the blacksmiths and some neckbeard who showed up. I skip the joust because this is some good conversation and I am interested in metalwork. As the conversation continues Neckbeard starts interjecting. Apparently, he has done metalwork, too! 

He is not particularly polite. I start asking the blacksmiths about projects they have done. Every project the blacksmiths mention, he has done, too. Oh, you got injured doing something? He did something similar but got hurt worse. So on and so forth, in a rather smug manner. The blacksmith are not enjoying Neckbeards company.

This goes on for most of the joust. Maybe I had just been in the sun too much that day, but it was getting pretty grating and eventually I'd had enough.

**""You know, all your one-upmanship stories are just making me think you have a small penis!""** I hear myself say.

Silence.

cbhaxx,43,,248,1pe73e,,671,"Story:

I just got a job in the Army (IT-related), and I was filling out this form to get security clearance to work with military equipment in the base. Now this required me to get a few signatures from different leaders within the base, among them the Head of Security (Ranked Lieutenant Colonel). I had gotten all the others signatures, all I needed was this guys signature. 

So I headed down to his office, on the card scanner there was a note saying ""if the light is green, come on in!"", so knocked on the door and went in. I saw the guy sitting behind his desk and here's how the conversation went:

Me: ""Good mor-""

Him: ""I don't have time, get out""

Me: ""I just need your sign-""

Him: ""I said get out that door, NOW!""

I went out the door completely baffled with the lack of respect he showed me. I respect the rank as long as the one carrying it shows respect towards others, something this asshole did not. I was pissed.

.

The revenge:

Eventually I got one of his coworker's signature instead, but I wanted revenge, I craved it. After a few weeks I was able to work quite independantly (I have worked a similar job at another base for 2 years), so my boss let me roam around as I wished. 

I found a map over all the network connections in the base, and there it was. His goddamn office. I unplugged all network connections going to his computers (He has a few with different security clearances).

An hour goes by, then it happens. My phone at my desk rings, and guess who it was, the fucking asshole. He started yelling right away:

Him: ""None of my goddamn computers are working, get here right n-""

Me: ""Sorry we're swamped call me later""

ditchtwicker,58,,90,14jsoi,,669,"Some years ago, a local internet provider kept giving out my phone number by mistake. My number was 12X-3456, their number was 12Y-3456. At first I thought people were simply misdialing but then I would ask them to confirm the number they were calling. They would read back to me the number that the installers had left for them to call to complete the installation and it was always my number. The odd time this happened would have been fine, but living in a university city, you would get hundreds of installations (and thus calls) when classes started.  
  
This actually went on for a few years and every time I called them to fix it they would either say that it had already been fixed or that there was nothing they could do about it, even though they were the people giving the installers the number.  
  
After a particularly busy fall installation season, I had had enough and called the IP one last time to resolve it. When they once again said it was beyond their control, I told them what I was going to do. I was going to tell their customers that I was no longer an internet service provider and that I would be unable to complete their installation. That they would need to get a hold of competing company B that was authorized to finish the installation (and thus get the contract) at the following (correct) phone number. The customer was never to call this number again and that I thought the customer was stupid for even using company A to begin with.  
  
The IP flipped and said I couldn't tell their customers that! I replied that I'm not really saying anything untrue, and that if they really don't want their customers to hear that, then they can get their customers to stop calling me.  
  
Over the next few weeks I had about 20 calls that I gave this reply to. And then, after years of annoyance, the IP was somehow able to figure out how to fix the phone numbers and I was never bothered again.  
  
Edit: Just adding a few things -  
  
I didn't want to change my phone number as I had had it for years and was worried about losing touch with friends.  
  
What worked with the customers that I told this was that while I never claimed to be the company they were calling, I did not deny that I was the IP, and the little script I used could certainly have sounded like I was the IP. In no way did I lie though or cross a legal line.

neduil,120,,184,1artru,,665,"When I saw this subreddit, I knew I had to post my petty story.

During my time at uni, I had some really loud neighbors downstairs. I was on the third floor, and they were on the first. They had a little garden on their apartment that was right under my room's window. When I looked down from it, I saw the garden, all of it's plants and it's cold stone floor.

Being women in their 20's who were in college, they used that space to party. Hard. I would not normally mind that, but they did it VERY frequently - often everyday -, disregarding the fact it was an all residential building, filled with families and other students that did not share their willingness to party at home.

They studied only in the late afternoon, so they could party all night and sleep during the day. I studied all morning and afternoon. The obvious result: While they were OK, I had many nights without proper sleep.

Me and some other neighbors tried to solve the issue friendly, only to be dissmissed by spoiled bitches that thought what they did in their apartment was their bussiness only. Then we tried to solve it by legal means, calling the police and some other stuff. We even got them to pay a couple fines. But $400 to be shared among 4 rich spoiled bitches was not going to stop them from doing wrong, of course.

So I decided to prank them. It was small stuff at first. Very petty. One night, while they were partying, I cut the power to their apt. in the electrical box on the street. Took them a whole week to figure out the problem. Another night, I peed on their car. I threw poison on their plants from my window. That petty, silly kind of thing.

The other neighbors were at it too. I heard (although I'm quite sure it is not true) that one of them went down the underground, cameraless garage one night, with sandpaper, and took all the paint out of one of their cars. I wish I had at least seen the car afterwards, but I never did. I'm sure we annoyed them, but not enough for anything to change.

This went on for a long, long time. More than a year, I'm sure. Maybe two. A couple years can be a lot, when you have to study for your tests, has a lot of personal problems and can't get enough sleep.

One glorious day, a rat poped up at my own apartment. I never knew where it came from, since I was on the third floor and my place was always very clean and tidy, but it was ok. I got lucky and was able to trap the creature into a corner and kill it with a broom. Since it was so easy to get rid of him, I never told anyone about the rat.

It was a fairly big rat. About the size of both my closed fists side by side, excluding it's long tail. It was pretty hairy, all black. Not very unusual, I guess. But I had never even seen a rat this close before, so I thought it was interesting.

The thing is, I have a mild interest in biology, so I decided to preserve the cadaver in formaldehyde to dissect it later. I had dissected plenty of frogs before, since I loved the electrical impulse/muscle contraction experiment, but had never even touched a rat.

So I decided to keep it in my room (yeah, I know...) inside a little bottle for a few days. I was honestly hoping to dissect it for some first year students later, but then...

One night my loud neighbors started to party as usual. It was a wednesday. But that night, there was something different in the air... A smell. Delicious and meaty, a barbecue was being held in their little garden. It was easy to spot from my window, since it was night and it had coal burning bright and smoke climbing all the way up to meet me.

When I saw that, my mind suddenly cleared. I knew exactly what to do. I took the dead rat out of his wet sarcophagus, and out of the third floor window he went. My aim was true that night, as it felt right over the rest of their cooking meat. The formaldehyde, flammable as it is, proppeled the fires beautifully, and the sound of what I believe was a small explosion followed the sound of the rat hitting the grill.

I did not see anything, as I immediately retreated my face back insede the room. Screams everywhere, friends of the bitches running to the door, sounds of beer bottles breaking... The party was over in a minute. They called the police right after.

I did not sleep that night. Nor the rest of the week. I was sure they knew it was me, and was expecting either retaliation or legal action. But, to my surprise, they moved out a week later.

A mutual friend told me the reason: someone from the top apartments had thrown a rat filled with alchool on their grill. The police investigator that came that night somehow deduced it was from very high, above the fifth floor.

Nobody got hurt, but the bitches understood the gesture as a death threat and left. According to my friend, they moved out to a new apartment, but they don't do partying at their home anymore. They are scared as fuck that they might have an even crazier neighbor than the last one.

I was the only witness to my own crime. They never saw me.

I went to see her and she said ""these ideas are too sophisticated for a college sophomore to have come up with. It had to have been plagiarized.

ACraftAway,38,,198,1n1s4q,,661,"This is my new favorite sub! Just found out about it couple minutes ago and have a really good story to share.

So this happened near the end of August. Now just for reference in NYC their are two types of public buses: express and local. Locals are usually your generic public bus design, but the express is like a coach bus inside (they have nice comfy  double seats and a narrow walkway in the middle).

Anyways I was on my way to work and I have a nice suit and my favorite shades on. I always use the express bus since it saves me time to get from where I am to Manhattan. So this obnoxious lady comes on the bus and  hits a couple people with her bags and one of those architect/artist rolls (you know the one you roll up a painting/blueprint in). The bitch even had the nerve to yell at a dude whose elbow touched her ass, while going down the walkway, even though his elbow was on the arm rest before she got on. So she finds her way to the seats behind me and is sitting directly behind me.

A couple of stops down I start feeling the kicking on the seat. I have no idea what this lady was trying to do, but she kept kicking my seat every couple of minutes. Usually I would just ignore it and enjoy my morning music and the bus drive, but this bitch was asking for it with her previous behaviour.

**The revenge:**
We are arriving into Manhattan and was getting a call from my coworker/good-friend. Since she was the only one close to me (or I wouldn't have the balls to do this), instead of answering it normally I do this:  
*""Hey, who's the one?""  
""Female, Late 20s, Blonde hair, brown eyes, blue top, black skirt? Gotcha, don't call me again on this phone.""*

My coworker was like dude wtf before I hung up, but I texted him saying I would explain when I got to work.

So the kicking stops and I could hear  her grabbing her stuff and she was ready to get at off the first possible stop. She glared at me briefly on her way out and was sweating on her way to the front of the bus. Bus pulls over and she gets off and starts running and calling someone, while looking at the bus. Windows were pretty tinted, but I hope she saw my smile of pure pettyrevenge. 

Told my coworker what happened when I got to work. We were laughing so hard at it. It was a good day.

""No problem, neighbor,"" I said with a smile, ""just glad I could help you out."" I wished her a good day and went on my way. 
I found out later from my friend that she remembered me and how badly she treated me and was fucking mortified when she found out that it was I who had been maintaining her yard. 
Her husband has since passed away and I continue to this day helping her out when I see the yard looking bad. Sure I'd like to think that I do it out of the goodness in my heart, but there is a part of me that takes some satisfaction knowing that I'm slowly, as my Mother used to say, killing her with kindness.
Sometimes the best revenge is kindness in the face of rudeness, for it acts as a mirror reflecting an image to the recipient that they are often mortified to see. ",Killing 'em with kindness.,774,pettyrevenge
giggsrules69,66,,103,18g2j6,,656,"Background: My mother-in-law can be incredibly irritating at times. Everything my wife and I do is taken as a slight against her, and when she doesn't get her way, she constantly makes passive aggressive remarks about it. She's always complaining about how we never visit even though we only live an hour away. (Please note that she has not once visited US since we moved where we are now.)   
  
Setup: This past weekend my wife and I were in town where her mother lives. It's also where our alma mater is; where we met, etc. We were there to attend a festival that we go to every year, but in order to appease my mother-in-law, we agree to go early in the day to have a late lunch with her. Of course, she decides we HAVE to go to this place that's 45 minutes in the next town. She suggests that I drive all of us (me, my wife, MIL, and brother in law).  
  
Petty: Here's the thing; my mother in law HATES Led Zeppelin with a passion. The first bars of Stairway send her into fits. However, being the passive aggressive person that she is, rather than say anything, she'll silently fume and make offhand remarks, or try to talk over the music. So here I am sitting in my car waiting for my extended family to get in for an hour and a half round trip. I load up my iPod to my handy-dandy Led Zeppelin playlist consisting of several hours of playtime, and decide that's what we're listening to on the whole ride to and from brunch.  
  
My wife knew what I was doing; she never said a word.

SGTRmadillo,112,,127,17cvo8,,660,"I have been working at Ralphs Grocery Store for 8 months now, and this story starts 1 month into my employment. 

It was raining outside and I was braving the elements to bring in carts for customers, and a lady, I will call her ""Mrs. Wonderful"", decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry, directing her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts, right at me. I begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the elements, but I smile and wipe down her cart for her. I tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries, none of them would be wet, but she disregarded my statements, and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots, for it to get rained on. The gears have begun to turn in my head. 

Months go by, with her coming in about twice a week to buy $300.00 dollars worth of expensive wine and vegan groceries, for her very wealthy husband I assume, based on her massive ring and Porsche Carrera GT. And then I became a cashier, and I saw my opportunity. Whenever I worked, I would watch for her, and when she got in line I would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout. Everything was ready for my revenge. 

At our first encounter behind the register, I slipped her salt off the belt to the side, because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out, and basically everything needs salt. I don't ring it up, its not on the receipt, its not in her bags, and its not hers. Perfect. She comes in the next day, only for salt, and with a very unhappy look on her face, I smirk. I do this a couple more times, not every time, because this is a long play, and I cannot get caught, but about every third time. 

But I think she is about to put 2 and 2 together, so I move to phase two of the plan. I start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register. She comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing. On the day before, I had taken the Cumin from her belt on another cashiers register. Mrs. Fantastic speed walks in, arms a-swinging, and walks up to the 58 year old gentlemen who had rung her up the day before, and yells ""WHERE IS MY FUCKING CUMIN"", and he started laughing. Made this all worth it, and made me want to continue this to the next level. Mrs. Compassionate then storms over to my manager, who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks Mrs. Forgiving is just looking for free groceries. 

Then Mrs. Giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out. Fuck, what am I going to do now. So whenever I am sweeping the floors and I see her. I steal an item from Mrs. Sharing's basket. Even watching the belt she sees nothing happening, yet her butter, an egg (yes, only a single egg from the carton), some spices, the occasional meat, and when I'm feeling really ballsy, a bottle of wine, gets put swiftly back on the shelf. I can visibly see her breaking down week after week. Looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute, watching the belt, being aggressive and hateful to the cashiers.

I step it up another notch. I start to not steal her groceries, but swap them with the competitors brands. I have no idea if she notices, but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home. One particular night I replaced her 50 dollar bottle of wine with a 3 dollar bottle which I had stored under the register, one that looks eerily similar to the one she bought, and I think I saw her start to tear up when I rang the correct one up for the next day. At least I hope that's what I saw. 

1 month ago I decided to lay off this woman because I think I broke her enough to say I've gotten my revenge. That didn't stop her from still checking over her shoulder, watching the belt, staring at the screen that tallies up the order every time she is in the store. BUT, she still leaves her cart in the lot and doesn't put it away, so I am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while, just to keep her on edge, anxious, and fearful, and will continue to haunt her shopping experience, Forever. 

So Mrs. Delightfull, thank you for shopping at Ralph's, where you get Real Low Prices, and a Fast Checkout.

cobrachai,57,,165,176su2,,660,"I told this story to my group of friends and they all told me to post it here, so here goes:

The scene: my dorm room, freshman year. Though the rest of my floor was going out to a party, I decided to stay in for the night. Still wanting to socialize with whoever was still around, however, I left my door open. Later in the night as most people were leaving for the party, I heard someone stumbling in the hallway outside my room. Upon further inspection, I found it was a girl from down the hall. Let's call her ""P"". P had a reputation for getting incredibly drunk and sleeping with the guys on our floor. I never had much of a problem with her (I didn't care who she slept with and her drinking wasn't any skin off my back), except that she never seemed to acknowledge me unless she wanted something. Sure enough, when she saw me standing in the doorway the first thing she asked was, ""Do you have any vodka?""

My immediate response was ""no"" because (1) I didn't have any vodka, (2) she was clearly already drunk, and (3) I'm a firm believer that if you're going to ask for a favor you should at least offer something in return, especially if it's someone you don't know very well. However, P kept pestering me and stumbling around my room even after I asked her to leave. After about fifteen minutes of unsuccessfully trying to talk her out of my room, I formed another plan.

While P was distracted by something on my roommate's side of the room, I took out two shot glasses. I poured water from a nearby bottle into one and old water from the vase of my bong into the other. ""Here, I'll take a shot with you and then you can go to the party,"" I said, and handed her the shot of bong water. We drank them together and she immediately got wide-eyed, saying it ""tasted like ass"". I covered it by saying, ""Hey if you wanted good liquor you should've bought your own.""

TL,DR: Drunk girl wants free shots, I gave her bong water instead.

EDIT: Apparently it's important that I specify for the purposes of this story that I'm a girl, and that both P and I are (mainly) interested in men.",No free liquor for drunk bitches.,825,pettyrevenge
bobeet,75,,112,1btoyl,,656,"My dad owns a a show camaro - all black paint, original look, and garaged constantly. He almost paid more attention to that than to his own kids, but damn it paid off.

So one weekend dad's cleaning it before a show, and the 5 year old kid next door decided he wanted to help dad wash it, and dad said no - he takes the kid back to neighbour and tells him to keep him away, and the kid repeatedly comes into our yard trying to help dad wash the car. About the third time dad gets an earful from the neighbour about not letting the kid do something that 'can't hurt'. Dad went off on a spiel about how washing a car like his was a several hour process and it wasn't just a car that needed cleaning, but he was getting it ready for a presentation showing.

The neighbour didn't get it, and ended up saying somewhere that *you just can't control kids sometimes*. But dad didn't relent and went ahead with his cleaning - and went inside leaving the car doors and boot open to air and dry before coming back to do the final detail.

In the meantime the kid next door sneaks over again and starts washing dad's camaro with a hose, spraying the interior accidentally, and using a cloth he'd dropped in mud. Kid fucked the paint badly all down one side before dad got hold of him, marched him back to the neighbour's, and told him to control his fucking kid. Dad again gets an earful about it only being a car, and to get his priorities in order, people are more important than possessions and besides, the kid was only trying to help and didn't mean to damage anything.

Dad was fuming - he'd have to miss a show, and needed to respray a section of the car and buff back the rest, and have the interior pro cleaned to undo the damage.

So a year or so later neighbour gets a brand new 4WD, and it soon gets dirty, and dad gets in the kid's ear - tells him the dad's car is really dirty, and really needs to be washed. 

Then dad passes the kid a stainless steel scouring pad and tells him that's the best way to get the mud off everything - and yes, the kid got to ruin the neighbour's paint on every damned panel. Dad was pretty happy with his handiwork, and said to us ""hell, sometimes you can control kids"".",Petty revenge on neighbour,768,pettyrevenge

jaimystery,40,,138,1pfh4c,,653,"Years ago, I worked as a waitress at Denny's. It wasn't a bad first job but . . 

There was this hostess who would have a total fit if a lowly wait person touched the podium while she was on duty. She barely tolerated the managers disturbing her holy altar of hostessing. If a lowly wait person did touch her podium, she'd screw us later not seating us then slamming our sections.

Anyway, the Saturday and Sunday morning rushes usually started at 9 am and ran to 2 pm but I always was scheduled for 6 am while The Holy Hostess (HH) usually came in at 8.

One quiet morning, I happened to notice a screw on the floor in the hostess area but I was heading into the kitchen so I just picked it up and kept moving.   

As it turns (ha!) out, the screw was from the underside of the hostess podium and HH had ""the day from hell"" because the podium was all wobbly and pouted until one of the managers found the extra screws and fixed it.

Well.  You know what that means right?  A small Phillips head screw driver became a permanent part of my waitperson kit and every few weeks, I'd take a moment and loosen a few screws before HH showed up.  Not enough to destroy the podium - just enough so it would wobble a little throughout the morning.  The best was doing it on a Saturday because the wobble would get worse by Sunday.

as expected, a bunch of people cut line. since it was a college, and a smaller one at that, there was a lot of ""oh hey!! can i stand in line with you??"" it was annoying, but it was something we were expecting so we just let it go.

periodically, the cops would go up and down the line to keep people from getting to rowdy or doing something illegal.

then a bunch of high schoolers came and cut line right in front of us. it was extra annoying because there were about 10 of them and they clearly didn't know the artist well (they only knew his most famous song because it was on the radio; they didn't know any others). we were angry but let it go. things got worse as they began to litter and talk extremely loudly/annoyingly. then these kids whipped out a few joints and some vodka in water bottle. you could tell they thought they were the shit because of how they were acting with every sip and hit they took... yet you knew that they didn't really do it often (i.e. one girl took a gulp of coke, a tiny sip of vodka, another gulp of coke and then spit the whole thing out, exclaiming how disgusting it was). they were obnoxiously blowing the smoke our way and throwing the water bottles everywhere. i mean i don't care that they were underage and smoking/drinking, do whatever you want...... but don't be stupid about it.

WestonP,84,,173,1hepfm,,655,"Background: I live in condos that have attached garages, and each unit's garage door and driveway is right next to each other. This is nice because it was hard to find a condo with an attached garage in this area, but comes at the cost of the bedroom of some units being directly above a neighbor's garage. I'm one of those garages, and as such take care to be quick and reasonably quiet whenever I come and leave late at night, although some is of course not reasonably avoidable. Most times I'll just drive my truck instead if it's late, because it's parked outside on the street, so I can come and leave quietly, without my garage door opener shaking my neighbor's bedroom.

Today: It's the early evening and I leave for a short trip in town. I see my next door neighbor talking in Russian with her family in her driveway, right next to mine (a common occurrence; a bit odd, but I don't mind). I come back 20 minutes later and find that another one of her family's cars has parked in my driveway, fully blocking my garage door, despite her driveway being extra wide (end unit). Now there are also four people out there standing around and loading something into the trunk.

I pull up and wait for them to see me and move out of the way, but nothing. They know my car (it's very distinctive), and they can hear it, but I now also put on my left blinker to politely indicate that I intend to go into my garage... still nothing. They're slowing walking and loading stuff into the trunk of the car, and I'm fully in their view, but it's like they're making an effort to look elsewhere and not acknowledge me. I yell out the window, ""excuse me"", and they ignore it. I yell again, louder, ""excuse me"", and they turn their backs and ignore me again.

Wow, there's about ten ways they know I'm there and what I want by now, but each one of them refuses to even acknowledge me. Oh, fuck you! I apply more than the necessary amount of throttle and go down the street to park... not burning rubber, but enough that it's yet another thing to catch their attention. I get out and walk to my door, glaring at them, but they still wont even dare look at me. They continued to be parked in my driveway for another 15 minutes, and finally leave.

Tonight: It is now 10:45pm and I've been making a point to no longer limit my garage noise. It's still a bit ""early"" in the night, but I've already completed my noisy garage projects (drilling and hammering) that I had previously intended to save for a reasonable hour during the day tomorrow, and of course I've opened and shut the garage door a few times, mildly slammed a few doors, etc.

I have also decided that I should go ahead and finally go see the late showing of World War Z tonight, so I'll be leaving for that in about 15 minutes. And of course, I'll be driving my car that's now parked back in the garage...

out-of-phase,32,,129,1hnr5c,,644,"First, a little background.


When I was a freshman at high school, I didn't really ""fit in"". I wasn't an outcast by any means, but I just didn't have a certain clique that I stuck with. I didn't play sports, I wasn't into video games, I didn't get very good grades -- my passion has always been music (and, at the time, skateboarding). I like to think I made friends indiscriminately. And I did; if I met you, and you were a nice human being, I never saw any reason to not become friends with you.


Because of this, I was friends with older kids, geeks, band kids, jocks (the nice ones anyway), nerds, drama kids, etc. I never got into any fights or instigated conflict. I was always sort of the ""class clown"", and I got the nickname ""Swiss"" for usually being neutral on most things and always trying to make peace. The only time I was a loud mouth was when I was goofing around.


As y'all probably know, even if you do your damnedest to avoid trouble, in high school it will inevitably find you. I rarely had problems, but when I did I tried to stand up for myself, and usually they'd resolve themselves. But there was one group that started giving me trouble my sophomore year, the senior jocks.


Not all of them, mind you, but there was a group of about 5 of them that were absolutely obnoxious and picked on EVERYONE. Most people would just take their shit because they didn't want to get beat up. These guys were textbook meatheads; all of them were on the football team, all of them dipped (mouth tobaccer), drank, had pickup trucks, lifted weights, cursed all the time -- the list goes on. But, when they first started picking on me, I stood up for myself. I don't mean physically.


Basically, in the past, the best way I found to deal with bullies was to make them laugh. It's hard to stay aggressive and angry if you're laughing your ass off. But with these guys, I guess they interpreted my humor as arrogance. So, instead of leaving me alone, they decided to single me out. Any time I saw any one of their group in the hall, it was *guaranteed* that I'd get called a faggot or douchebag, and likely that I'd get the old bully go-to ""shoulder bump"".

It got worse and worse as time went on, and I found myself having to choose my routes to classes carefully, and I found I had to leave a certain time, because often they'd follow my car when I left, honking, yelling, etc.

One day, I'd had just about all I could take. School had just gotten out, and everyone was walking to their cars. They started following me and laughing, and called me an ""inbred jap piece of shit"". 


I'm 25% Japanese, and I guess they'd gotten tired of calling me the usual names. Now, this insult finally crossed the line for me. My dad got a *lot* of shit growing up for being half Japanese in a conservative white neighborhood, and his mother even more so. Instead of ignoring them, I turned around, looked directly at the dude who insulted me, and said, ""Your mom should've swallowed."" They took off running after me. I managed to get in my car and speed off towards home. I thought I'd lost them.

About 10 minutes later, I see a red pickup truck flying towards me. Lo and behold, there they are; one of them driving and three of them in the bed of the truck. I stop speeding and slow down to about 30 mph. They get right up on my tail and start throwing rocks at my car, leaning on the edge of the pickup, screaming all sorts of shit.

I kept slowing down until I was going probably about 20 mph, and they were RIGHT on my ass, throwing rock after rock at my car.

Then I brake-check them, HARD. I smashed my foot into the brake-pedal, looking in my rearview mirror. They slam on their brakes. I hear ""oh shit!"" and see ALL three of them fall off the truck. One had been standing, leaning over the top of the cab; he fell forward over the windshield and hit the ground in the front. The other two had been sitting precariously on the sides of the bed. They both lost their balance and fell backward onto the road. I couldn't stop laughing.

I sped off, and within seconds they were all back in their truck, furious, and started tailing me again. I drove to the local police station (happened to only be a minute or two from where we were -- small town), and they follow me into the parking lot, still yelling and hollering. They get out of the car and start walking towards me, and two police officers come out. 


They sit all of us on the sidewalk and ask what happened; I told the police they were following me throwing rocks at my car. The dudes denied it back and forth. One of the cops saw the rocks in the pickup bed, and saw a bunch of little dents on my car. I go free, they get arrested for criminal mischief. Their parents managed to get the charges dropped, in exchange for taking away their cars. For the rest of their senior year, they had to ride the bus to school.

**TL;DR -- Bunch of racist bullies won't leave me alone, chase after me in their pickup throwing rocks at my car, I brake-check them, they get angrier, follow me into a police station parking lot, get arrested and lose their cars for the rest of the year**",High school revenge on racist bullies,773,pettyrevenge
foxekiwi,41,,141,1bw6rn,,640,"I witnessed something beautiful tonight. I live down a one way street in a small town. In the middle of the quiet, rainy night everything was changed by this most horrible screeching noise and a car blaring on its horns. My SO and I look out the window, and see this truck dragging its front bumper with a car chasing it. The truck stops and starts honking its horn, because ANOTHER car gets in front of it and stops it. Traffic gets backed up, everyone is in their vehicles on phones, and here come the cops, driving over lawns to get to the front of the line. Turns out, the truck had just been involved in a serious hit-and-run just a few minutes ago and all the other vehicles were chasing it down. The petty revenge? There were 3 cop cars parked at various points on the road, the furthest one being about a block back. The guy in the truck insulted the cops, and tried to resist arrest. Instead of being led to the nearest cop car, right behind him, the ass hat was led down a walk of shame, between all the cars that had chased him down, to the furthest car. It's raining hard.

bedoran,110,,113,1528y3,,643,"This is my first post, so have at any grammar mistakes and idiocy I will have displayed.  I think this fits well here, but I guess that's up to you.  To the petty revenge!

I was driving over to my parent's house to help my little brother with some Spanish studying.  It was raining and I have a personal rule to never drive over the speed limit during any type of weather that could affect my car's ability to operate safely.  Also, when I say raining I mean getting out of your car and closing the door will get you just as wet as jumping into a pool with all of your clothes on.  I'm minding my own business and this dbag driving a Lexus LetterLetter came speeding up behind me and chose to stay behind me on our four lane road (2 in each direction).  I don't know the model and since car companies don't like to give their cars names anymore I know it has to be some letters, but I digress.  This jerk is seriously riding my bumper.  It's a major pet peeve of mine on the road and even more so when there's bad weather.  If I have to slam on my breaks I know he'll just end up crushing the back of my car causing all sorts of inconvenience and possibly injuring me in the process.  So I slow down well in advance of the next light to prevent this a-hole from wrecking my car or myself.

As I sit at the light I happen to notice he's got his blinker on ('turning indicator' to some of you, also known as the 'thing never used' to even more of you).  I'm the only car in front of him at this point too.  Normally I would inch out a little into the cross walk to let people turn but at this intersection there isn't one for me to inch into, and I refuse to inch into the freaking intersection.  So I sit there like any other car would.  I wasn't even going to try to fuck with this guy's day.  He's obviously got somewhere to be, and so do I.  

Then the fucker honks his horn the second the light turns green.  He hadn't honked at all while tailing me, nor when we pulled up to the intersection, nor while I sat there not inching out.  He did it so that he could be driving off so that he wouldn't have to deal with me retaliating, but unfortunately for him I drive a manual.  So instead of driving away I just let my car ""die"".  I start it up and let it die again (just to act like i've got a problem).  I roll down my window and do the wave to get people to pass me up.  There's no reason everyone else's day should be slowed down too much due to one dbag.

While doing this I see the guy behind me is super unhappy and yelling and flipping me off because he can't get around me because he pulled up so close to my car.  I would have just sat here for a second light change to make him even later to where ever he was going, but I noticed he had no jacket on.  At this point I don't mind getting a little wet.  I open my door and while my awesome rain jacket keeps most of me dry I 'try' to push my car.  Apparently this guy's lady friend in the car told him to get out and help me move my car.  So this bastard gets out of his car in flip flops, shorts, and a t shirt screaming and yelling.  I just smile and continue to 'try' pushing my car, and as soon as he touches the back of my car i jump in, start it up, and leave him standing there like an idiot.

I hope you enjoyed your day asshat.

Edit:   I guess I should clarify some things.  First off I was driving in the right lane and he came up behind me.  I know some people disregard weather and will speed so I was keeping my ass in the travelling lane I guess.  Never heard it called that, 'round these here parts it's the ""slow lane"".  Secondly, I wasn't turning right at the light this whole thing went down at.  I was going to be turning right in a couple of lights.  So, no, I wasn't being THAT guy in the passing lane going slower than other traffic.  Hopefully I addressed your questions.  Holler if I didn't.",Road rage in the rain.,756,pettyrevenge
Redsnork,61,,141,1r3jsq,,644,"I'm sure all of you know about the Boy Scout's of America's recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs. But back when I was in the scouts, the policy was still in full effect. For the most part, at least in my troop, everyone seemed to be in full support of it.

One time, on a campout, I was sitting with my friends, talking about the BSA's policy on gay scouts. An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation. He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against God's wishes, and that the policy is to ""protect"" boys who wouldn't last in scouting anyways. He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be ""too dirty for them.""

At the time, I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout, and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop. I was a closeted bisexual, and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troop.

As the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting, I grew more and more pissed off; but didn't do anything at the time. The final straw came when he told me that ""a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank."" That day, I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout award.

About three months later, I got my Eagle Scout award. The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremony.

At the reception, I ran into one of my good friends, who also happened to be bi-curious. (We had a slight history, but that's another story.) After the reception, as everyone was walking out, I started to hold my friend's hand. (I had explained everything to him earlier.) Mr. Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped. Feeling ballsy, I gave my friend a light peck on the lips. I almost could feel his shocked stare.

I had to walk past him on the way out. As I walked past, I said ""this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did.""

onrole,53,,111,1ko9pv,,641,"Today I was driving to work and I was stuck behind the most atrocious driver. The interstate plates gave them away as a tourist so I was happy to leave some distance between us and not pressure him. Eventually we reach a roundabout entering the town where I work and we both continue straight, he indicates off the roundabout and cuts it short, driving over the footpath into a parking spot. This was all fine until he immediately decides he doesn't like the parking spot, fails to indicate and pulls out in front of me, cutting me off. Now annoyed I made fine use of my horn and we continue down the road where I got to see him again fail to indicate at traffic lights, pull into a no standing area, pull out ( he did indicate) in front of me, and then parks over the driveway into the employee parking area of my work.

BlueMacaw,100,,110,1dwua2,,638,"My latest hobby is [coin roll hunting](http://www.reddit.com/r/crh).  I've been going through rolls of pennies, saving copper pennies, looking for rare dates or errors, and finding the odd foreign coin.  It's cheap entertainment and easy to go through several rolls a night while watching T.V.  

My credit union has several branches near me so if I'm running errands near a branch location, I'll pop in and buy anywhere from a few dollars worth to a $25 box if they have it on hand.  Every single branch I've been to has been very friendly and helpful...  except one.  

I went into a recently opened branch.  There were no customers in the lobby and three tellers were manning the windows.  I walked through the little cordoned maze and stood there for way too long before one of them finally acknowledged my presence and called me over.  I asked if they had a box of pennies in the vault I could purchase and the teller instantly said no.  Didn't look, didn't make a call, didn't offer an explanation.  I know hauling a heavy box of pennies out of the vault can be a hassle and the teller might have been having a bad day, so I let it slide.  I'd seen a few penny rolls on the counter at the next teller's window, so I said if she or the other tellers had any pennies on hand I'd buy a couple of dollar's worth.  Again, she said no they didn't have any at all at the moment and didn't bother to look or ask the other tellers.  I didn't call her out on it; I smiled and thanked her and said I'd check back in the following week.  

At this point in time, I had accumulated more than a couple of hundred dollars worth of pennies that I needed to deposit and hadn't decided on a ""dump"" location.  Lazy teller seemed deserving of this honor.  So every week for the past 4 weeks I've been bringing in around 30 pounds of rolled pennies to this branch and managed all but once to drop them off at her window.  

**TL;DR  Lazy teller wouldn't give me 100 pennies, so I gave her 100 pounds of pennies.**

I coach the only girl team at the camp and they compete against the other boy teams of the same age. The boys are much taller, physical and overall quicker than my girls but I teach them to compete and play hard since there is an obvious mismatch. Well one of the boys at the camp is a hot shot, you know the type. He thinks he's the star of the camp and he won't listen to a thing the staff members tell him to do because he's better than us. So this little prick starts talking shit to me about how I'm a terrible coach because after a week of playing 2 games a day we've only gone 4-6 and he has yet to lose a game at camp.

So of course he's mouthing off to me about how he's going to destroy us etc. Well like I said, my girls play tough and with only 30 seconds left in the game we were up by 1. Little shit head made his move to the basket and he missed a point blank lay up from literally a foot away from the hoop. He is devastated and complaining that the got fouled (no girl of mine within 2 feet of him he just plain missed). So with 10 seconds left he has the ball again down 2 and decides to take a 3 pointer to win the game. Only problem was as he was dribbling up I told the ref next to little shit head to make sure both his feet were behind the 3 point line. This caused little shit head to look at his feet and one of my girls took this chance to steal the ball from him. We won the game and he was crushed, like on the verge of tears crushed. 


I walk over to shake hands with the other team and give him a shit eating grin but he rages off to the corner before I can even get to him. Not too bad for a scrub coach and shitty players.

vondahl,59,,125,17qeiz,,623,"Hi all, I have a story I thought you might enjoy but it's a little more justicey than revenge-based so let me know if I should post it elsewhere!

About ten-ish years ago, I was in 6th grade. In my math class, our teacher had assigned seats at random. Of course with my luck, I was seated between the two most obnoxious kids in my entire graduating class. I'll call them Justin and Corey.

They were *those* kids, the ones everyone hated. We all knew one growing up. They were beyond annoying, and they just didn't know when to stop. They were a lovely combination of socially inept and attention-starved. To add to my misery, Corey and Justin hated each other. They would constantly bicker and fight, sometimes trying to swat at each other and usually hitting me as well since I was the only thing separating them. It was hard to pay attention with this going on around me, and one of my favorite classes was quickly turning into a nightmare.

My math teacher was a good guy, and a good teacher. After he would give the lesson, he'd sit down at his desk. If you had any questions about the work we were doing, you could form a line at his desk and he'd give each student one-on-one help. 

On this one fateful afternoon of class, Justin was being particularly obnoxious and decided to focus all of his energy towards making my day awful since Corey was absent from school. The whole class period, he was hitting me, saying mean things, taking my pen, etc. but back then I was too nice (read: doormat) of a girl to do anything in retaliation, and I didn't want to get in trouble for disrupting class. 

I had just about had it up to here, and I was thankful that I didn't understand one of the math problems we were supposed to complete in class. I practically skipped up to my teacher's desk to get some help and take a little break from Justin, but lo and behold, guess who also needs help on the in-class work...

There was another kid getting help in front of me, so I patiently waited my turn and tried to ignore the fact that Justin was in line behind me, elbowing me in the ribs and trying to drive me up the fucking wall. 

At that moment, I had finally had enough of it. Weeks of pent up rage and frustration boiled to the surface. Just as that other student walked back to his desk and my teacher was waiting for me to ask for help, I swung around to face Justin and, with all of my 11 year old strength, I bitch slapped him as hard as I could and told him to go to hell, consequences be damned.

My teacher saw the entire thing. I was expecting him to drag me straight to the principal's office, but his reaction was quite the opposite.

killmesara,37,,115,15js57,,626,"My mom is awesome, and everything I learned about revenge comes from her. 

My whole life Ive suffered from extreme insomnia. It's gets so bad at times Ive been hospitalized. When I actually do get to sleep, I tend to sleep through alarm clocks.

When I was in highschool my mom would put a cordless phone in my room and call it from her job all morning until I woke up and headed to school. 

She owns her own business so alot of times shed just have a secretary call our house and let it ring until I answered. This worked great until senior year. 

One morning I couldnt take the phone ringing anymore so instead of waking up I just picked up the phone and threw it into my wall as hard as I could. Smashing it to peices. 

My mom was rightfully pissed when she got home from work and saw not only a smashed phone, but a hole in the drywall in my room. She didnt punish me and barely said a word to me that night. She went and bought a new phone and I assumed everything was cool. I promissed her Id fix the wall and pay for the phone, and she told me to just fix the wall and everything would be cool.

That night I took an extra sleeping pill so I could fall asleep at a relatively decent hour, and be able to answer the phone when she called. I fell asleep and waited for the phone to ring. 

What I didnt know was my mom was plotting something evil for me. 

That morning she woke up early and unboxed her new cordless phone, plugged in the base, made sure the handset was charged and then hid the handset in my basement. She also placed one of my cordless microphones next to the phone. 

My band practiced in my parents basement in highschool so there were microphones, amps and a pa with monitors taking up a majority of the basement. 
My room was directly above where we practiced. 

She then took the mic reciever and plugged that into my Crate BXL 500w bass amp and 4x12 cabinet and turned all the levels up to 10, then went to work. 

When she called the house about an hour later the whole house began shaking and all I could hear was what sounded like a washing machine being raped by gladiators and a small goat. I shot out of bed and began frantically racing around the house trying to put an end to the sound. I was half asleep and crashing into everything. After about 20 seconds I heard a fizzle and a pop and the sound stopped. I though I was losing my mind, when I heard the smoke alarm in our basement going off. I ran down stairs and saw a small amount of smoke comming out of the speaker cabinet of my bass amp. Upon further inspection I saw my mom's new phone and the microphone placed near it. 

After I finished getting ready for school, I called my mom to tell her that I got the message and was wide awake. 

She ended up blowing three of the 4 speakers and fried part of the amp head, but I respect the shit out of her for it and besides it was shitty amp anyway.

I walk up to our freezer, gently peel it open, and there it is. The bag of Pizza rolls, really small in size. Dumping its contents onto a plate, i am left with one whole pizza roll and a sea of crumbs. And only one person in all of the people who live in our house do this, My brother. I have asked him many times to just make the extra couple if there are any, and he never does. He has done this MANY times before. I'm done with this.

So, I make the lone wolf, take him off the plate and cram the little guy into the very back of his shoe. He knew it was a suicide mission, but he was glad to Accept it.

TripleFFF,38,,94,1ghzli,,620,"Hey guys, I finally had something to post here today! :D

I run a recording studio in an industrial complex, and my apartment is above the offices of a contracting company. We get along pretty well, they stay out of my way and I don't make any noise during the day as my soundproofing budget is non existent. I have a private gated section and driveway that leads out onto the road. The contracting company has offstreet parking and access through a right-of-way down a separate driveway, but they have a fire exit that opens into my driveway that they leave open sometimes when it gets hot. I don't usually mind so much, but we have had run-ins in the past with their guys wandering into my section and lounging around on my downstairs furniture, smoking or making phonecalls.

Today I walked out into my yard and there was a shiny, signwritten Mercedes parked DIAGONALLY in my driveway, blocking all three carparks. I made a quick phonecall to the office downstairs to ask them to move the car, and the girl at the desk said that it was a clients car and they were currently in a meeting. I heard her ring the boss who was in the meeting and tell him about it, and he said it would be moved right away. Fair enough.

Well, 30 minutes goes by and the car isn't gone. I'm a nice guy, but I get petty about things like my private property. Besides, it was 3:30 and I needed to buy some stuff before the shops closed. 

**The Revenge**

I stomped back up to my apartment, making as much noise as possible, and crashed around making 'getting ready to go noises'. When this didn't get a reaction, I jumped behind my drumkit and tore out a MASSIVELY loud fill, complete with ear splitting crash cymbals and double kicks. Seconds later I heard an alarm chirp and three giggling executives came out and jostled to move the car. They waved in the general direction of my tinted studio windows and headed back inside to finish their meeting. No bad blood, but perhaps a lesson learned :D

zalloy,29,,80,1504pk,,630,"This one happened back when I was in junior high. The carnival came into town, and a bunch of us decided to get together and go have some fun, since we were still young enough to get into it. We were going on the rides, and playing the games, and enjoying the ""fair food"" that is always available at these things. Fried dough, etc.

Well, of all the people on our group, I was the only one who was wearing a jacket with a zipper pocket, so everybody asked me to hold on to their money and stuff while we went on the rides, so it didn't get lost when we'd get flipped upside down or whatever on the rides. 

So, everybody gives me their money. I zip it up tight in my pocket, and we all go enjoy the rides for a while. After a couple of hours, a couple of other kids showed up that I didn't really hang with, and my ""friends"" decided it would be cool to ditch me and go hang with them while I was on one of the rides.

Well, I got off the ride, and they were nowhere to be found. I was going to be honest, so I looked around for them for about an hour, but didn't find them.

I opened my pocket, and I had about $50 in my pocket that they had apparently forgotten I was holding.

I left the carnival, walked to the local pizza place, ordered 2 large pizzas, left a nice tip, and called my mom to come pick me up. Told her not to fuss about dinner, that I had it covered. 

She showed up, and saw me standing there with 2 large pizzas, and started asking questions. I explained what happened to her. She said, and I quote, ""Fuck them! Serves them right!"" And we went home and enjoyed our pizzas, and I went out the next day and enjoyed what was left of the money.

Great concert, good music, all was peaches. Then at the ending act, a drunk lady that was sitting behind us decided to move up practically sit on our laps to try to get the singer's attention. She was very obnoxious, bouncing about and interrupting any kind of view we had. 

All four of us were getting pissed. By the end of the song, I had enough. I wanted to see the best part. I inched up to see the lead singer, as he threw his guitar pick to the front row. It landed right in between my feet, and slid back about 5 inches. I reached downed and grabbed it. She shot me the meanest look she could squeeze onto her face, and I just smiled.

tmtreat,78,,112,1lap64,,623,"So my first time on my own after college, I got an apartment with a buddy in Austin, TX.  When signing the lease, we found it odd that they made us sign an ""intent to move out"" form, but the property management agency said it was standard and we were naïve so whatever, we signed.

Not even two months into our 1 year lease, realtors start showing up at our apartment, trying to get it ""pre-leased"" for the following year.  This is odd, I think, so I consult my lease.  Sure enough, if written ""intent to move out"" has been submitted, the apartment can be shown to prospective renters as long as a reasonable time and date has been agreed upon with the tenants. 

Problem is, these realtors would just show up unannounced at all hours of the day to walk around our place with complete strangers.  I called the owner of the unit (who was the other party to the lease), and she was in 100% agreement of my interpretation: realtors MUST call at least 24 hours in advance, and only after we reach a mutual agreement on the date and time can they stop by to show the place.

Yet, it continued.  7:30am on a Saturday morning, a knock at the door from some realtor.  After explaining to him that he cannot do this, he replies  
""read your lease man, I can come by whenever I want.""   
""Actually, the contract is between me and the owner, and you've never seen my lease.  We need to schedule a time first.""  
""Whatever, I'm already here and you're already awake so you might as well let me in.""

The last straw was when one afternoon I went for a quick run (I was out of shape, so it would be 20 min max), and left the door unlocked so I wouldn't have to carry keys.  I get back to the apartment and the door is locked.  After 3 hours of waiting for my roommate to get home from work, we go inside to find the business card of the fucker who had shown the place while I was gone and proceeded to lock me out.  That was it.  No more of this shit.  I call the guy up to explain that he had just locked me out of my own home.  His reaction?  ""Well, I guess you've learned to never leave the door unlocked.""

Wow.  I was ready for some revenge, but had no way to go about it.  Random unscheduled visits from random people.  What could I do?  Would this actually continue for the next 10 months of my lease?

Until one day, an opportunity fell right into my lap.  I see a voicemail left at 10:15 on a Saturday morning from a guy saying he'll be by to show my apartment at 11:00am.  ""Great"" I think.  ""Thanks for the heads up."" But I had recognized the voice.  It was the same guy who locked me out and told me off- I still had his card and confirmed it with the phone number.

I knew he was coming, but he didn't know I had gotten the message :)

A few minutes before he was set to arrive, I go into the kitchen (the kitchen island is right in front of the entryway) completely naked, and start doing prep work for dinner.  Big knife, chopping onions and the like, earphones in as if I were listening to music.  Right on cue, I hear a knock on the door at 11:00.  Gametime.  This guy's gonna see my hairy ass!  After a couple of knocks, a key goes in the door.  Deadbolt unlocks.  The door opens behind me, and quickly closes.  Hah!  That'll be an image he'll never forget.  

But this guy's persistent.  ""Knock knock knock.  Knock knock knock.""  Door opens again, and promptly closes.  More knocking.  *Take the hint* I'm thinking to myself.  The door opens again, and I hear footsteps approaching me.  *No fucking way.  The nerve on this jerk!* I feel a tap on my shoulder, and I whirl around, giant kitchen knife in the air and I scream ""WHAT THE FUUUUCCKKKK!!""

The guy's terrified face turns to desperate placation.  ""[It's ok, I'm a realtor!](http://www.gifsforum.com/images/gif/other/grand/87543089841e81c58a760a9c82e4035e.gif)"" Entirely pissed off, I yell ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE"" and literally chase him out the door.

kurisu313,69,,111,1c3910,,621,"To set up this story, you should know that my girlfriend is the most teeny-tiny person in the entire world.  Well, maybe not quite, but she stands at a whopping 4’8” (142cm for you yanks) and is also very slender of build.  In addition, she’s Asian which makes her look even younger since we live in England.  By comparison, I’m an averagely tall white guy, so we make something of an odd couple.  Ironically, she’s older than me at 28 to my 27, though no one would ever guess that to look at us.

One day we are eating at a restaurant that we often frequent (lovely chips!) since we usually eat out for Saturday lunch.  A middle-aged couple sits at the table opposite us and the woman seems to have some kind of problem with the way she’s looking at us every now and again.  I try to write it off as me being overly sensitive and assume that at worst she’s one of those assholes who are offended by interracial couples.  Well, I ain’t stopping for you, lady!

Well, the meal wears on and we’re just chatting and joking like any normal couple.  At some point the waiter approaches to just check that the meal’s alright, which it is.  He then walks over to ask the other couple if their meal is okay.  You can see the man about to affirm when his wife (I guess they’re married) jumps in with both barrels.

“How can I be okay when you allow that to go on in your restaurant?”  She hisses.  The waiter looks a little perplexed (she hasn’t pointed at us or anything) and asks what she means.  She jabs her finger right at me and says; “How can you let that paedophile get away with that?”

Now, I’ll admit that in retrospect I had a dozen comebacks.  But this is real life and nothing was forthcoming in the moment.  The simple fact is that my girlfriend could pass as a schoolgirl if she wanted, but I never saw her that way.  I was mortified, and I’m not a confrontational or aggressive person.  A.K.A, a wimp.  My girlfriend though, is a damn sight brighter than me and jumps in with a quick retort.

“What did you call me?”  She demands.  You can see the woman shrink back with sudden confusion.  She’d been accusing me, after all.  My girl strides out of her seat, towering to her intimidating not-quite-five-feet and faces the woman head on.  “Just because he’s younger than me doesn’t make me a pervert!  He’s twenty-seven!”

It was pretty funny to watch.  The woman went an odd shade of purple, clearly not used to being in a position where she couldn’t bull her way through or one where she had to apologize.  Well, that’s my take on her character anyway.  Not that I’m biased against her or anything.  Her husband(?) looks half-embarrassed/half-amused, so I stick with that.

Anyway, the banshee mutters a vague apology and calm returns to the restaurant.  I think the waiter was just relived that it all ended, the poor bastard.  He got us a complimentary drink.  Made sure to tip him a bit extra for that.

As satisfying as that was, I’m sure you’re all asking where the petty revenge was.  I have no idea how she pulled it off to this day, but my girlfriend managed to snatch their little jar full of condiment packets while she was at the table without anyone noticing.  We heard them have to ask the waiter for some later on.

**TL, DR;** My girlfriend is the world’s smallest condiment thief.

idontknowhowtotype,44,,81,1cw5fj,,628,"  So i used to work at a coffe shop. Let's call it space dollars. It was a small store but got a lot of business because of the drive-through. So we would make coffee and occasionally small food items for customers and a good 99% of our customers were great, but there is always that 1% who are complete asshats. 

   Well one morning i was assigned to the task of making food for all the customers and taking drive-through orders. So everything was going great the first few hours of my shift. It was just another morning trying to start off our customer's days the right way. Then a woman pulls up to the box outside in her car and I answer ""Good morning welcome to space dollars."" I hear her talking on her phone and receive no reply. I'm thinking who could she possibly need to talk to at 8 in the morning. So i wait patiently listening to this woman talk about nothing important for a good 30 seconds. 

  Finally, I decide I've had enough as she is holding up the line. I get back on the headset and say ""Good morning"" again. This time with a why the hell do i have to deal with these kind of people tone on my voice. She finally responds and says ""Excuse me! Can't you tell I'm on the phone?"" I wait a few second not quite sure if she really said this. I'm wondering how people can be this self entitled. Within these few seconds she calls me a ""little idiot"" to the person on the other end. Then I respond with my best customer service I am replaceable answer ""Could you please place your order ma'am? You are holding up the line and people are trying to get to work."" She then tells the person she is talking to politely to hold on ""She guesses she should take her order"" and then laughs.

  She orders a latte of some kind I can't recall because this story is not about that. My coworkers and I have by now decided that we collectively hate her. So when she orders an oatmeal that takes a minute alone to make I am fuming from my ears with hatred. She wants me to put splenda and steamed milk in her oatmeal which we make with water.

  She gets to the window and rudely holds out her money and doesn't look at us while she continues her conversation about nothing. She is driving an old beat up minivan which makes me realize her life may suck. Still having manners and being decent to other humans shouldn't be a problem so I made her oatmeal, handed out her drink, gave her the change, and sent her off. 

Here comes the revenge. I know this woman. She comes in everyday and gets the same oatmeal and eats it on her drive to work. So I made it perfect with beautifully frothed milk and 6 splenda nice and boiling hot and put a plastic knife in the bag(instead of a spoon). She had to stare at her favorite morning breakfast and not eat it. Good luck lapping up your oats with a knife on the highway. It was probably cold before she at it. Ahhh sweet vengeance.

I still to this day picture her at a red light trying to get a couple of little morsels balanced on her knife only to drop them on herself when she brings it to her mouth.

G-42,49,,171,1fgxue,,623,"I was laid off temporarily one winter.  During my off time, I got a phone call from a guy I knew a few years earlier.  Kind of a good-for-nothing, but generally harmless.  He told me he'd started a painting business, and had a huge contract, and could use any help he could get, fast, and knew I was off and might want some work.  He was based out of a city about 70 miles away, so he said I could stay with him if I wanted, he's got room.  So I took him up on it.

I get there, and the guy doesn't have a truck, and asks if we can use mine.  His is ""in the shop"" - total bs, he didn't even have one, but I didn't know that yet.

We go to the first house to paint(he really did have a contract to paint several houses), and he points me to where he'd like me to start.  I have painting experience and he knows it, so I don't need a lot of supervision.  But I don't notice him doing anything at all.  Just going to the bathroom every 15 minutes or so.

Well it becomes obvious pretty fast, guy's got himself a coke problem.  To the point where he can't do any work, just gotta inhale powder all day.  Now I don't begrudge a man his sunstances, coke, weed, acid, alcohol, whatever, as long as you're meeting your responsibilities, and not dragging down others around you.

Over the next couple of weeks he hired a couple more people who came and went, and didn't get paid for their short stints.  But both those people were, to be fair, absolutely terrible, and caused more damage than they were worth, so not paying them was reasonable.  

Over those couple of weeks, when he'd get good and high, he'd get talkative(as blow tends to do to a person), and he'd let slip how he can't have any utilities in his name, cause he owes them all hundreds or even thousands of dollars - phone, internet, electricity, water, gas, even car insurance somehow - the works.  He's got a Good Girl Gina at home, who's pretty sick of this shit, but is too nice and trying to fix him instead of helping herself.  So everything's in her name.

So a couple of weeks go by, I do my work impeccably every day, and it's time to get paid.  There's no money to pay me.  He's making excuses about how he didn't get some money the customer had promised, like I'm too stupid to see where the money really went.  Anyway, I had nothing else to do, so I worked another week, listening to his promises that I'd be paid the next friday(the end of 3 weeks or work).  Sure enough, friday came and there's no money to pay me(but there's been blow every day for 3 weeks now).

So, I leave.  I'm not working for free.  And for revenge on getting 3 weeks of work out of me for free, I sent an anonymous letter to every utility he owed money to, telling them where to find him.  He immediately had collectors on his doorstep, filing summonses against him, for thousands of dollars.  Plus, with me not doing any work, the customers went from being impatient with how slowly work was being done, to firing him for breach of contract.  Good Girl Gina had enough and dumped him.

He had to leave town pretty much immediately.  He had no vehicle either, so packed a bag and hitch hiked out of town.

katealatea,49,,127,1eel73,,616,"I had to go to BB&amp;B one day about a year ago to get a birthday present for a friend. The store was one of about five in an L-shaped strip mall, and the parking was minimal. I noticed someone pulling out of a spot almost next to the entrance, and thinking ""Hey! My lucky day!"" I pulled up to the side of it, signalled, and waited to get in.

The person pulled out (by backing towards me, and driving away) and I pulled in -- and I instantly heard someone LAY on their horn. Apparently, some guy in an enormous truck had been waiting to park in the same spot from the other side, and I had taken it. (Granted, had I noticed him, this would have been a huge dick move on my part. Still kind of was, but by accident, I swear.) I was about to pull out and give it to him (and tried to signal this), but he roared off, swearing out his window at me. I felt like a huge jerk, but I figured that was that, and went up into the store.

As I'm rounding the first corner of the store, I feel a rush of wind approaching, and this guy goes stomping by me. As he passes, he turns to me and goes ""That was my fucking spot, I was there FIRST."" And then he's gone in a whoosh of cologne and fury. Okay, I get it, you're pissed. I tried to say something to the effect of, ""I'm really sorry, I didn't see you, I can go out and move my car,"" but he's moving at Mach 5 and just shakes his head at me and takes off, and I refuse to sprint after him.

Okay, fine, I maybe deserved that (even if it was an accident). I continue shopping, and no more than three minutes later, this guy does the same thing -- jog-by bitch-out, something to the effect of ""That was incredibly rude. What the hell is wrong with you?"" Again, I try to say something to him, ""I'm really sorry, did you want me to move?"" but he rolls his eyes and sprints off. Now I'm getting pissed.

I am shopping for maybe five minutes more before, out of the corner of my eye, I notice this guy put it in cruise and get ready to do it to me again. Now, normally I'm completely anti-confrontational and am a complete gutless wonder (despite being 6'3"") but at this point I'd had enough. He's almost past me and starts in with another ""You have absolutely no respect --"" and without thinking, I pivot and slam my feet down in front of him, and shout, ""**HEY!**"". He freezes in his tracks.

I am inches from this guy's face now (and yes, I am taller than him, though not by much). ""This is the third time you have come sprinting by me to chew me out. I told you I was sorry, and I will say it again. **I'm sorry**. It was an accident, and I did not see you before I  pulled in. I have apologized, multiple times, and I have offered to move my car. Now, you have two options. You can come outside, and I can move my car, and you can have the spot. Or, you can decide that it is not that important to you, you can accept my apology, and you can **MOVE ON**. Now, did you want me to move my car? Because I will go outside right now."" 

This guy's mouth is half open. He just shakes his head and stares at me. 

""Fine. Then **GROW UP**."" And I turned on my heel and left.

I really did feel bad about it at the time, but I just could not handle his raging indignance. A few minutes later, I saw him skulk out of the store empty-handed. Pretty sure he just came into the store after me so he could tell me off, which frankly makes it even more pathetic.

We had a carry-out special pizza do combat Little Caesars $5 hot and ready, that comes default with pepperoni on it. If you want something else, you can substitute the pepperoni for the topping of your choice free of charge.

One night, a lady calls in and orders one of the specials with pineapple on it instead of pepperoni. However, since it automatically comes with pepperoni in the system, a new employee neglected to remove it, and as a result had both toppings on it. To this lady, this was un-fucking-forgiveable. She wanted her pizza, she wanted it free, and she wanted it delivered to her house when it was remade. Yelling up a storm, calling everyone in the store incompetent, telling us to get real jobs, etc, because a newbie happened to mess up once.

Wouldn't you know it, I was the lucky one to deliver the pizza to this dragon-lady. I arrive, and there she is waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs to her apartment. I start apologizing, futilely attempting to soothe bitch incarnate. She just looks at me. And as soon as I hand her the pizza, she spits on me. Not on the ground, not near me, not at my feet. On. Me. I was stunned. Shocked. I was at a lack for words.

We blacklist her in the system, so she can never order from us or our franchise owners stores again. But this wasn't enough for me and my friend.

On my day off, we waited until she left her house. Went up to her door, and emptied an entire bottle of super glue into the lock. Wadded up the tumbler good and nice. Nothing turns your day into pure misery faster than being locked out of your own home.

The worst part of the job was rude customers, especially when you are doing a carry out for them. One day, a super rude bitch comes to pick up a grill she bought and had assembled. So me and my bro there went to help her load it. It was a big heavy one, so we had a third guy help us. As we were lifting it into her minivan, she saw that there was a dent on the underside panel. Upon seeing it, she began freaking out on us and insisting that it was our fault. Due to where the dent was at, there was no way it could have happened other than during the assembly. So as she bitched and yelled at us, we took it back to customer service where it was offered as an exchange. We politely asked if she would accompany us back there to ensure that we got the right one. She flatly refused and commented along the lines of it is the red one and that hopefully we weren't too dumb not to find it. Back in the grills, my friend commented it would be funny if we brought back the wrong one. Agreeing, I grabbed the first red one we saw, a model that was at least a hundred dollars less and brought it back. She didn't even check it. So we loaded it and she was on her way.

riotryan,49,,118,1rbgg4,,611,"This happened over 20 years ago, but it's probably my best example of petty revenge. I was 20 years old and worked at a fast food restaurant. It is one with the guy named Jack in the commercials. Well, there was a big e coli problem with our meat as some children ended up dying in Seattle. It severely hit our sales negatively.

The next management meeting we had, our manager announced some new company changes. Instead of taking a break in the break room, we would eat our meals on our breaks in the dining room. Their thinking: if the public saw the  employees eating the food, it would reinforce that the food was safe. As a bonus, we would get one free meal per shift for a limited time. This policy was a big change to our previous policy, and I was shocked. I asked, ""Really? We'll take all of meal breaks in the dining room?""

That is when my manager shot back, ""Yes really! What's so hard to understand?"" I was a bit thrown off by his attitude, but I always followed the rules. The next day, it was time for my break. I went to the dining room with my manager at the counter watching me. This is when I proceeded to take out my large sub sandwich from the sandwich chain down the street.

I still can the see the look on my manager's face. He walked up to me, ""What the Hell are you doing?""

""I'm having my lunch,"" I responded with a shit-eating grin.

""And you didn't even want a free burger and fries?""

""No way. That food will kill you.""

He had really fallen for her and she genuinely seemed to feel the same way, talking about how she had changed and never felt this way about other guys before. Since he is one of my best friends, I tried to be unbiased and not have any assumptions about her just because of what other people had said. Our group of friends accepted her and defended her, since she our friend's girl, until we found out that she had definitely been cheating on him. Multiple times.

ShaneL79,41,,110,1axtty,,609,"One evening a few years ago I was driving down a main road in my city. This road was normally two lanes in either direction, but because of construction it went down to one lane  for several blocks in the direction I was traveling. I am driving in the right lane at first, then switch lanes just prior to the lane cutting off for construction. 

I've seen it a lot, but can't explain what is running through these people's heads, but prior to moving over there was a truck about 100 meters back in the lane I was moving into. They were the only vehicle around and had been traveling at that distance for a long distance which leads me to believe we were traveling roughly the same speed. Once I moved over this truck accelerated and moved right in on my bumper. Then unlike most idiots I've seen do that, she took it a step further and began honking incessantly. 

Through the construction the road went from its normal 60km/h to 30km/h. I let off the gas until I got down to just above 30km/h. This woman didn't back off even a little. I tried barely touching my brakes so they would flash without actually braking in hopes that she would get the message and back off - she didn't. 

A little ways into the construction zone there was a large metal grate on the road. It was about 3-4 inches thick and did not have a lip to help ease onto it. I was in a little and low sports car so I had to slow down. As I approached this thing I had to brake regardless of how close this idiot was to me. As expected when I braked she had to lock up her tires to avoid rear ending me. The thing was, I didn't brake hard - just gradual but she was so close it didn't matter.

There were four of these grates in total and at each one I braked and she came within millimeters of hitting me. Each time the frequency of her honking increased. 

Once construction ended I moved back into the right lane. This woman passed me then swerved into my lane and slammed on her brakes. Seeing her previous stupidity, I was expecting it and was able to brake without there being any problem whatsoever. Once her road rage attempt failed she floored it ahead and out of sight. That was the end of that - or so I thought....

Late that evening I received a call from the police. Apparently someone reported me for dangerous and reckless driving. The police asked me to go down and give a statement, which I did. When I arrived the cop explained that some woman told them I was not letting them pass by swerving from lane to lane blocking them in. They also claimed I was slamming on my brakes to try to cause an accident. I was pissed that this bitch was lying and tried telling the cop my side of the story, but she didn't seem to care at all. She handed me a few tickets totaling about $500 (I don't remember exactly what they were for but I believe stunting and dangerous driving were two of them). 

The next morning I woke up still pissed and decided to go back to the police station and get more information. I spoke to a different cop that explained the womans report claimed it all happened between such and such a street. Immediately I knew I could proof she was lying about the swerving from lane to lane to not let her pass part. There was construction through the entire area she mentioned and one lane was a giant open pit because of it. I explained this to the cop and he was slightly more receptive, but still told me that if I wanted to fight it I would need to go to court on a specific date. He also mentioned that since she was the only witness, she would need to be there to testify or else I would likely have the fines dismissed. I figured she was aware of that law and this was just a bitches attempt to make me lose a day of pay from work and/or my time. But I was definitely fighting this.

I went to court about 6 weeks later to fight the ticket and step one is going to the counter to speak to a court clerk. This is the person that weeds out the people who either want to just pay their fine, or have absolutely no chance of winning their fight. 

As I was standing at the front of the line I was close enough to hear the people in each of the three windows talking to the court clerk. These two large women directly in front of me began yelling at the clerk and saying ""this is bullshit"" before storming out. I figured ""oh great, I'm going to have the bitchy court clerk who hates the world"". On the contrary. I made a joke as I got to her window about those angry girls in hopes that it would score me some points. I gave her my fine numbers and she began laughing. 

I was confused and a little worried. 

She then proceeds to tell me there is good news and bad news. The good news was the second cop I spoke to hand apparently been on patrol shortly after we spoke and was in the area this all went down. He confirmed my story and dismissed my tickets. The ""bad"" news - well one of those two large women who were angrily berating the court clerk was actually the one who filed the complaint. The police now believed my story and gave her the same fines I just had dismissed in addition to another fine which was in regards to filing a false police report. Total of which was slightly over $2000. The bad news part of that was that I needed to stick around and testify. I did so - happily.

We sat in the traffic court waiting area for about an hour. The entire time those women had absolutely no idea I was the guy who was going to testify against one of them. When the time came the crown prosecutor called us into court. She explained her story then I explained mine. Then to top it off the cop who issued her the tickets and dismissed mine made an appearance and explained his portion of the story. She was guilty on all counts and out a couple grand. The judge even gave her a lecture on lying to police and how she could have been sentenced to jail time for it and told her she got off lucky.

Walking out to my car afterwards I made sure to smile from ear to ear and walk as close to them as possible. It was a great day.

DownJL,53,,104,1ed5ar,,612,"I'm a decent guy, for the most part, but when a craigslist seller pulled the ""bait and raise,"" I whipped up a quick plan to inconvenience the douche.  

**Background:**

I babysat for my niece and nephew one weekend, and after I put them down for their naps, I checked out the Craigslist video game section in hopes of finding something to purchase on my way home.  I found a listing with a bunch of SNES games, a bunch of them rare games that I wanted.  I calculated their worth to be around $250 (eBay averages), and contacted the seller with an offer of $200, having told him how I calculated their worth to be around $250.  He replied that he'd go $225.  I said I'd go $210, and he accepted.  Nice!

The guy was located about 35 miles north of the interstate I used to drive home, but I didn't really care about the added hour of travel because I was going to get a bunch of awesome games!

When I arrived at the meeting spot (McDonalds parking lot), I messaged him and he said he rethought the offer and thought he could get $250+ for the games, so unless I was willing to go up to $250 then he couldn't go through with the deal.  I was pissed...I drove an hour out of my way to make this deal - a deal we agreed on - and this douchebag had the audacity to pull this grimy shit

**Revenge:**

At first, I tried appealing to his integrity, but he brushed it off and said that he was sorry, but that's the way it is.  I had no intention of paying more than our agreed amount, so after my initial appeals failed, I took a couple of minutes to think about how I could inconvenience this guy for wasting my time.  After I had it figured out, I began driving home.  

I messaged the guy saying that I would do $250.  He said ok and asked if I was still at McDonalds.  I told him I was and about 10 minutes later he messaged me and asked which car was mine.  I told him what to look for and he said he didn't see my car.  

Me: ""Oh no, is there another McDonalds nearby?  Did I go to the wrong one??""  (I looked it up to make sure there was).

Him: ""Yeah there is another one nearby.""

Me: ""Should I go there or do you want to come here?""

Him: ""I'll drive over there quick.  I have a get together soon, so have the money ready so we can make this quick, please.""

Me: &lt;waiting a couple minutes&gt; ""Oh hey, I just got your last message.  I figured you not responding quickly meant I should just go over to the other McDonalds.  Are you not at this one anymore?""

Him: ""No, I'm at the one you were just at haha.""  Ok, come to this one again.  I'll wait here.""  Ten minutes later: ""Where are you?""

Me: ""My GPS lost signal and I don't know how to get there now!  I think I got lost trying to find it!""

Him: ""Ok, what street are you on?""

Me: ""I don't know...What should I look for?""

Him: ""Look for &lt;street names&gt; and then tell me if you see any of them.""  Five minutes later: ""See any yet???  I have to go soon.  Please hurry.""

Me: ""I don't see them, but I see a Subway (restaurant).  Do you know where that is?""  

Him: ""There are a couple of them.  Is it the one near the pizza place?""

Me: ""Yes.""

Him: ""I'll be there in about five minutes.""  About five minutes later: ""Your car was a &lt;car details&gt;, right?  

Me: ""Yes.  What are you driving again?""  

Him: ""&lt;car details&gt;.  I don't see you.  Are you sure you're at the right Subway??  The one near &lt;local pizza place&gt;?""

Me:  ""No, I saw a Dominoes when I was driving around (shot in the dark) and thought that's what you meant.  

Him: ""Hahaha WTF!?!  I don't even think there's a Dominoes around here.  You mean Pizza Hut??  It's not even near Pizza Hut anyways.  There's a Walmart near it.  I really need to get going, though, so tell me exactly what's around you and stay there.  If I can't find you, then I have to leave. Sorry."" 

Me:  ""Yeah I see the Walmart.  I'll stay right here until you get here haha""

&lt;five to 10 minutes later&gt;

Him: ""I still don't see you, man.  I have to go, though, so I'm sorry we couldn't make this happen.""

Me: ""Oh I'm sorry you can't find me, but it's probably because I started driving home as soon as you raised the price like an asshole after I drove an hour out of my way.  I hope you enjoyed the runaround as much as I did, dick.""

Chas was quite the fun-loving prankster. One day he found my pipe lying on my desk when I had stepped away, and he took the stem. Not the bowl, but the stem. When I returned and found it gone, he refused to return it, getting a big kick out of my discomfiture (and quickly growing nicotine fit). Hours later, just before leaving, he returned the stem to me. I assured him that there would be consequences. He just laughed.

This called for revenge.

I bided my time.

Many weeks later I bought two of the small cigars that Chas favored. I also bought some cigarette loads. I used a toothpick to insert not one but two of the loads into the business end of one of the cigars, taking care to plug the hole with tobacco when done.

Before walking into the newspaper office, I put the loaded cigar into my shirt pocket, and carried the other one in my hand. Walking up to Chas, I offered him the cigar in my hand. He reached for it, then abruptly withdrew his hand and laughed. ""I know what you did. Thought you could trick me."" He then snatched the loaded cigar out of my shirt pocket, amused with himself over seeing through my clumsy stratagem. 

Stuck the cigar in his mouth, flared his lighter, touched the flame to the cigar and inhaled. Puffed some smoke. For a long moment nothing happened -- I had the sinking feeling that the loads hadn't worked.

banana-stand45,94,,213,17xqxp,,604,"This is the story of possibly my greatest revenge on an enemy. During my sophomore year in college, I dated a guy who introduced me to probably the greatest apartment I have lived in to date. Great location, awesome parties, and lovable roommates. Four people lived in the apartment (boyfriend included) and two significant others would stay over frequently (myself included).

For most of the school year, everyone got along fabulously. Unfortunately, drama slowly built up between the other significant other and her partner. This significant other (let’s call her Tina) was overly dramatic, self-absorbed, and extremely two-faced. Around March, her partner figured out Tina was cheating on her and promptly dumped her ass. This became a problem because both had signed on to continue the lease for the next year. Tina kicks her ex-girlfriend off the lease for the following year and throws a hissy fit when we all aren’t moved out a week before our lease ended.

We begged her to let us keep a few pieces of furniture in the house before our next lease began, as we had nowhere to go, but she had no sympathy. She logged into another friend’s Facebook account to tell us off, so it looked like she did nothing wrong. Frustrated, we packed up our shit and got out.

By now, I was beyond frustrated with her, but I decided the best course of action would be to just ignore her and move on with my life.

My junior year rolls around, and I start my second year at an internship on campus in our LGBTA Office. There are about 7 or 8 interns every year working in the same space but with different assignments. Who walks in the first day? Tina. Fuck.

From day one, she started a crusade to ruin my life. Being passive aggressive, she would often leave notes blaming me for things or broadly stating how she hated drama and anyone who starts it needs to find a hobby. Everyone in the office fell in love with her after the first week, which completely got under my skin. What everyone didn’t see was her setting people up to fail so she could come in and save the day, her leading other girls on only to break their hearts intentionally, and her saying incredibly hurtful things to anyone who dared cross her path.

At first, I tried to tell everyone what she was doing and how she hurt people. This led to a meeting between the head of our department, Tina, and myself. I was scolded for spreading hurtful rumors as Tina cried crocodile tears. Later that day, she “accidentally” deleted a rather large Photoshop file I spent weeks on. She must have “accidentally” emptied the recycling bin too, my work was long gone.

I felt defeated. Since the LGBTA community was so tight knit, you couldn’t risk rejection. Otherwise you lose all your friends. By this point, a good portion of my friends weren’t returning calls or texts.

Eventually, she dated a close friend of mine then publicly dumped/humiliated her. My friend comes to me crying, telling me everything that happened. Apparently, Tina started spreading rumors about me throughout our community. She told them I lied because I was still bitter about losing the apartment to her. Finally, I figured out the perfect revenge. 

The Revenge:

The rumors were already out about me, so my credibility was shot. I did the only thing I could think of.

I was nice. Nice as FUCK.

Suddenly, I was friendly with her in the office. I laughed at her jokes, admired her work, and complimented her fashion. When we were out with friends (especially when Tina wasn’t there), I laughed about the good times we shared and how much fun she brings.

Tina had no idea what to do with my sudden kindness, so she started getting nastier in return. While I did not see it, current friends filled me in on what happened when I wasn’t there. Whenever I came up in conversation, Tina would start spewing hate about me and how I’m trying to get back at her. But when they talked to me, I would only sing her praises. During this time, she was also continuing to lead girls on and break their hearts.

Slowly but surely, I regained every one of my friends. After a year, every one of them apologized to me and told me everything she had them believing. The ENTIRE community turned on Tina afterwards. The administration asked her to leave her internship after discovering the mess she caused for me and other interns, all of her previous friends now unfriended her on Facebook, and she ended up leaving the community in a huff.

Best part? She could have prevented all of this if she didn’t try to spread rumors.

TL;DR: Bitchy ex-roommate spreads lies to make people hate me, I’m kind in return, everyone ends up hating her and she loses all of her friends.",Don't start rumors about me.,817,pettyrevenge
[deleted],50,,76,13pcvg,,611,"Wednesday night I'm at the gym, when I see some kid, maybe 16-17 years old trying to go home without taking the weight off the bar he was using. Trying to be relatively subtle, I asked him ""hey man, are you planing on putting your weights back?"", hoping he would get the hint. He gives me an eye roll and a ""nope."" and keeps on walking. I mean really, what can I do? I add him to my mental list of douchebags and continue with my workout.

So tonight, I go into the gym and see this kid again, benching this time. Now, benching is the one thing that people at my gym actually do, so he is using the last available bench. So then I happen to look up just as Captain Asshat is heading to the bathroom. Boom. Time to act.

I walk over to his bar, take his weights off and start throwing every 45lb plate I can get my hands on onto this bar. At four pairs of 45s, I see him come out of the bathroom.

5 pairs.

He sees me

6 pairs.

""Hey bro I'm using that!""

Ignore him. 7 pairs. 675lbs.

""Dude I'm on this bench.""

I look at him like this news is surprising to me. ""Oh. My bad.""

And with that I walked away, leaving him to unload the fruits of my labors.

Schizophrenetic,65,,157,1ktxgp,,605,"I have a friend who works at a local toy store specializing in antique toys, and since I live nearby, I like to visit him, shoot the shit, and of course, play with awesome antique toys (normal 28 year old man behavior, obviously). About a month ago, he told me about this woman who regularly visits the store, and who he's **sure** is stealing stuff. He's noticed stuff goes missing after her 'visits' but has never confronted her.
Fast forward to last week. I come in and visit. My pal looks pissed. I ask what's up and he explains that he actually *caught* her stealing and called the police. Now, it's important to understand, we live in a small town, and just about everybody knows each other. Well, surprise, surprise, the policeman who showed up is her husband. The husband/corrupt policeman not only fails to arrest or take into custody the stealing woman,  but condescendingly tells my friend that if he ""wastes the departments time again,"" he'll call the owner of the store and get my buddy fired. The thief leaves the store without so much as a warning. So, my buddy is, understandably pretty mad. I'm trying to calm him down, making jokes and stuff. He seems better, but still kinda pissed.
Fast forward again to yesterday. I go in to visit. There are a couple people in the store, and my buddy points out the infamous thief, as she's browsing (probably stealing). I notice that there's an unattended purse sitting on one of the chairs by the door, and ask about it. My friend says it belongs to the thief. And that's when inspiration struck.
I tell my friend to keep the woman busy in any way he can, and he goes over and starts talking to her. Meanwhile, I walk over and open up her purse.
In addition to six or seven toys I recognize from the stores shelves, there is an iPad mini, an iPhone, a wallet and a bunch of other stuff.
Well, I'm no thief myself, so I'm not going to steal from her, but what I do instead is (a) remove all of the stolen toys from her bag and put them behind the counter, (b) factory reset her iDevices, so say goodbye to all your photos and data, and (c) take her drivers license. Okay I said I'm not a thief, but I couldn't help myself. I took the license, not knowing what I was going to do with it.
She eventually gets frustrated with my friend and walks back to the front of the store JUST as I'm walking away from her bag. She gives me a weird look, and looks in her bag. But guess what! Nothing is obviously missing! She takes the bag and leaves the store.
Then I show/tell my buddy what I did. He loves it. But what do we do with the drivers license, I ask.
With a big old grin on his face, he takes me to the office in the back of the store and points me to the shredder.
And it was done. So now she has none of her photos or contacts or any of that shit, none of the toys she stole, and WILL be arrested if she gets pulled over.
And that's how my friend bought me a whole case of Fat Tire.",Shoplifter thinks she's so smooth...,762,pettyrevenge

[deleted],84,,132,154htf,,598,"For years, my step brother made my life hell. Called me names, humiliated me, hit me, abused me, just generally made my life not worth living. I never told anyone and he ended up moving away.

I haven't seen him in a couple years, so imagine my surprise when I finally see him at my dad's house when I went to pick up my daughter. It was Thanksgiving, so the entire family was there, including his wife, who is one of those wrongly arrogant and all-knowing-but-really-knowing-nothing type of people. I notice that my step brother has gotten fat. Not chubby. F.A.T. Which is something he used to make fun of me for, even though I was 100 lbs soaking wet and it led to a bad eating disorder back in the day. (I'm not exaggerating when I say he made my life HELL.) He's one of those types who really can't take his physical flaws being pointed out, by the way.

So I engage in small talk. I wait until everyone is sitting at the supper table and eating quietly, look at him and say, ""Well your wife must cook well, because, my God, you've gotten FAT."" 

I finally got to sit back and smile as, for the first time in my life, I was alpha dog over him. He looked me right in the eye and knew that I was alpha. I sat there and challenged him with my eyes to retaliate and he backed down. It was glorious. 

Everyone busted out laughing except him and his wife, who oh-so-intelligently responds, ""Well, he's lost weight, actually! He's doing really well!"" Which made it even better. 

I know it sounds petty and awful and it makes me sound like a buttwipe douchebag, but for the first time I felt powerful and victorious over him, and he knows it. I smile every time I think about it. 

EDIT: It wasn't about calling him fat. Everyone in my family is a bit overweight except for my daughter and I. It was about sending the message that he had no control over me anymore and that I was in control and unafraid of him now. 

Also, my family is a huge wad of jolly old rednecks who don't take anything seriously. They thought it was hilarious and just some sibling play fighting. Only he knew otherwise. He's made more jabs at me where everyone laughed more times than I can count. It was all about the message, not the weight thing.

So today I was in a really good mood. I went christmas shopping and was really happy to found perfect gifts for my love ones.

I really enjoy christmas time, but as we all know, going shopping around this time is not always the best idea, because you will probably walk about 2 miles just to get from your car to the mall. Today, the parking is PACKED.

Anyways, I am in a store and I realize that I forgot a certain card for a store, and since I was buying a lot and needed the discount, I thought, why not take a walk to my car to get the card and put the stuff I already bought in it, since I am not parked that far!

As I walked out the store and take a few steps, I see a SUV  slowly following me. As nice as I am I think : He wants my parking spot! I should tell him I am just putting stuff away and I am not leaving!

I get to the car, he rolled down his window and it goes like this.

Me (just to make sure): Are you following me to take my spot sir?

Him: Is there a fucking problem with that? Hurry up.

OH HELL NO.

I just keep walking, as slow as I could. When I got to my car, I put all my stuff in my trunk, and actually get in the car (my card is there anyways). I stay there for a goor 5 minutes before getting out, walking toward the mall and waving at him with a big smile.

ahoythrowaway,217,,183,1ap155,,601,"I posted this in another thread a few months back, but a PM I had said to post this here. I agree, but my need for anonymity is still there:

My ex was an avid gamer. My ex was also a douchebag, who ended up lying and cheating on me. He started seeing one of our coworkers behind my back, using the guise of going to the bar with our friends as an excuse (I wasn't old enough to drink, as I was only 20.) His bar of choice was right next to the diner I'd hang out at. Before I caught him cheating, I was always scared of him walking home drunk. He had already been hit by a car doing so before I met him, and wound up in a coma. The police in our town were also pretty strict, and would bust you on public intoxication. So I'd frequently ask him if he needed a ride home. He refused, and said one night he was going out with the guys. I decided, that since he was going out, I would, too. My friends and I went to our favorite diner to hang out, eat, and sit around for a few hours, chatting (the waitresses loved us. They were never super busy at night, we ordered a lot of food over the course of the evening and not just coffee/soda, and we tipped well.)

We got our normal booth, which had a view of the bar if your back was facing the door. I wasn't the one initially in the seat, my best friend was. We were chatting, eating, when he went PALE. ""ahoythrowaway, you need to see this."" When I looked, my boyfriend was kissing our mutual good friend. And it wasn't an innocent peck, they might as well have been eating each other's faces.

I was hurt, more by her than by him. I then decided to get my revenge on both of them.

I got her kicked out of the National Guard because she was smoking weed and taking her mom's percocet. I contacted the Military Police anonymously, and she was drug tested.

First, I took the top of the line graphics card I had just bought him out of his computer. The thing cost me around $1,000 and had been installed 2 days before. I got a refund. I packed up his shit, took it to his parents (he didn't own much. Just a few boxes that easily fit in my car and his computer.) His parents weren't home, so I left it on their porch (I wasn't a total bitch. The porch was enclosed and I could lock it with the key I had.) He was also on his final warning before this at work, because he and another coworker never did their work, leaving it for first shift (my shift with my mother, who managed the store, which meant we had 3x the amount of work they did, as we were a gas station/coffee &amp; baked goods shop. The day shift was the busiest.) Before he left, he was supposed to bake muffins and cookies for the next day. He didn't, because ""he didn't feel like it."" Which meant I had to go into work 2 hours earlier (at 3 am) when I had already worked 55 hours that week. I reported it to our boss, and he was fired. 

He came in for work when he came back, he didn't even stop at the house. So, his sister drove the 3 hours to come back to work just to be fired, went over to the house to find the locks changed, no one home, and a note on the door telling him that his shit was at his folks, the graphics card was gone, and that he had to find a way home because he didn't drive and I wasn't driving him. I also turned off his cellphone, as it was in my name. It was shut off within minutes of him even stepping out of the car.
She ended up losing her mind and moving to a different state because she felt her life in ours was destroyed. She never knew I reported her. He ended up unemployable (not just because he was fired from that job, but a few others,) living with his mother and stepfather, living in a ghetto. He never even replaced his graphics card because he never had the money to.

**TL; DR: my ex was cheating with a coworker. Got her thrown out of the army for drug abuse, got him fired, threw him out, and left him stranded an hour away from his parents with no cell phone**

Needless to say I was pissed. I waited until she had some guy over she was trying to impress. My sister and I were told to stay in our rooms and not make any noise because she didn't want him to know she had kids. So I sauntered in, grabbed a handful of dry cat food out of the dish and proceeded to flip them in the air and catch them in my mouth.

My ex-SO and I went to a dinner party with her coworkers. One of the couples there were Indian. Both of them were 2nd or 3rd generation (read: speak perfect English), but both spoke Punjabi as well. Throughout the night, they would take little asides from the group conversation, in Punjabi. They wouldn't lower their voice or do it discreetly, they'd just say a couple sentences, sometimes one would smile or chuckle, and then they'd carry on. 

For any bilingual people out there that do this, please realize that it's rather disconcerting for everyone else around. Imagine how you'd feel if someone stopped talking to you, whispered something to the person next to them, and then started talking to you again.  

After the second or third time they did it, the host, who is very... engineer-y, looked the guy straight in the face and said in a serious voice, ""Sorry? I didn't catch that."" 

The dude didn't take the hint, and responded, ""oh nothing."" I guess that's when the host decided to take petty revenge. The next time they finished with a little private conversation, the host pulls out his phone, types something, and about 10 seconds later everyone at the table except the couple gets a text message that says, ""How many text messages do you think before they realize how annoying that is?"" 

Before everyone was even done submitting their guesses, text message alerts going off all over the place, the guy half of the couple had said something to the effect of, ""what's with all the texting?"" 

The host responds, ""Oh sorry. I was just jealous of your private convos, so I thought I'd start my own."" 

Was it childish and passive aggressive? Definitely. Would it have been better if he'd been more direct? Yes. Was it satisfying? You better believe it. ","Oh, you are going to exclude everyone else from your communication, right in front of us? OK. Prepare for some petty equality.",695,pettyrevenge

So when non-employees began parking there too frequently, we clearly marked all the parking spaces with ""*NAME OF BUSINESS* PARKING ONLY"" and ""Towing at owner's expense"" signs.

Today, my department was having a meeting, when we noticed a woman who doesn't work here getting a yoga mat out of her car...which is parked in one of our employee's spots. Across from our building is another which houses, among other things, a yoga studio. My boss began beating on the window (which doesn't open) and yelling at her that it's employee parking only (they definitely aren't sound-proof).

Then, she *turns and looks right at my boss*, stares for a second, and begins walking toward the yoga building. My boss continues to beat on the window to get her attention, but she continues on. She turns and *gives him one final look* before entering the building with the studio.

So we call down to our HR person, tell her the situation, and that this woman needs her Mercedes station wagon towed the hell out. Fifteen minutes later, the guy is here, and her car is gone.

I just hope her class ends before the end of the work day so I can see her get back to an empty spot.

tl;dr - Woman parks where she's not supposed to and doesn't heed our warning...twice, so we tow her ass and (hopefully) make her lose her yoga zen.

**UPDATE 1:** Since this happened in the last hour of work, and we looked online and found out the class was 90 minutes, we knew we'd be gone before she got out. HOWEVER, we set up a hidden camera. I had an appointment after work, and saw the response, so I came back to transfer the footage. Since it's almost 2 hours worth, it was going to take forever to transfer, so I played it back through the camera, and caught a glimpse of our parker. I snapped a picture on the viewfinder, but need to block out some identifying info in the background before I post. Will be back soon with some viewing pleasure!

**UPDATE 2:** Okay, so I wouldn't have angled it this way myself, but [here she is](http://i.imgur.com/Nd5AgKz.jpg) walking by. All I could see of her when scrubbing through the video at 25x speed. I know some of you will be disappointed that I blurred a good deal of an already grainy video, and desaturated, but I want to make sure I can make the area a little less identifiable. The footage will be fully transferred tomorrow, and if time allows, and enough can be done to keep identities safe, I'll do my damnedest to get you all a video! I should also note, the camera is facing kind of away from the angle I took the photo from earlier. Would have been a much better shot, but space didn't allow. I think if I'd set it up I would have tried to get it over a little more.

**UPDATE 3:** So we've gotten a chance to get a better look at the video, and sadly, it's a bit of a letdown. The part where I took the picture, she just kind of walks by, glances up for a second, then begins digging around for her keys. Then she walks off frame, and we never see her again. The camera was pointing toward the direction of the door of the yoga studio building, but we never see her go back there.

---
So, growing up, I lived in a house in a quiet, small town in california. Our house was a corner house, and because of that was one of the biggest lots in the neighborhood, and right on the edge of a seasonal river. Having so much space, I had dogs as a kid - normal, exciteable animals; Our dogs barked at strangers. Not excessive barking, but the usual ""Hey! Who are you? Why are you outside MY yard?"" 

Most of the neighbors had dogs, many of which were small, yappy and obnoxious. Whatever. We made our share of noise - BBQs on the weekends, loud music from time to time. Neighbors made noise, we made noise, nobody complained. 

My first dog grew old and died, and I got another dog(actually, two. I found a pair of twin puppies abandoned in an alley walking to school one day. Carried them around in my backpack all day. I kept one, gave one to my girlfriend's dad; Cute little queensland/terrier mutts.) Anyways, the new dog had the same political views as the first one, and was pretty good at restricting barking to when strangers hung around. We had a good fence, and the dogs couldn't get out. Cool beans.

So, I'm a teenager, and the new dog is four years old. We're both pretty set in our routines. Neighbors across the street have medical problems, and move out to be closer to family. They rent their house out to first a series of teenagers and short timers, and eventually a middle aged couple. New neighbors are, at first, standard strange new people. We talked with them a few times, the wife described herself as an artist - she created gaudy yard sculptures, and made attempts at landscape design - she was way off base, planting things like poison oak and nettles because 'they were naturally growing in the river, and added a california ambience to her yard'. Cool. The plants ran rampant, took over her yard and overgrew the sidewalks around her house, which many, many families used for afternoon walks. Good times.

After a while, maybe two months or so, she started complaining about our dog barking. First she would just walk across the street and admonish us for having pets that interrupted her creative moods. This escalated to phone calls, and complaints to the police. Mind you, our dog barked about twice a day most days, though he really got excited when the trash truck came by - he loved to run back and forth across the yard yelling at it(one day he actually caught it - escaped out an open gate, tore ass down the street to catch it, and plowed right into the back when it stopped.)

We never did get a ticket, the cops got to the point where they stopped responding to her. She was furious about this, and came over to our house several times to scream at my parents about the dogs. My mom was fed up with her, and decided it was time to take this further. Neighbor asked 'If I buy one of those electric collars, do you think it would work?' My mom responds 'I don't know, would you wear it?' 

Her screaming fits were met with first ironic responses, then loud music with the stadium speakers pointed at her house, etc. 

Then she bought the statue.

She must have found it at an estate sale, this HUGE Jockey statue that she thought was the bee's knees. She bought it, spent a week very carefully painting it white, and proudly displayed it in her front yard.

Around this time, the fights over our quasi-noisy dog had reached aclimax, and one day I came home to find my dog very sick. He died at the vet's office, and the vet informed us the dog had ingested a very large quantity of rat poison(which we don't have or use). Of course we suspected the neighbor(She smirked at us from her yard when we got home), but couldn't prove anything, and the police couldn't do anything; No evidence, no witness, nothin.

So, late one night after a month of no complaints, I snuck over to the neighbor's house(at my mom's urging) and a couple friends and I confiscated her 400 lb concrete statue. Snuck it back to our house, stripped of the recent coats of paint, and lo and behold, the jockey was restored to its original racist black! Snuck back across the street and left the statue on the sidewalk, several house away from the neighbor. 

Come the next morning, the good neighbors all notice there's this horribly racist statue, with a hobo stick propped in its arms, a run-away note taped to its chest, escaping from its owner. Neighbor's husband isn't strong enough to move it back home, so gets on his bike and takes off before his wife wakes up. 'Somebody' called the police, complained about a racist art display, and they come to talk to the neighbor. Surprise surprise, they look in her back yard as they talk things over, and notice an owl propped on a tree to scare away crows that looks a bit off. They inspect, talk to her some more, and leave with her in custody.

Turns out she had shot and killed an endangered owl, hung it with chicken wire on a tree, and now had a federal charge against her. All because my dog barked a couple times a day.",Not all neighbors are Mr. Rogers,721,pettyrevenge
relytv2,30,,91,1gfvqz,,600,"I work at a pizza place and there is this old lady ""The Slice Lady"" she sneaks behind the counter when you're not looking to pick out her slice of pizza. Its fine if you want a specific slice and ask for it, but she comes behind the counter without asking, a big no no and demands the best looking slice after proding them all, again a big no no. She is rude about it, no pleases or thank yous. We usually put the slices in a box or on a plate, but she demands them sandwiched between two plates and wrapped up in a bag which is annoying and time consuming. 



So one day I saw her coming in and hid all the newer slices and left just the biggest nicest one on the tray with a few shitty old ones I had to throw out or give away anyway. She won't come behind the counter if we are there but if we're somewhere out of direct sight of the counter she will sneak back there incredibly fast. I was waiting for her today so she couldn't sneak behind the counter. She ordered a slice I grabbed one at random like I always do as is protocol and she screams like a banshee ""let me look at them!"" So I turn around and let her see them she looks for about a solid minute (I have much better things to do) she points to the good one and I say ""ok no problem"" 




I am going to the oven to heat up her slice and put my thumb on the smallest shittiest one on the opposite side of the tray from the one she wants. I grab a shit old one next to the fresh one she wants, slowly and deliberately so she can see what I'm doing. When she sees this again she screams so loud ""that's the wrong one"" I act startled and whip around to face her causing the good slice and 3 old ones to fall on the ground, leaving only the worst one that was under my thumb on the tray. So I look at her with the biggest shit eating grin on my face say, "" you scared the crap out of me yelling like that"" then I look at the the slices on the ground and the small shit old one on the tray and say ""I'm sorry we only have this one left"" she is visibly upset and grumbled something about paying for a different slice, I say "" sorry but you shouldn't have startled me like that and I wouldn't have dropped them"" she gives me the dirtiest look and grudgingly takes that crap piece.

She looked me over and I could see what was going through her mind ""just an intern as if he knows or has the authority to help"" so she predictably said no dismissively and went to sit at my supervisor's cubicle to wait for him.

Thinking nothing of it I went back to my desk. Someone passed by and said good morning to her. Thing is the passerby called her ""Lisa"" and then I remembered that I had processed an office laptop to be issued to a Lisa due to be picked up today, the paperwork was done and dusted and just required her signature and she could take it and leave as long as any member of IT, me included, signed for it.

yotsubakoiwai,103,,85,1igc91,,595,"I'm going to share this experience in my boyfriend's perspective which he had while working as a waiter. Not sure whether it counts as a revenge but I guess it's worth the share.

I used to work in this small cafe as a part-time job when I was a teenager. So one day, this middle-aged lady came in with her kid, about 5 or 6-ish years old. I knew she would be a demanding customer by the looks when she stepped into the cafe (had a fair-share of experience of it). Since it was lunch hour at that point in time, it was already quite busy and the cafe was under-staffed, I tried to get all the orders as quickly as possible. The lady, who I assumed was a strict vegetarian, kept asking whether are there any vegetarian dishes available and constantly clarifying whether each dish that she pointed out on the menu had meat in it, even corn soup. She finally settled for this assorted veggie sub that she ordered for the kid.

6 minutes in, Mrs Vegetarian was getting super impatient at having to wait for the food to arrive, constantly asking about how long is it taking every time I passed her table. Next to her table, there was this little window where the kitchen staff places the finished orders, ready for the wait-staff to take them to the customers' table. Her order is finally done and I took it to her.

To my surprise, her kid was already happily eating a sub! I asked her how did she get her order (as I was the only one manning the tables at that time), she said that she saw a wrapped sub placed in the window, assumed it was hers and took it behind my back. I immediately told her that it was another customer's order. I think she didn't realise that her kid was happily chomping down a chicken sub as she ""screamed"", slapped off the sub from the kid's hands, made him spit whatever he was chewing and started to pick out the bits of chicken on his tongue.

I went to the kitchen, told the rest about it and laughed. As for her, my manager decided that due to the circumstances, she does not qualify for a replacement sub, had to pay for the chicken sub and took a bit of reasoning before she paid up and left the cafe angrily.",Please don't self-serve.,680,pettyrevenge
CitySecrets,63,,147,1hwbj2,,589,"First time poster. This is a long one, so sorry for the absolute wall of text! If you really don't feel like reading a lot, please skip to the TL;DR. I Hope you enjoy my first crack at this! 


Just a little relevant information;

When I was in elementary school I was a decent student. I wasn't the ""star pupil"" or anything close to it. I was always in the B+ to A range. Our school had a rewards program (very similar to Mrs. Puff's ""Good Noodle"" star program) where if you got good grades, you got stars and little candies at the end of the month. So, everyone in the class knew if you were doing well or not. There was also permanent seating plans that were set for the whole year, so you never changed seats.

Into the story now;

I was seated next to a loud mouth boy, hereby dubbed SH (Short for Shit Head). SH was one of those kids that would take your pencil crayons without asking, steal your snacks from your backpack, blatantly ridicule you and just make your life an all around hell. However as soon as he was confronted by a teacher he was the perfect angel, therefore he was never caught doing anything wrong. He also didn't give two shits about school, so he never even bothered to look at his marks, this ends up being in my favor.


About a month into the school year, I started noticing that my work was going missing. Now, I was a forgetful kid so I just assumed that I had put it down somewhere and forgotten it. This went on for about two weeks before I started to get kind of suspicious.


Then one day I was called to the principal's office and I was scolded for copying SH's work! I was outraged, I broke into a crying fit and screamed about them being wrong. I got my first ever detention and a stern warning.


When I went back to my class and sat down, SH was watching me with the smuggest face I have ever seen. That's when I pieced together where my work had been going. SH would wait until I went out for recess or he would ask to go to the bathroom, then when no one was looking he would steal my work from my homework folder.


Being a shy kid, I didn't want to tell a teacher. Instead, I sat down at my desk that night and devised my master plan. Sure, it would mean extra work but who cares if I got my revenge! I decided that every time I did my homework, I would make two copies. One of the copies would have my actual work, and the other would be complete bullshit. I would put the fake copy in my homework folder and simply move my real work to a different binder.


SH continued to take my homework from my knapsack, and I continued to cackle to myself when he was out of earshot. Every time he got it back, he threw it in his desk without even looking. He assumed he did well because he was stealing a smart kid's work.


Skip forward to the end of the year when he received an envelope that had his parents name on it. This usually means that the principle wants to get a message to the parents directly. It also read ""OPEN ONLY WITH YOUR PARENTS"" in big red letters on the back. He, of course, dismissed this warning and tore into the envelope. As he read the letter, his face fell a little and began to tremble a bit. I overheard him whisper to his friend that he failed the grade and had to stay back a year!


The feelings that filled me were glorious. I felt terrible of course, because I caused someone else pain but man did I feel good! The thing is, he couldn't tell anyone why he had failed! The kicker is, he confronted me after the last bell. Our confrontation was short and sweet;


&gt;SH: HEY! CitySecrets what the fuck happened?!

&gt;Me: I don't know what you mean? (I knew exactly what he meant)

&gt;SH: YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN (he shook the envelope grasped in his sweaty hand)

&gt;Me: Oh, you failed the grade and now you have to stay back, that's what happened.

&gt;SH: YEAH I KNOW, HOW COME YOU DIDN'T FAIL TOO?

&gt;Me: Because i'm smarter than you.

&gt;SH: Fuck you! I'm gonna-

&gt;Me: (I cut him off) Gonna what? Gonna tell the teacher that you were stealing my work?

&gt;SH: Fuck off! (A man of many words)

&gt;Me: Have fun repeating this year.


Before he could say anything, I left. Yes, I felt bad, but I also felt good because I stood up for myself to the biggest bully I have ever faced. I graduated before him and ever since I haven't seen him.


Mind you, this also happened quite a long time ago so the confrontation is obviously a very vague explanation of what I may have actually said.


Thanks for reading! I'm glad I could put this somewhere, because to this day I have kept this secret.

TL;DR: Snot nosed kid would steal my work and copy it, never got caught. So I started making two copies of my work so he would always take the wrong copy. He failed the grade and had to stay back a year.

EDIT: Broke it up more for easier ~~reasoning.~~ reading.

EDIT 2: Please feel free to reformat, or edit my grammar. I'm new at this, and typing a lot tends to make me lose track of my grammar skills :(

EDIT 3: I have gotten a few skeptical messages and comments about how this wouldn't have caused someone to fail a grade, and how there would have been more warnings and stuff. Thats totally okay that you are skeptical! Like I said in the comments, I wouldn't know if there had been conferences with parents, or if there was any other follow up.

Rubychan11,84,,135,1mh249,,590,"[rant]

So I just recently ceased working for a overpriced children's ""boutique"", and I'm ever so glad. I had been job searching previously but was biding in my time to quit until I had another job in the wings. Why was I trying to quit, you may ask? Well, it would seem that I have the worst luck with jobs. Or maybe I just hadn't learned my lesson. This was the fifth family-run store I'd worked for and so far they had all been clusterfucks of owners thinking they can break the rules and get away with it. Why oh why did I think this one would be any different?!

So the business hours were 10-6, but they asked us to get there 15 minutes early to get the store ready (vacuuming, watering plants, straightening everything out, reasonable stuff) and no one really left until 6:15 because of end-of-day cleaning and straightening and such. We also had to wait for the manager or the owners to come ""close us out"" and they were NEVER there at 6.

Now, aside from the pretentious customers we got, and just the fact that I really didn't fit in since I'm not a prissy, girly girl (I prefer to wear jeans and sneakers over leggings and uggs any day) they were truly breaking the law. They didn't give us lunches on 8 or even 6 hour shifts if they deemed it was ""too busy"", we didn't get a mandatory 10 or 15 minute break every 4 hours, and to top it off... we didn't get time and a half for overtime.

I even asked the manager AND the owner why. Their response? ""We just don't."" They proceeded to tell me that there was paperwork I was supposed to sign. Oh, I hadn't signed it? Well they would bring it in tomorrow. I knew for a fact it wouldn't even matter, because in the great state of California, an employee is still entitled to overtime and lunches and no signature on a document can change that.

They never did, and I was fine with that, because I was planning on suing their asses as soon as I quit. Well, right after I brought this up, they conveniently didn't need me to come in 15 minutes early anymore. Oh, and I should leave right on the hour. Even if there's still customers in the store. They claimed they ""just don't need that many people to close"" (if I left there were two people) but I knew their game. Unfortunately for them, I already had the proof I needed. I made them print out a record of my hours and took that and my paystubs to the labor board. They are now going to be cited for not adequately compensating their employees for overtime AND for not providing lunches if they didn't feel like it.

thebornotaku,82,,123,17wekr,,595,"I went to a local car AV shop to purchase a new subwoofer box and after a couple of minutes inside the shop, the owner and an employee from the business next door (a window tinting shop) came in and started accusing me of stealing one of their tools. I had brought a mini-drill from home so I could install my subwoofer in to my new box when I bought it and it just so happened to be the same model of drill they used.

After trying to reason with the employee and telling them that I could show them proof of purchase (from Amazon), the employee threatened me (""It's a small town, I have your plate number, You're lucky I'm at work right now"", etc). They called the police and stayed very near my car. I called the police as well because the owner and his employee had made me feel threatened. I got the manager of the business that I was in to print out my order form from Amazon. When the police arrived, they took the owner's story then came inside to talk to me. I showed him proof of purchase, as well as my ID and the card I used to order it. The officer took that and showed it to the owner of the other business and when the officer came back in he claimed that the owner would apologize.

When I went outside, the owner ""apologized"" in probably the most begrudging and accusatory way. He again accused me of stealing from him (claiming that ""he knew"" i stole it from him) and that it was ""some sneaky s*** you pulled, having your friend list it on Amazon so you could buy it"". Continuing to feel like I was in a hostile atmosphere, I got in my car and drove off.

Well, that's where the story *used* to end. It gets better.

You see, that chunk of text, along with the actual business names, which have been redacted, and a small summary, are what I posted to Yelp. And Google Reviews. And Yahoo.

Fast forward a few months from that point, and I see the employee who was being the most threatening at my work. He's hard to miss. He's a big, bulky dude with a huge beard. He came through my line at the grocery store and I bagged his order. He looked me dead in the eyes and we obviously recognized each other.

A few days later, I get a call, at work. This is pretty rare and usually it's my parents if anybody, and it's only if there's a family emergency.

So imagine my surprise when I answer the phone and it's the business owner from the window tinting place. He wants to talk things over and rectify the situation. I get his number and after a few days, call him.

Apparently, my reviews did some damage. The business is pretty prominent, in a big purple building on the main street in town. Everybody drives by it, so chances are if you're thinking of getting your windows tinted, you're gonna think of that place.

Well, he tells me that my 1-star review on Yelp knocked them down from 4 stars to 3. He tells me he's lost some of his old customers, and he hasn't been getting new customers as often. He even told me that I cost him an estimated $20k in profit over the four months the review was up. I checked the Yelp review every now and then, and at last count, well over 100 people found it ""useful"", who knows how many other people had seen it and decided against going to his shop.

So anyway, I took the opportunity to lay in to him a little bit. I told him that if he treats people like he treated me, he deserves to lose business. I tell him it's a shitty way to be and basically just tear him a new one. Even after my verbal beatdown, he's still really apologetic (though I knew he really just wanted that review down), but after hearing that he lost around $20k in profit over what is a $200 tool, I got the warm fuzzies inside and decided I'd done enough damage, and took the reviews down.

tl;dr:
**douchebag business owner accuses me of stealing his tool, even when provided with evidence to the contrary. I post a factual account of our interaction to multiple review sites, he loses a bunch of business. I cost him around $20k in profit over his accusations of me stealing a $200 tool.**


edit\\

To everyone saying I should have left the review up:

I felt like I made my point. I put a measurable dent in his business and I taught him a lesson. Even if his apology may not have been authentic, perhaps he would consider his actions a little more carefully before accusing somebody else like he did to me. Or, perhaps not, and then they go and do the same thing that I did, but decide to leave it up. Either way, I felt like I got my payback and I'm all for letting bygones be bygones. If he continues to be a dick, it'll come back to him, so I'm not really that worried about it. Myself and everybody I know have all pretty much agreed that he's a dick and would all rather take our business elsewhere because of it.

I don't feel like I'm censoring myself. I feel like I let him squirm long enough and now I'm letting up. Maybe I'm a more forgiving person than some of you in this instance but that's my choice. He took the time to talk to me calmly and politely, like an adult, and we worked it out together. I still think he's a douchebag and I won't associate with him, but like I said, I let him squirm and got my point across, and that's all I was trying to do.",You obviously don't understand how Amazon.com works.

Synthetika,74,,84,14sbix,,593,"This happened to me about a year ago when I still thought roommates were good ideas. I was in need of a roommate after my boyfriend and I split so my friend decided to take on the spare room. Since the gas bill was the ex boyfriends I asked if she would transfer her already existing account to the house to which she agreed. So we decided that I would pay the electric and she the gas. Any difference between the bills would be split.


Well one month in and we receive the gas bill claiming there is a $300 balance so I ask her why she has such a high balance and she says its just the deposit and that she would have them waive it after she set up direct deposit and they would send us our ""normal"" bill next month.


Another month goes by and they come by and shut off our gas and stick a non-payment flyer on the door. Understand that this is the start of winter the temperatures are getting colder day by day at this point it was between 15-20 degrees (Fahrenheit) each night. Thankfully it wasn’t mid winter and we hadn’t gotten into the negatives yet. Still was cold and I worried about the pipes freezing.


I give her a call and let her know what happened. She puts on the whole fake sorry act and says she will call them right away and fix it. I once again believe that she’s going to take initiative but of course she doesn’t. 


I know that she is not doing anything about it and that she is just going out partying everyday. I had known from the beginning that she was not very responsible but didn’t think she would let it go on that long. I tried calling the gas company myself but they would not do anything since it was under her name and I did not know her SSN. I had resorted to taking showers at my friends’ houses, making microwave meals for dinner and having to buy an electric heater and be secluded to my room for any kind of warmth.


This goes on for three weeks that I am asking her constantly if she has gotten it fixed and all she continues to do is give me ridiculous excuses. Always blaming the problem on the gas company or the bank.


I decided enough was enough. One night while she was staying out at a friends house I went into her room. Just for a minute I stared at her electric heater thinking of how badly I just wanted to start kicking it but then decided that might be a bit much and she would know I did it. I grab some tools and start to take the thing apart. I clipped one of the wires inside and then put the whole thing back together set it back in the same spot and casually left the room snuggling into my bed with a smirk.


The next morning I hear her walk into her room and just seconds later a loud whine comes from her about how her heater won’t turn on. It’s easy for me to hear since her room was right next to mine. I get up and walk to her room and with a look of concern say “What’s going on? You ok?” she just replies with the same whine about how her heaters broken and her room is freezing. I shrug and say “Oh sorry that sucks I’m going to get ready for work.” And not but five minutes later I hear her on the phone with the gas company working on getting the gas turned back on. They make it out a week later and get everything turned back on. Yes the satisfaction really was that she had to freeze for a week. While I still had my heater in perfect working order.

I worked, up until not too long ago when I got fed up with it, as a shift manager for a bowling alley. Great customers mostly, still friends with a lot of them. Nice co-workers. Crappy boss. Cheap corporation.

One Saturday afternoon I was running the shift. We had several birthday parties scheduled. As soon as she walked in I recognized one of the birthday girls. Nice enough kid. Then I started to recognize her party's guests. I realized somewhere along the line that I was recognizing each and every guest of hers. I knew some of them quite well from coaching baseball and helping at their elementary school.

Finally I figured out what was going on. She'd invited all of her fifth grade classmates. Save one, that is. The one she didn't invite was my son. For some reason--and to this day we haven't figured out why--her mother hates my wife. She didn't allow her daughter to invite my son. When I figured this out I was really, really perturbed.

As manager, I need to check on parties' hosts to make sure they're happy. Naturally I did. In my best customer service voice I said to dad that we were glad they were there and since little Hermione (not her real name) was in my son Ron's (not his real name) class, if they ever wanted to come in again they should call me first and I'd give them a discount.

Cthonic,98,,147,1m45ch,,579,"I used to study Tae Kwon Do at a school not far from me.  It wasn't exactly a McDojo, but the regular classes were super relaxed and ""feel-good"".  There was no full-contact without pads at the noob classes, only at the advanced classes.  And even then, we all knew each other and would avoid cheap shots.  For this reason, perhaps stupidly, I never bothered with a cup.  

Now, one day I'm helping instruct at one of the noob classes.  There was an odd number of people, so they put the least senior of the assistant instructors into the rotation to even things out.  There was one kid at the class, who we all knew had a severe attitude problem.  He would always ""forget"" some of his pads and wail on people below his level, hurting some of them sometimes.  So, it comes my turn to spar with him.  Usually, he would go pathetically easy if he was sparring a better student.  However, that day he had a problem with me.  I'd corrected him during a grappling exercise we'd done earlier because he was a) doing it incorrectly and b) being a dick to his partner.  Regardless, almost as soon as we start, he winds his foot back and I think, ""He can't be that stupid to try and hit an instructor in the balls right?""  I was wrong.  Full on dick shot.  I'd have complimented his form if I hadn't been enraged beyond words.  

Regardless, I guess the kid hadn't been in many real fights or been hit in the crotch many times.  While it hurts like hell, you usually get about 5 or so seconds before you feel anything.  I'd used 2 of those deciding to teach the fucker a lesson.  He dropped his guard after kicking me in the nuts, I guess figuring that he'd already won.  The smug look on his face changed rapidly when my heel connected with his solar plexus.  I hit him with a cross-up side kick that sent him sprawling, and much to my pleasure slammed his head into the wall.  I had about one second left at this point and got out a ""Ha, dumbass!""  For a moment, the head instructor was going to tear my head off for treating a noob class spar like a real fight.  Then when I doubled over, I guess he put two and two together.  The class had, at this point, stopped to watch the scene.  The little shit had to pick himself up off the ground.  Once they determined that his head was fine, he was ejected from the class and had to go change and take the walk of shame out.  At this point, I found out that he was 15 and therefore did not have a driver's license.  He had to sit out on the curb for his mom to pick him up while the class resumed as normal.

After class, the instructor asked if I was ok.  After determining whether or not I'd be able to have kids, he went ""I don't blame you, but try not to do it again.""  The little shit stayed at the school, but he definitely showed a bit more respect after that to both his instructors and his fellow students.

rbfjunkie,49,,119,1gvty4,,588,"I work at a gas station.  It's an unwritten rule that we give police officers free coffee.  There's not a sign up or anything stating this; it's just something we do.

Well, a few days ago, a group of police officers came walking in.  Whenever a cop comes in, I usually say something like, ""OOHH, giiiirl!  Someone is gettin' arrested today!""  And they laugh and it's a good way to start my day.  So, they each grabbed a huge cup, filled it with coffee, cream, and whatnot, and strolled up to my register.  I recognized the first 3, as two of them coached my old baseball team and one used to teach at our high school.  Then, Captain Douchebag rolls up.  

This guy made my life hell...from kindergarten until the day we graduated.  He would lap me on the track and punch the back of my shoulder every. fucking. time...he called me a band fag, a fat-fuck, curly-headed fucktard, dick licker, butthole-sniffer, among other names.  He also spread a rumor around school that I got my cousin pregnant.  Yeah, he's a winner.  

So, the first three gentlemen get their free coffee and head outside.  Then, Cap'n Douchebag strolls up.
  
    ""Hey, rbfjunkie! I haven't seen you in ages!""  
    ""yeh..."" I reply. 
    ""How have you been?  Anything new?""  Said Officer Douchebag.
    Trying to be nice, while holding in as much pent-up rage as I could,
    ""Yeah, life's good.  Got a new job here a month or so ago.""  
    ""Oh wow, man, that's awesome!  Well, take care!"" El Douchebag-adora said.

Then, he starts heading for the door as he said his goodbyes.  I told him very loudly, trying to make sure the other PO's could hear through the door, 

    ""Stop right there! What do you think you're doing?""  
    ""What do you mean?!"" Sir Bag of Douche replied, perplexed.  
    ""You have to pay for that coffee...if you don't, I'll be forced to press charges for theft.""
    ""Pfft...I...we...whatever dude! We get free coffee here all the time! What's goin' on??""  
    ""No, employees are given the power to discount up to $5 per transaction at their discretion. 
    We don't HAVE to give you anything.""
    ""And you don't wanna give me free coffee, even though you know me??""

I just stood there, staring at him. The other PO's were outside laughing their asses off at him.  He grunted and said something under his breath, and pulled out his wallet and threw $2 at me and said, ""Keep the change, you fuckin' BAND FAG!""  

Little does he know, I have the power to ban people from the store.  So, I got a picture from the security footage and posted it on the front door with a heading that said ""This person is not allowed on company property for 30 days (July 16th)""  A few hours later, my supervisor came in and asked about it.  We had a good laugh, and she agreed that we'll keep it up for 1 month, or if he comes in and apologizes before then.

Even though it was over $1.67, it will made me feel like a million bucks.

PsychoSemantics,115,,102,173whn,,580,"This happened almost 7 years ago now.  My girlfriend and I had just moved in together and our one year anniversary was coming up.  We decided to visit the zoo and were very excited about it.  It should be noted that at the time we were both part of the goth scene, and that emo was really popular (it was 2006).  

There were lots of school groups at the zoo that day and these little fuckers from one particular school decided to follow us around calling ""emooooooo!"".  If it had just been that, we would have shrugged it off and ignored it but after they saw us holding hands they started yelling ""oh my god, lesbians, gross"" and making comments about how we were going to hell.  It got to the point where we felt like we were being stalked because they seemed to be wherever we went, and we ended up leaving much earlier than we'd planned, missing out on one of the exhibits we'd been excited to see.  

On the way out, I snuck a look at the uniform of one of their classmates to find out the school name.  Once we had that, we looked up the school's phone number, rang and complained.  Bitterly.  Made sure to emphasize that the kids were walking around without a teacher.  

A week later, three of these turned up in the mail: http://imgur.com/A4FKyD3 the awkward line breaks and the fact they were all identical clearly indicates they were copied down from the board.

My uncle is a tall (6'5"") dude, but he's pretty skinny.  He doesn't seem particularly threatening, but he has been training in Tae Kwon Do for around 10 years.  

One cold winter in Minnesota, he was working on one of his rental properties.  He was in the back yard fixing something on the house when he heard a noise in the front.  When he walked around front,  there were three guys (high school/college) unloading his tools from his truck.  When he confronted them, they went to fight him.  He took them all down and held on one on the ground.  The cold, snow covered ground.  He gave the three guys two options; a) He calls the police, or b) he takes their shoes.

One of the few stories that I will always remember takes place at this old mall (that only stayed open because it had one or two good shops and one good restaurant) that had a credit union in their parking lot. My dad decided to take both my brother and I out for a guys night out while my mom was away on a work trip, keep in mind that I was about 8 and my brother 9, so we decided to make the one hour long trip to go to this one restaurant because it has great Italian food. 

When we got there most of the parking was nearly taken up but because it was after hours of the credit union they allowed anyone to park in their multiple lane drive-thru, so excited about the open parking we parked behind a car that was already parked in the drive thru (nobody was in front of them and they couldn't get blocked in). 

After a fabulous time eating at our favorite Italian restaurant we came out to see that someone had parked behind our truck, which nearly blocked us off completely from being able to leave. But my dad trying to keep a cool head decided to go into the mall and have the person called over the intercom but this came with no success. After possibly a 50 point turn and hopping a curb we finally were free from our troubles. After keeping his cool through all of the fussing with getting the truck out he couldn't let this person leave without a little bit of revenge. So my dad tells my brother and I to sit in the car for a few seconds as we watch him get out of the truck walk calmly over to the car who parked behind us and smoothly removes both of his/her windshield wipers and tosses them under their car. He walked back to the car with a grin. 

As we were pulling out of the parking lot onto the main road we heard a quiet tap tap tap of rain hitting our car. It rained for the next 2 days straight. ",Don't mess with a man and his two kids on their night out.. ,661,pettyrevenge

Anyway a few moments later she's hustling herself in the line in front of me using her suitcase-with-wheels to block. I let it go because she was initially there first and she's pretty old and I take a step back. (she doesn't acknowledge the fact I've let her in front of me).

randomfunnyword,67,,90,167x98,,575,"The first job I had in high school was working at a gas station. The gas station was family owned and the gentleman that owned it treated me like family. He worked with me on scheduling while I attended community college and was a downright nice person. 

I worked my way up to the position of assistant manager by showing up for every shift, speaking English, and being overly responsible for 19. The other guy that worked my shift with me was Antonio, a flamboyantly gay Mexican. He spoke English well after you spent enough time around  him to pick up on his dialect of Spanglish.  

One day I receive a page from Antonio to come to the cash register. Standing at the register are two fake tab blonde girls in their early 20's. I walk to the register and ask what's up. I'm informed by Antonio that the girls wanted a water. I offer them a courtesy cup and point toward the soda fountain. One of the girls explains with a semi valley girl twang (obviously from CA) that they don't drink tap water and that they've already explained to Antonio that they want a bottled water. I say alright, go head and purchase one and I'll ring you up. Valley girl is getting irritated, ""We shouldn't have to pay for water.""

""Well, the fountain has a filter and is essentially the same stuff as the bottled water, you can have some of that for free or you can purchase a bottle."" I responded, ""I'm sorry, but we have to pay for the bottled water and so do you.""

The girls are visually upset, they huff and sigh and I finally walk toward the back of the store. I go back into the cooler to go about my business assuming its handled. A couple of minutes later Antonio calls me back to the front. He shows me two water bottles in a trash can. The girls had emptied water bottles in a fountain cup and told him they got water from the fountain. This absolutely set me off. I look out at a gas pump and see them getting ready to pump their gas. I wait for the girl to start pumping her gas before I stop the pump after less than .25 G of gas. This occurs 2-3 more times before the girl comes in to complain about the gas pump. I explain that maybe it's broken and she should try another pump. She moves her car to another pump and we replay the same scenario. She comes back into the store even more upset and shorter on patience this time. I explain that there must be an issue with her card and that she should call her bank. She then asked why the pump said ""Stopped by Attendant"". 

Shit. I'm busted. What do I do? 

I ask to see the card and say that I'll try running it inside. I promptly ring up the two stolen waters as a credit transaction, hand her card back and tell her that she can buy gas somewhere else. 

TL:DR bitchy girls think they're too good for tap water so they steal bottled water from a gas station I was working at. I keep turning their gas pump off when they're trying to get gas.

SamNextDoor,223,,185,1djelk,,573,"**Warning** Wall of text ahead

**Background**:
I work in a coffee shop inside a family owned grocery store. I usually work the evening/night shift because I also attend school in the morning, meaning I have to close a lot rather than work mid day shifts. I have a lot of cleaning and chores to do before I can leave at the end of the day when we close at 9, and when I say we close at 9, I mean I'm walking out the door and punched out at 9. I have worked there for about a year and a half and I've never really had a problem with customers and I generally like helping people, always giving great service to people who deserve it. But sometimes, once in a blue moon, I'll get someone coming in right before closing who really gets under my skin.

**Situation**:
I'm rushing to close on time because my inconsiderate coworker didn't do anything she was supposed to do. It's around 8:50 and I'm mopping the floor, relieved to finally be finished in a matter of minutes. I was just about to lock my door when out of the darkness on the other side, this ""woman"" (who will know henceforth as ""bitch"") reached for the door handle and yanked it open as if she was suffering from withdrawal from coffee. She practically knocked me over with her boobs, which could only be fake, and her mini-me of a daughter in tow. Both were dressed as if they were about to go clubbing. I was fuming at their lack of apologizes and behavior, never was treated so poorly (and I have been treated terribly, but thats another time). They stood at the counter, obviously wanting a drink. I put on my best customer service smile and forced myself to wait on them. Since it's a family owned business, quality service was mandatory and I'm expected to smile and bend over-backwards while juggling 3 whales on a unicycle atop Big Ben and swallow swords if the customer asked me to. 
I start out asking: ""What can I-"" when I was cut off. ""I need 2 large mocha shakes, now."" I was less than pleased. I had everything cleaned and she orders the most complicated drinks requiring I dirty almost everything. Fortunately, we're about to close and I couldn't do it, right? ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything is in the dishwasher and soapy,"" I have a huge sincere smile on my face that I get to tell this bitch she's not getting her damn shakes. ""We close at 9 and it's 8:55."" She completely loses her mind yelling, ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Are you saying that I can't get 2 drinks?! You close at 9, it's not 9."" My smile faulters as I see my manager charging over. ""Can I help you, mam'am?"" My manger asks her. Bitch whines ""Yeah, SHE,"" Pointing at me ""Said that it's too late for drinks but it's not 9 yet!"" Suddenly mini-bitch pipes up and says, ""I want a shake, now."" My manager turns to me and tells me to go make the drinks, I can't really argue with him so I just frown and say ""Fine,"" He leaves. My smile has almost completely disappeared, you can tell I'm annoyed. I ring them up and the total comes to $7.84, nothing special. She digs out her wallet from her purse and starts counting out quarters, dimes, and pennies. *Really?* After she finished bitch was short a good $1.34, then thats when she did the *unimaginable*, she **REACHED INSIDE MY TIP JAR AND TOOK A DOLLAR** AS MINI-BITCH HANDED HER 35 CENTS. I was so appalled that I just stared at her, mouth open, when she tried to hand me the money. I protested ""Ma'am, that dollar is mine, you can't have it."" She looked shocked I told her no. ""Yes, I can."" ""NO, you can't, that's MY tip jar, MY property, MY money, you just basically stole my dollar."" She let out a frustrated sigh as she shoved my dollar back in the jar and asked mini-bitch for a dollar, to which **she pulled out a $5**. I had an angry frown on my face as I cashed them out, I was FUMING. That's when I knew I had to get revenge....

**The Revenge**:
I grabbed the blender out of the dishwasher and kinda washed off the soap. I poured the ice in and added significantly less chocolate, vanilla, and cream so it would be too thick to suck up through a straw, they would have to use a spoon. Then, I used coffee instead of espresso, same flavor just not good quality. I blend it for half the time leaving huge ice chunks in the bottom which is unpleasant to get around and is useless. When I poured it into their cups I ""forgot"" to add the chocolate around the outside, this doesn't change flavor, it's just not as cosmetically pleasing. And finally, I ""ran out of"" whipped cream so I used flat lids instead of the nice dome lids that hold the whip cream. I felt satisfied in my work and I decided to take an extra minute to clean up my mess, stealing another precious minute from them. I gave them my biggest smile as I handed them the drinks. I ran to the back and punched out, meaning I no longer work or do anything or else I get into trouble. I walked out as bitch approached me, ""You need to remake these!"" I played dumb. ""What do you mean?"" ""These are awful! It's too thick and doesn't have the chocolate or whip cream!"" I smile and politely tell her, ""I'm sorry but it's currently 9:02, we're closed and I punched out. I can't help you."" She stares me down but I keep my smile firm. Bitch gives up and sits down with mini-bitch who tries to eat her shake with a spoon. I walk over very slowly and lean down to their level and calmly tell them: ""Ever hear that you shouldn't mess with, or be rude to people who handle your food/drink?"" And give her a smile as her face gets pale as if she saw a ghost. ""Have a nice night,"" I yell as I walk out the door. I laughed all the way home.



TL;DR Bitch and Mini-bitch come in before closing, rude and tries to steal my money. I mess up their order and give them a life lesson.

EDIT: I have to be punched out at 9 or else I get in trouble the next day for staying late, I don't get paid extra for staying late. I don't get an extra half hour like most places to clean so I have to close and punch out simultaneously. ",You want coffee? I'll give you coffee.,758,pettyrevenge

ohFeisty,89,,117,1fl8dj,,574,"I've been in a long distance relationship with a cat for 3 years. The feline in question, Poof, belongs to my boyfriend's roommate - ""Ned"".

Ned is a [douchebag](http://alden-tan.com/wp-content/uploads/douchebag-posing.jpg). Really. Just with less blow-out-hair than the referenced image, and more crappy tribal tattoos. Ned was hired right out of college as a firefighter, and loves leaving his T4 slips around - showing that he makes over 100k a year. Yet despite working 7 days a month (*edit I'd misstyped and wrote ""week"")  (granted, 24h shifts) he fails to give proper care to his dog and cat. 

He'll do things like leave the dog in it's crate for 16+ hours a day, run out of food for the animals then claim they're on diets, hardly walk his dog to the point where it's socially dysfunctional and has overgrown nails.

When my boyfriend and I are at the house he shares with Ned, we do the best we can to take care of the pets. Any attempt to discuss their neglect is blown off by Ned. 

Over the years, Poof and I have become very attached. I take him to the vet, get him groomed, buy him food. The only reason I haven't adopted him is because I'm away from home so much.

Ned told my boyfriend he needed to move out for June 1st. Totally fine. Ned is just as horrible a roommate as he is a human - but BF has stuck around because rent was cheap &amp; the house was nice.  He'd been planning on buying a house - so getting the boot from Ned's place put that plan into motion. I'm not going to leave Poof with Ned, so I ask him one night if I could buy the cat from him. (He'd often bragged about how the cat was a 'good deal' at $50) Ned, who loves his possessions, was unsure and said he'd get back to me. 

Next day, he says I can have Poof... for $350.
I cry. I've paid way more than that in food, vet bills and medication for this creature. I was laid off and have been underemployed so I'm not really in the position to drop that much money on someone who's emotionally already my pet.

*Fast forward three months.*
This weekend, I'm back at Ned's house - helping my partner pack. I haven't been back to the house since Ned's absurd offer of $350 a 9 year old cat with kidney issues. As we're almost done, Ned comes up and says Poof has died. Or, at least, he can't find Poof so he figures he got out the house and died outside. He shrugs it off. Happened about a month ago. 

Once again, I weep. I let loose my years of fury on Ned. Telling him how I feel about his constant drunk driving, abusing women, pathological lying, animal neglect, and horrible narcissistic personality. 

My partner and I get into the rented truck, and drive to his new house. Open the front door and I'm greeted by my beloved Poof - mewing for attention.

Fuck you, Ned. Two weeks after he said I'd have to buy my geriatric cat from him, I came over during the week and took Poof. I wonder how long it look that douchebag to notice Poof was gone. Ned frequently comes home and passes out with the front door wide open - so the cat running away was absurdly plausible.  

Now Poof, myself and my boyfriend have a little house, where Poof can sit on the windowsill and be a happy, heavily loved fluffball. 
I've also reported Ned for animal cruelty for his dog. Wanted to kidnap the little mutt as well, but it wasn't possible.

The employee informs me that my food will be ready soon and goes back into the kitchen.  The asshat behind me decides to start honking his horn as if it will make things move faster.

In his defense, I did wait there a lot longer than usual.  This doesn't justify that he should have been honking his ass off though and showing he was visually pissed off by flailing his arm around out of his window.  Finally my food was ready and they pass the bag over to me.  At that exact moment, I thought /r/pettyrevenge.  I reached into the bag, took a few fries out and started munching on them.

its_raining_scotch,98,,127,1e6fss,,572,"This story happened in 2005, so it is a little far back now, but Oh do we remember it like yesterday....oh yes. Anyway, a bunch of my buddies and our girlfriends all decided to move out of our old college apartment and upgrade to a shitty house, since most of us had jobs now and it was time. So, let me start with the place itself: pretty big 4 bedroom lot, front and back yard, some fruit trees, single story, big driveway. It also had a dark side though: 12 foot tall pile of trash in the middle of the driveway. A garage FILLED with junk and refuse. Broken windows everywhere. Black widow spider infestation in the house (yes, you'd come how from work and find them hanging in the middle of your room). The heating system was not hooked up to any pipes in the attic, so when it turned on, the attack got nice and toasty, and we froze. The yards hadn't been tended to in probably a decade. There was a rotten home-made jacuzzi, which we hated due to its ability to spawn black widow spiders and other wooly-bubs. In short: this place was a dump, and we got it because it was cheap. We knew a slumlord situation could be sucky, but we hoped that our slumlord would be one of those who takes your money and disappears, allowing us to do whatever we want. But no....oh no nono nono.....this was not the case AT ALL. The first thing she said was ""ooo you have girls around, I know how that goes. first they stay a day, then a week, then they move in!! I don;t want them here! They can't come here!"" Next thing she noticed was my friends drum set: "" oooo noooooo, you don't play that here. It's somewhere in the contract. The neighbors don;t like me so they will be mad if you play music. (we are all completely taken aback by this psychos audacious attitude). Then she sees the same roomates truck (an old international scout) that he like to work on sometimes. she didn't like this one bit ""ohh NOOOOO you dont work on cars in my garage! I know what you wanna do, you wanna mess my garage up (it was a horrid pigsty already, she never clean her junk out it even though the contract said it would be clean and useable for us). Next tragedy occurs when we try and make the landscape look nice (it was only long dead plants and huge stick bundles prior). Us roomates and ladyfolk get to it and pull out the decades old overgrowth, hidden junk, and weeds. We pile them all conveniently in the front driveway so the landlord can come pick it up. Now we have room to do nice things like grow veggies and fruits like we've always talked about! Wrong. ""NNNNOooooooo is my HOUSE! You no change it. Put it back!!"" But, psycho, we just want to plant vegetables and stuff. We want to tend your fruit trees that have been ignored for a decade. Don;t worry, we are good at this kind of stuff"". Angry psycho ""NNOOOOOOOOOOO its my house and you cant do that, you dont like it, you dont leave (she always pronounced ""Live"" as ""leave"") here!' ""Look, we pay a lease, which states that this house and property are basically ours to do with as we please without you coming around all the time and arguing with us. I mean, we just want to plant vegetables, we dont want your flowers or whatever you think you're going to plant instead 6 months too late."" 

And then came those fate-full words, the crossing of the Rubicon ""FINE then you get out! I wont renew your lease!""

So here's where the serious revenge-porn section begins. Keep in mind that this lady is a bitch-psycho-slumlord, who would park her car in OUR driveway for weeks, show up unannounced and decide to grind tiles for the walkway at 6am on saturday next to our windows, never clean up anything she made like the pile of junk that filled our garage or the full fridge we inherited with rotting food. Anyway, now shit got serious. I told her she doesn't have the right to do all of this stuff, she said ""get out"". And so I began my battle plan. First I documented the place by video and stills, because I knew those would come in handy later for the inevitable court case. And just as expected, she charged us for most of our deposit based on all the damages she left. What a scumbag. So I plan a three pronged approach: small claims + City Housing Dept + IRS. All of which worked beautifully. Small claims was funny, she showed up with her ancient mom as her....lawyer? (who actually fell asleep the whole case lol). She didn't prepare at all and was unfamiliar with the whole process. We stated our case and showed our media evidence to the judge. Landlord-scum tried to interject and say it was all made up. He didn't buy her game though. I'll always remember this part of the court hearing Judge: ""Mrs. Landlord-Scum.....I'm looking at these pictures these boys hove given me, and I must say that your property looks like a terrible dump. I am in no way surprised that they are fighting you on this."" Of course she just started stammering about us being liars and shes the victim etc. We got the whole deposit back. On then to the housing authorities at the city. I brought them a VERY detailed report we made indicating every illegal/non-code issue we could find on the property (there were sooooo many). We had pics and everything. That place was janky and McGeyvered together like only a cheap, psycho lady could do. On top of that, I reported her to the IRS. Her neighbors HATED her and would tell us about all the problems she causes everywhere she goes. She also had a big mouth and admitted that she used our house as a tax shield (claiming she lived there and actually living somewhere else). I dont remember all of the details about the tax stuff, but I wrote down everything they told me and headed on down to the IRS office in my town. I filled out a form (anonymous of course) which basically allows you to rat on someone you know and suspect of committing tax fraud. I filled the form front to back and handed it in. 

Shortly thereafter, our deposit check arrived. Then a few weeks later I heard from the neighbors that her house had a lien against it. I never found out more than that, but I think I pretty much fucked her. I hope she saw that the power tripping and attempts to cut corners with us just ended up costing her 10 or maybe 100 times more time, energy, and money. She may have even lost a property because of her behavior. I'm getting a justice boner just thinking about this all again.

Ass_Explosion,85,,69,12mk6z,,569,"I'm a service plumber and I have a ton of stories of petty revenge for people that have screwed me, but this one is my favorite. 

About 5 years ago the company I was working for was called by a realtor we had dealt with in the past to winterize a home she had listed because the owner had already moved into their new home.  

Now I have to explain something to everyone that reads this, realtors are the single worst group of people for a service plumber to deal with.  As a contractor they tend to hold no value for your time as a commodity, usually want to be billed and, almost always want a discount because they ""bring you a lot of work"" (which is bullshit); this particular realtor was the worst of the worst, she also happened to be a major bitch.  

I was sent to the job and arrived with everything I needed exactly when my dispatcher said I would, I waited in my truck another 45 minutes for the realtor to show up and then she bitched because she wanted the spot where I parked; I moved my truck for her to make her happy.   

Once I got inside I started my work which was pretty easy;when you winterize a home you shut off and drain the water from the water lines, water heater and, fixtures; after the water is removed from the fixtures you pour RV antifreeze into the p-traps and toilets.  Homes are winterized to make sure water in the plumbing doesn't freeze and get damaged in case the furnace fails or the power goes out, realtors and banks usually do it to protect a property that isn't occupied.  

I was just about done and I noticed that the main water valve into the home had a very slight drip, the valve was at least 50 years old and was showing its age.  To be honest, this didn't matter much because when I was done in the house I was going to shut the water off at the street anyway and I could easily replace the leaky valve at that time if they wanted to (it would have taken 5 minutes) or just leave it alone; it really was no big deal, until I mentioned it to the realtor.  

Upon hearing that the main valve had a slight drip the realtor just flipped out, she started yelling about how this was going to ruin her day and then she called the homeowner; the homeowner left his work 30 minutes away to personally examine the situation.  By the time the homeowner was called I had been on the job for about 2 hours including waiting for the realtor.  The homeowner shows up about 45 minutes later with a very arrogant attitude and accuses me of purposely damaging his valve, I explain that the valve is 50 years old and that replacing it was no big deal; Because he was being a pain I offered to replace the valve for free.  Replacing the valve for free wouldn't work for him so he and the realtor decided I should just fill the plumbing back up (this made absolutely no sense) and bitched about wasting their time with winterizing.  

When I was done I wrote up an invoice and presented it to the realtor, while she was going over the invoice with the homeowner I went into the basement to make sure I didn't leave anything behind.  The basement was clean so I began heading back up when I heard them deciding not to pay me because ""I didn't do anything"".   I was very pissed off, as a rule a service plumber is only paid for the time he bills out and collects on; I was out more than 1/2 days worth of pay.  At that time I walked over to the furnace and shut the gas off to it long enough to extinguish the pilot light which will prevent it from working and turned the main water valve about 1/2 way on.   

After a curt yet polite exchange with my two newest enemies I decided to let the office handle them.  


About 2 weeks later we had a really bad cold spell and we received a lot of calls for frozen/burst water lines, one was from the realtor for the property I wasted her time at.  Because the realtor didn't pay us for our last encounter we turned her work down.  

I ended up working down the street from the house I winterized a few months later, it was off the market.  It turns out the water piping froze and then thawed flooding out the entire home and because nobody was living in the house at the time insurance wouldn't cover the damages because they were ""foreseeable"".  

Edit: TL:DR- I am a plumber that was sent to winterize an empty home, I did the work and mentioned a leaky valve to the customers, the customers flip out for reasons I couldn't comprehend, I was told to just put things the way they were before and I do, I overheard the customers saying they wouldn't pay me so I shut off the pilot light on the furnace, 2-3 weeks later the plumbing in the home burst and flooded the home, good times had by all.",How a plumber deals with a bad customer,638,pettyrevenge
Schizophrenetic,53,,129,1log56,,570,"I work at a grocery store, and more often than not, I'm assigned to the 'self-checkout cashier' position, which is sweet because you almost never have to do anything except get people cigarettes and look-up codes for produce.

We have this little old lady, Ruth, who comes in all the time. Ruth is the biggest sweetheart in the universe. I would kill or die for her. To put it in perspective, Ruth gave me a ride home when my car died, even though I live on the other side of town. She brought our bag-girl a cake on her birthday. She bought me a birthday present! A fucking mega man action figure! I had only ever mentioned to her that I like mega man, and she bought me an action figure. Ruth is, in short, an angel walking amongst us. She'll often stick around after her purchases to just talk to us (and it's *lovely*), just to catch up. To beat a dead horse, we all adore Ruth, such to the point that we quarrel over who gets to bring her groceries out to her car with her.

So imagine my rage when yesterday, this asshole yuppie out-of-towner rudely pushes her out of the way (pretty close to shoulder checks her, actually) so he can get in line before her. There wasn't even anybody in the store! And yet, push a lovely old woman out of his way he did. My manager rushed to her and made sure she was okay, which she was, but my blood went white hot instantly.

Thinking quickly I moved to that checkout lane and began fussing with the bags, making sure to keep my back turned to the yuppie. As he saunters up to the checkout station, I keep him in my peripheral vision, making sure to time it just right...

He completes his purchase and begins to walk past me. Still facing away, I **RIP** some of the bags off of the bagging frame and wheel around, slamming my elbow into the bridge of his nose. Dude actually falls to the ground, clutching his bloody nose.

I make a show of apologizing profusely, but he doesn't seem to believe me, since I'm wearing a shit-eating grin. None of the other employees ask if he's okay, or even bother to help him to his feet.

He leaves, and Ruth approaches. ""I know what you did,"" she says, giving me a knowing look. She winks and gives me one of the snickers bars she keeps in her purse.

TerrytheMerry,46,,121,1nwsvb,,562,"So a friend and I went to a concert last Friday and got some awesome spots in the middle right near the barricade separating the crowd from the stage. 

Unfortunately, next to me was a trio of late 40 something or 50 year old drunks, two men and a slutty woman who was wearing a strapless corset top that was way too small for her. The first opener comes on stage, a few awkward older locals who were obviously very nervous. After their first song the woman starts yelling loudly about how shitty their sound is and how she can't hear shit because an amp is directly in front of her. Annoying, but not my problem.

 Then the second opener comes out and the slut is obviously much more excited by them as they are more young attractive than the first, and about half way through their set she begins jumping against me whenever the singer gets near while sloshing her beers all down my back. I'm pretty pissed now and thinking about how I hope there isn't a police checkpoint on my way home, but I'm still in a forgiving mood since the woman is horribly drunk and I know she's probably not all that self aware. 

Then the second group wraps up and we're all waiting on main band, who everyone really showed up for, to set up. I'm talking with my friend when we hear the other drunks trying to calm slutty down about something, I start listening in and I hear this woman threatening to punch ""that skank"" in the face. Curious I listen more and find she's telling the other two that I was roughly slamming into her since the first set and about how she was going to break my teeth. 

Shocked I turned about and as politely as I could apologized but said that she must have me confused with someone else, to which she replied ""fuck you fat ass bitch, put your fake ass tits up!"" This perplexed me for a moment as I thought she meant fists rather than tits, then I realized she was accusing me of lording about my chest for attention, strange considering my top came up to my neck. As her companions decided to cheer her on and throw more insults my way, perhaps in hopes of a cat fight, I simply nodded and turned away thinking 'okay it's my problem now.'

 A few minutes later one of the band members walked out and she began hopping up and down, saggy flesh a jiggling, and I took my opportunity. I took a slight step back, so that she slid right in front of me, and as she bounced I caught hold of the thin bit of ribbon that held her teensy corset top together and watched as she jumped up one last time, pulling loose the knot in the ribbon herself, and all of the flesh that had been packed so tightly burst forth as the top slid to the ground. 

The hag let out a high pitched screech and briefly searched the ground for her cover, before realizing she couldn't find it among the legs of the crowd and littered beer bottles. She then grabbed on of the men and fled the establishment never to be seen again. I waited for someone to point me out or a bouncer to kick me out, before gleefully realizing that with the excitement of the band entering no one had seen me do it. Shame the woman was such a bitch, it was a spectacular concert.

ShaneL79,73,,83,17vn19,,567,"Every May long weekend we head into the mountains for a small town festival and baseball tournament. We usually go with about 10 regulars, and there are usually a few randoms that show up to fill the roster on our baseball team. We all usually cram into a couple of campsites right in the middle of the festival grounds.

Prior to our first game we were having our usual pre-game beers. I put my half-full beer down on the table while I did something else for a brief moment. When I turned around my beer was missing. I look over and one of the randoms is drinking it. I knew it was mine because I was the only one drinking that particular brand of beer. 

I thought that was uncool, but no big loss.

That evening I made a rookie mistake and left my cooler outside of my tent, thinking I would hear anyone trying to get into it. I woke up that morning and every beer in my cooler was gone. I look over and sure enough there is a pile of empties beside the chair of the random who took my beer the day before. I can't blame him, but I am pretty sure. A few people we were with were pretty certain it was him, but were pretty drunk.

I was a little more pissed considering I had two flats of beer in my cooler.  

That evening I paid attention to this guy. He arrived with a backpack containing only a couple beer (which happened to be the same brand I had stolen from me the night before). After about an hour he was drinking a different kind of beer. Then one of our friends open drinks went missing, and he had the same drink. 

It became a bit of a game and we started drawing on our drinks so there would be no doubt about whose it was. Still he kept stealing them. No one was being confrontational since we were all drinking.

The petty revenge came in two forms.

**Petty Revenge 1**

We all quietly hid the rest of our beer or locked it in a vehicle so he couldn't steal it. Then whenever he would put his drink down for a second or two, the group of us made an effort to grab it and hide it or pour it out. 

We are pretty certain he started stealing from other campsites at that point so we kept pouring it out. I hate seeing beer go to waste as much as anyone, but it was a sacrifice we had to make.

**Petty Revenge 2**

Our friends were playing a show at the local pub and we all went there to support them. This thief became such a side-show for the rest of us that during the show we were watching him walk around and steal drinks from people who were dancing, or even collecting multiple drinks and pouring the bottoms into one glass. 

One of the girls we were with had the brilliant idea to put some salt in it. She put a dash to start and he didn't notice. She put more, still he didn't notice. Then finally she dumped the majority of the bottle into his drink. He took a swig and his face reacted like it was horrible, but he continued to drink it. So for the rest of the weekend this guy was either drinking salt or nothing at all. ",Beer Thief,650,pettyrevenge

One fine noontime, I finished up with photography class and headed to the cafeteria to get some lunch. The kitchen line was in a little nook separated by a wall from the cafeteria tables. It was kind of dark in there. I was waiting my turn when two princessy sophomores cut in front of me. I asked them to get back to the end of the line. They ignored me.

Itsrane,147,,125,166c7w,,562,"First of all, thank you /u/Werewolf_of_London for posting [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/164jnu/i_have_a_coupon_id_like_to_use/) and reminding me of my own retaliation.

This happened about four years ago. Being busy *and* broke is not a good combo, and I needed some clothes that didn't look like they spent more time tumbling around a washing machine than on a person. I had fallen in love with a pair of pants at Diesel while showing my aunt around town. She gave me my birthday money early explicitly to get them when I got the chance. Remember the being busy part? Yeah, I had no time for a leisurely walk around town to shop, so I decided to go straight to the store after one my of classes (photography, this is kinda relevant), get the pants, and get back to campus in time for the next class. So I ended up downtown in clothes that are obviously worn, but still pretty neat, considering they've gotten sprayed with developer and fixer on a number of occasions (left cuff of my shirt had the only obvious stain, about the size of a quarter). My sneakers were speckled with bleached and red spots, but they weren't noticeable. I also smelled of fixer.

Anyway, walk into the store, right to the women's jeans section, and look through the sizes. Didn't even need to try them on, I knew exactly which one I needed. As I lifted another folded pair carefully to look at the sizes on the tags, a hand slams down on the pile, ripping the corner of the one I was lifting out from between my fingers. I looked over my shoulder and saw the biggest, snottiest sneer I've ever seen on someone's face. When this sales-- well, I don't think ""lady"" really applies, to this person, bitch will have to do -- this salesbitch saw that she had my (rather stupefied) attention, she said in the most condescending voice possible, ""These are $300 apiece, *honey*.""

Of course, I already knew how much they cost. I gently pushed her hand of the pant-pile, pulled out the pair I wanted, then met her eyes again, and said, ""Of course I know they're $300, *sweetie*. If I didn't have that money, I'd be doing the selling, not the buying."" I lost count of the number of colors and shades that flashed all over her face.

As a bonus, I *accidentally* hit the pile o' trousers with my oversized bag of ~~bricks~~ textbooks, sending them all over the floor, and said, ""Oh, no. I'm *so sorry*. I'd help you pick it up, but I have to run back campus. Sorry again!""

Revenge achieved. I also did talk to the manager about her behavior, but not in the ""you've wronged a customer and now you'll be sorry!"" way. Told her what had happened, and informed her that I didn't want to cause any trouble for anyone (beyond pants-picking and folding, but that was an *accident*), but there has to be some level of decorum, especially since I had not interacted with anyone in the store. The manager was pretty understanding, and even commented that she had received complaints about similar behavior with other costumers. I was kind of glad to know it wasn't just me. 

On the other side of the coin, I also go out of my way to praise any one who helps me well to management. When they're in earshot the looks on their faces are amazing. 

And I still have those pants.

Edit: Accidentally a typo.

Edit Again: A lot of people are going on about how I can be ""broke"" and spend $300 on a single article of clothing. The 300 bucks were from my aunt with instructions to get those pants as a birthday gift. If I could do what I wanted with that money I'd either squirrel it away or buy cheap but neat clothing.

Besides, 4 years later, and I still have them, and they're in better state than other, newer pants. Plus the way they fit is awesome and they make my butt look great.

I've never typed pants so many times before. Wow.

Pants.

Edit 3: I'm trying to respond to everyone. You guys took the time to comment, I'll take the time to reply. If I miss anyone, I'm sorry!

atheist_libertarian,45,,121,1h9fpc,,555,"So I used to work in an office with a bunch of other university students on summer break as sales reps.  there were a couple conferences throughout the summer and the reps from all the offices all over would come.

We all went to the office in the morning, and then split up into carpools to go to the conference and back, about a 30 minute drive or so.  Since I was late in the morning and someone was leaving from the conference early, I rode up by myself and then took the people from the other guy's car back to the office with me afterward.

All day, this one guy was whining about how stupid these conferences are, and what a waste of time they are.  Keep in mind, it's all basically 18-22 people there, so if you're really not that into it, just hang back and check out the hot girls from all over the place and maybe strike up a conversation here and there.  But no, this guy had to just shit on everything and bring the rest of us in his vicinity down.

Sure enough, he winds up being one of my carpool people along with two sweet, friendly, soft-spoken girls.  He starts by inserting himself into the front passenger seat without offering to either of the girls. No big deal I guess.  Then he starts ragging on me for not wanting to run the AC.  I just got the car, my first car, and was getting acclimatized to the expenses and didn't want to shell out for an AC repair when I'm just trying to use the car to get to work to pay for school.

I use this as a segue onto it being my first car, thinking this might spark up some conversation in the car that is upbeat.  Nope, this asshole has to rag on me for not getting a standard transmission and needs to point out that we wouldn't have shitty autos if it weren't for women wanting to drive.  I look in the rear view mirror and the girls are flabbergasted at this idiot.

So I decide I'll speak to them about what they are going to school for.  The one girl says something about nutritionist or dietitcian or something like that.  I take up an interest and tell her about a girl i knew from my school in that and about career fields, etc.  We are finally having pleasant conversation, but no, this asshole now has to point out that dieticians and nutritionists, or whatever, are just quacks.

After the drive, we're back at the office, the girls thank me for the ride, dickhead just jumps out of the car like, ""finally we're back"".  The girls want to just get away from this asshole and say goodbye and jump in their cars to leave.  I go into the office to get some supplies and dipshit goes in as well.  Now he's thinking about home.  

him:  ""Ah man, now I gotta walk home.""

me:  ""oh yeah, you live around here eh?""

him:  ""yeah kind of.  it's like a 2 minute drive on XYZ St., but because of the highway there, I have to walk all the way around and it's a longer way and takes forever.""

me:  ""oh that sucks man""

him:  ""yeah....[pause, trying to incite an invitation for a ride from me]""

me:  ""well, you probably want to get going then, i'll stop holding you back.  take it easy man, see you on monday""

i acting completely oblivious and watched him get more pathetic by the second.  for some reason, he didn't want to seem needy or something to actually ask for the ride, and i'm so glad he didn't.  i loved getting back into my car and watching him hit the pavement as i pulled out of the lot.

We were on a special grill in which you can control how high or low the fire could go via a little spin thing. It was located right near my foot. I waited until the jerk was almost done roasting her marshmallow perfect, and admiring the crispiness. I nudged the twister and the fire went up a few inches. Her art was burned. The walk of shame for her to get a new one was priceless. I gave a hearty chuckle. It was fun. Her marshmallow was forever tainted. Just like her soul. Bitch.

But the car I saw that I THOUGHT was far enough away was doing about double the speed limit so after I had already pulled into the lane he speeds up laying on the horn. Then as we head towards the highway he continues to tailgate me very aggressively. 

Finally we get the the highway intersection and I needed to go left. I pull into the turn lane and he comes up on my right side and glares at me while giving me the finger. He even tries to make a show of it. 

I guess he should have been watching the light turn red instead because he smashed into the person in front of him. It looked bad. Myself along with a few others jumped out of their cars to see if everyone was ok. The car in front had a woman who was banged up a little but was ok and then I went to his car with biggest smirk on my face. Looked him right in the eye and said.

etherealstasis,54,,87,19xta4,,559,"I used to pay $50 for a reserved parking spot at my apartment complex parking garage b/c we have more resident stickers than parking. I used to park on the street, but people keep hitting my car and stealing my antenna, etc...

Well people started parking illegally next to the concrete wall across from my parking space. I drive an SUV so I cannot back out when someone is parked there illegally. Thankfully, we have a fantastic towing/booting service so I thought no biggie, I'll just call and be on my merry way. Sadly, the company had change management and they no longer tow from this garage, AND they can't boot the car parked illegally b/c it would be a ""fire hazard.""

YaFloozeYaLose,107,,167,15u67h,,556,"Not sure if /r/pettyrevenge will like my story, but it certainly made me feel good. TL;DR on the bottom.

So, my boyfriend and I were at Universal Studios waiting in line to ride the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit Roller coaster. We were behind a group of little tubby boys all wearing neon green t-shirts. I remember this because I thought they were just a tad annoying as soon as we joined the line. Behind us was this short skinny girl and a really tall guy in a red shirt. 

There were a couple of people sitting on the railing when the line turned a corner and I thought they were in front of us so I didn't move and waited for them to jump down. Then I remembered the kids in green and realized that the people on the railing were from the other side. By the time I had move, the couple had already cut us in line. I simply thought to myself, ""Gosh darn it. That was my bad."" I figured in the next corner turn I'd inch my way back to my spot. 

When I tried however, this bitch extended her arm and grabbed the railing as soon as I walked up beside her to block me from moving up. I thought coincidence and I would have better luck on the next turn. The whole time she kept her head down while biting her nails. I tried again and the same exact thing happened. ""Are you serious?"" I said out loud, but she just kept her head down. Her buddy looked a little nervous but stayed quiet. I was getting pissed, but my boyfriend kept reminding me that it wasn't a big deal and I should get over it. 

I tried to and I was pretty close until I saw that she was not only in front of me, but she had also surpassed the chubby kids in green. When I tried to catch up to them, the kids were like, ""Uh . . . excuse me. You're kinda cutting us."" I just looked at my BF in disbelief. I don't like to get into fights or confrontation so I didn't say anything. 

We waiting in that line for almost half an hour, by then the couple was about 20 people ahead of us. Now I'm pretty shy and don't like any type of confrontation, but I am very competitive and in my mind, I was losing to this chick. Miserably. I really hate losing. So contrary to my usual personality, I started talking really loud. ""Whoa! Those guys got pretty far! They got in front of those people and those people. Hey, look they are trying to get in front of them too! Can they do it? Amazing! They did it again!"" Like a sports commentator. Unfortunately, everyone either didn't care or were too afraid to say anything. The girl looked up and kind of gave me a dirty look. 

Finally, they were trying to get ahead of these three kids, but they had overheard me and were prepared. They had formed a wall and blocked the way. I leaned over to where they were and started talking to them, ""Good job!"" I said and they smiled at me and we just had a small conversation about how rude they were. My boyfriend nudged me and smiled as he said, ""That girl was talking about you kinda mad saying that you told on her."" I smiled back.

I guess that was enough to satisfy me enough to enjoy the ride. By then we were right by the stairs and would get on in about another 5 - 10 minutes. Suddenly, the girl I had been talking to called to me. ""Hey!"" She said, ""We called security on them."" I smiled and thought to myself, ""Yes! Justice!"" Then she said, ""They want to talk to you."" Damn it! I had been trying to avoid a fight with this girl. 

I walked up to them, ""Who was cutting?"" He asked. With no hesitation I pointed to the girl and her buddy (who I kinda feel bad for since it seemed like he was opposed to the idea) ""Alright, you two get out."" The girl walk away in a huff followed by her disappointed man friend. I couldn't stop smiling. I think I was a little too happy, but like I said I'm competitive and in my mind I won. 

**TL;DR** A tiny girl and her man friend cut us and almost 25 other people in the line to a roller coaster at Universal. Being too shy to call them out directly, I started commentating on their actions loudly. After waiting in line for half an hour, a girl who heard me called security on them. I guess I was a key witness and was called over to confirmed that they were the skippers. They got kicked out of the ride five minutes before getting on.

Dragid,69,,127,1bb3ix,,553,"I've been living in my current apartment for about 8 months now, and when I moved in I made it clear that because I'm a student, I need it to be quiet Sunday-Thursday nights. I don't care about the weekends, but I take morning classes during the week and need to get to bed around 10. Things were fine for the first couple months, but my roommate and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot, so now she'll come home from work dragging some coworkers and they'll all get drunk and be loud until the wee hours of the morning.

On top of that, she's accumulated two dogs. Little yippy things, which she leaves caged while she's at work. The dogs are young (1 year and 6 months), and anytime they hear someone in the apartment and aren't getting attention they bark and jump around and make noise. Then, when the roommate comes home from work around 11pm, they'll bark for a solid ten minutes because people walking in the door sets them off. I can't do anything about it either, since the landlady is her mother.

So I just found a new apartment with people who don't have pets and seem really cool to live with. Cue the revenge. The roommate is also insane about cleaning. A place for everything and everything in it's place. Every time she's home from work, she's cleaning or redecorating/rearranging something. Every single day. So now whenever I'm home and she's not, I move things. Just a little. A quarter turn on a trinket here, putting the can opener back in the opposite side of the drawer, poking a hanging picture to hang *just barely* off center. Things like that.

The best part is within a few hours of her coming home, they're all back exactly the way they were. I love knowing that she notices and that it bothers her, but that they're such tiny things that there's no conceivable way to blame anyone without sounding like an insane person.",Petty Revenge on Crazy Roommate,680,pettyrevenge
mybossisadick,93,,106,1hj66u,,552,"Sorry guys, this is a long one... feel free to skip to the TLDR! Enjoy! And I'm so sorry for the language! I never swear in real life, but it feels great to finally get this off my chest.

About 5 years ago, I left my hometown for university in the big city. I was a wide eyed, fresh faced 18 year old from out in the sticks, wouldn't say boo to a goose and very innocent and shy. Because of this, I didn't have many friends.

I soon got a job at a local restaurant as a waitress which was very upfront with their customers, we were encouraged to be chatty at all times. This restaurant was extremely close knit and the staff accepted me straight away, we always went out after work for drinks and I eventually moved in with the ones I was closest too.

The only thing bringing me down...was my boss.

He was an utter shit head but he seemed to have something in it for me in particular. He would rota me down for the deep clean shifts every week (out of around 35 staffs) Mon, Wed, Sat. That's a 6am- 12pm shift of having your head inside the grill hoods, dishwashers, ovens, bathroom sinks, customer toilets and on top of that, a 12pm-10pm shift. Bearing in mind I still had college to study for.

He would berate me, make snide remarks,openly make fun of me in staff meetings, make me go get his coffee, ask me to make his food and always made fun of my appearance and financial situation. He knew I was desperate for money and I think he did all these things thinking I would never hand in my notice...and the fact I was an utter mouse and would never speak up.

Over time, I became more and more confident, even rising through the ranks. Became head waitress, staff trainer, shift co ordinator and eventually a supervisor. Of course, this also meant I would be working closer to my boss, who became even more unpleasant.

I graduated from college with the highest honors and received an offer from a hospital about 200 miles away (I was training to be a nurse) so the time came to hand in my notice. It was very emotional, as my boss said goodbye he said ""I wish I could say I would miss you but I won't, have fun wiping peoples butts for a living!"". He even went so far as to rota me in for my leaving party....and then proceeded to attend it himself! (It's fine as I powered through and shut up shop super early so I could go!)

So I bid everyone farewell, pack up and move away to start my career and I'm having a great time. I pop back home every other month to see everyone and we have a good catch up, although my boss would deny me the obligatory 30% company discount and eventually banned me outright from setting foot in the store ( good thing there is a coffee shop right next door to it that we would all gather in) 

My best friend had risen to the rank of 1st assistant manager and invites me back for a party that is paid for by the restaurant chain in the most glamourous nightclub in town (free drinks and entry, dance all night long and a chance to see all of my friends at one time) I tell her that I will attend though I will pay for my drinks, since I no longer work there and I shouldn't qualify for freebies! My old boss gets wind of it and tells me that if I attend, he will have me escorted out by the POLICE!??! 

I'm pretty upset as I've come all this way to see everyone to be told I'm not welcome. My friends all leave the club and meet me in the bar next door so we proceed to have a great time.

As luck would have it, a month later, I inherited quite a large sum of money from my grandmother. Not millions...but enough to live comfortably for the rest of my life. I'm not a flash woman, I don't drive a car, I already have a cute little bungalow in the suburbs that I bought and decorated myself, I have no hobbies, I don't like flying. I am dedicated to my life as a nurse and have kept my fortunes very quiet. For now, I'm investing and donating to charities. (oh, and I sent my parents on a honeymoon 35 years after they got married haha). I bought my best friend (the manager) a new car, it was the least I could do after she took me under her wing all those years ago and we slummed it together in a pokey student hole.

Although, the next time I visit my old restaurant, my boss comes up to me and gives me a great big hug. Weird. He asks me how my job is going. It's going good. Weirder. Asks me if I've had lunch, would I like lunch on the house for old times sake? Uhh, no thanks...what the hell is going on?!

I'm starting to get very uncomfortable. He puts his arm around me and asks me to join him in the office to check out the new CCTV system... well okay...I suppose.

The office has changed. On the wall are the sales figures, written in big red letters, with a downwards arrow and a drawn on sad face... a catalogue is on the desk, with a new fridge freezer highlighted.... on the computer, an email from Head Office saying that they have not been granted the budget for a new fridge freezer, only the document has been zoomed in so it's readable from 2ft away.

Boss sits me down. ""It's really nice to see you back in town, did Claire (the best friend) tell you about our fridge breaking down?"", ""No, she didn't"" I reply. It's all pieced together in my head. I know whats coming...

""Well, I've heard from the staff that you've come into a bit of money, and I was wondering, since you were such a valued member of the team to us all here, If you wouldn't mind buying us a new one? It would be a great help you know"".

I don't believe what's just been asked of me, but the voice of my weak, teenage self starting screaming within me ""THIS IS YOUR CHANCE!"".

I smile. ""I have a better idea"". I go into my bag, pull out my purse, go to pull out my credit card but instead slide my hand away and proceed to stick my middle finger up into his face.

""How about you go FUCK YOURSELF?"".

I promptly walk out, and burst into tears at the relief of FINALLY being able to tell my boss where he can stick it.

**TLDR: Restaurant Boss treats me like the shit of the earth for 3 years but I'm too shy to retaliate, became wealthy and refuse to buy that cunt a new fridge freezer.**

rivers31334,16,,99,1ina5l,,552,"A few years back, I was a summer camp counselor for campers with special needs.  It was a day camp at the local university, and each day the campers got time in the gym (under supervision of course), to play racquetball, swim, etc.  The university was nice and let us use an area of the locker room that was vacant.  Most all people were respectful of us, as they realized the difficulties of my job.

Now to try to explain this next part.  The shower system in the locker room was a bit weird.  Every time somebody flushed a toilet in the locker room, there was a short burst of intensively hot water that everyone taking a shower would feel…really annoying.  Basically, you had to coordinate your shower to either be short, or to when you felt that the locker room was empty, as to avoid getting doses of extremely hot water.  People were generally cool about this fact, and it wasn't really a big deal.

One afternoon while getting my campers into the pool area, a man (let’s call him Professor Douche) felt the need to cut the line at the entrance citing his seniority at the university.  As he passed me, he gave me a terribly nasty look and said, “you should get your campers under control.  This is a university, not a zoo.”  Either  Professor Douche didn't realize these campers were special needs and needed closer attention, or he was just a real big douche.  Either way, this pissed me off.

The Revenge:
Well after the day is over, and all my campers are currently in the locker room getting ready to leave, guess who strolls in for a shower post swim…yes, Professor Douche.  As he was the only one taking a shower at the time, I couldn’t resist.  I had ALL my campers (16 of them), go flush the toilets one by one as they were walking out.  I could hear Professor Douche scream around the 9th or 10th flush…yes, it was awesome.

For reference, the road I was driving on was one of the larger roadways in the city. It was the pre-rush hour rush, so there were more cars than usual, but less than full on rush hour. 

So I'm driving down this road in the right hand lane, singing along to the tunes on the radio, because that's how I roll. Out of nowhere, this jackoff in a raised pickup truck with all the fixins (you know the type) comes flying up behind me, gets right on my tailgate, and starts laying on the horn. I look around, and the road is full. I can't go left, because there is a wall of cars there, all moving the exact same speed. But yet, this doucher has decided that I'm not doing all I can to shorten his commute.

This goes on for about 30 blocks (5 sets of lights) and this guy just will. Not. LAY. OFF. **THE HORN.** He's riding my ass like nobody's business, and constantly pulling left and right to try to get past. Into more cars. I don't know. But whatever, I've had it by now. Game on, fucker. You've freed the beast. At this point, I know I need to make this guy more unpleasant than he already is, but I don't know how. Then he makes this problem very easy to solve.

At one point in this road, a new right hand lane opens up for about 150m. This is *only* to exit. It does not stay on this main road. It leads to another, larger road. So of course, as soon as we hit this new lane, asshole decides he is going to use it to pass everybody. He swerves into the lane the second his truck is clear of the last little bit of curb. He punches the gas, and quickly starts to overtake me. With perfect timing, the car ahead of me moves over into this lane as well, blocking this truck's path. Cue the horn. The other driver proceeds to give 0 fucks about this guy on his ass riding the horn. Now, by this time, the guy who was originally behind this truck (2 spots behind me) has pulled up close behind me, and I'm holding pace with the truck, forming a pretty little rolling roadblock that is trapping the truck in the exit lane. He's got the signal going, he's trying to muscle his way back onto the main road, but I (and I like to think the other two guys as well) were having none of it. We hold this guy in his lane for the last 75 m or so until he hits the exit ramp, at which point I give him a cheery little wave as he pops a few blood vessels.

The road he got on was already gridlocked with rush hour traffic, and the next off ramp was over a kilometer away. Enjoy your trip, asshole.

EDIT: A lot of people are asking about medical emergencies. I don't know, but I think it's safe to assume this wasn't the case, as the road we made this guy get onto is the quickest route to the nearest hospital.

rnavroze,29,,153,1cvahy,,547,"**BACKGROUND**

I live in Mumbai. There is nothing like driving etiquette here. Driving is a game of survival, anyone can cut you off anywhere and bikers generally squeeze between cars and try to beat the traffic.

The bus service over here is also chaotic. I don't know what the ""international standards"" are, but here bus stops are 2 and 3 minutes apart, and 20-30 different routes may all share at a single bus stop. There are no doors on buses (there are doorframes, so don't worry, we don't have to climb in from the windows). And buses rarely halt for more than 20 seconds at a bus stop. In fact, they start moving before the last person has even entered the bus. (You buy the tickets after you're seated)

****

**REVENGE**

So it's frequent here that bikers try to save time by squeezing in between the bus stop and a bus. Nobody really cares if you get out from the front or back, so usually there's people getting out from both sides. Now this is quite dangerous, as the biker could easily hit you in his hurry. So what I do, when I see a biker trying to squeeze between the bus and stop, I'll stand at the back door, and put my hand out, signalling that I'm getting off. So the biker usually stays right behind me, so as soon as I get off and move away, he can cut out before the other person exits. But I don't move.

rustlethemjimmies,45,,115,19kllu,,541,"Sorry for the wall of text.. But anyways

I work on the register at a bulk type meat market butcher thing, and this hambeast comes to the register during the lunch time rush, and tries to buy ~50 slabs of different cuts of meat. Once I ring up the total price, she decides that it costs to much, and dumps 20 trays back on my register. Now these registers are tiny, none of that conveyor belt stuff, so I ran out of room. She then demanded I take them all off the total and re-bag everything for her because all of the bags are now practically empty, meaning I had to put it all away myself during the lunch rush, or try and work around the 20 trays in my limited space.

The area that this butcher is in is known for theft and destruction of property, so trolleys aren't actually allowed to leave the store. My revenge? As she is trying to pry money out of her purse with those sausage fingers, I stretch the bottom of each plastic bag slightly and then overload them all with the remaining trays of meat. She payed, still accusing me of ripping her off, then left. Two minutes later, she comes back, all six chins quivering and she is livid about it, and started yelling at me, because her meat went all over the car park. The head butcher came out, saw the meat still sitting at the register, and just there and then said if she didn't like it she could fuck off, as it wasn't my job to make sure the meat got from the register to the car.

**TL:DR** Hambeast comes in to bulk butchers, changes her mind about half of the shopping at the register where I work, demanding me to re-pack the bags now that she has emptied them all again. I get my revenge my slightly stretching and overloading all the bags. Comes in two minutes later, furious because the bags broke, and zero shits were given by the boss.

Not_Joshy,59,,127,1fwsyf,,547,"Years ago I was a bartender for a local bar, a mostly awesome job where the money was decent &amp; the beer flowed freely, though every now and again you would encounter some pretty douchey people. This is a tale of one of those people:

I fondly recall this one time where I had this guy come in and sit at my bar during a slow spell in the day. The bar top was empty so he had the whole thing to himself and my undivided attention. I remember him saying how he had shown up a bit earlier than his date for the night, and how he wanted to knock back a few to help ease the nerves. A fairly common request. I remember his drink order; he wanted a premium margarita with top shelf ingredients, blended, with extra salt on the rim. I whipped up his drink, he complimented its deliciousness, and proceeded to guzzle it fairly quickly over the course of around 20 minutes. He ordered another, standard procedure. I figured what the hell, his date's on the way, nothing wrong with a bit of liquid courage. 

So I mix up his second drink and my back is turned while I'm watching the blender. As the noise dies down, I hear a familiar *-click-click*. I turn around to pour his drink into a mug in front of him and see this dude clipping his finger nails right onto the bar top. Hmmm. Not exactly the best place to take care of that, but whatever man. Guess he wants to look good for his date. So half way through his second drink his date arrives, and this dude wants to close out his tab and get a table. My douchebag sensor starts tingling as I hand him the little tray thing with his card and receipt to sign. I make myself busy at the other end of the bar and bid him a good rest of his evening, as he and his lady grab a table. I go to pick up the tray and receipt when lo and behold, fucker stiffed me AND left a pile of his fucking fingernail clippings in the tray. Come on man- you just spent $18 on 2 drinks, and the only tip I got was a handful of your disgusting, gangly nails?? Fuck that. 

I watched the bar ticker closely as the waitress from his section put in the order I recognized: premium margarita, blended, with extra salt. I did what any petty revenger would do; I tossed that pile of his own nail clippings into the blender along with his drink, then blended it up nicely. Then I watched menacingly from a distance as he chugged down his frosty/naily beverage, knowing that was all the tip I needed. 

As an epilogue, he ended up not tipping the waitress either on a fairly hefty tab &amp; I regret nothing.

I don't want to be a complete ass and take up 2 parking spots on the 1st or 2nd floors (where 99% of the people park), and park on the 4th floor (where there's at *least* 100 spots and about 10 people park). Everyone on my garage floor, with so few people on it, has their habits and parks in the same spot...every day. I park way off to the side, in the corner, so I am not bothering anyone with my double-space parking.

Tim is an older man who is a bagger and lets you know how long he's worker there (35 years).  Tim is also a little slow. He isn't really mentally challenged but you can tell he's a little off. Tim is also very broke so he always looks in the fridge for free food. One day he thought it would be a good idea to eat my subway. I confronted him and he just said "" it didn't have your name on it"" I was furious and talked to my supervisor who told me to let it go and just put my name on it next time. I agreed after I calmed down. So a week or so later I put another subway sub with my name clearly on it. The Fucker ate it too.  I go to my boss again who said he would look into it which actually means he's going to do nothing as I'm walking out I see Tim and could tell he heard the conversation and had the biggest shit eating grin on his face and I went insane for a little bit.

This was war for me. I was so mad. It was the grin. His damn smile of "" I can do what I want"" that I had to do something bad. So after thinking for a little bit, and a little research I knew what had to be done. I made a meal some chips a candy bar and what appeared to be a beef sandwich but it wasnt beef. It was dogfood. Yes I made him a dogfood sandwich. His lunch came around and I saw him look in th fridge (I made it a point to be around the break room at the time of his lunch and watch this go down) I see him look in the bag with my name on it, pull out the wraped sandwich and throw it in the microwave. He rips the bag up and throws it away and starts in on my candy bar. After he eats that he pulls out my sandwich and starts in on it. To my suprise he didn't know it was dogfood and was really enjoying it. So I walk in the break room open the fridge  and ask where it is. Before he can say anything about no name. I point and say "" that sandwich is for my dog, that's dogfood"" he just sits there with a blank look on his face. I give him an evil smile and he runs out of the break room and I just lose it laughing my ass off. It wasnt 2 minutes later before I was called to the bosses office. I explain the sandwich was for my dog and show him the torn bag with my name on it. He laughs and says he understands. As I leave the office I see Tim, and I give him my best impression of his grin that he gave me. The look of horror on his face isn't something ill forget soon.

**Background**
So you know type, classic douchebag, bluetooth headset, suit wearing, businessman (known as DB) who makes slightly more money than the rest of us which adds his narcissistic ego.

**The Story**
So in the morning commute to work I get out of the train go up the stairs to exit the station, normally I have no problems with this. Today however was very different. DB decided to NOT stick to the right side of the stairs which is the side you use to go down, and went on the left. Now normally this would be no problem as someone would just let him go. But I noticed that he had already bumped into 3/4 people in his rush to get the train but not only that he said ""excuse you"" (as sarcastically as he could) to every single one, including a little kid around 5/6 years old and the cherry on top was instead of paying attention he was busy talking on his bluetooth and overall ignoring everyone.

**Revenge**
So instead of letting him go down and catch his train on time I decided to play a game of chicken, we both were walking directly at each other me on the right going up, him on his ~~wrong~~ left (my right) coming down. Of course he too stubborn to move, and I decided that instead of winning I would have some fun, I slowed down just enough so the rush behind me would catch up and then I bumped into DB slowing him and forcing him to move into the corner. At this point he was PISSED and he even pushed me out of the way to try to make it to the train but it was already too late, he was trapped by the rush of the people exiting the train. He was stuck waiting (i'm assuming) a good 10 extra minutes while the train emptied and then left without him.

OlderBrotherRevenge,99,,111,14gs28,,537,"Throwaway because my brother has reddit. This is also a long one.


This petty revenge wasn't the result of a single action, but of a long period of frustration that culminated in a perfect opportunity.


I remember being a child going to grade school and high school. Sometimes you just really did not want to go. So yes, I've pulled the ""faking that I'm sick"" card in order to stay home, but I usually felt guilty about it and would only do it 2-3 times a year at most. My younger brother (by ~5 years) however, was less motivated in school than I was and throughout his time at school would try to pull it a few times PER MONTH. Of course, by the time early afternoon comes around, he's playing video games and watching movies while eating ice cream. Now, bless my parents, but after a while they just kind of let my brother get away with it all the time. It was frustrating to me, because I put a lot of effort into school, and they were a little harder on me than they were with him. I would have multiple talks with my parents on these mornings where he'd be belly-aching and moaning and ""UUUMMMFFGHH I feel awwwful""-ing, but they would just say ""I don't have the energy to deal with him today."" It got to the point where it was laughable; I didn't think someone could have that many fevers, that many colds, or that many migraines that often.


Anyways, by the time I was in university and still living at home, my brother's frequent ""ailments"" were just a part of life. That does not mean I grew placated by it; quite the opposite. The longer it went on, the more incensed by it I became. The main frustration for me was that my brother was completely taking advantage of my parents, and my parents were LETTING him take advantage of them. I would see their looks of exasperation often during these ""sick"" mornings, and it would irk me to no end.


By the time the petty revenge (justice?) gets into play, My brother is in grade 12 and is 17 years old, and still faking sick several times a month. My parents were going away on a huge anniversary vacation to Europe, and being that I was the oldest child still living at my parent's house, I was put in charge of getting my younger brother to school and watching over him. I was his ""legal guardian"" for the three weeks my parents were away. And as his legal guardian, I was going to make sure that he went to school every single day unless one of his limbs were cut off.


So it's early September, the start of the school year, and my parents leave for Europe. My younger brother starts his senior year of high school, everything is fine. Until...


The SECOND DAY OF SCHOOL, I go down to his room to wake him up, and up starts the moaning. ""Ohhhummpphhh OlderBrotherRevenge, I'm so sick. I have such a bad cold *fakeasshitcough* I need to stay home"". Are you kidding me? The second day of school, you are going to pull that shit with me? I was enraged, but this was also my chance to finally be able to directly address this issue as I couldn't address it before. My rage was building up for 7 years for this moment. Never did I realize that it would work out so perfectly.


I calmly let him know that he was, in fact, going to be attending school that day, whether he was sick or not. He IMMEDIATELY became indignant, arguing with me about his body's failings and the recuperative measures that needed to take place. After about 15 minutes of debates, I gave him an ultimatum: either go to school, or we're going to the hospital.


""Fine, let's go to the hospital!"" he said, trying to call my bluff in a move of desperation.


My nostrils flared with excitement. I had nothing to do that morning. ""Get your coat.""


With glee, I drove him the 20 minute drive to the hospital, and checked him into the ER, the entire time with him bitching to me about how unnecessary this was and how he just needed to rest. I said that since he was sick quite often, we needed a doctor to check him out as I was worried about his overall health. Fuming, he waited with me in the waiting room for about an hour and a half before being called into triage, where he gave a laughable account of his state of health. The nurse looked at me with a smirk, as though she knew what I was up to, and I was reveling in the moment.


After another 30 minutes of waiting, we finally get into the ER. My younger brother is still complaining up a storm. The nurse comes by and does the pre-check, asking him to cough, pressing down on pressure points on his body. By the end of the assessment, the nurse is pretty confused as he's found nothing wrong with my brother yet (""How surprising!"" I thought), so he goes to get the doctor. When the doctor comes, he's as well perplexed by the lack of noticeable signs of concern. Since there's nothing noticeable that the doctor can see, he decides that everything is necessary. He orders a blood test, a urine sample, and a CAT-scan for my brother. 


My brother hates needles. He turned white when the doctor said that. I was over the moon.


The nurse returns with the syringe for the blood test, and my brother squirms back on the hospital bed in a feeble attempt to get away. The nurse scolds him, and tells him to man-up. My brother's face was still completely white and he had to look away, so I was giving him small encouraging remarks that would get him through this. My brother is not impressed, and I can see in his eyes and his body language that he's regretting the decision he made to go to the hospital and to pretend to be sick that day.


Next, the nurse leaves and returns to give my brother a cup to pee into, and instructs him to the bathroom. With a smirk, my brother says that he doesn't need to pee, so he won't be able to do the urine test. He thinks he won that round. The nurse looks at him and says, ""Well okay, but if you don't pee into this cup, I'm going to have to insert a catheter into your urethra."" It took me every fibre in my being to not burst out laughing at my brother's expense at that little quip. I am pretty sure I was visibly shaking with internal laughter. My brother's face dropped faster than a boulder rolling down a hill, and he grumpily asked where ""the damn bathroom was.""


When he returns, he gets set up for his CAT-scan (I couldn't believe they gave him a CAT-scan, it was like icing on the cake), so I just chill out with my book and read while he takes the 45 minute journey to the underbelly of the hospital. When he returns, we wait another 30 or so minutes with his impatient (still pretending to be sick) moaning at all times, until the doctor comes up to us and basically says that my brother is fine and he's not sure why he's there. Smiling, I thank him for his time, exclaim how happy I was that my brother was not in any mortal, and lead my brother out of the hospital. We've been there for roughly 4 hours, and on the way home my brother makes a comment saying ""Ooooh, I'm going to take a nice bath and then a good nap when we get home."" This boy thought he was in the clear.


""Oh, what? Didn't you hear the doctor? You're fine. By my reckon it's your lunchtime now. You're going home, putting on your uniform, and going to school for your final two periods.""


He was LIVID. Swore up a storm, gave me as many insults as he could muster, and said my parents wouldn't approve of this to try and get me to change my mind. I replied, ""They may not approve, but they aren't home for another 3 weeks. I am."" After that, he sullenly sank into his seat and didn't talk unless it was to insult me.


We went home, he got dressed, and I drove him to school. And because I'm a nice brother, I went into the attendance office to let them know that he was in the hospital all morning and that if he got a detention because of it they would be hearing from me. Told him I love him, he discretely shot me the finger, and I went home.


One of the most satisfying mornings of my life.



*Note: We live in Canada, so we have universal healthcare and didn't pay for the hospital trip. Was it a waste of taxpayers money? Yes. Will there be people who chew me out on this? Yes, but sorry; I needed to teach my brother a lesson.*

*Note 2: My parents (and my extended family) thought it was hilarious and approved of my actions, as they were just as frustrated with him.*

**TL;DR: Younger brother pretended to be sick way too many times in life; parents went on a vacation and put me in charge; when he tried pulling that shit with me  I took him to hospital where he got a blood/urine test and a CAT-scan; after being checked out and being given the all-clear, I dropped him off at school.**","Cry wolf long enough, and you're going to get bit.",648,pettyrevenge

So when I was a little girl, around 3-4 I had a cousin that was just the meanest entity to ever become human. We are the same age, however she would always try to get me in trouble and one day on a fine Christmas evening she decided to lie to all the adults and tell them that both of my older brothers called her a swear, and they got in trouble. 

So what did I do, trip her no too easy, tell on her the adults would never listen. No as soon as we had the Christmas cake, it had little toys in it so I asked my dearest grandmother if I can please have the toys on the cake, of course she wanted it but grandmother favored me over her. That's not the revenge.

I decided to play with Santa and his reindeer in the swimming pool aka the toilet, so I stuck them in the toilet and flushed the toilet multiple times until it flooded. (Sorry Santa) I promptly walk out of the bathroom and to the dining room with the adults and act like nothing happened. 

Then I hear my sweet grandmother yell from the kitchen so I run to see if she needs help. She asks me in a serious tone what happened to the bathroom as it was flooded with a Christmas miracle, I say I do not know looking her dead in the eye, and explain that my cousin stole my toys and locked herself in the bathroom and flushed my reindeer down the toilet making me cry. 

I get extra dessert while she gets yelled at and cries sweet tears of joy for me. I smiled at her and she knew, however the adults would have nothing of it and she got in even more trouble for slandering sweet little me. My brothers never knew.

This morning however, I told him the time was 7:04 (which it was), my mother then comes down stairs a few minutes later to say it's 7:10, time for him to get out of bed. Apparently this is unacceptable, someone has been lying to him and he is going to shout about it. How did he know you ask? He had been counting in his head.

I'm sitting there at this point almost ready to leave, unable to believe how this specimen is related to me. What was my revenge you ask? I set the clock forward by 10 minutes while he was in the shower. My brother hates waiting in the bus stop almost as much as he hates getting out of bed.

emotionalbanshee,143,,175,1ka2gf,,533,"So, I learned to do make-up as a hobby. As a solo hobby, it's expensive. As a profession it's even pricier, so I charge people enough to cover my kit and have some left over. It's not exorbitant, and definitely the cheapest of services a bride pays for, and yet this bridezilla decides to argue and haggle with me over my prices (im not selling veggies at the farmers market here) and accuse me of stealing from her (bitch you want to do it yourself?? Go ahead) because she booked me last minute.

Alone, her shit attitude is bearable. She IS a bride after all. Except she crticizes every single product I use ($1000+ kit here, I ain't using cheap shit) and every thing I put on her face requires a 7 minute mirror inspection complete with bitchy criticism. Except when I offer to do it differently she just huffs and says ""I don't have time to fix every little mistake, just hurry up!""

Bitch you're fucked.

Photoshoot makeup is a fine art, I can fuck up her pictures easily without her realizing how hideous she will look. But that won't be enough because her photographer will probably edit her to look nicer so I need to fuck her up so she will notice.

My trump card? It's an outdoor wedding, and its a super sunny, humid day. Normally I'd waterproof her makeup and apply it carefully so it won't melt. Today? I slapped it on and made sureto use stuff that I know runs very easily (I have non waterproof for those who are allergic or just prefer it).

Her photos will need more editing(stuff I used on her will make her face glow white cause of all the sunscreen in it) and it will barely hold for two hours in that weather.

As far as I'm concerned I don't care if she reviews me badly. I do this for fun and as a favor to friends, it's not my bread and butter. I hope she looked half as melted as I planned her to look. 

Tl;dr: Don't piss off your makeup artist on your wedding day.

(she was having the photos taken before the wedding because of how hot it was outside, she wanted everyone to look their best before the weather wilted their hair and clothes)

Edit: people are taking runny concealer way too seriously. Her photos, if edited more than usual will still turn out fine (if she hired an actual legit service) they will just cost slightly more. Her makeup would hold enough for the 'I do, k thx let's eat' but it inconveniences her by forcing her to check on it every so often. At WORST I created a minor frustration, hence why I'm posting in PETTY revenge. A wedding doesn't explode because your eyeliner moved a bit.

NotEconomicallyViabl,32,,113,1cc2gw,,530,"My SO and I had to move to a different city for a few months because of her job. Since apartment rentals are too expensive in that area, we decided to venture into renting a house for the first time. They are first-time landlords, which already raised some red-flags for me, but my SO was determined into saving money and these landlords were willing to do a 6-month contract.

Before we moved in, we were told they were going to install a dishwasher and let us use the garage shed and take care of the yard. Now we know to always get these things on writing, since that ended up not happening. Basically, everything they did was half-assed. They lived about an hour away and told us to piss off after we asked about thinks they promised to take care of.

And then the mice problem started. They ate through a collector's item backpack that I had and tore some of labels from vintage wines that we had. They got into our cabinets and it was just hell! We basically did not eat at home because we were so disgusted. I called them, and called them about the mice problem, but to no avail. They simply told us to get some poison and put it around the house. Well, according to our state laws, that's THEIR responsibility. We say that and they basically tell us to piss off again and just put poison all around.

So, revenge mode ON!

The mice problem started about a month or two before we moved out and they were trying to get it rented out as soon as we left. So, every time they asked to enter the house to show it off to potential renters, we would leave the mice traps and mice poison EVERYWHERE and in plain sight. You had to step over them to get into the living room, bedrooms, etc. 

But the real treat came as we said goodbye to that house. We took granola bars (which we determined was the mice favorite treats, since they ate through our supply) and dropped them all over the vents and basement. A few months supply for them.

Hope you enjoy your new tenants. Except they pay no rent! Mwahaha",Not so mice revenge on crappy landlords,643,pettyrevenge
[deleted],39,,103,1bd6f4,,536,"This was all my fault. I'm the guilty party here and I deserved the revenge. When I was out shopping, I bought a couple tins of a different brand of cat food. It was 35 cents less expensive than his regular brand and I am as cheap as the day is long.

So in the morning I fed the cat the new brand of tinned cat food. He sniffed at it. He stood there and stared at it in disbelief. Then he stared at me. It was a look that clearly said, ""This is shit, you cheap fucking bastard."" He flicked his tail with undisguised contempt and stalked away.

A short while later I was having coffee and reading the newspaper. The cat was busy grooming himself thoroughly, and seemed to spend an inordinate amount of attention on his feline posterior. I raised an eyebrow and gave him a slightly disapproving look (do that in private, cat!), and went back to reading the newspaper.

A few moments later I heard a quiet *thwip thwip thwip* sound. I paused, newspaper in hand, and listened. *thwip thwip twip...* I looked to the sides - nothing. Then I folded the newspaper and beheld my furry little friend, on the table, drinking my coffee. With the pink little tongue that had just spent so much time lovingly cleansing his puckered little butthole. 

He noticed me looking at him and licked his lips and stared right back at me. Then he jumped down, looked at his food, looked at me, looked at the coffee cup, and walked away flicking his tail.

alchemy_index,42,,110,1jrom7,,533,"Last winter, I posted a for sale ad on Craigslist for an acoustic guitar. It was a decent guitar, nothing special... not high end but not horrible. Of course, I got a few low ball offers which I promptly ignored, except for one. This guy sent me, a complete stranger, an email about how my guitar was a piece of crap, and how that I must be a ""noob"" to guitars if I thought I would get close to my asking price ($400) for it. He offered me $100 or something to ""take it off my hands"". 

This guy was acting like such a condescending, know-it-all, asshole, I decided to play along. I told him something like ""you're right. How about $125"". I told him that I worked at UPS as a late night loader and that my shift ended at 2AM, and that I could meet him at this public parking lot by 3AM at the latest. He wasn't too happy about that (has to be at work at 8AM or whatever, blah blah), but he agreed, probably because he knew that he was getting a $400+ guitar for $125. We exchange cell phone numbers and what type of car we'd be in and agree to meet.

2AM comes. I text him ""leaving work now, will be there by 3 for sure"".
3AM comes. He texts me saying that he's there, and asking where I was. I don't respond. He texts me a few more times.
3:15AM - I text him ""sorry, had a last minute truck arrive, will be there in a few minutes"". He replies that he's been waiting there for half an hour, and to hurry up.
3:16AM - I call the authorities and tell them that there's a really suspicious car (gave car description) in ____ parking lot. They say they'll check it out.
3:45AM - He texts me saying that the police just searched his car, and ""where the fuck"" was I?!
3:46AM - I text him back saying ""sorry. decided it wasn't worth it to meet up this late in the freezing cold for $125.""

I then block his cell phone number (I gave him my Google Voice number) and send all his emails to immediately delete. I never sold the guitar, I ended up giving it to my brother as a gift instead.

atombomb1945,38,,83,1fo74k,,528,"Back in Highschool I worked for a once well known, now going bankrupt Video Store that was decked out in a Blue and Yellow color scheme.  I would constantly get parents coming in to rent movies and their little kids eyeing the candy in front of them.  Inevitably, the question would be asked ""Mommy, can we have some candy?""  And most of the time, the parents would just say no, or say that dinner was waiting at home, or any of the other things that parents tell their kids.  

But then, every so often, I would get the parent who would look at their kid, then look up at me and say ""Aww, I would like to get you some candy, but the mean man behind the counter won't let us get any.""  Said in a whiny and crybaby tone.  So, I decided to get my revenge the best way I could.  By turning the tables.

Mommy looks at them, then at me, winks and says ""Well, I would, but he (pointing a finger at me in a way that old time Baptist Preachers would point out siners) said you can't have any.""  I look down and see a flood of tears from the kids, and a smurk of joy from the mother.  I smile, then frown, and say ""Aww heck, I can't do that too cute kids like you.

I like to go to sleep fairly early for a college student (around 11 PM or so), and my roommate goes to bed who knows when. This wouldn't be a problem if he just quietly did his homework or listened to his music through headphones. This is the opposite of what he does.

He likes to keep the room light on and loudly play the same Spotify playlist on repeat of about 6 songs exclusively taken from Madden NFL video game soundtracks. He also sings along. 

Every night I wake up to this and, as nicely as possible, ask him to use his desk lamp and headphones. He always does at first, but about 15 minutes later the light comes back on and the headphones come unplugged. I don't understand. I tried talking to him about it during the day, but he was unapologetic. 

Two nights ago I decided I'd had enough. He didn't have a morning class the next day, and I had to get up at 7 for my morning class. I set my alarm for six thirty and fought through the noise for the last time.

When I got up, I opened my laptop and played [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2EGKt8yONI) (which I actually happen to enjoy) at full volume. Needless to say, he wakes up very confused.

The_Ninja_Hamster,25,,117,1jwdq4,,533,"Sorry for the long post. First time poster, yadda yadda yadda.

I work in the travel section at an international organization with many staff members who travel quite frequently. We are quite busy, but well organized, and so are able to deal pretty well with last-minute rush requests for various travel documents.

Enter staff member (Rude Bastard, or RB) with a history in our office of being difficult (not following instructions, submitting the wrong forms, rude to anyone below his level, never having *anything* prepared on time, etc).


Me: What can I do for you today sir?

RB: I need my (old Travel Document) renewed urgently because I'm traveling soon.

Me: Sir, we no longer renew (old Travel Documents) here at Derp Organization; since September of last year we have been issuing only (new and much-more-secure Travel Documents) that meet the stricter requirements of many countries around the world.

RB: What? Why wasn't I notified of this?!

Me: A memo was sent out to all the heads of the departments of Derp Organization in July of last year sir, and again once the change took effect in September.

RB: Fine! Just tell me what I need to do to get a (new Travel Document)!


I tell him the process of applying for a (new Travel Document), all while his grumbling continues, calling our office a circus and unprofessional. My coworkers and I can hear everything, and are getting a bit annoyed to say the least.

Time comes when the (new Travel Documents) are almost all finished...except for the new photo everyone has to take, as per the new stricter requirements.


Me: Ok, now that this is all done, head over there to have that gentleman take your photo.

RB: What? Why? I have this photo from my (old Travel Document) and it's still good! Why can't you just use this one?

Me: We cannot sir; the (new Travel Documents) requirements state that the photo must be under 6 months old. We provide this service free of charge over there by that gentleman.

RB: Well I can't have my photo taken like this! I don't have a tie on! I would look unprofessional! If I had known I needed a new photo I would never have come to work without a tie!

Me: (declining to mention to RB that the requirements for the new Travel Documents are CLEARLY posted on our intra-net, and ignoring the bait of responding to what was OBVIOUSLY my fault for not informing him of the changes last year) That's ok sir, other staff take photos without ties on all the time.

RB: No! I'll come back tomorrow!

Me: ....thinking to myself (what happened to this being urgent?)


So RB comes back the next day, wearing his most magnificent thousands-of-dollars-suit (yeah, right) and tie, hair slicked back, the whole nine yards, and takes the photo.

Unbeknownst to RB, I am not just someone who works the front office collecting applications and helping staff members.....I am actually in charge of creating the (new Travel Documents).

Time comes to upload the photo to our software program, and guess what happens?

Oops, looks like our ""software"" ""automatically"" cropped the photo, cutting off your glorious suit and tie, thereby leaving you looking like only a floating head on the (new Travel Documents). Which are valid for 5 years. Asswipe.

We were in History class, and some guy is the centre of attention cracking jokes, everyone is loving him. I know that all these jokes are from one of Billy Connolly's DVDs, but it's apparent no one else does. Fine with me, but he keeps going, and keeps taking credit for the jokes. I casually mention to the girl sitting next to me that actually a comedian named Billy Connolly came up with these jokes, and shit goes down. Her immediate reaction was 
"" Shut up tobootandthensome, you're not funny""
She then told everyone that I lied about the guy stealing all these jokes, I'm pretty beta at this stage, and this guy is rather popular. So it gets round that I was for some reason jealous of this guy, and therefore tried to tarnish his relationship, pretty embarrassing sitting there with everyone in the class talking shit about you.

My revenge? The next day was movie day, in Hitory class. I of course brought in this Billy Connolly DVD, can't remember which one, we have a bunch and this was like 8 years ago. The teacher put it on, with a smirk, and I sat there giddy as fuck. What then happened was Billy Connolly repeating, virtually word for word what this kid had been saying the day before.

Enter one day, when there's a Caddilac XLR convertible. I've never seen one of these in person before, and it's gorgeous.

It is also, however, parked diagonally across two spots. The two spots adjacent to those are unoccupied, and if there's one thing I absolutely hate, it's dickbags who don't know how to park. Taking up multiple spots, parking too close to the lines, etc... you know the type.

Well, as soon as I see this car, I park my wagon right up next to it. I fold my mirror in and get my car about three inches from his (if that) and crawl out the passenger side.

Knowing that he could just crawl *in* from the passenger side, I went in to my mom's office, explained the guy's parking and asked for her keys. She obliged.

So I get her car too and park it on the other side of this Caddy. Again, just a few inches. I crawl out and call it good.

I didn't have anything to do that day so I decided to sit and wait. I messed around in her office for a bit, browsed the internet, whatever. Then I heard yelling. I walked over to the door, looked out, and a fat, middle-aged man is yelling because he can't get to, nevermind open, the doors on his Caddy.

He sat there yelling and steaming for a few minutes until he stormed off somewhere, probably back in to his office to make a phone call. I ran outside, got in my mom's car and moved it so the passenger door was now free, but left my car in place. He came out again, realized his car was no longer blocked, unlocked it and I got to watch a fat, middle-aged man crawl across the interior in his $100k Cadillac just so that he could get in and drive off, all because he parked like a dick.

He left a girlfriend (Call her HP for horrible person) home in the house that he owns. A few days ago, the hairstylists husband goes over to visit and sees a man walking around in his underwear. After he knocks on the door a few times, nobody answers, and so he starts yelling through the door. He hears HP's voice through an open window next to the door and so knows she's there. After hearing her, he realizes what is going on. HP is cheating on his son. 

So, enraged, he starts trying to take down the door, leading HP to call the police. My hairstylist also hears of the situation through the neighbors, who like John. She rushes over, and arrives to see the police taking her husband into custody for trying to break in. She goes over to try to stop this, and the cops, who also like John (for the most part), tell her the deal. 

Her husband will have to spend a night at least in the county jail for his actions, as his name is nowhere on the ownership papers for the house, so technically illegal. My hairstylist also is informed that he can't evict HP either, as her name is nowhere on the ownership papers either. Only John can do that, as only his name is listed as owner, and he can only evict in person, which is not feasible until he gets leave. However, the cops give her a clever alternative method of payback. 

The next day, HP receives a call from my hairstylist stating that at 3:00 that afternoon all the locks will be changed on the house, something she can legally do. She then tells her that if she needs back in for any reason, she can ask the hairstylist for entry. This is all technically legal, as she is allowed to modify the house, but can't evict. She isn't, however, denying her entry by allowing her in by asking, so HP has no legal recourse for entry. 

Now, HP is trying to find a place to stay, as her parents are gone and her ""boyfriend"" had no idea she was cheating on someone and so left her cold, so she is pretty much stuck sleeping in her car until she finds another residence.

One night I was working as a csa (customer service assistant) at the front counter while we were in peak. We were packed and for some reason 30 teens decided to all come in at once and order through front shop. I told one of the food preps to chuck some chips down in the fryer so the customers don't have to wait too long for their order. Comes in Bitch who decided to push in front of the teens in line and she didn't even care. I wasn't surprised, considering that the store was placed in one of the worst suburbs in the country. I greeted her polity, but she didn't give a rats ass about greeting me back and what she'd done to the teens. I knew that she was going to be a trouble maker so I called my manager to deal with her (not allowed to argue with the customers otherwise we get fired). She starts to bitch about how she had bad experiences at this store and that she want fresh large chips with no salt and she wants them cooked a little longer.

The bitch starts throwing a tantrum about how the manager is shit and that she should quit and about our shit service, (meanwhile I'm at the back coming up with a revenge plan for the bitch).

shakey_bakey,77,,105,1dgk1z,,517,"So, I work at a bank as a teller. It's the asscrack of dawn when we open our drive through lanes. My manager and I had issues opening up, so we couldn't process transactions. We didn't open until about a half-hour after opening time, which was at 7 am. 

After getting everything sorted, this very nice young lady puts her money in the carrier and sends it to me. She is a very sweet girl, but she is a stripper, and apparently, she just ended her shift. Now, when she gives me her money, I notice that it's a little wrinkled and stinky. I put it aside in my drawer to get rid of later.

She leaves, and after a few minutes, this other woman pulls up. I greet her, and without any provocation, she starts screaming at me.

Her: ""Your sign says that you guys open at 7! I was here at exactly 7! Why weren't you open? I want to speak to a manager!""

It was going to be one of Those days with one of Those customers. My manager is about twenty feet away behind a closed door and she still heard the old woman. She comes over.

Manager: ""Hello, my name is Manager. What can I assist  you with?""

Her: ""You guys weren't open at 7! I was late for work! I waited for an hour for you to open!"" 

First off, no normal person sits in front of a darkened building for an hour, and second, no she was not here at 7:30. I kept checking for people who may have thought we were open, and no one had come by.

Manager: ""We had a few difficulties opening, ma'am. I am very sorry that you were late - ""

Her: ""Why didn't anyone call me to let me know that you were closed?""

Manager: ""Ma'am, we don't call customers if we are unable to open on time. We simply don't have the manpower to call everyone that comes into our branch. Now, what can we help you with today?""

Her: ""I need to make a withdrawal!""

I take out the carrier and put a pen and a withdrawal slip into it. Then I send it to her and ask her to sign and indicate how much she needed. She flips her lid again.

Her: ""Fuck you! I'm not signing shit for you. Other Manager at Other Location just hands me my money.""

The manager and I share a look at her blatant lie. The woman puts her debit card into the carrier and sends it to me. Then she pushes the call button.

Her: ""1234.""

Manager: ""Pardon? I don't understand.""

Her: ""That's my PIN. I want $200 out of my account. I want all small bills.""

I had to step out of sight to literally facepalm. The manage explains that she cannot use her PIN, as bank employees cannot know that kind of information. Woman starts getting combative, arguing that she isn't ""signing shit"" because she doesn't trust us with ""her money"". After a few minutes of polite cajoling from my manager, the woman finally signs the withdrawal slip and sends up her driver license. It's expired. I would have told her that we couldn't accept it, but my manager was so frazzled that she did overrode the notice and told me to get the woman out ASAP.

The petty revenge?

I gave her ALL of the ones and fives that I had gotten from the nice stripper girl. The money smelled like cheap perfume and pot, was covered with glitter, was still kind of moist in certain spots. She left without checking the money. I hope she got that glitter all over her car.


ETA1: For those who asked about the coffee pot guy:

There is an elderly gentleman (though I use that term loosely) who comes in every single day - and I think he loiters on Sundays, because I'll see him in the bank parking lot when I'm grocery shopping.

We have this really cool coffee pot that plugs into a base. When it's plugged in, it heats up the coffee inside to keep it warm. It's also expensive. Now, we have that on a table right by the door with an assortment of ""fine sugars"" and creamers, as well as cookies and candies. So, he comes in one day, and makes himself a cup of coffee. He normally goes through six or seven cups while he's in the branch, so we don't think it's odd at all.

He takes the entire coffee pot into my managers office with an entire container of creamer. He sits there for an hour, pouring cup after cup of coffee, all while other customers are baffled. We aren't allowed to say no at any point, not even if someone's being an ass. So my manager just continues to talk to him. Finally, after an hour or so, the guy gets up to leave. He walks right by the coffee table thing without stopping.

He has the coffee pot and creamer tucked up snugly into his coat, and as he's trying to leave, my manager goes after him.

Manager: ""Uhm, sir, can we please have our pot back?""

Man: ""What pot?""

Manager: *points at coffee pot*

Man: ""Oh."" 

Manager: ""You can come by and have as much coffee as you'd like...we do want to keep coffee on hand for our customers...""

Man: ""Oh.""

My manager puts the coffee back on the table, but we didn't notice that the creamer was gone until a customer had asked for it. :-\",Cuss me out and act like an idiot in public? That's fine...,622,pettyrevenge

This is another golf post, so I'll try to include translations for those of you who are not familiar with golf lingo (heathens!)

I was out golfing today, because fuck yeah, summer. I was on the green putting with my group. I was lining up to putt for birdie (a good score ona hole, one under par), when I hear a golf ball land close. Very close. Like, 3 feet away close. That would have hurt, and the guy who hit it didn't even yell ""FORE"" (to warn other golfers that a small white projectile might be heading their way). The golf ball rolled down a small embankment and into a sand trap next to the green. 

Whatever. Shit happens. Then the guy shows up, decked head to toe in LaCoste gear, chewing a massive wad of gum and wearing jersey shore type sunglasses. My buddy is about to putt, and this guy strolls up to the edge of the green, and just yells out ""EY. I HIT A BALL THIS WAY. WHERE IS IT?"" right in the middle of my friends backswing (a big no-no in golf etiquette.) No apology, refusing to wait until the player playing has hit his shot, and demanding to know where his ball was. Like we're gonna help you.

""Yeah, it went into those trees over there."" I say, pointing at a thick copse of trees about 40 yards to the right of where we're standing. Long grass, not a lot of room to move, and plenty of thistle bushes.

Assholio turns on his heel and stalks off towards the trees and starts rooting around in them for his ball. I hear the occasional ""fuck!"" and ""ow!"" coming from his general direction, prresumably when he jabs himself on some thistle.

While he's rooting around in there, I casually stroll over to the bunker (sand trap) and pick up his ball. It's a Titleist ProV1 (the priciest golf ball you can find, that skilled golfers use to play good, and that shitty golfers use to look good.) I pocket the ball and proceed on my merry way to the joyous cacophony of cursing from the trees and thistle.

I used that ball for the rest of the round, and am debating keeping it for posterity's sake.","You almost hit me, and then expect me to help you?",631,pettyrevenge

The_Quantum_Raptor,55,,155,1kol3h,,520,"There's this small cafeteria on campus near where I work that I go to frequently for lunch. This particular day I happened to bring a lunch from home but was stupid and forgot cutlery. No problem, I thought, I'll just pop in the cafeteria and grab a plastic spoon and fork. 

So I head to the cafeteria, grab the spoon and fork, and just about to leave when I get stopped at the exit by a woman in her late 40's. She asks me if I bought anything to which I say ""no, just need some cutlery for lunch"". She then sternly  tells me that I can't take the spoon and fork because I didn't get anything, unless I pay for them. Now at first, I thought she was joking so I kind of laughed and tried to play it off as a joke since I'd done this multiple times in the past without any problems. 

She doesn't take kindly to my laughing, however, and starts to get angry with me telling me to either pay for them or get out. I asked how much they were (it was something like 10 cents) but I had literally no change. After some more discussion, it became clear I wasn't leaving with the cutlery. I was frustrated at this point and I was just getting ready to leave when I said ""guess I'm not having lunch then today"". I started fuming when she responded in the most smug and bitchy way possible ""Yeah, I guess not"". 

This is where I got my revenge. Without breaking eye contact, I started rubbing my hands all over the eating end of the fork and spoon getting them all good and sweaty knowing that she would have to throw them out when I left. I confidently dropped them on the table in front of her and walked out without saying anything. Best 10 cents I never spent.

As a sidenote, I've gone back since and everytime I buy something I take about 5 plastic forks. Got a whole drawer filled with them now, which I probably will never use, just to get back at this one woman. ","If I can't have them, no one can",675,pettyrevenge
nummnutz,41,,117,1amcbz,,520,"I had been travelling with my family to the Dominican Republic for a week of sun and rum.  While the rest of my family was going to head home to NYC after the flight, I had to take everything with me for my flight home to the west coast and had a 25-30lb bag of records (will be important later)

sgt_roflman,72,,111,1aga6l,,517,"(Ex-Post from r/TalesfromRetail)

I generally work the Sunday shift at my poorly managed bookstore, and being a Sunday; the bank is closed.
This means I'm stuck with whatever change was left in the til from Saturdays shift. Which shouldn't be a problem as there is $250 in various notes and coins except for the $50 customers.
Now the $50 customers don't actually spend $50, they spend less than $10 and pay with a $50 note, which quickly eats up all the change and leaves me with several $50's and no way to give customers change until the lunch shift where I would have to find another business who will exchange my 50's for change.
After the same customers coming in with the exact same habits several weekends in a row I decided to start asking them if they had any smaller change. They never did, which was quite frustrating.
So I got my co-worker to prepare one weekend, before the end of his shift on Saturday he got $150 of the til changed into $1 coins. Come Sunday morning the same customers came in at various times, picked up their $3-$7 items and handed me the fifty. Keeping my 'friendly customer service smile' I would count out the correct amount of change in $1 coins and happily hand them their mound of change with their receipt and do my best to hold eye contact with their state of surprise upon receiving the pile of coins.
The next weekend they all had smaller change and have ever since. The regulars do anyway, I still get the occasional random $50 customer.",The change game,628,pettyrevenge
Kings-of-bunny,60,,105,1a0od4,,515,"This happened on the Friday just gone, and since I've been lurking here for a while, I thought I'd share my petty revenge story.

I work in a an accounts department. Contrary to popular belief we aren't completely socially inept, in fact the whole team is quite the opposite. We aren't Loud or unprofessional, but we do love a bit of banter and a giggle. 

All accept one person, who I'll call 'the shrew' (because he looks like one)
He has always been a hard working, motivated and efficient employee like everyone else, except he is the most selfish, self absorbed prick I've ever met.
Day in day out he criticises people because of their lack of expensive/sought after belongings, and if you do have something new, rest assured he'll go and buy himself a better version of what you have and boast about it. He's one if those guys.

Anyway, the story...

My wheely chair sadly passed away, it had been with me since my 1st day almost 4 years ago, so I needed a new one. I was presented with this space-aged one, with more padding, moulded to perfection, just a generally funky chair. Shrew didn't like this. So Shrew took it upon himself to find me 'a better one'. I came back from lunch to find him leaning back in my new chair, whilst he put his old one at my desk

""I've given you the privilege of sitting in a chair I once sat in, no thank yous are necessary"" and he spun round and tapped away merrily. 
Prick. Pricky pricking PRICK!!

So once he left his desk, I proceeded to take one of the little legs off of the keyboard so it would wobble. Knowing he would slide himself backwards to the desk behind him to complain to IT his keyboard was unstable, I also locked two of his wheels on the chair, and took the sliders off, so they couldn't be unlocked.

And then I played the waiting game. It only took 2 minutes for him to sit back down and throw a hissy fit, and shout behind him at IT that they MUST give him a new keyboard. When he didn't get a reply, he pushed backwards from his desk, only for the wheels to lock and send him flying off the back of the chair. During the tumble he managed to  pull off some of the arm padding, leaving a bear metal armrest in its place. He got up, red faced, and told me to give him his old chair back. 

I have him the biggest shit eating grin and said 'my old one is just over there, I wouldn't usually give anyone the privilege of sitting in it, but because it's you...' And gave him a wink.
And as a bonus, because he can't unlock the brakes, he has to put 10x the amount of effort in the wheeling to his destination.
This has absolutely made my week :)

tongue_tiedx,33,,92,1mfvfn,,521,"First post/long time reader yada yada.   

A little backstory/info: I work front desk at a hotel.  Our hotel has two buildings, they are both the same but one is the main building where breakfast/lobby/coffee, etc. are.   We are a relatively small hotel so we don't offer full service amenities (24 hour maintenance/laundry/housekeeping, etc.)  So from 6 pm-8 am, there is just one person at the desk. 

 
Late one night it's raining and a woman walks in/half struggles with three big bags.  I greet her and she kind of just looks at me.  So I ask, ""checking in?”


In a very snarky tone, ""Obviously.""  Ok, sometimes people come in asking what time X closes or where Y is or other generic questions, but I let it slide because it’s not a huge deal.  I ask for her name and as I'm about to check her in she decides she needs to make a phone call right then and there.  I ask for an ID and credit card and she holds up the 'one minute' sign with her finger accompanied with a loving glare to me. 


Sadly there was no one around so I couldn't do anything but wait.  However her conversation was brief (she had to tell her friend it was raining and unsure about doing some activity tomorrow).  I ask again for her ID and credit card and she sighs and half tosses it at me. 

By this time I'm over her.  I decide to put her in the furthest room from where we are, in the second building and in one of the worst rooms we have (nothing major, just a connecting room facing the street).  I give her info about the hotel and then where her room is.  ""I have to go back out in the rain?! Don't you have a room in this building?""  I had a few rooms left in the main building but told her I unfortunately didn't.  She then wanted help with her bags to her room and I again had to sadly tell her I had no one else on staff.  She just glared and then shuffled back outside in the rain. 


Thirty minutes later I get a call that she wants an extra blanket and pillow.  I smile inwardly and tell her once again, I'm the only one on property so she will have to come to me.  She asked if I could bring it, and usually when it isn't busy I will gladly bring people items, but since I lost any desire to help her, I apologized and said I could not leave the desk.  So she came in ten minutes later, grabbed the blanket without a word and stalked off.  She didn’t have to walk too far since our buildings are 100 feet at most apart, but it was pouring and she definitely got some of it the few times going outside.

Flixdog,69,,91,17g8wr,,520,"I moved into my house four years ago.  It has a garage that opens onto a fairly narrow alley and is directly across from the service entrance of a bar/restaurant.  The bar has two private parking spots abutting the entrance, and people frequently park alongside my fence, also in the alley.  All is well.  Except for the people blocking my garage.  

A few times a month, I would return home to find someone parked (illegally) directly across the alley from my garage, which does not leave enough room for me to actually get in the garage.  I started leaving polite notes, and when I caught people, I asked them to park alongside my fence.  Frequently, the offender was related to the bar: beer truck, grease truck, recycling van, dropping someone off for a shift, picking up a paycheck, and on and on. It quickly became tiresome, and I got sick of arriving home from work to a blocked garage and an entitled asshole saying, ""It was only for a minute!"" when they own two parking spots and can also park twenty feet down the alley and block no one.

I talked to the two managers and the owner, several times.  Their excuses included:

*The bar has been here longer than I have owned my house

*Their two parking spots are reserved for the owner and cannot be used by anyone else

*Sometimes people just need to run in real quick 

*It's probably not even anyone related to the bar

*They will announce at their next staff meeting that people should not block my garage, princess &lt;sneer&gt; &lt;eye roll&gt; 

This goes on for three and a half years, with only short periods of improvement after each discussion with a manager/owner.  I start to twitch every time I round the corner into the alley.  

One day, my bosses' boss asked if I could be on call (on my day off) for an important project.  I was angling for a promotion, so you bet your ass I'm available, sir!  Mid-day, I opened my garage door to take out the trash.  Son. Of. A. Bitch.  I ran to the bar entrance and pounded on the door.  Kitchen dude said the truck did not belong to anyone at the bar.  I paced.  I sweated.  I silently begged my phone not to ring.  I stared at the empty space alongside my fence.  For the very first time, I called a tow truck.

Then I ran inside my house, grabbed a tin of olive oil, and poured about a half cup on the truck's windshield, driver side window and door handle. I felt slightly better.  Five to ten minutes later, the tow truck shows up.  Almost simultaneously, the driver shows up.  It's the fucking bar manager.  He sees the oil and loses his mind.  You bitch, I was only here for a minute, we've been here for decades, why didn't you tell me this was such a problem, on and on.  I calmly dismiss the tow truck driver, give him my widest and craziest smile, and close my garage door.  He's out there for an hour scrubbing olive oil off his bayyyyybeee.

I gathered pretty quickly that she had the wrong number (our clients seem to get new phone numbers every 4 months), so I told him that if he gave me his number (he had called blocked), I would be sure to remove it from our system and he'd never be bothered by us again.

""Well, you called *me*"" he replied condescendingly.  ""*I* shouldn't have to give *you* my number.""  I calmly explain that there are multiple people here making multiple calls over the course of a morning, so we need to identify *which* number we dialed that was incorrect.

When the receptionist gets back, I tell her what happened, and I ask her who she had called that morning.  She wrote out a list, and one by one she crosses off the people who respond to her voicemails, until only one name and number is left.  Not being one to assume anything (especially when editing a client's contact info), she writes a letter to that client's last known address asking if his number has changed, and sure enough, he calls us a few days later to tell us that he had, in fact, changed is number.

hatinonshitheadkids,105,,97,1fz9tz,,520,"Opted for a throwaway since this is a little cruel...only you petty peoples can decide if this was justified!

This is a few years back, supervising a shift at a busy and well known restaurant, we're known for a relaxed family atmosphere but mostly entertained young couples and parties...

This particular day was manic. There was a music festival in town, hot day, a lot of punters out enjoying the atmosphere. Shift running nice and smooth, we got plenty of staff and we're having a good bit of banter with the customers. All good...

Enter a gypsy family, very well known in the community for being trouble makers and extremely well known in our restaurant for trying to get away with petty things (such as not paying for side dishes, desserts, drinks, complaining to get vouchers and generally being rude to our staff and a nuisance to our customers).

The father is 6ft tall, built like a brick shit house, tattooed to the eyeballs and quite literally decked in gold.... he usually leaves all the talking to the mother, a short and snappy cow with cartoon eyebrows and the nastiest false nails and hair extensions I've ever seen. 

On this particular occasion, they bring a selection of their brood. 3 of their bratlings, The youngest is around 4 years old, middle is 7 years old and eldest is early teen and all of them dirty, disrespectful and snot nosed.

We're busy. upstairs, downstairs and outside seating is packed. There's a 15 minute waiting time for tables. These guys walk in, ignoring our host and find a table for themselves. Host goes over and tells them there's a queue and is told to fuck off as their hungry NOW and don't want to wait...

Well, alrighty then. I apologise to those who are waiting and saw it happen but they can see there would be no reasoning with these guys and the moment passes.

Mother comes up and barks her order at me. Throws a £50 note on the counter and walks off. Not a please or thank you in sight. I call over ""Excuse me miss, you forgot your change and your drink glasses"". ""Bring them"" she says without looking back to me. So I do.

About 15 minutes later and the youngest brat is getting bored. He entertains himself by spitting on the table and writing his name with his gob, SCREAMING that he's starving, fighting with his brothers, swearing and the ultimate peeve of any waiter or waitress that has ever lived... *RUNNING AROUND UNSUPERVISED.*

He's going to go one better. He's going up to other customers tables and is **TAKING** food from their plates. Chips, garlic breads, tomatoes, anything he can get his hands on. These guys look around for the terribly embarrassed mother who is sure to be straight behind him to apologise profusely and yank him back to their table.... yet nasty chav momma hasn't even looked up.

Brat then runs behind the counter to the cooking area, we got a 250°c grill, a 150°c griddle, a chip fryer and a bain marie back there and all at a lovely head height for a 4 year old. He pushes staff members out the way to go into the kitchen where we have the ovens and raw meat being prepared, he starts pressing buttons on the oven, dishwasher, glasswash... putting his dirty hands on our lovely clean work tops.

He then runs back into the cooking area where staff have now actually noticed him and are trying to block him away from dangerous areas. He;s trying to push past them, starts kicking them and want's to have his own way. Brat turns away and is now pawing at the cooked food being prepared on the counter top. Topples a chicken salad dish onto himself and then begins eating it off himself, in *tears* because he's so hungry.

I've had enough, I take his wrist and take him back to his mother. She glares at me, then at her son, snatches him up and turns back to her trough. 'Whatever', I think to myself. I know there's nothing I can say to the mother about her son's behaviour. She clearly doesn't care or has the power to stop him. Maybe he'll stay there now since the food has arrived. Shift goes back to normal.

A few minutes later, I'm behind the till and feel something kicking my legs. Yup, it's the brat. I look over to his parents table, they're still engorging themselves. I couldn't believe it. 

Kid starts running around again, this time instead of heading to the kitchen at the left, he heads off to the disabled toilet on the right. I know it has a clunky door that has the tendency to lock itself... so I follow him to make sure he's okay.

When I catch up to him, he's unrolled all the toilet paper and turned the sink on full blast to splash water around the floor.

A scolding is on the tip of my tongue, but when I look into his shit brown eyes and his ""I dare you to tell me off' smug little face... I realise I'm leaning on the door that has a tendency to lock itself and with a triumphant look, I accidentally shut it and accidentally turn the light off. I can already hear the turd screaming but the toilet is right by the music speaker and it's hardly noticeable...

Parents are about to leave 10 minutes later, nasty momma looks around for her youngest spawn. She doesn't seem panicked, she glances back to the restaurant floor and over to the staff. ""Have you seen my son?"" she snaps. They truthfully reply that they haven't, for I have not told them. 

A few of them go to check upstairs, in the kitchen, in the fridge and freezer when one of them walks past the disabled toilet and hears a wailing. Quickly, they get a butterknife to turn the lock from the outside. I'm only watching from afar but I hear the staff member gasp and the hicupping of a child that has spent itself on screeching. He has also pissed himself with terror of being locked in the dark for 10 minutes.

The mother walks over to him, smacks his bottom and turns to leave without another word. And so triumphant was my glee, I began to cry with held back laughter.

superdupermanda,38,,82,15tf57,,513,"This just happened to me an hour ago. 

I'm battling a cold and I ran out of medicine. I stopped off at the drugstore down the street to pick up some supplies (tissues, nasal decongestant, toothbrush). I'm walking down the aisle towards the cold medicine when this harpy and her husband are taking up the whole aisle with their basket full of clearance Christmas wrapping paper. I kindly say to them, ""Excuse me"" so I can squeeze by. Instead, I get twin sneers and sidelong up and down glances and no movement. I say to them again, ""Excuse me, mind if I get by?"" and no response. I know they're ignoring me. Now, my ears are stuffed up so I'm pretty sure I said this somewhat loudly. Instead, they mosey down the aisle towards the cold medicine, blocking my way.

I'm annoyed. All I wanted to do is to run in and out of the store. I overhear the harpy saying she was going to get some cold medicine XYZ. Well fiddle-dee-dee...that was *exactly* what I came to buy. Harpy and her husband split off at the intersection but I still wasn't able to shimmy through the small gap between her ass and the aisle. She blocks off a large portion of the aisle reading medicine packages with her ass and her basket. Seriously, 75% of the aisle is blocked. I quickly turn down the parallel aisle and get to the cold medicine from the opposite direction. Harpy is slowly reading the medicine boxes but the type we both want was right in front of me. There were two boxes left.

I made eye contact with her, smiled, then picked up the last two boxes and left. I could see her realize I had JUST picked up what she was looking for. *YOINK* I see her scrabbling through the racks but haha - those were the last boxes of XYZ bitch!

Bonus petty revenge: I cropdusted her as I left. Tee hee.

Missed opportunity: Sneezing or coughing on her. I was just stuffed up at the time.

We had several regular customers but one in particular was always rude to me (I was the cashier at the front register). She was always very abrupt, never said ""good morning"" back to me when I said it to her, never said please or thank you, I'd be lucky to even get a ""hi"" or ""hello."" 

This customer was a late-middle aged woman. Only a few wrinkles starting to form but she still had some years to go before most would consider her ""old"".""

ShaneL79,33,,101,1b0n99,,508,"When I was 16 years old, my parents felt they could trust me enough to leave town for the summer. They left me some cash to buy groceries and the basics, but they expected me to get a job as well. I didn't mind hard work and they gave me a car (my mom was in a minor accident and was too afraid to drive so I ""inherited"" the car happily at the cost of being her personal chauffeur) so it made it much easier to find a job.

I decided that I wanted to be a delivery driver because I loved my car and driving. I found a job in our local paper and called them immediately. They asked if I could start in the morning. Sure thing I thought and went up there at 7am ready to work. 

The company sold home soda dispensers and the CO2 and syrup cartridges that it used. My job was simple, deliver whatever the customers ordered and collect their payments. The job was for minimum wage but had the bonus of $3 per delivery to motivate drivers to be quicker and more efficient as well as pay for gas.

I had a few minute conversation with the owner and he handed me a stack of 30 orders and had someone help me load my car. I was at the first place by 8am and basically zig-zaged all over town till about 6pm that night. Pretty easy job.

After my day or work I went back to the shop to give the owner the cash I collected - about $700. He hands me $30 for gas and says come back in the morning. That $30 was a little less than a full tank (back then at least). 

The next morning I arrived and get another 30 orders, loaded my car, then asked when I was going to get paid. The owner said he already paid me for the prior day. I thought he was joking, but asked again just to make sure. He said I made 10 deliveries at $3 each and he paid me $30. I explained what he told me the previous morning and he denied having ever said that. Fuck that I thought. Then he was called out to their warehouse while I waited in his office. 

While I was waiting I realized something very very important. Through every talk we've had I only told him my first name. He never got any information from me whatsoever. In other words there was no record of me at their company.

I walked out to my car, on the way out the owner said he needed me to take another CO2 cartridge to a guy I delivered to yesterday. No problem, I said to him. Smiled and left.

I made the first few deliveries and collected payment. It was enough to cover my previous and current days of work and a little extra. I then continued making the deliveries but told every customer I visited that the company was going out of business and that the company was giving them their last order for free as an apology. Everyone was so nice and felt bad that I was losing my job that they tipped me quite well from the money they were expecting to spend on their order. 

I never went back to the shop. They never called me for their money because they didn't know who I was. A few months later they did shut down and I had a much better summer job.

**TL;DR - Company I worked for wouldn't pay me what I was owed. They didn't have my information so I made the money I was owed and then some on their dime.**

So my brother thought it would be a good idea to go under my bed in the middle of the night, and make weird noises to freak me the fuck out, then pop up and scare the living jeebus out of me.



I waited about 3 weeks, but it was worth it. He recently watched a creepypasta called ""Abandoned by Disney"", and whenever he finds a good scare like this story, he tells me to listen to it.

Bad idea.


The video has a creepy piano song in the intro of the video, which i use to scare him.

I sneaked into his room at around 2:30 AM and put a large mickey mouse head on his chair and an LED flashlight shining underneath it while he is still sleeping. I also put my phone behind the chair and set the creepy song to play 20 seconds after i leave his room.


The song plays. I hear him slowly wake up and realize he is being watched by a large mickey mouse head in the dark with a flashlight shining below it with the extremely creepy music playing behind it


He IMMEDIATELY darts for the door (which i left open) for him to run into the kitched (also dark) for him to see a dark figure stand about 15 feet in front of him (me) wearing a scythe (plastic one i had from 5 halloweens ago). He then freaks the fuck out and sprints for the guest room down the hall and locks himself in the room while crying his eyes out, until i can coax him into coming out

I really enjoyed working there, especially since the store I worked at was located in a college town, with many drunk women taking pictures of things they would (or would not) regret the next day. One day, a sorority chick came in while talking on her phone and slammed a roll of film onto the counter. She continued with her conversation and would not stop to tell me what she wanted. That got her irritated and began to gave me looks that seemed to say ""well, aren't you going to do your job?"" I just continued to stand there until she was done with her phone call. She finally hung up and at that point, I asked her how I could help her. She was already irritated with me for not being able to read her mind and know what she wanted, so because of that, she felt the need to be rude with me. She would talk down to me as if I did not know how to do my job. Although she had pissed me off enough to make me want to say something, I kept my composure and continued to remain professional. I began to process her roll of film and printed them all out. Now, at that time, Walgreen's had not switched over from the Kodak machine to the newer digital Fuji machines, so we would have to review the pictures to make sure that all the prints were fine. I began to look through the pictures and the first half of the roll was nothing but sorority party pictures. Nothing out of the ordinary. Until I got to the second half of the roll. In that half of the roll, I see this sorority chick doing some things that would go on the NSFW_gif subreddit. So, I decide to put those pictures in the very front, so when she would open the envelope, they would be the first prints she sees. My plan was nice and simple, but got even better when Ms. Sorority chick arrived with a friend to pick up the pictures. I hand her the envelope, and she then hands them over to her friend, while she paid for the pictures. As soon as the pictures were paid, the friend opened up the envelope, pulled out the pictures and let out a gasp, which made Ms. Sorority chick turn to look at her friend. The friend then showed Ms. Sorority chick the pictures of her extra-curricular activities and the face that Ms. Sorority chick made was priceless. She grabbed the pictures, stuck them back into the envelope and practically ran out of the store with the friend right behind her.

After a couple of weeks of spending every penny we found on gumballs, something miraculous happened: pennies were no longer required! With a simple turn of the knob, one marble-sized gumball came out of the machine. Though we had free access to gumballs, we only ate a couple each day.

One day, my cousin came over to play. We fired up the sega genesis and were having a great time. ""Do you want a gumball?"" ""Yeah,"" he replied. I walked over to the gumball machine in my parents room and turned the knob twice. I went back to the bedroom and told him about our gumball machine.

keenedge422,38,,95,1jm9te,,514,"**Background:**  
So in my early college days, I hung out with a group of wild, hard-drinking guys I'd known since grade school and, being the most rational member of the group, often had to step in as the voice of reason for their wilder plans (something they were very grateful for because it kept them from serious injury or jail... usually.) In that capacity, I'd grown very accustomed to them asking whether [insert horrible idea] was a good idea or not.

**Offense:**  
So one day I showed up to the apartment of two of them and found them sitting at the table clearly agitated. When I asked them what had happened, they explained that some guy had been over the previous night and taken a crap in their shower. I laughed, saying he must have been seriously drunk, and they said ""no, he was sober. He just thought it'd be hilarious."" They'd called him out on it the following morning and he'd just laughed, said it was a ""joke"" and refused to come clean it up or even apologize. They were clearly in revenge mode, but I talked them out of doing anything rash because, while the guy was clearly a prick, they were going to overshoot it on the revenge and do something like light his car on fire. Bad juju. Anyway, we moved on and it wasn't mentioned again until a couple weeks later, we're hanging out again and someone is clicking around on facebook and suddenly stands up in shock. We come over to see what he's looking at, only to find he's just received a ""bring your friends"" party invite from the shower pooper to christen his new apartment. They all stood there silently for a second, then turned to me, eyes begging.  
""Get in the car.""

**Revenge:**  
We get to the party and mill around for a little while and I'm starting to think better of them doing anything foul to this guy's place until he suddenly says ""Hey guys, remember when I took a shit in your shower? That shit was hilarious!"" Nope, screw him, he's earning this. The three guys with me at the time finally make their move and line up to use the main bathroom in the place. The first guy goes in and upperdecks the toilet; always a classic. The second went in and plugged the sink, pissed in it, then knocked the guy's toothbrush into it. The third guy went in and was in there for a while, then comes out grinning from ear to ear and says ""ok, we gotta go... now.""  
We get out to the car and start driving away and he starts laughing hysterically. Turns out when he went in there, he was looking for something to do and noticed that the floor air vent wasn't screwed down. He had taken the cover off and crapped right into the vent. It had even managed to make the turn enough that it wasn't visible anymore, meaning that it'd go unnoticed even after they'd cleaned up the other things and would keep the poop smell lingering for quite some time. After a long laugh from all of us, I just said ""you know of course there's really no coming back from this one, right?""

macgillweer,57,,83,186in8,,509,"I started off working in kitchens as a dishwasher.  In case you don't know, dish dog is the low man on the totem pole, but nobody really messes with them, because nobody wants to do that if they quit.  I actually liked it.  Turn on the music, load up the wrack, dirty dishes in, clean out, wax on, wax off... you get the picture.  I would actually use the time to go over my college homework, write paper outlines in my head, and even design D&amp;D worlds, all while my hands were busy.

Eventually, I got promoted to prep cook, then line cook, etc... and moved to a bigger, better paying kitchen.  I still loved cooking and enjoyed being in the ""zone"" when tickets were flying in and out, food was perfect, and you got to drink a case of beer after work with your line buddies.  I was good enough to get promoted to sous chef, and took the job, even though it meant an actual hourly pay cut with more responsibilities.

I was good at this, too.  Cut overtime hours in a huge kitchen, streamlined food cost and made sure people took pride in the food and service.  I even nutted up and fired the racist, lazy bitch who threw temper tantrums in my kitchen.  6 nights a week, 60+ hours, and I loved it.  Things were great, I got a few awards, it was awesome.  Then I asked for a raise.  ""Sure, its in the works"" was the reply for about 8 months.  Then they switched bosses, I started off at square one with the raise.  ""Oh, yeah, we're working on it.  I have to talk to the guy, and he's only here every 3rd Tuesday"", or some other bullshit.  6 more months of this, then I say ""Look, if you can't get me a raise, take me off salary, and I can at least get overtime.""  Done.

So I kept doing the job, even though I made the same pay as the line cooks, but was responsible for the whole kitchen.  At least I was making more money.  They hire another sous chef, at a salary much higher than my old rate, and I ask if I can get that salary as a sous chef.  ""Well, you have to apply for the job,"" which I had been doing for 5 years.  ""Fine, I'm no longer a sous chef.  Find somebody else to close the kitchen 6 nights a week.  I'm paid the same as a line cook, so that's what I'm going to do now.""

Time passes.  I am back on the line, still happy, but much wiser.  Another new boss, and he starts trying to bully the staff.  Me, as a former manager, knows what is and isn't allowed by company policy.  People start coming to me when they question his instructions, I tell them what the actual policy is, and what they can do to counter him.  Chef, understandably, doesn't like somebody challenging his authority, but most of the people we work with don't speak english too well, and he is abusing these people in ways that are clearly not allowed in the employee handbook.  Stuff like forcing people to use vacation time when they don't want to.  Offering overtime early in the week, then cutting it later on.  Ignoring time off requests, etc... not stuff you get sued for, but stuff our company frowns upon.  My outspoken defiance gets me transfered off the line and into the ""steward"" position.  I don't care, company can't cut my pay, and I've got so many years there, I get tons of benefits, plus I no longer work nights.  Awesome.  Angry that I haven't quit, Chef tries one last thing to get me to quit.  Dish room.  I couldn't believe it.  I was the highest-paid dishwasher in town, never worked a night or Saturday, and nobody ever fucked with me.  Chef would come into the dishroom, expecting to see me elbow deep in some shitty, burnt pots.  Nope.  Everything clean, I'm miles ahead of the workload, and I have a smile on my face.

CA1900,73,,119,1j9dex,,513,"I'm a pilot by trade. I no longer work for an airline, but back when I did, I spent a great deal of time in big airline hubs.

A lot of these airport terminals cover a vast expanse, and utilize long conveyor belts to help speed the journey through these big buildings. They're a good idea, at least in theory.

Unfortunately, as any frequent traveler can attest, people *lose their minds* when they get to an airport. All social conventions and situational awareness are completely out the window. One of the worst examples of this is the traveler who sees the conveyor belt not as a tool to speed his journey, but rather a chance to stop walking and let a machine do the work for him.

These human slugs wouldn't be such a problem if they would simply heed the simple instructions that are posted *everywhere* along these conveyor belts: **Walk Left, Stand Right**. Such a simple concept, or at least it would be if these people didn't leave their brains in the parking garage.


So as I'm in Newark, rushing to my gate to catch my flight home, I end up behind one of these human speed bumps. She's standing on one side of the conveyor belt, and her bag is directly next to her, making it impossible to pass. I can't step over it as I'm pulling my wheeled suitcase with another bag strapped onto it.


I say ""excuse me"" as I approach her.  She doesn't acknowledge me at all.

I say, ""ma'am, could I get by?"" She just gives me a confused look.  We're about ten seconds from the end of the belt, so I give up and wait while other passengers stack up behind us.

We get to the end of the belt, and she steps off, but doesn't pick up her bag. It falls over, completely blocking the lane, while she stands there looking around.

""Ma'am?  Ma'am, your bag!""

I back up a few feet, but it only buys me a couple of seconds, as all the non-insane travelers are right behind me and I have no where to go.

She looks back as I'm shouting, looks down at her bag, and picks it up. She then sets it down on the metal platform immediately after the belt ends, but still between the handrails!  She resumes looking at signs to figure out where to go.

Out of options, I do the only thing I can: **I kick her bag, as hard as I can, ten feet across the terminal floor.** I'm positive I heard something break inside when it landed, and that just made it even more satisfying.

She actually had the nerve to say to me, ""What is your problem?""

I was too stunned by her stupidity to do anything except shake my head and walk away. But I smiled as I envisioned Snow Globe juice and broken glass all over her clothes.

OmegaSpoon,74,,173,16ziua,,502,"It was a snowy morning that day. Hopes of school being cancelled were shortly dashed. Somehow, I managed to find a way to fight through 3 periods of school. Then, I dragged myself to English. 

The lesson was bog-standard, with one deviation; it was our first English lesson back after receiving our Mock results. I had been pleasantly surprised to see that I had managed to attain a beautiful pair of A's. However, Mrs 'Conor' (Not her real name, instead I used the name of my mortal enemy) decided to tell us that we should all have received C's. the majority of the class got a mixture of A's and B's, so as you can imagine, there was a large amount of disgruntled pupils. I personally found it quite rude, but the sight of heavy snow falling brightened my mood to 'miffed off a bit'. The real problem, was when she asked for our work back (A controlled assessment we had finished that we were analysing that lesson). She wanted us to hole punch the papers for storage purposes, which is perfectly understandable. Then a frown fell upon Mrs. Conor's face, a d she abruptly declared ""Actually, no, send them to the front. This work might have to go to the examine board, it needs to be neat."" This caused a huge imbalance on my moodometer. It went straight down to 'who the fuck do you think you are...'. It was preposterous, surely a set 2 year 11 English class was capable of punching holes? Apparently not. It was then, that I hatched my plan.

Mere minutes earlier, she had prepared said hole punch for us to use. She had carefully set it to the setting for A4 paper. Then she made her mistake. She moved away from her desk to help a student. Thanks to my 'prestigious' position at the front next to her desk, I quickly grabbed her hole punch, and adjusted the setting. Slightly. It was only a centimetre or two out. She then returned to her desk and ordered the papers to the front. The moment of truth came. She used the misaligned hole punch! But victory was not here yet. Was it noticeable? She grabbed her binder, and inserted the papers. All of a sudden, she froze. Only for a second, but it was long enough for me to see. She suddenly started patting the top of the papers, trying to make it fit. It was at that moment, that it happened. Her mouth, wibbled. Like a child stuck on a hard level in a computer game, she was about to cry. Then she pulled herself together and closed the binder. It mattered not that she didn't cry. Her mouth had wibbled. Her binder wasn't a perfect fit. VICTORY WAS MINE!

And best of all, we had a massive snowball fight at lunch. It was a good day. It was so good, that I haven't been back at school since. God bless you snow.

katej131,58,,75,1f1hr2,,500,"I was pulling into a parking spot at the local Wal-Mart when out of the corner of my eye I notice a shiny white car whip into the spot to the right of me. Before I even turn the car off, people exit from every door of the shinny white car, both people on the drivers side hitting my car with their doors. 

I have a red, piece of crap car, and normally don't really care about things like that. A friend of mine was in the car with me when this happens and gets out and says to the group of people, ""you guys just hit your doors into her car."" I told him it was no big deal. 

The group of people then begin to laugh and hurl so pretty vulgar insults at the both of us. I told my friend to just ignore it.

AussieApathy,25,,67,1ir4vz,,502,"A few years ago, my family and I went camping at a spot owned by a friend of ours. It's a public site, as in anyone can access the campsite, as long as they pay the owner to access the hot water, toilets and showers, and obey the rules. (This also applies to us.)

One of the rules is:

- No noise between 10pm and sunrise.

Many campers play music from their car stereos, and for the most part, there is no problem with that.

Enter four annoying douches. They show up a few days after we do, and from minute one, they are playing electronic music from their cars as loud as possible. We don't mind too much, as there is no-one else at the site, and we've dealt with worse stuff than that.

10pm arrives.

The music doesn't stop. After a half hour, I walk up to the owners along with my father. The owner lives on site, and when we told him about the music, he responded with ""I know. I was about to ask them to turn it off."" That's no problem, he's done it many times, with many campers simply not realising what time it was. Thinking that this would be the case, we returned to our tents.

We see the owner ask them, and we also see the douches laughing.

The owner passes by us on the way back to his house. He answers our questions before we can ask them.

""Just be up at dawn""

We wake up at dawn, but are tired as fuck, since the music didn't stop until about 1am. We make some coffee and wait.

Finally we see the owner walking towards the douches' camp site. He was holding a large black bag. When he finally got near the site, he stops, sets down the bag, unzips it and pulls out his chainsaw. He pulls the cord and the chainsaw screams into life.

I've never seen four people wake up so quickly. As they emerge from their tents, I see the owner turn the chainsaw off put it back in the bag and walk away.

One of the douches visibly had shit his pants. We didn't hear any music for the rest of the time they were there.

They scattered all over the bin. It was both disrespectful to the flight attendants who would eventually have to clean them up for the next flight, as well as rude to the rest of us who now had to contend with them in the bin as we put our bags in.

When the guy saw me struggling to clean them back up and at least put them in a pile up there, he tried to excuse his behavior, saying that he didn't want them in front of him. 

I smiled and said, ""Don't worry, I'll take care of it."" I then finished collecting all the magazines and cards, and called the flight attendant over. I asked if there was anywhere she'd be able to put them.

Edonculation117,39,,87,1lsoa1,,494,"I work in the bakery of a well known UK supermarket.  I mainly just serve the counter, slice bread and pack the products our bakers make.  I work the afternoons/evenings and have very little interaction with the morning workers (most evening workers are high school/university age, the morning workers are mostly a lot older and been doing the same job for 30 years).  One such morning worker will always complain if things aren't set up perfectly for her to come in and do as little as possible.  The frozen lay-ups have to be on exactly the right racks and the department must be spotless otherwise she will spend an hour or so each morning whining and complaining that she can't do her work properly.  Whenever this happens she always goes to our manager to say how lazy and useless all the evening workers are, despite having no idea how busy it is in the afternoons and how hard we all work.

This colleague does about 4 hours work in her 8 hour shifts, takes more than an hour for breaks instead of the half hour we are allowed and always leaves 20-30 minutes early leaving whatever work she hasn't finished behind for the afternoon workers to complete.  This often means that I and my afternoon colleagues end up working 30-40 minutes over my scheduled hours, unpaid of course, just to get everything finished.

About a week ago a couple of us from the afternoon shifts came up with a plan to annoy her.  She makes the fresh cream cakes for the counter which are some of our most popular products.  I now go out of my way to make sure that the counter is as full as possible and looks as nice as possible to drive sales.  With some carefully worded recommendations to customers we are now selling a lot more cream cakes over the counter.  So each morning our colleague comes in to find an empty counter and an empty fridge that she expects to be full of cream cakes.  This means that she has to make twice the amount of creams cakes each shift in order to fill the counter and the fridge.  I have great fun imagining her seething with frustration each morning when she opens up the fridge to find it empty.  Not only are we driving sales up but she actually has to do nearly a full shift of work instead of shirking it all on to others.  Now every time I refill the cream cakes I do so with a big smile on my face, making my shifts so much more satisfying.",Revenge on a lazy co-worker,581,pettyrevenge
skello,34,,80,1a7zzk,,490,"So, my boyfriend grew up in a small town suburban neighbourhood where a lot of a children around the same age lived. Come his teenage years, the family across the street from his house got into loud partying on the weekends. They would pound loud music in their garage, which of course echoed and kept everyone up. Compounding the problem, the parents of the kids are a manager of a successful liquor store and the owner of a party hosting firm. Since they were feeble parents who let their kids do just about anything, the partying was all but guaranteed. When my boyfriend's family and the family of his best friend (who also lived along that street) complained about it, they would find their houses vandalized. They did the whole 'dodge-the-cops' routine by turning the music down and were none-too-subtle about their disdain for the rest of the neighbourhood.
  
Enter my boyfriend's best-friend's father - we'll call him Angus. Angus was the leader of the local Scottish cultural club and has been playing the bagpipes since a young age. While Angus' and my boyfriend's families were talking about these loud parties, someone mentioned how much nicer it was to hear bagpipes than the loud dance beats. This gave Angus an idea. He asked the whole neighbourhood for permission (and got it), and set about his plan. I should note that Angus lives next door to the shitty loud neighbours.
  
Friday night came along and the loud teenagers were obnoxiously partying it up. They were unthinkably drunk the whole night, throwing bottles and doing what inebriated teenagers do. The neighbourhood didn't say a word and the party dies down at like 5 a.m. on Saturday. Angus, who typically has the Scottish piping band over for practice and hanging out, decided to hold practice as soon as local noise ordinance let him do so. That happened to be 7 a.m. At 7:01, some 20-piece bagpipe outfit starts playing, loud as can be, facing the fence which separated Angus and the neighbours. 
  
They played. And they played. And they played. Hours and hours of bass drums and bagpipes filled the neighbourhood. The teens, hungover and pissed, called around to ask people about filing a noise complaint - when they discovered that everyone was actually in on and supported the piping practice, they called the police anyway, only to get themselves a good strong talking-to for being horrible neighbours in the first place.

nwestnine,21,,69,14v0pf,,490,"Back in high school, I worked as a caddie.  I've golfed all my life, so it was a pretty easy gig and I did a damn good job.  Club pro requested me for a pro-tournament he was qualifying for.  I kept my mouth shut when needed, but I could help your game by a few strokes (if asked).
    
Every year, there was a two-day event for the members.  There was heavy gambling on the event and a steep entrance price.  No one played and spent less than $5k.  As a caddie, you'd have the same person each day and the pay was significantly higher than a normal.  It was expected to make $200-$500.  Caddies look forward to this day to balance out all the days where they made $0 throughout the summer (often were more caddies than golfers).
    
One year, it was 100+ degrees, sunny and humid.  Each round was 6 hours (golf should take no longer than 4).  This didn't count the hour-lunch break or the couple hours of waiting before.  So, these were 10 hour days.
    
I was assigned a guy I'll call John.  Not very pleasant to be around.  Never a ""thank you"".  No small-talk with other golfers or me.  He didn't play very well.  Despite the nice weather, he had an umbrella, couple dozen golf balls, extra shirts, extra towels, and rain-gear in the bag for me to carry.  I still made no mistakes over the two days and went far above the call of duty.
    
My base rate was $60 for both days combined.  For tipping, the club's system was to match that and then pay more on top (it was stupid and has since changed).  So, the minimum anyone should have made was $120, but most made above $200.  John decided to pay me $100 and write a vague bad evaluation.
    
The caddie master tried to make things right, but he's limited in his powers.
    
Attached to every evaluation is a lunch ticket.  Members fill them out with their number, get charged $5; caddie gets burger, chips &amp; drink.
    
I memorized his number and acquired a stash of blank lunch tickets.  From then on, John bought me lunch whenever I had a bad day.  I gave many away too.  This went on until I stopped caddying.

He would be a dick to girls, make up all kinds of ridiculous stories, talk shit behind your back, and whip off his shirt whenever possible. The kind of guy that would turn off a Xbox when everyone is playing, just because he's losing. Our friend group was  slowly but steadily becoming disillusioned with this guy. And after a particularly extensive display of asshatery, we decided to get back at him.

The moment of inspiration came when my brother was watching an episode of True Life. It was dedicated to people that frequent online chat sites. We thought why not pose as a particularly slutty girl (who shared an extremely similar first name) on a bunch of these online chat lobbies and put up his number soliciting phone sex and sexting. 
We posted it in a number of lobbies that popped up on our Google search. The first hint that is was working was when some guy responded on lobby ""DONT CALL THAT #, SHE SOUNDS LIKE A DUDE!!"" 

Lo and behold the next day he shows up to class looking flustered and annoyed. He immediately starts getting into it about how he's got and still getting ""100's of creepy calls and dick pics from all over the f-ing world.""

monkey_wrench,73,,86,189r6y,,491,"My ex girlfriend broke up with me the day before my birthday (about 3 months ago), we were together for over 3.5 years, shared a Verizon account (unlimited text and talk with 6gig data plan) and had just activated our new iPhone 5s (it's relevant), but the account is in my name. 

I thought because she broke up with me, if anything, I would be the bitter one, so I figured we could keep the phone plan as long as we each paid our share. The initial break up was not bad, so it was feasible, however because she is an alcoholic, and started abusing drugs after we broke up, she began acting like I was ruining her life (that’s a story for another time). 

When she started acting like a bitch, I began looking into splitting the account, getting her off mine and having her start her own in her own name. I called Verizon, and they said that all she needed to do was assume liability for her line, no fee for splitting the account. Awesome. I get a hold of my ex, and let her know this information. I call Verizon back after texting my ex, and they say that they can call her and start the process immediately. Perfect, do it.

I call Verizon the next day, they said that they contacted my ex, and the paperwork had been started, all she had to do was call back and it would be over with. She would be off my account and have her own. I was very happy about this because I really wanted to lower the data on my plan, for one month I use a little bit less than 1gig and she eats up about 4.5-5gig. So the sooner she assumes liability for her line, the better. 

I wait a few days before calling Verizon back, they say she hasn't contacted them, and her line is still active on my account. So I text my ex, and ask her what the hold up is, she says that she DID call back, they were supposed to contact her, and they never did, but that she got a text saying that it was taken care of. Ok, fine. 

I call Verizon back later that day and they said yes, they were supposed to call her back, but they didn't. They said that the customer service representative that was dealing with her had put in an application for her to lower the deposit amount for her to start her own line. I guess because her credit is so bad she was initially going to have to pay $400. After the application went through, it was lowered to $125.

From that day on, I call Verizon at least once a week to see if her line is still active on my account. Every time, they say yes. I follow up my calls to Verizon with a text to my ex, politely asking her to call Verizon so we can get this done and over with. She tells me each time that she plans on doing it later that day.

This goes on for about 3 weeks, and I am getting fed up with the bullshit. I call Verizon again, and ask if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. They tell me that all she has to do is pay the $125 and she will be off my account. They suggest suspending the line, because that usually makes the process go faster; scare her into paying and ending this whole ordeal. I decline; I want to give her a chance to pay the deposit without having to do something like that.

I text my ex, ONCE AGAIN, and ask her to PLEASE call Verizon and finish the assumption of liability for her line so she can be taken off my account. To summarize the conversation, she basically told me that if I want her off my account then I can pay the deposit for her; she has no intention on paying the $125. 

I fume for a day or two and try to think of a plan. 

I call Verizon, for the second to last time, and I ask to suspend her line. I guess it is uncommon knowledge that you can suspend a line on your account without billing. The monthly access charge is $40 for each phone on the account. The 6gig data plan is $80. 

What happens is this: I suspend her phone without billing, leaving her line on my account that is attached to her brand new iPhone5. I am no longer being charged for her monthly access, $40 off my bill right there. I lowered my data to 2gig (just in case) and that’s another $30 (or $20) off my bill. Also, once the assumption of liability process starts, you only have 30 days to complete it. After that 30 days, the process starts over, and not only does the deposit go back up to $400, it's harder to lower it the second time around. 

I hang up with Verizon, extremely happy. Not only did I suspend her line, I don't have to pay for her monthly access, AND since the phone number is attached to her brand new iPhone, its not like she can use it anywhere else.

She texts me furiously (using the wifi at the bar she spends all her time at because she doesn't have internet at her house)

[Text One](http://i.imgur.com/HbgF57Q.jpg)

[Text Two](http://i.imgur.com/wvUaDVT.jpg)

[Text Three](http://i.imgur.com/bDB74FL.jpg)

[Text Four](http://i.imgur.com/lGVmbpF.jpg)

So today, for the **last time** I call Verizon, and I verify that I **do not** have to pay for her monthly access. 

So now, instead of just paying the $125 and being able to use her brand new iPhone, she is going to buy a new phone and start a new account because she thinks she is screwing me over. Little does she know that she is actually screwing herself over.

It feels good to win this fucking war.

Dr_Legacy,156,,164,16794r,,492,"One summer about thirty or so years ago I spent a year in houston, texas.  It was a long summer.

I still hate texas to this day, and the story following is just one reason.

I was in Houston on an assignment for a large IT vendor.  I took temporary residence and tried to blend in, because being different in texas only invites constant confrontation.

But as a temporary resident, I did not get texas license plates for my car, which meant that my vehicle and I were constant targets.

At the same time every morning, I drove about 30 mins on the I-610 outerbelt to the project site.  At the time I-610 was in terrible shape because the houston heat had buckled it in numerous places.  The repairs to the road left serious potholes that ran the entire width of the lane, but were too narrow to see clearly as you approached.  Basically, you had to memorize their location if you didn't want to wreck your car.

One day a particularly charming degenerate native observed my out-of-state plates and took it as his duty to tailgate me in his nasty pickup truck, get alongside and swerve at my car to run me out of my lane, and perform other agressive maneuvers to show his lone star superiority.

The first day it happened I figured it was a random asshole, but then he showed up the next day at about the same spot and tried it again.

I revved it and let him follow close behind.  When buckle #1 came up, I swerved at the last minute and enjoyed the crunching thud that ensued as his rustbucket truck ran into it.  I knew where the buckles were, and this local idiot didn't.

He was raging after that and tailgated closer, trying to overtake my car.  I sped up and swerved, and savored the crunching noise that buckle #2 made.

I thought I'd lost him after that but soon looked into the mirror to see him speeding up right behind.  He had a gunrack in the back and I figured he was unbalanced enough to try to squeeze off a shot.  I sped up again, making sure he was doing over 90MPH when i swerved to avoid Buckle #3, which had to be the eastern arm of the Grand Canyon.

His truck hit that and immediately slowed down.  

I never saw this asshole again.

I put out the candy and waited in a bush in my front yard, and sure enough, some older kids, probably eighth grade, came and poured all the candy into bags. They were laughing and talking about how awesome it was. I then proceeded to come out of the bush and say something like ""Hey! The sign says take two!"" At this point, the kids made the mistake of trying to run away. Naturally, I took off after them. Eventually during the chase, one of the kids tripped and fell on the ground.

So last Monday, she's at a busy intersection in town.  The lights are green, so off she goes, but the vehicles at the other side of the lights aren't moving.  She's trapped in her van in the middle of the intersection as the lights change again and she's blocking traffic.

It's completely her own fault.  She screwed up.  She should have checked ahead and made sure the way was clear.  She knows this.  How embarrassing.  She has to sit there cringing in the middle of the intersection waiting for the way to be clear so she can move.

There's a man standing on the side of the road with his lovely wife.  He's outraged! ""STUPID BITCH!"" he yells.  His wife looks at him a little surprised.

My Mum the pensioner knows she screwed up.  There is currently nothing she can do to rectify the situation other than wait it out.  It's pretty embarrassing.

So she turns at looks at the outraged man and takes a big deep breath.  ""CUNT!"" she yells.

Man's wife looks startled, then starts giggling.  Man is apoplectic!  His eyebrows are going in all directions!  ""SHITHEAD!"" he yells.

""PRICK!"", Mum the pensioner yells back.

Wife is now openly laughing at her husband.  Husband is turning all sorts of colours then abruptly storms off.  Wife follows along snuffling and snorting and pausing only long enough to share a look of camaraderie with my Mum the pensioner.  Mum calmly drives off when the way is clear.

plonce,39,,96,1izub3,,488,"My neighbor, with whom I have a very good relationship, decided to get a dog.

No problem with that, the only issue was that every time he would let the dog out, it would find its way into my front yard and proceeded to take a massive shit.

I cleaned it up without saying anything several times, but after the 10th time, I finally decided to let him know.

He promised that he'd be better about it, and each time his promises turned out to be nothing more than lip-service, and the dog kept shitting on my lawn.

After what seemed like the 6th or 7th time I mentioned it to him, I decided I had to make a statement or the problem was never going to go away.

So I grabbed a big trash bag and headed to the dog park.  With elbow-length rubber gloves on, I collected every piece of shit that I could find.

Some wet, some dry, some white from age.  It was absolutely disgusting and I gagged from the aroma.

The next time I saw him drive away, I dragged the bag of shit over and with a rake, proceeded to absolutely cover his front yard in rotting dog shit.  I took great care to make sure I spread it out evenly, even hiding piles under his juniper bushes.

His dog never shit in my yard ever again.

And he never mentioned it to me directly, saying only this the next time we saw each other over the fence:

""Hey man... the dog... won't be a problem anymore.""

He generally just made my life extremely unpleasant.

 A few months in, I came down with a horrible sinus infection that lasted for three weeks with loud, hacking, blood/sputum producing coughs and complete sinus blockage. Of course, no sympathy from my roommate. In fact, he proceeded to mock me over Skype to his girlfriend WHILE I WAS IN THE ROOM and could obviously hear him. My doctor told me that I should use a neti pot to irrigate my sinuses along with taking antibiotics. Of course, poor college student me doesn't want to buy a neti pot, so I take asshole roommate's refillable water bottle and proceed to use it to douche my nasal passages while he was at class.

ShaneL79,146,,99,1j0gw8,,485,"The other day I was renewing my vehicles registration at my local registries office. As usual the service was at a snails pace. I was second in line behind this completely redneck looking guy wearing a white (and dirty) muscle shirt and he looked like he just got off some dirty job just prior to getting there.

There were 3 guys behind me in line as well. Then all of a sudden a family walks in. There is two parents, a teenage girl, and a younger girl. All of the females are wearing hijabs (head scarfs).

Instead of getting into the roped off line, they walk directly to the front beside the redneck looking guy ahead of me and proceeded to wait there. Finally the next window opens and they go directly to it. The redneck guy says ""excuse me, there is a line"" and they ignore him. 

He walks up beside them to the counter and says, ""excuse me, you just skipped ahead of all of these people in line"". 

Immediately the father denies skipping in line. The registries employee asks if that is true to the rest of us standing in line. We all agree with the redneck looking guys version of events. The woman tells the family to go to the back of the line. 

At that moment the woman starts yelling that this was racist. She started to say they were getting picked on because they were Muslim and middle-eastern. The husband demanded to speak to a manager, and one was already there watching the whole thing and stepped up.

The guy demanded that they be taken care of before he calls the police for hate crimes on the redneck looking guy and the employee. 

The manager says she will take care of them personally and asks them to have a seat so she can go grab the forms they'll need. They sit down and the line continues moving. The family looks at everyone in line like they just won. The people in line don't give a shit. 

As soon as everyone who was there prior to that family was served she re-appeared and said she was too busy to help them but they could get back in the line which was now empty.

I got to see his face before I walked out and this guy clearly looked defeated. He knew what just happened and now there was nothing he could do about it.

**TL;DR** - Amazing manager at registries defused a families anger and false claims of racism and prejudice and still makes them wait as long as they were fighting not to. ",Defusing False Claims of Racism,584,pettyrevenge
cliffhanger407,38,,64,1gafrr,,488,"When I was probably 13 or 14, my dad took me to Cedar Point. It was quite a trip for me as we live in Atlanta, and I've always been a huge roller coaster fan. We did, however, unfortunately choose to travel during a very busy season. Between my dad's work and school, it was impossible to go when no one would be there, so we prepared ourselves for lines.

Our first day at the park, we worked our way through, never really knowing the details of the roller coaster we were about to get on, but always enjoying them. Some had very long lines, others were quite short. We didn't really know where we were going, but I knew that we wanted to ride Millennium Force on our first day. The ride had opened maybe a year ago, it was on all the roller coaster shows on TV, and I just had to do it. Unfortunately, we got there a little late in the day. The line was quite long, but my dad was very patient, and we waited in line for close to two hours to ride.

As we wind through the queue, my anticipation builds. This monster that I've been looking forward to is getting closer and closer. When we get to within a half hour left in the line, a small group squeezes by my dad and they stop directly in front of us. I guess they didn't want the park employee to see them, so they planned to stop before the end.

I'm seething with anger, and my dad notices. He tells me to be calm. ""Yelling at people is never the answer,"" he tells me. I wanted to yell. I wanted to push them back to where they belonged in the line. My dad simply smiled. We creep to the final queuing building where the line breaks out into separate rows for each row of seats in the roller coaster, my rage building because these people are still in front of us. I'm wondering how my dad could let these people stay in front of us. It's not fair. Then, we see the first park employees that we've seen throughout the line.

My dad gets their attention and calmly explains, ""This group in front of us cut in line."" The employee asks the people around us and they all confirm what happened.

[deleted],82,,166,1bt3et,,483,"My wife and I went to see The Avengers with a group of our friends. This was the opening-night showing and so the theater was **packed**. We got there about an hour or two before the show started. So I decided to take a nap. About half an hour before the movie started, I woke up to see a group of loud, obnoxious college-aged kids come up the stairs by our seats. Their friend had been holding their seats for them. They were pretty loud, but I imagined that they would quieten down before the movie started. Right before the movie started, the theater management came over because they had a few announcements and a small competition. They basically just asked some trivia questions about the Avengers and gave out T-Shirts and the like. The group behind us were loud and obnoxious, shouting out stupid and obviously-wrong answers, and making stupid jokes. Again, I figured that they would shut up once the movie started.

The movie started and they were good for a bit, but then they started making all kinds of stupid comments while the movie was going on. I was starting to get really pissed. I mean, people would clap or whoop when something cool happened on screen, or laugh when something funny was said. That's fine. But these guys were making stupid comments and just ruining the atmosphere. I could see people in the rows below me looking up towards them with irritated expressions on their faces and I could also hear people sighing in exasperation. However, no one did anything. I thought I could ignore them and so I just dealt with it.

Finally the movie got to the scene where Coulson gets killed by Loki. Coulson is sitting there bleeding out while Nick Fury is talking to him. The entire audience is quiet because this is supposed to be a sad scene. Except for the fucks sitting behind me. They start imitating what the characters are saying in mocking tones and making stupid jokes and comments about ""how sad they are"". I finally couldn't take it anymore. I turned around and said/shouted in an extremely loud voice:

**SHUT... UP!**

I heard whoops, clapping, and cheers of support from the surrounding chairs. The obnoxious guys tried to make some half-hearted comebacks. A theater employee walked up the stairs and flashed their lights at the group and I heard some whispering; I think they were telling them to be quiet or they'd be kicked out.

For the rest of the movie, I heard nary a peep from them.

**TL; DR;** Obnoxious moviegoers try to ruin movie by making stupid comments. I yell at them to shut up. Theater management possibly warns them that they might get kicked out. They shut up and everyone gets to enjoy the movie.",Petty Revenge at loud moviegoers,649,pettyrevenge

My little brother is a genius.  He got an Associate's degree from a local CC before finishing up 8th grade.  Basically, he's one smart cookie and everyone knew it.

He's taking his Biology final exam and notices the kid next to him is blatantly looking at his paper, doesn't even try to hide it.  He's not one for letting kids cheat off of him, so he goes and hurries through the rest of the test, purposefully marking the wrong answers for his entire test and watched as the kid gleefully fills up his scantron and dances up to the front and turns in his test.  As class is about to end, my brother takes out his eraser and slowly and obviously takes out an eraser and erases his answers for the entire test, basking in the look of horror of the kids face, and blasts through the rest of the test in the last 15 minutes.

I've just been to a show and was sat up on the upper circle, front row. Now, I'm a tall chap (6ft 3in) and so when I usually sit in a theatre or cinema I slouch and slide forward in my seat so that the person behind me can see the stage / screen. I'm nice like that.

Unfortunately, the person sat behind me tonight was an annoying kid and seemed to have great pleasure in kicking the back of my seat over and over with gradually increasing force.

After about 30 minutes of this I decided to get my petty revenge and so, after one final kick hit the back of my seat and pushed me over that fine edge, I nonchalantly stretched, adjusted myself and sat upright in my chair.

superdupermanda,47,,104,1613jw,,489,"This happened a few years ago. My grandma lived with my parents and my aunt came over every morning to help out and provide her some company. Auntie G would come over around 9:30am every weekday. On most days, she'd encounter dog shit in front of our house and walkway. WTF? The dog owners on my block were conscientious owners and would pick up after their dogs. My parents and aunt were tired of picking up after phantom poops. We figured she let her dog go outside our home because we were one of maybe 4 houses with hedges and plants outside.

My aunt and my mom started watching for the suspect and we realized it was a middle-aged Asian soccer mom/bitch with a huge fluffy gorgeous dog. They'd stalk and watch for the bitch then ran out to confront her. She pretended not to understand my aunt who yelled at her in Chinese. She repeatedly ignored my mom who yelled at her in other dialects of Chinese and in English. She walk off with her nose in the air with her big fluffy dog. She learned to cross the street if she saw that someone was watching from our house and let her dog do its business outside a neighbor's home. We were angry. Our neighbors were angry. 

We eventually just had random neighbors stand outside around 9:30am to make sure she wouldn't let her dog poop. This couldn't go on forever.

My elderly but extremely spry Auntie G got mad enough one day to follow the lady to her home from a safe distance. She stalked the lady to a house 1.5 blocks up the street from our own. (Imagine a tiny 80 year old woman peeking around a hedge to spy on a woman. Because that's what she did, lol.) My mom went out there to confirm fluffy dog bitch lived there. (Imagine a middle aged woman in her car with sunglasses and a newspaper spying on this woman.)

My auntie's revenge: Now that the house was marked, my aunt started collecting fluffy dog's poop in plastic bags for a week. She then went over to fluffy dog bitch's house one afternoon and smeared the festering dog poop all over their sidewalk, their gate, and even their door handle and stuffed in front of their door locks. What? We're just returning the gifts your dog left us.

**TL;DR** Fluffy dog keeps pooping outside our home. Elderly aunt stalks owner and returns pooptastic gifts.

Side note: I would love to say this stopped the lady but no. The dog took a huge shit outside another neighbor's house the very next day. My poor neighbor stepped in the dookie and my mom ran out to tell her who was doing it. The neighbor's very large and buff Hulk-esque son pretty much scraped up the feces, ran up the block, caught the lady and the dog and screamed at her for not curbing her dog then flung the poop at the woman.

Apparently the restaurant was to host a wedding banquet shortly after we had arrived. We noticed right away that they were short on supplies - for example we ordered lobster but only got about half the number of the little forks to eat them with as we had people at the table.

As we began to finish our food, waiters began to try cleaning up our table *while we were still sitting there*. Eventually, somebody pulled a teacup straight out of my uncle's hand. Normally, my uncle is a very quiet guy, but I guess this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

He went on a rage about having his tea swiped from him - he was clearly not done drinking it. The person who took it from then tried to apologize and put the teacup back on the table in front of him. To which my uncle yelled ""I saw your fingers go into this tea when you took it! I demand a new cup!""

Anyways, a week later my girlfriend at the time and I decide we are going to go see it but right as we are heading out Dennis comes out of his room with a shit eating grin. I see what's coming from a mile away and promptly inform him that if he ruins Shutter Island for me I'd get him back 10-fold.

Context for the story: one of my friends is vietnamese, so from hanging around her family I know a little bit of vietnamese. 

As soon as I sat down, I handed Tammy the nail polish I wanted, asked her to cut down my nails and file them in a round shape. She starts going to work on my hands. I look down and see that my nails are a square shape... so I politely remind her I asked for my nails to be round. She nods her head and continues working. She has done nothing to change the nail shape. I pull back my hands and say ""can you please round out my nails?"" She looks at me as if I had just accused her of performing back alley abortions.

I frequent Local Gaming and Hobby Store (LGHS) to the tune of twice per week. Once is usually for a tabletop game, and the other is for LGHS's board game extravaganza! Bring your board games to play with friends! Bring yourself to play new games! Bring your friends!

Anyhow. LGHS shares a parking lot with a small bakery, a tax place, and a martial arts studio. The studio is more like an advanced day care, but it does occasionally have Big Damn Events that everyone and their mother needs to attend, because watching five-year-old Jimmy throw Jack across a mat is a family affair. No matter. 

Well, unless you get this guy. Meet Double Parking Douchebag.

DPD was related to one of the kids at the studio, and would visit often to see the little bastard throw kung fu kicks like a Power Ranger. Each time, he would simply pull into parking spots haphazardly, usually taking up two slots, and when there wasn't a big event going on, the parking lot was empty enough to let this slide. 

Cue Saturday's big board game extravaganza, which apparently fell on the same day as a Big Damn Event. DPD decides to pull into the last two parking spaces in the front of the stores because fuck you, that's why. This meant that SG, who always brought heaps of board games for people to try, had to park in the back. I'd parked there as well, and I helped her bring in her big bags of games. We related the tale of SG's parking woes, and a cunning plan was hatched by Captain Awesome. CA went to the back, where he had parked as well, and brought his car around... and parked right behind DPD. Coming inside, we all began to play various board games and have copious amounts of caffeine-fueled fun. 

That is, until the horn started.

DPD wasn't just honking. No. DPD was laying on the horn. You'd have thought there was a fire. Nope. We all managed to block out the sound, which persisted for around two minutes before ceasing, and it wasn't until the door to the shop opened that we paused our game and looked up.

Owner of the studio's wife was there, and was asking whose car was parked behind DPD's. Captain Awesome immediately rose. ""That's mine. When he wants to discuss the problem like an adult, I'll be right here."" Captain Awesome then sat down and asked if anyone wanted to trade Wood for Bricks.

Owner of the studio's wife started in on how he had to move the car, etc. Captain Awesome flatly ignored her until she left. Cue more horn-blowing. After a few minutes, cue the wife coming in with a cellphone in hand. Cops were being called. Captain Awesome waited, bidding her to call the cops.

Police arrive. The officer who arrived was a regular of LGHS. He was also Captain Awesome's training officer.

That's right. Captain Awesome was a cop.

The two speak, and the cop leaves, after telling Owner's Wife to inform the driver that this was a private lot, and that he couldn't do anything. I have no idea if that's true, but it was awesome. Finally, DPD comes in and asks who parked behind him. Captain Awesome stands up. 

""The next time you park like that, I'm not going to move my car. I'm going to have one of these fine patrons of this establishment drive me home, so that I can change into my work clothes and gear. Then I'll come back and we'll talk about it.""

yunzaidai,61,,140,1jqvmt,,478,"There was a huge music festival this last weekend which featured an artist that my boyfriend and I were excited to see. They were at the end of the day, and we made sure to go early and stand as close to the stage as possible to get a good view of the band. 

As it gets closer to the starting time, more and more people begin to crowd in and it gets packed. Suddenly this girl, which I will call Entitled Bitch (EB) from now on, cuts in front of me with her friend and blocks half my view. I was annoyed, but it was no big deal. I could still see the stage relatively well. 

After a few minutes, a group of very tall people end up in front us, and I couldn’t see anything from where I was standing. Since there was some space beside EB, I tapped her shoulder and asked if she could move just a little so that I could still see (I made sure to note that her view of the stage would still be obstructed even if she did move). The interaction went something like this:



&gt;Me: Excuse me, could you move just a little bit, I-
&gt;
&gt;EB: No! I don’t fucking care!
&gt;
&gt;Me: If you move just a little, you could still see the stage and I would be able to see as well. Plus, you cut in front of us and we didn’t say anything.
&gt;
&gt;EB: Fuck no, deal with it. I got here first!



By this time, I was very much ticked off. If she politely declined, I would have just backed off and dealt with watching the screen instead of the stage. But her being A-entitled, B-rude and C-inconsiderate, I wouldn’t have it. 

Eventually, I was able to get into a spot right next to her, which I assume pissed her off, because she started leaning into me and putting all of her weight onto me to try to get me to fall. I stumbled, and responded with an elbow to her stomach (Sorry guys, I’ve always had trouble with responding to bad behavior with good ones).Of course, this turned into her playing victim to the crowd around her, but I just ignored her and turned around to watch the show (and she didn't dare try the same thing again). 

But it gets better!

Eventually, some people in front of us moved and EB was quick to move in and take the spot, giving me a quick smug look before turning back to watch the show. I moved up behind her, making sure that she couldn’t get out of that spot.

Why? Because there was a tall girl standing right in front of her, which is probably why the people moved in the first place.

LegendaryOdin,107,,125,174k6k,,479,"This took place a few years back, basically right as I was finishing high school, and it was actually my friend Kev that got revenge. The reason I am posting this is because I was essentially the instrument of his revenge. 


Nearby from my house was a place called CyberJocks that was, essentially, a large gaming zone that did regular LAN and all night tournaments (great place, shame it shut down). You can all imagine that along with attracting lots of awesome people that it also attracted a lot of younger, more profane little snots. Kev frequented this place more than I did and regularly put up with these little shits screaming racist and sexist remarks over the headphones during CS. So, he hatched a plan of what he deemed approrpriate justice and this is where I came in. 


Being a shut in most of the time, I spent my hours after school playing games while letting my mind wander. One of my favorites to play for hours and hours was Super Smash Bros Melee. Kev told me they would be hosting an all night LAN with a Smash tournament and prodded me to attend. Even with my dislike of venturing into society, I figured I'd be ok so I agreed and we played every day for about a month. 


The night arrives and I find out I am the only female in attendance, something that is both humorous and disconcerting. We play some CounterStrike first, Kev bitching because I continuously peg him with the noob cannon (his term for the shotgun) and then the Smash tournament begins. 


Needless to say...I have never heard so many men/boys whining in profanity laden tirades. I bulldozed through them intermittedly using Fox and Peach with Kev doing a jovial little Mephistopheles jig behind me. It comes down to me, the current champ and the guy who claims to be better with him. Champ goes down in silence and the guy who was better, using Samus, actually threw the controller and got kicked out. 


When it was all over, Kev was practically coated in a perverse satisfaction at seeing all those little twats that had been, mere moments ago, laughing at me and telling me to get back in the kitchen, sulking silently. To add insult to injury, I managed to stamp most of them out in CounterStrike. He told me later about it all and we laughed it off, especially finding out the ""guy who was better"" had actually been the NY champ at one point.

Jordo_99,52,,97,140bh3,,481,"Very brief setup...in 7th grade social studies (history) we would take a weekly quiz...they were almost always very easy (every student essentially gained 1-2 letter grades) and the teacher was downright amazing and made every day fun (won a state award twice, only person to do so) so there was really no excuse to do poorly on this and no studying was required...however some people are just lazy:

...and now we arrive at James, the over-privileged, jock with the biggest ego (next to mine) in the class. James was likely a B or C student, very capable and rather smart, but very lazy which is why he wasn't near the top of our class. Anyway, James sat directly to my right and was getting B's on all of our quizzes until one day when he realized I was getting A's on all of them...this didn't sit well with him.

It only took one test for me to catch on that he was copying my answers because he bragged about how he scored the same as I did and I noticed that every answer was the same...I was a stupid, egotistical kid and would race through tests to get done first and I recalled last week that James had finished slightly behind me and how I chuckled to myself thinking he probably just guessed on everything because. Everything clicked when I saw our answers were all identical all multiple choice and the last question was always a bonus question of ""what was your favorite thing you learned this week"" and even that was the same...so I started devising my plan:

On Friday, just before our tests came I told James that even if he can also get 100%, he couldn't possibly beat me on speed. He took the bait and when our test came I purposefully answered each question wrong by putting the letter before the correct answer (A instead of B, C instead of D...etc) and then put down my answer for the bonus and got up...James sprints ahead of me and practically dives to turn in his paper. My heart leapt with joy and I just sit back to my desk to change all my answers back.

James scoffed at me and pointed out that I was stupid for forgetting my name or something on his way back to his desk. On Monday we get our scores back and he's shocked...0% but he got the bonus question correct. His jaw dropped even more when he saw that I got 100%. I then rubbed salt in the wound with a ""Huh, guess I wasn't the stupid one after all...probably shouldn't copy off me next time"".

At this point James should've called it quits and just went back to his B's but he was almost as stubborn as I was...he was smart enough to figure out how I altered my answers but not smart enough to realize that he was outmatched...and so came Friday

This time I started off for the first 4 questions with the same pattern and then answered them all correctly for the last 16. I wait for James to get it and start furiously erasing all my answers and adjusting the first 4, and putting the same ones down for the last 16...James notices this (as was his plan) and he runs back and adjusts all of his answers as well...Monday comes and I was tell that he's seething with excitement, ready to rub in my face that I was outsmarted. He got a 25% and I got my 100% again.

...this went on for 3 more weeks until he finally caved. The 5th week I was especially devilish and wrote all my characters as they would appear on a calculator (boxy)...then I let James see them outright, and on my way up, I added and erased lines to turn a few D's into C's and D's into B's...etc

His parents ended up getting a call as the teacher was concerned that something might be wrong at home...he was forced to explain this to his parents, who then called my parents and while I ended up getting scolded by my mom, I was taken out for ice-cream with my dad as a celebration of my wit.

TL;DR
Tricked a kid into writing down the wrong answers to a test after I figured out he was cheating off me. Then played off his ego/stubbornness resulting in 4 failed tests. Received icecream/praise from my dad when he found out.


EDIT: a few people have asked me why my mom scolded me...the short answer is that she felt the proper action would have been to just covered up my answers instead of being a devilish fiend. The long answer involves her taking christian values into skewed directions...she's lightened up an extreme amount since then. I think it was because she was very adamant about raising my brothers and I with good moral values and I can see how praising this could have gave me incentive to manipulate people.",How I made a kid fail 5 straight tests as he tried to copy off me.,578,pettyrevenge
boomsc,151,,120,190ixx,,477,"I'm a late sleeper. And the house-mate who claimed the most isolated room in the house also claimed the room -right- next to the bathroom.

She has sex. *A lot* (all different guys).


I go to the toilet usually around midnight,and then once before bed around 2am. And I didn't realise until she *told* us all that we keep going to the loo at 'really inappropriate moments'.


She's a largely unpleasant person, always complaining and double-standards etc etc, generally someone who belongs in badroommates. My solution? When she's been particularly annoying, and -especially- if I know someone's round. I'll make a point of going to the bathroom -frequently-, just to make her have to pause and stop fucking so I don't hear.


My other housemate took the cake though. She -really- pissed him off, so that night he went down, knocked -loudly- on  her door and said ""Hey [painintheass] I'm going to the toilet, you're not in the middle of anything I might interrupt right?"" and went to the loo.

Edit:

Since people have been asking, lets list deeds we're getting revenge for.


Naming the entire house as a facebook business as her 'shagpad'


Putting up with her trying to hit on the gay and female among us when drunk because she -is- that desperate.


Having sex in public places. The kitchen, shower, sofas, stairs etc. (It's the location, not the act, that's the problem)


Having her go off on rants about the state of the kitchen when over half the dirty crockery is hers and hasn't been washed in days.


Constantly bitch about each of us to everyone else behind our backs


Fill the fridge and freezer with her stuff (we're talking a -months- worth of food into space that has to be shared between seven)


Leave passive-aggressive messages about how we all really need to clean up more


Generally refuse to contribute towards communal stuff. She blocked the toilet and works at B&amp;Q, we asked her to buy a plunger when she was already on shift, and we'd split the cost. She let us know they are available for about £5, came home,and went away for the weekend leaving us to deal with her fatty shits (she's on Atkins or something)


etcetera, etcetera. Two other room-mates have loud, frequent sex. We don't care, stop trying to make me out to be some puritan.

WeaverByBirth,82,,118,17wtrh,,480,"I have pre-ordered a Full Sheet ice cream cake for my Kid's Birthday. Since it was an ice cream cake and I don't have big fridge to keep the full size cake, I told them to keep it in their shop and I will pick it just before the cake cutting. 

When everyone gathered and we were ready for cake cutting, I have asked my friend to pick-up the cake as I was with my kid and guests. Apparently, the cake maker messed up the size and decorated a half sheet cake instead of a full sheet cake. I was shocked to see such a small size cake and called them and they argued that it was a full sheet cake. 

I wasn't ready to argue as the kids and guests were waiting for cake cutting, so I had my kid cut the ice cream cake and distributed the ice cream cake to kids and bought another full sheet regular cake from a near-by shop to serve the adults.

Next day, I went to the shop with the cake box (empty) to prove that they gave half-sheet instead of full-sheet. They realized the mistake and asked me to talk to the owner (these are franchisee). Owner was a rude Asian lady and didn't bother to apologize or anything. She said that she will give a small cake to compensate the difference between the half-sheet and the full-sheet. Since we ate the cake, I didn't want 100% refund, I was reasonable and asked only 50% of what I have paid (55$ of 110$ I have paid in advance). 

She said that I am stinky and trying to make use of their mistake. I have clearly repeated that I am just asking 50% refund. That lady didn't even bother to listen to me. I told her to keep everything and I walked away. Later I told this to my friend and he suggested to dispute the transaction in my Credit card. I did the same and Amex refunded 110$ back to me on the next day. 

PS: I have donated 55$ to charity promptly.

Snowreaper,163,,157,1f376i,,478,"The folks over at talesfromthepizzaguy thought you /pettyrevengers might like this story. So here goes.

Waaay back in the day i delivered for this place that stayed open till 4am. Working till 4am can be tiring but drunk tips are some of the best tips, especially in a college town so its worth it.

The place i worked at had a deal on Mondays for a large 1 topping pizza with a large drink. It came to $7.16 out the door. We would make bank on Mondays, the high volume made up for the low dollar amount of orders. On Mondays its best to try and bunch things together to maximize your time to $$ ratio. I'd do whatever i could to make sure i was getting paid. I'd check the addresses of the upcoming orders and try and time things to get orders i knew were to good tippers, drive faster or slower to avoid something that would take me out of the way or have me going to a known bad tipper.

Well one Monday i couldn't avoid this order. This was from a regular that lived on the very farthest edge of our delivery area in a seedy part of town and never ever tipped. Ever. Not even the change. He'd ask for all his money back down to the penny every time. And the dude had money, he'd always answer the door in some expensive track suit too. Well i got his order along with a couple on the way to take the sting out of things. This was in the middle of rush, so by the time i would get back to the shop, the orders would have come and gone,so not only am i going to not be tipped, I'm going to lose out on a lot more money just making this order. This greatly upset me. All the drivers were sick of this clown and his penny pinching ways! So i decided to get some revenge.
Did i mention its late fall, early winter? Did i also mention this takes place in Michigan? No? Well both of these are true.

So i drop off my other 2 orders and Mr.Regular is last of course. I take his pie and wedge it up under the passenger side windshield wiper and start my trip to his house in the ass end of nowhere. I pull it about a mile from his house and its ice cold. Now there's no way he's going to accept this super icy ice cold box. Being the quick thinker that i am i put the pie on passenger side floor and blast the floor heat. It should be noted that the heater in a 87 Honda Civic should have a setting called blast furnace. I get to his house, and the box is piping hot and the pizza is ice cold. Head up to the door, everything is normal, he demands his exact change. I look him in the eye and say, ""Thanks man. Much appreciated."". On the surface I'm thanking him for the business but we both understood i was thanking him for nothing.

Well by the time i get back to the shop, he's called in and actually got to speak to the owner. He was livid that it was so cold! I could actually hear him a few feet away from the phone receiver. So the owner asks me, ""Snowreaper, whats up with this guy? Says his pizza is cold."" I told the owner, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. He lives on the edge of our delivery area and he never tips. Not ever. And he didn't tip when i went out there, so he should be happy he's getting a $7 pizza."" Another driver piped up and backed me up saying he hated delivering to that guy and never got tipped ever. The owner, bless that man, chewed out Mr. Cold Pizza! ""YOU NEVER TIP MY DRIVERS AND YOU COMPLAIN?!?! YOUR LUCKY WE STILL DELIVER TO YOU! IF YOU ORDER AGAIN AND I HEAR YOU DIDN'T TIP YOUR BLACKLISTED!!!"" and with that he hung up on him. Took the guy a few weeks to work up the courage to order again, but by god, he tipped a buck and the change from then on.

*edit* put some spaces in so its not so horrible, but not as many as SEGirl did since she's already done it.

*edit#2* I see a lot of comments about tipping delivery drivers. Allow me to provide a singular reason to tip your delivery driver. You see, the word tip isn't just a word, its also an acronym. T.I.P = To Insure Promptness.
Feel free not to tip, your delivery will not be prompt, and in this case it will be ice cold. :)",So you don't tip but your a regular are you? Xpost from /talesfromthepizzaguy,635,pettyrevenge

The best part, which I only realized after we got the date from the city marriage office, was that the date we were given was my ex's birthday. All our mutual friends came to our wedding, so her birthday party was probably deserted.

perfectsolitudex3,48,,91,132ogv,,478,"On a particularly busy evening, two women walked into the restaurant I work in. We had about a 45 minute wait so I informed them as I took their name. The woman whose name I took, Catherine, was pissy she had to wait so long but waited anyway.

A little while has passed and I continued to call names and seat people as tables were available. After calling a couple who had been waiting outside, Catherine came up and started flipping the fuck out. I'm horrible with names but I remembered this pissy bitch.

Before I continue: my wait list was a full page. I had the first quarter crossed out and the rest untouched. You could look at the list and clearly see that I was calling people in the correct order. 

So I asked her what the problem was, she told me (still yelling) that they had come in after her and that she was waiting over an hour when I said it'd be thirty minutes. I asked her what her name was, and she angrily said ""Catherine."" I then asked how many people (irrelevant) and she angrily replied , ""two."" I took as long as I could to find her name (even looked at the second page of names I had, though I knew she was on the first). 

I sweetly said, ""oh! Here you are!"" and showed her my list. What Catherine didn't realize is that I wrote down the time she walked in the door and the amount of time I quoted her. So I said, again sweetly, ""hmmm...no I said it'd be about 45 minutes and I said that at 5:15, it's 5:32 now so you still have about 25-30 minutes left. Sorry for the confusion!"" 

She huffed, walked away, and didn't bother me again after that :)

Crunshy,43,,133,1l6na9,,476,"So basically my brother always does this disgusting (Personal opinion) thing where he drinks from bottles in the fridge, I expressed to him one day that I found it horrible you know germs and all getting all round the bottle and then wash-back so on. Is it really that hard to pour it into a glass? One fine day I bought a nice 2L bottle of coke, now this drink is for me and me only and I told my family that my shit is my shit and no one touches it. Anyway my brother after I told him constantly did this drinking from the bottle shit. I hated it I just can't stand it and he knew this and exploited it all the time. Anyway I finish my coke off one night and decide to get some payback for this shit he does to me.

So I take this empty bottle of coke and find all sorts of evil shit in my cupboards with the main base being Soy sauce for the colour. So I start filling this bottle up soy being the largest amount and that alone is disgusting but I added vinegar, pure cordial, Whisky (He hates whisky) And then poured in some Tonic water for the fizz just to convince him it was coke

So I leave the bottle in the fridge and go to bed. The next day I keep hinting about it being my coke and no one touches it so on, another thing he likes to do is steal my things so I already knew the idea of drinking it was tempting for him and so the idea rolled in his head but he didn't take it, he just wasn't biting my bait at all. Step forward a few days and now I feel all hope is lost in this master plan I thought would work so well when in he comes from work just as dinner is almost served. So he comes in open the fridge and does what i'm sure a lot of us do, scans up and down pointlessly looking for something to drink even though we don't want anything. This is when I see his face light up a little he reaches for it and out he brings my ""Coke"" bottle, so I started acting up a lot more than normal knowing what he would now do. That is when he does it, the bottle gliding towards his mouth like a rocket ship going into space and it sinks in he gulps and gulps his eyes full of joy until all of a sudden he drops the bottle and that smug look turns to one of shear horror tasting the contraption I had worked up for him.

By this point i'm crying with laughter, I'm on the floor rolling with joy at the situation it was brilliant. I couldn't have expected it to go any better than that. Since this day he has never drank from a bottle or stole any of my stuff.

lanni957,55,,101,1hreq0,,480,"I was told to post this here as well.

I worked for a few years as a sales associate at a clothing/skateboarding store. One day three young girls (maybe 12 years old) came running and yelling into the warehouse sized store, split up and hid behind different racks of clothing, in amongst the hanging clothes.

Less than a minute later another girl came in the store and asked if we had seen some girls come in. At first we thought they were just playing hide and seek or something but it became clear that these three girls were bullying their ""friend"" and were hiding from her for that reason. This poor girl was not dressed as nicely as the others nor was she as skinny.

She was also the only one who wasn't white.
My south-asian co-worker got really upset after seeing this all go down and turned to me and said ""watch this"".

While the girl was looking around for her friends it took everything I had not to just tell her where they were, but I wanted to see what my co-worker would do.
He disappeared into the back room and came out with our manager following him. He then pointed at where one of the girls was hiding, then walked back to me.
SIDE NOTE: This girl had decided to hide directly infront of an air conditioner vent that constantly became stuck in place, and needed a good punch (which neither he or I could deliver) in order to open the large slats up.
My co-worker told my manager (and 5""11, 225lb weightlifter) that he had tried to get it open earlier in the day and couldn't.

I watched as my manager ignored the clothes in front of the vent and threw his fist into the wall as hard as he could. He wasn't expecting the clothes to start screaming. Nor did he expect a little girl with a very bloody nose to step out from behind the wall of shirts.

My co-worker watched smugly as my manager offered apology upon apology to the girl, who simply ran out of the store crying, followed by the group of girls. We never heard from them again.

chocozuna,36,,73,1advtq,,480,"I'm an IT administrator at a mid-sized company.  While my job responsibilities are primarily infrastructure and server maintenance, I will assist with lower level tickets when the help desk is overloaded.  Not because I have to, but because I want the department to look good and to help out my coworkers.  

So one day, I picked up an older ticket that was stagnating in the queue.  I thought the delay in resolution was due to a difficult issue, but instead it was due to a difficult user.  The whole time I'm fixing her problem, she's complaining about how our department is so slow and that we are all incompetent.  She is inches from my ear saying this, but I do my best to ignore her and just focus on her screen.  She doesn't take kindly to being ignored, so she ups the volume and specks of spittle start to fly past my face.  People in nearby cubes are looking at me, although most seemed to be sympathetic as they were accustomed to this lady's behavior.  I later find out this is why the help desk is reluctant to assist her, though the tickets have target dates and we look bad when they are not met.

I fix her computer and leave slightly damper than when I arrived.  Back at my desk, I think of what I can do to avenge myself and my compatriots.  I want to mess with her somehow, but not in a way that would cause a lot more work for the IT department.  In the end, I settled on a three-pronged revenge:

1) Looked up her favorites and added all non-work related sites to the blocked list on our filter.  When she asked for me to unblock some, I said that sadly they were blocked for the entire company and there is nothing I could do.  Then I went ahead and gave override privileges to people I liked.
2) I'm one of the last to leave the office, so every now and then I will power off her computer by holding the button down.  I do it locally to ensure no logs are left of the shutdown.  This makes it so that she has to power her machine up the next morning, having to wait 5+ minutes before she can clock in for the day.  I take great pleasure in knowing I am denying her several cents each time (once every ~3 weeks.)  I would do it more often, but then we'd have to replace the computer and I wouldn't be able to blame it on ""power spikes.""
3) The final piece involves changing her password once every month or two to something completely random.  I then tell her I reset it to something like Password8, whereas I really make it Password*.  She'll type it a bunch of times unsuccessfully, after which I ask her to step aside.  I then proceed to type it slowly so she can see my fingers, but she never sees me hold shift down for the last character.  The end goal of this is to convince her that she's either really bad at typing, or that she's slowly going insane.

JunkyardRose,61,,103,1fvtww,,475,"So a few years ago, I lived a very short walk from a local bar and above closest pizza shop. Every weekend, when the bar closed everyone who had been drinking would stumble their way down the street to the pizza shop for some late night drunken-munchies. It can get quite loud between the 'woo-girls' and the drunk jock's but I usually slept through it fine. The stairwell to get up to my apartment (the only one up there) was next to the pizza shop entrance and had a big 'privet property' sign on it. Usually I kept that door locked, but I'd had friends over earlier in the evening and when they left they must have forgotten to lock it. 

A few hours after I'd gone to sleep, I wake up hearing yelling and laughing in my stairwell. It takes me a moment to come to, but then I realize that drunk people are sitting in my stairwell eating pizza and being loud. It didn't really bother me they were in there...but then I smelled cigarette smoke. I don't smoke, and it pissed me off my apartment would smell. Also...they woke me up. Not cool. 

I got up without turning on any lights, and peeked through the crack of the curtain on the door. I could see two of them sitting against my door on the doorsil, and three more sitting on stairs right below them. The apartment was pretty old and crappy (=cheap!! I didn't care) so the door itself had about an inch and a half of clearance from the doorsil at the bottom...

THE REVENGE
I quickly and quietly grabbed my mop bucket, and a dustpan. I wedged the dustpan under the door, so I could pour water on it, and it would direct it out and under the door without getting all over my floor. Then I used the mop bucket (filled in the tub) to unleash a torrent of water from under the door. As I heard screams and curses, I flipped on the lights and swung open the door and started yelling ""get the fuck out of my apartment!!"". The two that were sitting on my doorsil were SOAKED all down the backs of their jeans...the ones sitting below them didn't get it quite as bad, but was still pretty good. Once I got a look at them, they were no more than 16-17. Scared the everloving-snot out of them, but they shouldn't have bothered me. 

Oh yeah...did I mention it was January, and this is eastern Canada? They were in for a chilly walk home.

Meekly, two people look out the window. I see them and shout out something along the lines of 'WTF are you doing throwing shit out the window?' They start calling me names, and berrating and laughing at me, etc, and close the window. What they assume, is that I don't live in that building.

Not a big deal, but it was annoying. One day I'm in class and a teacher comes in and goes up to me and says ""You left your lights on, go out and shut them off when you can."" I thank her, and on my way out to my car I realize that it's not my car, but the bastard who's been stealing my spot. Walked smugly back inside, said nothing.

MrsQuess,24,,119,1rawsw,,472,"I seriously did not get along with my sister growing up.  She moved back into my parents' 2 bedroom apartment when I was 16.  She was four years older.  So we had to share a room and I didn't even like the chick. I was the angsty, artsy type and she was the prep.  We just clashed!
So, my parents refused to get me a stereo that had a CD player on it because they thought CDs were just a passing trend.  It just wasn't a logical birthday or christmas gift for me. I had finally saved up enough baby sitting money to buy my own stereo and I didn't want to share it with my sister.   I'd come home from school and she would be listening to it loudly on some country station.  I hated anything she did so I was always shitty with her.   
One of the reasons I chose the stereo I did was because it had a remote control with it and I thought that was coolest.  It was poorly designed because if you hit mute on the remote, you could not unmute the stereo from the stereo itself.  It had to be unmuted by the remote control.  Once I figured this out, I just put my stereo on mute whenever I left the house and took the remote control everywhere I went just so she could not use it.",Took the remote with me.,591,pettyrevenge

While the used high-end audio community is generally fantastic and trustworthy, a few years ago I did run into one unsavory character.

I paypalled him $400 for a pair of headphones which, months later, never arrived. Over that time there were tons of emails and messages back and forth, which were just repeated versions of ""Oh, sorry dude, I was really busy this week, will definitely send them out ASAP."" He also tried at one point to tell me that he had sent them and the post office had lost them (lie).

After doing some poking around, I found out that this guy had a bad reputation for pulling stuff like this - a number of folks on the site I was using and others complained about getting ripped off by him.

So, after a while, I got fed up and issued a final warning, and still got nothing.

Unfortunately for this guy, I knew his real name and where he lived, and it was easy enough to find him on Facebook and MySpace. I looked through his friend list, and picked out 15-20 people who either a) had his last name (family members), b) had recently posted on his facebook or myspace page (they are clearly in touch), or c) were old (I assumed they were family friends of his parents).

I sent each of them a message asking them to get in touch with the guy and get him to stop pulling this stuff before he got in real legal trouble, with links to various complaints across internet boards of this kid ripping people off. 

I got an immediate change in tune, an apology, and a headphone shipment within a week.

Prospect212,96,,107,1c83es,,473,"A year or two ago, there was a group of young teens that loved to play street hockey in our court.  This is a townhome complex with shared parking spaces.  My home is at the end with the 'overflow' parking, which leaves me many spaces to choose from.  With the lot in this area being so empty, it is an optimal place to play street hockey and set up a net.  Perfectly acceptable, I loved doing these things when I was a kid, but be respectful of other people's homes and cars.

My girlfriend was tired of walking out every morning to hockey sticks and the net behind her car each morning leaving for work.  Also, their gear (skates, gloves, pucks) would be in our yard.  After asking the kids to pick up after themselves to no avail, I spoke with the parents.  ""The parking lot is my kid's backyard, as far as I'm concerned,"" was the Father's response to my bringing it to his attention.  

Instead of reporting to the HOA, I decided PettyRevenge was more my liking.  Late one night, after they left their equipment out again behind her car, I picked up their skateboard ramps, gloves, balls, pucks and net and placed them in my shed.  I then took them to the landfill the next morning.  The hockey sticks and skates needed to send another message.  I took note of the car the Father drove and noticed he always backed in.  Given the time he left in the morning was still dark outside, I placed the hockey sticks and skates in front of his tires, out of sight.  The next morning after I did this part, I noticed the sticks were not there (He did run over them, as splinters and plastic were on the pavement) nor the skates.  

Whether it was a lesson to the Father or the kids (or both) is not my concern.  They were out money and materials. Since that day, there has been no equipment behind her car.","""The Parking Lot is My Kid's Backyard""",580,pettyrevenge

ashlya,34,,103,1pookd,,467,"So, yesterday was Halloween. There was a party and as a result, I felt like crap this morning. I still have to work though, with it being Friday. Anyway, while on the train this morning, I saw a woman get up and move to an empty seat across from her. I took the opportunity to take the empty seat since, anyone who had taken the morning train at rush hour knows, they are hard to get. I noticed the woman who moved glaring at the guy on my left, but he wasn't a bum nor did he smell, so I ignored it.  
  
Then... I found out why she was glaring at him. He was pretending to be asleep and proceeded to maneuver his arm so his elbow was jabbing into my side, under my arm. His legs were also spread apart, constantly pushing against mine. The jist was: he was trying to get as much space to himself as possible by forcing the people sitting next to him to move due to the discomfort.  
  
You know what. I was really tired and felt shitty; I was not going to move out of the seat because of some jerk. Two can play this game. Slowly, my arm began to move back until I was pushing his arm against the seat. Every jerk of the train resulted in my arm moving back even more. I also pushed my leg against his, creating more space for myself. (Mind you, I didn't have it affect the person sitting to my right.) The guy realized what I was doing and began trying to push back, but I was a fucking wall. He couldn't move me unless he wanted to make it really obvious. And guess what - I was taking the train to the last stop.  
  
He finally gave in and moved his arm, but then proceeded to put his hand on his thigh, with his pinky touching mine. Another attempt to make me uncomfortable and move. I still wasn't going to give in and move. So, when he got to his stop, after he tried to push me one last time while getting up, I stuck out my foot and made him stumble on his way out.

win32ce,53,,80,1kuws1,,468,"This happened a few years ago but clicking around here made me want to share. I’m a fully grown, mature adult man, and not at all proud of this but it is pretty funny.

I was flying on per-merger Continental Airlines in coach, when they were experimenting with how close seats could be before people died. I was sitting in my isle seat with my knees pressed against the seat-back in front of me, when the woman in that seat decided to violently recline into my kneecaps – I cried out in pain and wrestled my poor legs free, and she seemed to be actually trying to push the seat back harder against me! She huffed and rolled her eyes (which I could see now that I was standing) and pretended to sleep. 

I wiggled back into my seat, legs tucked sideways, seething. My seat didn’t recline as it was in front of an exit row, so I was stuck in the dental hygienist position behind my bully. The people around me politely pretended they hadn’t noticed the spectacle. I decided this woman would not be sleeping on this flight. I looked at my watch and thought six and a half minutes would be just enough time for someone to almost get to sleep. So at exactly 6.5 minutes, I pretended to adjust my tray table and jostled her seat until she moved enough that I was SURE she was awake. Nobody noticed.

I spent the next 390 seconds planning my next covert move – getting something from my bag under the seat – and executed it with perfect timing. This went on for over three hours. I didn’t miss a single interval. At one point she must have managed to nod off because I had to literally bounce her up and down and pitch her head forward before she moved on her own. All of this was meticulously covered by some well planned, normal-looking action from me. Not a single glance from the reading or napping passengers sitting next to me, or sitting next to my assailant / victim.

I felt like my need to adjust my legs, go into my bag, change the tray table position, stretch etc. might start to look suspicious, so I planned to stand up and go to the restroom on the next tick. That would justify quite a wallop on the top of her seat without seeming suspicious at all.  When the time came I stood up, cramming my shoulder into her headrest and sending her flopping forward. It was beautiful and I was oh, so satisfied as I took the isle and turned to the back of the plane –

EVERYONE within the next several rows was grinning at me! People in middle seats were craning their necks, a boy sitting behind me was elbowing his dad.  It was like being a kid caught modeling your mom’s bra – beyond embarrassing, absolutely nothing to say to defend yourself. I just had to get myself together and take my walk of shame to the restroom. I washed my blushing face and went back to my seat.

Exiting the plane I was behind her and I gave her wheeled suitcase bag a little nudge to hook it on the bulkhead as we left. She stumbled and had to stop and pick it up; she looked a mess. Someone behind us was laughing hysterically, maybe about something else.

TL,DR; Bitch crushed my legs on a plane so I shook her awake over a dozen times.

[deleted],128,,87,1e38w3,,468,"Me and my girlfriend went to go see Iron Man 3 last weekend for the Friday night showing. Big turn outs at my local theater. So much so that for each showing of Iron Man 3 there was a line outside of the theater designated for the order of entrance, because they couldn't have the lines inside the theater probably because of how many people there were and the confusion it would cause. Me and my girlfriend decided it was worth the 45 minute wait outside to be basically first in a line to get the best seats. 

Well the 45 minutes pass and a couple about the same age as us cuts in front of some people in front of us as they let the line go inside the theater to grab some seats. No way. Fuck you. We still sit exactly where we want, upper theater in the very middle, but these two assholes sit right in front of us. Well I let 10 minutes pass and I go find the theater manager and say, ""Hello. Sorry to interrupt but I've been looking for you for ten minutes now. These people cut in line and as a result have taken away good seats from people who waited."" Being the cool guy he was, he comes with me and I point them out. They are then ordered to either leave the theater or wait until everyone else is seated before they can sit again. Well they must have decided to just stay because they sat in the very first row all the way to the right. 

Haha. Fuck you two. 

Edit: To add some important context I missed. Yes cutting the line annoyed me, but I could have sucked it up. As we sat there, I listened to them laugh at people how they couldn't find seats.

It's in my pocket and vibrates and I let it go to voice-mail because this is an important meeting. Not 5 seconds later, another call. I let it go to VM again. 5 seconds later it begins to vibrate, so naturally I assume this must be an urgent phone call so I excuse myself from the meeting to take it outside. I missed it before I get out of the room. So I call the number back:

I explicitly wrote that *I*, me pretending to be the guy, was available at any time to include nights and accepted texts. I even encouraged people to reach me at work via fax or the work number.

PegasusCoffee,35,,78,1lhckd,,462,"I work as a Security Officer for a large company and I oversee a large facility. One of my duties is escorting people without IDs (new employees, expired IDs, or they just forgot them at home). It's an easy job, so I don't complain too much.

Well, one day I'm told I need to escort a woman from the Visitor's Gate to the HR Department for an interview. It's raining pretty heavily, but we've got all manner of raincoats, ponchos and hats to keep our hair and outfits clean and dry. I, myself have got a thick coat on, so I'm nice and snug in my own little dry paradise by the time I meet the interviewee. No big deal, right? Wrong- that's when things get interesting...

**The Transgression:**

I found her talking away on her phone with the most incredulous look over her face, just plastered there before continuing on with her yammering over the latest piece of celeb gossip. I try to get her attention, and she has the audacity to hold her finger up at me. Imagine I'd been the one interviewing her? Well, I wait about 20 seconds before clearing my throat and getting her attention; ""Ma'am?"" She pulls a very contrite voice and tells me she's on the phone and that she'll be done in a moment... and then says something about the ""royal baby"".

Finally, when she gets off the phone, I ask her why she had to delay her escort, which she scoffs at and shakes her head, telling me that I was already late (I wasn't) so any further lateness is ALSO my fault. As you can see, we're interviewing a real winner, here.

**Vengeance:**

I decide that this bitch isn't getting of scot-free. I look at the pouring rain and tell her that we should go. She demands a rain coat and a plastic bag for her handbag (lolwat?). I explain to her that we're out of rain coats (we're not), but we'll be taking a route to the HR Dept that's mostly covered by a roof (we're also not). She demands MY rain coat, and I ~~lie~~ explain to her that it's part of a certified uniform and that it is *illegal* for me to allow her to wear any part of it, including the rain coat, unless she's employed in our company.

Begrudgingly, she follows me to the HR Dept, shielding her bag from the rain while complaining about the route we're taking. Every time she tries to duck for a roof over her head, I insist that we're going some direction without a roof, or cover.

She arrives at the HR Dept with her makeup soaked, her clothes drenched, and her attitude smoldering with irritation and generic rage.

**BONUS!**

I called HR after they'd finished interviewing the woman. I told them what had happened and it ended in me saying ""If you hire this woman, she'll be the biggest pain in the ass on staff."" She replied to my advice with laughter, followed by ""No shit.""

RuleThyNo,39,,93,1ep4bq,,470,"English isn't my first language but I will try to describe this as clear as possible.



Ok so this is something I do frequently, but I will tell you how it started.

My grandmother lives in a farily big apartment complex, with parking spaces right in front of the building. I go there to have lunch with her once a week. Three of this spaces used to be reserved for visitors but about a 6 months ago they changed into spaces for an eye shop, so I didn't park there anymore. But about a month later I noticed that the spaces were always empty. So I thought I can still park there no one would mind.

I did this for maybe 4 weeks, as I was pulling up to the parking spaces the next week there was a car parked right across all three of the spaces. I thought what an idiot, parked my car elsewhere and went inside. I told my grandmother about the car and she said that it belonged to one of the eye shop employees and that she did this on purpose so I wouldn't park there anymore.

Now I would understand if she came to talk to me or something like that, if I blocked the spaces and costumers of the eye shop had to park elsewhere. But that was not the case they were always empty, and even if it was, when she parks her car across all the spaces the costumers couldn't park there too.

**My Revenge:** I made a flyer for courses on how to park your car for driving rookies and free theory lessons on what a parking space is and how to use it. I thought it was hilarious. I put it under her windscreenwiper and she never parked there again. I was so proud with myself that I printed out a whole bunch of it and put them on badly parked cars I see everywhere.

And it makes me laugh everytime.

schismtomynism,39,,62,12qi26,,464,"I used to work at a grocery store during my teenage years as a cashier, stock boy, cart pusher... pretty much whatever they asked me to.  This grocery store was surrounded on three sides (all but the street, obviously) by an old folks home.  Most of the time, the people from the home walked to the grocery store, not because they really needed anything, but because they wanted exercise, something to do, and generally just socialize.  This was generally pretty convenient, because I usually LOVE talking to older folks.  With the exception of loose 20 something females, they're my favorite people.  I even thought like this during my angst-filled teenage years.

Now, I've read several posts on here of the horrors people encounter as a cashier.  While I can relate, I generally have a pretty high tolerance for other people's bullshit (for better or worse).  So, an older woman that I recognized came to my line with a bunch of empty bottles that she wanted to return for the 5 cent deposit.  Now, we have a bottle room with machines for that.  It wasn't my job to redeem bottles at the register, but I knew how to, and I felt like being nice.  So I scanned each bottle/can (5 cents each, with a grand total of $1.25 or so... that's a lot of bottles), but two of them did not scan (because we do not sell that brand out our store).  When I explained this to her, she went FUCKING CRAZY.  She threw a glass bottle across the store and stormed out.  This was over 10 cents.  Jesus.

Anyway, my manager had me close my line, and explain to him in the office what happened... no problem.  Once I was done, they had me go outside and push carts for a bit with my best friend, Kevin.  Now, Kevin is not a normal kid.  He's built like a brick shit-house, he's allergic to everything, and has a high-functioning case of asbergers syndrome.  He has a heart of gold, though, and is one of the best people I've ever met.  He also lives RIGHT next to the old folk's home, and walks through there every night to get home.

So, we were gathering a line of carts (about 15 or so), and a car backs up out of their spot (obviously not looking) and pins me between the line of carts and their buick.  Not HARD.  I didn't suffer any injuries, but it still really pissed me off.  I knocked on the trunk so they knew ""hey, maybe i should release this poor 16 year old kid.""  That's exactly what happened, until they backed up AGAIN, doing the same exact thing.

My best friend, Kevin, went to the drivers side window of the car and said ""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, YOU FUCKING CUNT?!""  There was no answer.  I guess this person isn't used to being called a ""fucking cunt"" on a daily basis.  I got out of the way, and went inside to tell my manager what had happened.  By the time we got back, the car had driven off, apparently like a bat out of hell.

I thought this was the end.  Nope.  Kevin got off of work an hour before me, and asked me to come over.  I knew the shortcut through the old folk's home, and walked over there.  After playing goldeneye (yeah, those were the days) for about an hour he said ""I want to show you something.""  He brought me to the old folk's home, and showed me the same car that hit me.  Turns out it was the SAME woman that flipped a shit at me earlier that day over 10 cents.  What was special?  Kevin seriously took a MASSIVE dump on the hood of the car, picked it up, and smeared into the windshield ""DIE CUNT.""

1) There are a lot of pets at my house. 4 chickens, 3 cats, 2 dogs and a snake. One of the cats is my husband's and the chickens are my mum's but the other pets are mine.

2) My husband and I live with my mum and maternal grandmother. My grandmother has dementia so she needs a full time carer, which is what I do while my husband and mum work full time.

3) My sister in law had her first kid in October 2012

4) My husband and I are childfree, which means we never want kids, biological or adopted. My husband likes kids and is great with them, just doesn't want them while I don't like them at all, plus I'm terrified of pregnancy to the point of it being a phobia.

Anyway, I got my pet snake in July last year, which my SiL thinks is crazy. When I told her about him, she was asking things like ""What if it bites you? The venom will kill you!"" To which I replied ""He's a python. They aren't venomous."" Then she said ""It'll strangle you and eat you!"" So I told her ""No he won't. He'll grow to 1.4 metres max, and for his species that's rare."" But she just kept harping on stuff like that so I changed the subject.

Few months later, in October, she had her first kid. My husband and I went to visit her and the bub when they were out of hospital and I also told her that we were in the process of adopting a 2nd dog when we moved back to my mum's place. I was excited to share my news since I love dogs and hadn't been able to live with one for 6 years while we lived in an apartment building. My dog from before I moved out of home had been living with my mum all that time. My SiL just looks at me with a disapproving expression and says ""Two new pets in 12 months? Why would you want another pet but no kids? What's wrong with you?"" 

Needless to say, I was angry, but I kept my cool. I just excused myself and went outside for a cigarette. Her husband came outside with me and apologised for her explaining she was stressed about their kid, but it still stung. I find it hard to muster up enthusiasm for people when they tell me they're pregnant cos I don't understand the appeal, but I act like I am and turn the brain to mouth filter up to 11 so I don't offend.

So anyway, 8 months go by, I've had my awesome dog since November, her baby is a dream kid that hardly cries, she's doing a great job as a mum and everything is good. We go to visit her, her husband and the kid a few weeks ago. After we give her a hug goodbye she says ""Guess what? You were just hugging two!"" She's pregnant again. I just couldn't help myself and said ""Pregnant twice in 12 months? Why would you want another kid? What's wrong with you?""

Problem is, no one else in my group did anything the entire time. One dude helped me set up the tripod to take the video, but they've basically just written down everything that I've written down. And there are still plenty of things to do for the report - the things I did would only equal to about 60% of the project, so I still needed them to help too, you know, being a group project and all. We all sat down, and they all talked about going to the fucking beach for spring break, which, fine, whatever, but at least use the class period to work on the project. But no, every time I walk behind her computer she's on Facebook. The other two are talking about how they want to get into Vanderbilt (no, seriously). I don't say anything, I'm being polite, and I just give them the benefit of the doubt and leave for break and maybe they'll have something, even if it is only a vague inclination of what the hell we're supposed to be doing. I mean, it's their grade, too. They need this class, too. So hopefully they'll help me out with our project.
So I come to class on Tuesday after break with all my shit, and no one else has anything fucking done. I should add that everyone in my group is around 18 and I am going to be 24 this year (I fucked around a lot in my late teens, so college was a couple of years late) and no one else is concerned at all about having approximately zero of our required 11 pages completed one day before the shit is due. So I sat at the computer in lab for an hour and 45 minutes trying to plot and calculate the acceleration of an object in a fuzzy video clip and make a graph of the motherfucker, and my lab group sat behind me and talked about old Nickelodeon cartoons for the entire class. Seriously. Other groups were telling my group to shut their shit because they were trying to work.
I tried emailing my professor about it since yesterday morning, but he hasn't replied yet. I talked about it with another person who used to be in a lab group with some members of my lab group (we are reassigned lab groups before every new project), and he said he has brought up their lack of work and input on their last project before to our professor, and he basically told him that as long as it was getting done, it didn't matter who did what.
I was scrambling tonight trying to fucking finish everything that no one else had touched, but after about two hours, I decided I just don't give a fuck anymore. None of them have answered my emails from the past two days. I guess they assume that I'm going to finish the report because I've already done most of it. But they're in for a nice fucking surprise.
I logged into my student account online and dropped the fuck out of that class. This was the final week to withdraw, and I did, and tomorrow morning when they come in, I'm going to be a fucking sleep, and they're going to have approximately none of the assignment finished. Even if they start from scratch tomorrow and really pound it, they still won't have time to finish. None of them have shit done because they expected me to do it, and I just decided that I don't care anymore. That may have been a shit thing to do, but keep in mind that I was prepared to turn in everything that I had done if they had only replied to my emails and drawn a goddamn picture of our experimental set-up. So, fuck it. Fuck them. Fuck that class. I don't want to be a doormat anymore.
Anyway, thanks for listening.

It was pretty much the go-to place to get smokes and snacks for every bar-goer for 2 or 3 blocks in every direction. On a particularly busy weekend night I was slinging cigarettes to drunk people when an obnoxious bro-y type douche walks in talking loudly on his cellphone. He thought it was more important to complete what I'm sure was a profound thought to his likely equally stupid friend who he was talking to, than it was to be polite and just order his damn cigarettes. As he's talking a few more people walk into the store and start piling up behind him. When he has finally finished what he was talking about he takes a moment to bark his order without so much as glancing at me and continues vomiting vacuous sentences into his phone. He slides a $10 onto the counter while looking away and continues to yammer on. I ring him in and place his cigarettes on the counter. He keeps talking some more before he finally grabs his cigarettes and hangs up. Finally, he turns to me and says, ""How much were those?"" I think I know what has happened in his tiny little brain so without hesitating I say ""$9.97"" or whatever it was and he proceeds to PAY FOR HIS CIGARETTES AGAIN. He was so wrapped up in his cellphone conversation that he'd forgotten or didn't realize he'd already paid. I took his second $10 didn't ring him in and he left.

BurnerAcctNo1,27,,83,1g7g14,,461,"I might be called a dick for this one but I'm not sure. I guess we'll see. 

One weekday morning, I hopped on the turnpike to head into work. I wasn't in the best of moods but this changed pretty quickly. This particular day, the traffic was more or less bumper to bumper(which is very rare, thankfully), when I noticed a lady in my rear view who was crisscrossing between lanes like an aggro idiot. For some reason, this really annoyed me.  

I was in the middle lane while she was in the left lane and it came a point where cars in front of her started to resume driving while she was stopped looking at her phone or what-have-you. With 5 or 6 car lengths between her and the car in front of her, I decide to switch into the left lane. She took offense to that for some reason so she did what every asshole tries to do; Speed up really fast to make it look like they're about to ram the back of the car in front of them. 

I see this in my rear view mirror and before she could hit her brakes to end the charade, I do a quick-stomp of MY breaks with like 4 cars worth of space between me and the car in front of me(Just like tapping the breaks, but extremely hard using a stomping motion so that the car's chassis appears to be screeching to a halt yet maintaining approx the same speed). 

She's clearly not ready for this, nor is the coffee she was holding at the time. I know this because, in my rearview, all I see is a light brown sheet of water pouring down from within her car's windshield.  

She jumps out of the car and I roll my window down because I'm honestly about to choke and die from laughing at this middle aged lady in a  gray pantsuit and a newly browned blouse storming out of her car screaming at me. Through my laughter and coughing, all I could get out was, ""That'll learn ya, dummy. Get back in your stupid car."" Before resuming driving and choke-cough/laughing my way to work. While still in traffic, I did notice to lady in the middle lane next to me laughing her ass off as well.   

After that, the day was actually pretty good.   

*Before you say I put other cars in danger, I really didn't. When the traffic resumed, no other car was flooring it to move forward. We were going at MOST 10MPH with no potential of that ending anytime soon.

The ladies are typical catty; they love themselves some juicy gossip, and me being the youngest, I'd always have to regale them with tales of my weekend. Quiet weekend? I was boring. Exciting weekend? ""No wonder you look so tired today."" If I clear my throat, ""Are you sick? You LOOK sick."" And being the youngest, I'm automatically the dumbest in their eyes (dumbest? most dumb? agh, the irony).

Also, the ladies are the type to be nice to their coworkers' faces, but as soon as said person is out of ear-shot, the unnecessary insults start. Calling them an idiot, making fun of their hair, saying they've put on weight, you name it!

Well, on the 3rd week, I brought in lunch from home, which included a sandwich and all the fixings. Thinking nothing of it, I put the bread in the toaster oven, set the timer, and came back to my desk. One of the old ladies starts freaking out ""Does anyone smell that? Does something smell like toast? I SMELL TOAST!! I ACTUALLY SMELL TOAST! THIS ISN'T A JOKE!!!!""

I totally went along with it. And by went along with it, I played dumb and acted like I didn't smell anything.

Kept it up until she asked the receptionist to call 911.

At that point, I got to play my dumb, young girl card, and simply said ""Oh! I AM making a sandwich... maybe the hot bread is what smells like toast?""

culofiesta,53,,84,1i3kg2,,457,"This happened years ago when I was 13. Our town had just opened a rec center complete with Olympic sized pool, weight room, track, sauna, video games, snack bar...for a kid that can't do anything it was a relief to finally have somewhere to go. My friend and I are waiting outside for my mom to pick me up when a couple in their forties walked by us. I saw them walk by and I sneezed at the same time.

""What did you say asshole?"" says the man. I honestly sneezed and didn't do it as a joke, I just happened to be looking at him at the same time. I told him it was an accident. When his wife chimes in; ""Let's just ignore the little bastards, honey. Kids are motherfuckers.""

I should add that this is an upper class suburb, not a trailer park. Adults usually don't go around talking like this. *Kids* don't go around talking that way. 

The man then got in my face, looking up at me. ""You got a problem, you little punk?""

I was really confused how I got in that position where moments ago everything seemed so peaceful. I told him again I sneezed, I didn't mean anything by it. His wife finally pulled him back inside.

Later that week I was working my glorious job as a supermarket bagger when guess who came through the checkout?

I quickly skipped over to that register and asked the bagger there if I could take over. I was still fuming about that asshole and knew I'd get caught but fuck it.

I started bagging his groceries, shoving them in the bag. Luckily he bought a lot of bread and eggs that day. I grabbed his bread and twisted it like I'm drying out gym towels and slammed the eggs on the bottom of the bag, opened the carton, broke a couple personally and stuffed everything possible in one bag so it would rip open soon after he got out to the parking lot.

All the while I have one eye on him, certain he'd see what was happening. He didn't. I slipped away before he caught me.

Surely he must notice as soon as he picks the bag up, right? 

Nope.

Then of course he'll see me watching him and say something rude right? It took less than that for him to threaten me last time.

Sees me, doesn't even recognize me.

Americandesserts,38,,130,1jncuy,,461,"**Accidental cake revenge**

I’ve ended up volunteering at the county fair this summer since I need a certain number of volunteering hours to get full credit on my GPA. Yesterday, I managed to get revenge on two people, but the first was accidental.

My job was at the 4-H booth, registering people’s submissions. A girl who had hated me, and I her, in elementary school, walked straight up to my table. She was carrying three pies she’d baked herself and wanted to have judged. I simply tried not to look at her, but under the pretense of adjusting the pie lid, which was on the table in front of me, she whispered in my ear, “Hello again, fuckface.” 

That was what she had called me when I was in fifth grade and she was in sixth. At that moment, all my rage at her came flooding back. I would have been willing to let it go, but she had to bring up taunts from five years ago. That was fine. I couldn’t do anything or say anything, or else I’d lose a valuable volunteer position I would need for years to come. 

My work partner volunteered me to carry this girl’s pies over to the display risers. I vowed to do my job perfectly, to set those pies down and to own it. However, the universe was angry at her on this day. 
My shoelace had somehow come untied, and I stepped on it as I made my way across the freshly-washed, smooth cement floor. Halfway to the risers, I fell, pies flying out of my hands. My chin slammed into the floor and I bit down hard on my tongue. Even the blood filling my mouth could not keep me from looking up joyfully as the three pies she’d worked so hard to make flew through the air. The lids were not secure and flew off. 

Two of them landed on the floor. One splattered on the risers. All three were ruined. 

I hadn’t even meant to do it, and yet, I had done the absolute best thing possible. She would get no credit for her 4-H project, she would not have a chance for a ribbon, and she would not get her hard work displayed with everyone else’s. I turned around and saw her standing there, openmouthed, as her mother rushed forward to try salvaging the confections. The work partner helped me to my feet and ran off to get paper towels. 

I stood there, trying not to swallow blood, and looked at her. She was standing frozen and white as a sheet. I raised one hand to shoulder height, waved with my fingers and smiled winningly. Her mother left without a word and she followed.

------------------------------------

**Bean revenge**

The second revenge was intentional. 

While I was sitting at the aforementioned desk, far earlier that day, there was a dry spell of people coming in to register. My work partner had not yet arrived so I was all alone, flipping through the fair book and wondering what the hell a muskmelon is (it’s like a cantaloupe, only a vegetable). 

A family of three walked by on my left. A teenage boy, a mother, and a father. They only had livestock books and didn’t have anything to register with me, so they had no business with me. I was sitting there, staring into space, chin on my hands, waiting for someone to arrive with a box of vegetables or flowers for me to catalogue. As the father passed by, he grabbed the table and yanked it out from under me, shouted “WAKE UP” and continued walking, chuckling to himself.

I know it sounds like something that belongs in /r/thathappened, but I swear I am telling the truth. Neither of his family members said anything to this man who just ripped the table out from under a teenage girl who was doing nothing but daydreaming. No one else was around. I pulled the table back and resolved to get revenge on this man.

After a while I was getting moved between 4-H (kids ages 8-19 who are in 4-H) and Open Show (anyone) registration desks. In one of the rare moments I was at the Open Show desk, the same man came over with a large plate of green beans. 

There are so, so many categories of green beans and I had learned quite a bit about them in my years at the fair. However, many of the judges cannot tell one type of bean from the other (perils of being run by volunteers) and simply trust the person who writes the tag as having them down as the right kind. Ny job was to make tags.

Immediately, my brain began whirring. How could I destroy this asshole? Then it came to me. I had been looking at beans and other vegetables all day. He told me they were a bush type. I had only had three entries of bush type green beans and I knew that these would easily win first prize, and 30 dollars, if they were entered. However, there were at least fifteen different types of pole green beans entered already. If you’ve ever seen a fair book that tells the classes of vegetables, you know how small the print is and how easy it is to make a mistake.

I wrote that he had pole type beans on the tag and put it on the risers, waiting. Everything would be judged the next day, and since this happened yesterday, my time was now.

This morning I came in and nonchalantly went over to the Open Show produce. The beans didn’t even win fourth. They had been surpassed by everything else. No cash prize for you, bitch.

It's hard to pass on the highway, and there are only a few place where you can safely do it.  I was doing what I consider a very reasonable 5 - 7 mph over the speed limit, but an asshole driving a semi insisted on tailgating me for miles, even though the chance for passing was virtually nill.  Normally I don't care too much about tailgaters, but having an 80,000 pound vehicle right on my ass that can't exactly stop on a dime was pissing me off.

So we eventually come to a river valley, and the river flat (prime for passing) is a couple miles long, with about a mile climb back up out of the valley on the far side.  I, being the nice guy I am, slowed down a bit when there was a generous gap in oncoming traffic, thinking the semi will take the opportunity to pass.  Did he, though?  Of course not!  That's why I'm here writing this.  He kept tailgating me, making no attempt whatsoever.  Asshole.  I sped back up, and when we started the climb up out of the valley I let up on the gas and slowed down to about 35 mph.  Of course he was nearly in my trunk, but I downshifted and gunned the car (turbo forester) and in no time I was doing 20 over the limit.  Before I crested the hill, I looked back, and there he was, belching black smoke, not even a third of the way up the hill.  Miles later, the next and final glimpse I get of him, he's a good 2 - 3 minutes behind me.  I had a smile on my face the rest of the drive home.

It's located right near a highway that leads up into Vermont, and because of that it gets a decent amount of business from out-of-towners driving up north for vacation.  The parking lot/pump area is a bit narrow; there's four pumps (room for two cars on either side), with a small entrance/exit on either end for people to come &amp; go.  It's difficult to explain the layout but there's a few car-lengths of space on either side of the pump area (between the pumps &amp; the entrances/exits) for waiting cars to line up.

Last summer I pulled into the station to gas up my car.  I'm friendly with all the kids that work there - we always shoot the breeze when they're filling my tank and I always tip them a few dollars for their effort (they have a sign saying not to tip but fuck that).  On this particular day this kid Alex happened to be working - he's a nice guy who I know fairly well and we've always had a good rapport.

A few minutes earlier, on my way to the station, I'd stopped to help a guy stuck on the side of the road - just a simple jump to his car, then we shook hands &amp; left.  Purely coincidentally when I got to the station the same guy happened to pull into the spot across the pump from me.  We'll call him Tim because I'm pretty sure that's what he said his name is.

Anyway, the story unfolds like this:

I was sitting in my car while the pump was running, bullshitting with Alex about who knows what.  Tim pulled in, recognized me, then got out to thank me again/ chit chat while Alex filled his car.  The three of us were standing there, pumps running for both cars, just shooting the shit and making small talk.  Two other cars then pulled in, filling all of the pumps and causing a situation where I'd probably have to back out of my spot in order to leave.  On an ordinary day that's no big deal and I didn't think anything of it at the time.

Then a shiny new Subaru with New Jersey plates pulled up behind me... *right* behind me.  I didn't even notice it until the woman behind the wheel honked her horn.  She yelled out the window ""Hey! *Stop talking!* You're in the way and *I'm* in a hurry!"" and honked again.  We all gave her dirty looks, Alex pointed to the pump sticking out of my car, waved her off, and we went back to our conversation.

Thirty or so seconds later the pump did that ""THUNK"" noise indicating my tank was full.  I got in my car, and Alex put the nozzle away and then stood there waiting for the machine to print out my receipt.  The Subaru woman honked again, and then said once more through her open window ""Excuse me, I'm in a HURRY?!"" in that annoying, upward-inflection &amp; bitchy tone of voice.

At this point I was fairly irritated but not enough for a confrontation.  I had my gas and this woman wasn't worth getting mad over.  So I went to back out of my spot (the car in front of mine was still there, actively being filled so it obviously wasn't going anywhere for a few minutes), and I realized that this Subaru had totally boxed me in.  I couldn't go anywhere, and that was that.  So I put my reverse lights on &amp; sat there waiting for her to get the message and back up - I figured that she would immediately let me out if she was in such a hurry to get gas and be on her not-so-merry way.  5 or so seconds passed.... and the woman honked again, then fucking *pulled forward* another foot until her bumper was 6 inches from mine.  At this point it was obvious to everyone else who was present that moving my car was out of the question - there were the gas pumps to my left and the brick-fucking-wall of the gas station building immediately to my right.  I was about to get out of my car and ask her to move when she honked one final time.

All of a sudden it was like a switch turned on, and this guy Tim absolutely lost his shit.  He was still out of his car, leaning up against the pump &amp; trying to maintain a conversation with Alex..... and after the final honk he turned and started ripping this woman a new asshole.  Full-force top-of-his-voice yelling, waving of the arms, flipping her off, etc.  It hadn't noticed this until he started yelling, but he was a pretty muscular guy &amp; cut quite an intimidating figure as he walked towards her car yelling his fucking face off:

""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME LADY?  YOU JUST FUCKING BOXED HIM IN, ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED?  ARE YOU A STUPID PERSON?!  HE WANTS TO MOVE BUT YOUR FUCKING CAR IS IN THE WAY!  HE CAN'T FUCKING GO ANYWHERE, OPEN YOUR FUCKING DAMN EYES!  HONKING ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE A GODDAMN THING IF HE CAN'T MOVE HIS FUCKING CAR YOU **BITCH**!""

Throughout his tirade I was standing there, awkwardly half in &amp; half out of my car, mouth completely open and shocked at the beauty of what I was hearing.  I am *not* a confrontational person so this exchange was wholly unexpected but was *massively* appreciated - he said everything I'd wanted to (but would never) say. The woman immediately put her car in reverse and sped out of the lot, flipping us all off as she went.  The three of us stood there and watched her drive the few hundred yards to the north-bound highway on ramp, and then onto the highway..... And then Alex started to crack up laughing and said ""the next exit with a gas station isn't for another 17 miles so if she runs out of gas she's *fucked*""",B*tch boxes me in at gas station and gets verbally assaulted by a guy who I'd just helped,511,pettyrevenge
Aaawww_Yeeeaaah,14,,82,1gep83,,460,"Ok, this is my uncle's story from a few years ago. 

Backstory:
He used to work as a mechanic, doing maintenance on helicopters. For a while he had an apprentice (or an intern or something) following him around shadowing him to learn how to take care of the copters. This guy ""Jimmy"" was terrible for leaving the windows open in the copters at the end of the day and bugs would come in all night. After several weeks, my uncle had had enough of listening to bitch and complain about them, as the bugs grossed him out and told Jimmy that he would be cleaning the bugs out from now on.

Revenge:
It was dusk. Jimmy had left for the night and Uncle was finishing clean up for the night when he notices that Jimmy has left a window open in one of the copters. Again. So he decides to give him something to complain about. Close the window so the bugs stay out? In time. But first, take the doors off all together! He also hung a light inside and went about his business cleaning up. About half an hour later he finishes up and puts the doors back on the copter, takes the light out and leaves. 

Results:
Jimmy comes in the next morning and finds the copter he's in charge of cleaning ALIVE with bugs. Every insect within a mile came to that light and now they were completely coating the inside of the copter. You couldn't even see inside, you just saw masses of bugs crawling around looking for an exit. Jimmy freaked out. He refused to clean it, bitched to my uncle when he came in and was simply reminded that he told him not to leave the windows open. While Jimmy went to complain directly to the manager of the facility, my uncle simply popped out the doors again, shook them off and when Jimmy returned not five minutes later, all the bugs were completely gone, so he couldn't even complain, which made him flip his shit even more. He stormed off in a rage. 
The manager gave my uncle his best ""Yeah, so this happened"" look and says: ""So you had some fun with Jimmy today, huh?"" My uncle shrugged and simply repeated: ""I told him not to leave the windows open."" 
I'm not 100% sure if Jimmy quit after that or if he just never left the windows open ever again, but either way he never had a problem with Jimmy ever again. 

TL;DR: My uncle had an intern who hated bugs but always left the windows open, so he FILLED a helicopter with bugs and told him to clean it. ",I told you not to leave the windows open...,542,pettyrevenge
BRE4KER,66,,80,1hvk48,,454,"This happened a few years ago when I was living in Los Angeles. I had just gotten a new-to-me (aka used) bicycle and was riding it around Venice Beach. They have a large area dedicated to foot traffic, bicycles, skateboards… non-motorized traffic. On this day I was feeling a little silly so I put a big shaggy wig on my bike helmet. So it looked like I just had a big brown mane of locks. The cool thing was it muffled the roaring sound of wind. I could hear everything around me pretty clearly. I think the wig was working like those shaggy covers on movie microphones. Even though the sound dampening was cool, the wig itself was hot as hell.

So like I said, I was riding along the concourse of Venice Beach when this rent a cop waves me down. Actually, he nearly tackled me. I come to a stop a few yards away. This guy, an overweight sweaty fellow, wearing an orange safety vest, proceeds to dash up to me. He stops in front of me, out of breath, and points right at my face. With his finger inches from my face he berates me for not wearing a bicycle helmet. He tells me it's illegal to ride a bicycle without one in California. Every time I try to tell him that I am wearing a helmet under the wig, he cuts me off with a flicking gesture of his hand. So I'm thinking to myself, ""Okay fine. If you want to play this out, then we'll play this out."" He gets on his radio and calls for the actual police. Meanwhile, I'm also pointing out all the other bicyclists that are riding around without helmets. He couldn't care less. Finally, two police officers, one female and one male, ride up to us on bicycles. The rent a cop proceeds to tell the male officer that I'm in violation of some code and I should be ticketed. All the while the female cop is looking right at the strap for my helmet. She asks me if I'm wearing a helmet. I tell her that I am in fact wearing one. I then take off the wig and leave the helmet on my head. The three of them stare at my helmet for a few seconds and then in unison the two police officers start laughing their asses off. The rent a cop looks like a damn fool.

Here's where my petty revenge comes in. After the cops caught their breath, I ask them if there is a law about wearing a helmet in California, making sure the rent a cop could clearly hear. The female police officer answers, ""No, but it's a good idea to wear one."" The male police officer then says, ""But, there are laws about false accusations."" Apparently, the police knew this rent a cop because they said something to him to the effect of, ""You need to stop doing this kind of thing."" Eventually rent a cop left and I was rewarded with a high five from the police officers for giving them the best laugh they had all day.","Rent-A-Cop ""Wigs"" out over non-helmeted bicyclist",534,pettyrevenge

About a month ago, Miss Entitled bought a shiny 2006 Lexus RX (ugly little soccer-mom SUV).  She drives this thing around like she's in a Ferrari, she actually broke down in tears last week because it rained a little bit and her 'new' car was outside.  I digress, however, so here we go.  Midweek, last week, I arrive home from work, proceed to open the garage, and guess who's now parked in my spot?  I assume she's going to leave eventually so I brush it off and go about my evening, she never leaves.  The next 2 evenings I return home from work and she's up to her old tricks, still parking in my spot.  I decide it's time to put my foot down.

Monday of this week I return home, and you guessed it, in my spot again!  Miss Entitled is spending the night (like she does every night) and I know she has to be up early for work.  I wait until my roommate and Miss Entitled are sawing logs and make my way into the garage.  I then proceed to replace her garage door opener batteries with some dead watch batteries I had laying around.  I test them to make sure they won't work, BINGO! 

I figured she'd be smart enough to check/replace the batteries, so I also go into the basement to the electrical panel and flip the circuit breaker.  I then head to bed and wait for the chaos.  Right around 5am I hear my roommate and Miss Entitled screaming at one another.  At one point I hear my roommate scream, ""Maybe if you'd just park your soccer mom car outside and quit taking Pvt-Richard's spot this wouldn't have happened!""  I'm in tears, Miss Entitled succumbs to my plot and now has to call a cab.

I return home that night and she's parked on the street, upon seeing this I give myself a round of applause and proceed to pull into the garage.

Peterhul,71,,86,1477pu,,455,"Short backstory, I'm a 2nd year uni student so I can't live on campus, so me and 3 friends moved into a 5 bedroom house together this year. To cut down our costs we thought we'd find a fifth housemate and get them to move into our spare room. After a while of searching with no luck on our end, our landlord told us someone had contacted him. We took the girl with no questions as we'd realised how much we'd save with someone else in the room.

She moved in, and while she makes no appearance in person, she makes the oddest noises I've ever heard. Bangs and furniture moving at 3am, screaming and laughing on skype all the time, strange videos being watched at weird times on full volume. And she does nothing. Fine, she doesn't use the kitchen (gets food delivered every day), but the bathroom gets into a state and she makes no effort to clean it. She spends more time in there than any of us (2+ showers/day and each is upwards of half an hour with the water going). She also (gentlemen, prepare your stomachs) has recently got into a habit of not flushing, and I'm not talking about piss and shit. This is one of my absolute phobias, makes me physically sick at the thought at times. She hasn't yet paid a bill (owes me money), and our costs are huge because she can't live without 2 heaters in her room 24/7 and her ridiculous showers. She's had arguments with our landlord, who is a lovely guy who sorts out anything straight away, but she just doesn't get the idea that it's a student house, it's not going to be a fucking palace. You get the picture, we are not fans of this person.


And then she moans about the internet. A LOT. None of us have a problem with it, but for some reason she thinks she's different. This is something I can help her with.

My mom is notorious for being a major hypocrite in our family. She will yell at us for eating too much junk food but will come home every day and eat half a (family sized) bag of chips while watching Ellen. She will get angry when anyone leaves the bathroom smelly but leaves the worst stench of them all when she is done. Most of all, she can be extremely inconsiderate. She will eat half of something, put it back in the pantry/fridge, and never finish it, but if we eat it, she yells at us because it was hers. This last thing she does is the topic of my revenge. Her car has a beeper that lets it be unlocked form a distance and if you press the button twice, the entire car gets unlocked. As I have seen with every other person with a car I know, it is common courtesy to unlock the whole car so eeryone can get in, but this does not occur to my mom despite us telling her of the fantastic feature her clicker has. Instead, she will only unlock her door, get in, buckle her seat-belt, put the key in the ignition, and finally look up at me waiting outside as though she had no idea I had been carrying a conversation with her on the walk over to the car and was planning on accompanying her to the pre-decided distention via automotive transport and only then unlock my door.

nshipma1,132,,217,1qbg0z,,450,"a few years ago i went to north carolina for a wedding, and while there my then boyfriend (now husband) and i visited a local brewery. it was quite small, so they don't distribute or even bottle. we did a tasting, and afterward bought a growler that was awesome (cool top, slightly bigger than normal growlers, and unique since it's a brewery no one has heard of). it was an awesome wedding and fun weekend, so i have good memories attached to this growler. in addition, i used to use it to fill up at local breweries near my house, because it is slightly bigger than normal growlers but the breweries would fill it up for the same price. so i had stickers and stuff from these breweries all over it. 

well, i have a friend who did not own a growler. because i have three, i offered to loan him my growler until he got his own. i gave absolutely no indication that he could keep it and was very clear that it was a loaner til he got his own.

fast forward a few months, and we decided to go get beer together at a brewery in our town and both bring our growlers. as soon as we get there, i see he has ripped all the labels/stickers on the growler off so you can't even see where it is from anymore. i was more than upset because i didn't understand why he would do this to someone else's property, but i'm very bad with confrontation so i didn't mention anything. i know i should have, but at that point the damage was done and i didn't even want it back anymore since it lost all of its uniqueness. 

fast forward another few weeks, and he finally does buy a new growler. first thing he does is post a pic on facebook of his new growler and MINE, with the caption: i now have a growler collection.

WTF?? when did my growler become yours?? my irreplaceable growler (who knows when/if i'll ever be back in charlotte to buy a new growler, and i already looked and their website doesn't sell them) is suddenly part of your collection?? i was PISSED.

so, fast forward another few weeks. i ask to borrow an armband from him that can hold an iphone for my marathon. i specifically said borrow. i used it for the marathon october 27th, and it is still sitting on my dresser. i have no intention of giving it back either. and he also has yet to mention it to me even though it has been more than two weeks. every time i look at it i get a slight grin. it won't replace my growler, but i do get a little satisfaction.

[deleted],27,,82,1inh0z,,450,"I used to have a coworker everyone hated. He was a steroid induced asshole working because his cousin owned the company (mortgage company). He was abrasive, rude, and just an asshole. He also love hunting more than life itself. He had no idea what he was doing (no education, no training, didn't understand the mortgage process). 



One day he pushed all of us over the edge... the mortgage company had an 800 number for people who called from the newspaper ads, etc... we (loan reps) took turns answering it, we had assigned times we owned. This certain the asshole had 9am to 3pm on a Wednesday. 


After a morning of no calls, he decides to leave at 11AM and go to the gym/lunch/Hunting store until 2pm. Hunting store was a major sporting goods chain I won't mention name of that had a huge hunting/fishing department. So he is 3 hours of out of the office, on his one day where he owns the 800 number. His cousin, the boss, didnt care, he was busy in his office didn't notice he was gone... so lo and behold between 12-1 two calls came in, people applied for re-fis (lunch hour is busy, since people make their phone calls). 

I answered one call, a coworker (a quiet very nice young lady) took the other call. Policy is, it's our deals, since he was not as his desk (exception is made if guy got up for 10 minutes to use mens room, we would cover)... but we are not going to cover and give him deals because he took a 3 hour lunch. 


So he comes back, opens up our software (CRM) and see two calls came in.. he gets all excited ""thanks guys for the deals, please email me the applications""... our sales manager said NO. asshole gets all angry and it escaltes into an agrument. A loud one. 


His cousin (big boss) comes out, and to see what all the noise was about... it became a long heated agrument, with me, asshole, sales manager, and cousin boss, it was decided he would in fact keep those deals. But if this happens again, whoever answers the phone gets it (unless of course, it's a quick 10 minute bathroom break)... 


Later he tried to act all cool and thank me for covering, but this habit of having others do his work was common... the nice young lady who took the other app stayed out of it, she let the angry men figure it out. He was the type of guy who would start physically threatening others, any other workplace, this guy is fired... but his cousin and him were very close friends. 


We really hated this guy..... so here is the revenge....... a few weeks later, so it was well removed from the big agrument we all had. 


He loved this certain hunting store. One day he left his hunting store shop members card on his desk (he was putting in an online order), I took a quick picture of the ID # with my phone....nobody noticed I did it. 



When he was out of the office, I then opened up Photoshop (I am good with Photoshop) and made him a ""members appreciation discount day"" coupon. I copied a similiar coupon layout I found online and made it state ""get 80% off hunting and fishing merchandise Between the hours of 10AM to 3PM on Tuesday, June 3"" (i forgot exact date). I even wrote a marketing letter with his name and info, and hunting store member # and mailed to his home. I even ran the envelope through the printer and mailed it from  the same town of the store's location (I was in that area anyway). I used some of our marketing stock paper, so it looked fancy. 


So he gets the hunting store fake coupon in the mail.... he brings it into work the morning of the fake sale, I see it on his desk.. which also happen to be his next scheduled day to cover the 800 number. He makes up some lame excuse to leave the office around 10AM..... from 10AM to 1pm he's gone, we assume he went to the Hunting Store fake sale... and he did... in that time, 3 calls came in, which we took the applications for. He comes back around 1pm, looking pissed off like hell. He sees we took 3 applications, and doesn't say a word (because of the last time he can't pick this fight again).... later his cousin walks by and asks him what's wrong (ever see a 6'2 250 pound man sit in office chair and just pout like a spoiled child?)... so asshole starts whining about how he went to hunting store and this coupon didn't work, and how he got into an agrument with the manager, and the kicked him out of the store. 


Cousin says, ""isn't today your phone day""... asshole ""says yes""... cousin says ""well, did we get any calls""... asshole says ""yes, 3, they are all set and we are working on it"".... end of story.. those 3 mortgage apps went to the people who answered them (myself included)... asshole never skipped work like that again. I never told anybody I made the fake coupon.

After school, Junior year, I went to my buddy Ben's house to hang out for a few hours before going home. I did this a couple days a week.

This day we were messing around in his garage, where he has a small halfpipe. I would skate and he would BMX. He was rather well-known in the Midwest for his riding abilities and would often go on tours with his team on the weekends. This is relevant.

Anyways, we're in the garage and started throwing screws at each other, then snowballs and it escalated to bigger objects. He ended up chasing me out to my car with an old brown banana; like hell I'm gunna let that splatter on me. I unlock the car and get in just in time to hear a loud *whump*. I see Ben's big goofy grin and then him running back in the house. I get out and see banana splattered all over the driver side of my old car.

Aw hell no son.

So I drive home and since this is February near Chicago it's like negative 10 degrees Fahrenheit. For some reason it didn't even click that banana would freeze to my car. Sure enough it did. I go to get my ice scraper and actually took paint chips off in the process of getting this frozen mess of banana goop off. I was just getting more angry that Ben got the last shot. 

But I didn't forget.

We kept hanging out normally through the end of the school year and into the summer. June rolls around, temp's getting into the 90's. I'm working at a pizza place.

I'm sitting at home masturbating, like always, when I get an idea. I get in my car and speed to my workplace, run in, say hey to everyone, and grab some anchovies. Perfect.

I call up Ben right away as I'm pulling out of the parking lot.

""Hey whatsup? Let's hang out!""

""Yeah man, come on by, I'm home,"" he says.

I get to his house and we're in his garage. He says he has to poop. He goes inside. I go to my car and grab the cup of anchovies.

Immediately I go to his expensive, beloved BMX bike and take out the seat with an allen wrench. The seat is connected to a rod that slides into another open tube on the frame. Inside this open tube is where I dump the anchovies. I quickly get the seat back on before he comes back in.

Everything went better than I planned in my head.

One month of 90+ degrees passes and he went on one of the tours with his team. When he comes back we're all hangin' out and he's telling me about this terrible fish smell that was in the van when they were all travelling.

*Hell yeah, shit's workin'.*

Another month goes by and he's telling me whenever he rides at the parks there's this terrible smell that follows him everywhere. But it's only when he's on his bike. Weird! I get little comments like this every now and then for the next month after that.

Three months total goes by. He orders a new bike seat. It comes in the mail and he wants to change it. Two of his friends are over in the garage when he changes it. Loosens the screws on his seat, pulls it out of the tube and this white-ish green, goopy anchovy paste is pulled out with it. The most rancid smell in the world fills the garage in seconds.

Ben starts puking.

His one friend starts puking because of the smell and because of Ben puking.

The other also decides now would be a good idea to puke.

Puke everywhere in the garage, mixed with three month old rotting anchovy stank.

I get the entire story from Ben on what happened the next day. Laughing my ass off so hard while he's telling it. His friends retell the story also when I see them the following week. Laugh just as hard.

The look on his face at the simple explanation I gave him was worth the 7 month wait for my petty revenge.

n33dyourlov3,40,,114,1r13h2,,444,"A few months ago I worked as a cleaning lady in a large day care. This was below my experience and education, but I was living in an area where I couldn't fluently speak the first language (Quebec, French). I wouldn't say I'm too good for the position, but no one deserves to be treated the way that  I was being treated. 








 On my first day, a woman (Nessa) yelled in my face for not taking out the garbage the day before (before I started working there), I was told I ""no good clean"", and she had it in her head that I was hired on as her personal slave. 



Although I am responsible for 89% of the cleaning, Nessa still had tasks assigned to her... until she tricked me by saying her boss had asked me to take over her cleaning duties. It was awkward for her when my boss noticed this and told her off. 






While cleaning the toilets one morning, Nessa screamed for me to come.. I made my way down the hall immediately after washing my hands only to see her gesturing to me to come by slapping her knees as if I'm a dog. I was slightly offended, but I brushed it off as a possible cultural difference (Muslim community).



 Then, she kicks a chair at me and tells me to reach a hat a child had thrown out of reach. 














If asked nicely to help reach the hat, I would have had no problems, but asked like that and it not being in my list of employee duties, I decided to walk away leaving Nessa to do the dirty work. After a month of harassment, embarrassment, and belittling, I decided to walk out early-mid shift leaving good ol Nessa to clean the mess all by herself.","Treat me like a dog, I quit half way through my shift!!",558,pettyrevenge
lokiikol,33,,92,14udi2,,441,"So it's a wintry Friday morning and the coffeehouse/bakery I used to work at is packed.  I mean, the line would be out the door if people weren't so averse to the outside cold (so instead they bunch in a big cluster just inside the door).  It's fairly chaotic for the morning rush.

We cashiers and baristas are doing the best we can to manage the flow of people, but it's taking 10 minutes for most to get through the line.  Our manager gave out some free cups of coffee to people who were irked, but this one lady was not having it.

She starts admonishing me in a very shrill voice as soon as she gets to the front of the line ""WHY did it take SO LONG to help everyone?  Why aren't there more people working?""  I try to explain that we have as many people on as we can, and my manager is trying to mollify her with a free coffee, which she refuses.  ""I don't drink coffee, I just came for a couple bagels and a muffin!  How about you give me those for free?  I'm not coming here again, blah blah blah...""

Seriously, I think my manager wanted to give her the stuff for free because he was hung over, but he told me to get her what she wanted and he would take one of the bagels off her order.

Well, I knew that something had to be done.  I looked through the basket and found the absolute *smallest* plain and chocolate chip bagels in the place, and these one were noticeably smaller than the rest.  I mean, I would not have sold them to anyone even though they were in the basket, but I thought, this lady deserved them.  The chocolate chip one was even malformed, must have been against something while baked - perfect for her.

The muffin?  Same size as all the others, but I thought **very** bad thoughts at it while I placed it in the bag.

I put everything in the bag quickly so she didn't notice how much smaller the bagels she got were.  She was still glaring at me while my manager rang her up, and muttered a brief thanks before leaving.  I like to think she screamed when she pulled the bagels out at home.

frayjoker,96,,116,13poop,,444,"I've got a good half dozen stories I look forward to sharing with this subreddit. Here's a favourite.

In high school I was friends with this mentally disabled girl (and don't worry this isn't going in the direction you think it is). In the first week of school, I was picked on at the bus-stop. When she saw I was upset, she jumped in and yelled like a mad-woman until I was left alone. I appreciated the gesture, so throughout high-school it developed into a mutual watching of each other's backs.

This went on for some years, until she started to get used to getting her own way around other people. That she could manipulate people with lies and sob stories. When she found these tactics didn't get any sympathy from me, she started to take it out on me. There was nothing much I could do when she would yell at me, pinch, hit or throw things at me. I would ignore her, and she would get angrier at me.

""Why are you making me upset?"" She would ask. I would calmly tell her ""I think you're upset because you're treating your friends badly."" Cue more fists and screams, and one day a teacher coming up to me and blaming me for picking a fight with this girl.

""Fray Joker! I expected much better behavior from you than to pick fights with a special needs student. Go stand over there until your bus comes, you should be ashamed of yourself.""

This teacher was legendary for thinking less of students, for being a real power-tripping authoritative muscle drone. It was not possible to for her to be wrong when it was her word against another student.

I looked this simple beast in the eye and said ""I am not in the wrong here, and you will apologise for what you've said to me."" I swear at the time she laughed it off, rolled her eyes. And I knew. I knew that she would apologise.

So started my campaign. Every single time I saw her, walked past her in the corridor, saw her standing on duty. Any time I had to interact with little miss superiority complex, I looked her in the eye and said simply ""You still owe me an apology.""

It took three months for this academic dictator to take umbrage at my continued disrespect towards her. Before she finally snapped and yelled at me to ""meet her in her office"". Head held high I walked in to find her sitting at her desk, hands folded, doing her best to kill me with her pure unbridled fury, detention pad at the ready. I looked her in the eye and said ""You owe me an apology."" 

She asked me why, and I explained the incident to her. How this girl decided to pick a grudge against me, and how I was trying my best to teach her sympathy towards others. She accused me of going over this girl's head. I pointed out that we had been friends for years, and she always used to be compassionate to others. I told her that her assumption I was in the wrong deeply insulted me, that I would never bully or hurt another student in the school. She admitted that she had never heard a complaint against me from any student or teacher.

Without another argument left in her, she said sorry, I said thankyou, and walked out of her office.

Guy behind her had both a hanging window tag and license plate marking handicap.

boomsc,305,,327,17mlfe,,449,"**Riiiight, I'm done now, it's late and I'm bored with you all. Thanks for the Karma and (some) interesting discussion. What honestly stuns me is quite how many of you are scummy and douchey enough to think it's appropriate to steal from someone. I a) hope you have others steal from you for the rest of your life and b) hope when you're finally old enough to drink and attend university, you live with some *enormous*, angry people who have no qualms about beating you senseless after you try and steal their stuff.**


I post in BadRoomates quite often...since I have six of em, and four are awful. One in particular is -terrible- he lives on the bottom floor, seperate form the rest of us, and spends his days getting wasted, high, smoking cigars and repeating the process (recently baked a load of Space cake, the entire lower floor stinks of weed now...)


Anyway, we had a party, got drunk, and my alcohol got left downstairs on the side in the kitchen..a few months in I finally go down to fetch it, and discover a shot glass in front of my Rum, and the bottle over half gone. It was an -expensive- bottle, and he was the only one who was down there to pinch it, he'd been enjoying a shot or two whenever he felt like it. I rescued my bottles, and a few weeks later finished off what was left...but kept the bottle.

I bought another (cheap) bottle of rum, poured about a quarter back into the empty expensive bottle....

and filled it the rest of the way up...

with *laxatives*, this thick, dark syrupy type stuff that looked designed to taste pleasant (and was cheap). Then I put it in the downstairs kitchen.


Now, my petty revenge is fairly obvious...however, petty revenge -kind- of turned into epic, justiceporn worthyness (or perhaps simply cruel?). Less than a week later, he held a party with a bunch of friends, loud music, getting absolutely wasted. At some point during the night he got high enough...or ran out of alcohol, to simply grab the -new- bottle of his 'friends' rum from the kitchen, and shared it out amongst his friends...


God, I can't tell you how wonderful it was to be woken up at 6am by a dozen stoned or drunk people downstairs -all- desperate to use the one bathroom in the house, and unable to leave and go home for fear of shitting themselves if they stood for longer than a few seconds.



**EDIT - lets see if I can't respond to a few of you en masse.**

**Apparently important!:- Someone mentioned this is important. The Rum is left in the pile of bottles we all leave in the kitchen, Bottles of Wine, spirits and cans of beer and whatnot, this is the unofficial housemate booze pile, its where we leave stuff to drink so that we don't have to keep it in our rooms (someone below said that makes it the equivalent of a storage cabinet), that doesn't make it for public consumption. He didn't touch the wine or cans, or others spirits it seems, just the nice looking rum.**

**1. It was left in my house, not someone elses, my home, the place I pay rent to live in. It was left in a communal area, which is part of what I pay rent for. At no point or no length of time does it become 'okay' for someone to steal from you. There is a Nintendo Wii in the communal living room, it's been there for five months now, it doesn't mean it's 'okay' to steal it and sell it elsewhere. It's not your property, don't steal it.**

**2. Two months wasn't a casual ""Lol it'll be fine"", I'm not a heavy drinker, I drank it at the party, it got left down there, I assumed in a communal space it would be fine, two months later I need it to drink, fetch it and realise it's almost all gone. And it could be there for nine months, it's a communal space, not someone's private room I dumped it in, and it's mine, at no point can someone else steal it, there isn't a 'five minute rule' or something.**

**3. Some people seem to have got the wrong impression about the house layout. He's not my roommate, he's my housemate, there are seven of us each with our own separate rooms inside a large house. The large house includes two kitchens, one bathroom, and one living room that are communal spaces. It's three floored, three bedrooms on the top floor, three bedrooms and a kitchen on the middle floor, and one bedroom, one kitchen, the bathroom and living room on the bottom floor. Rum-thief lives in the bottom floor bedroom, and the rum was left in the bottom floor kitchen, on the side, out of the way.**

**4. When I refer to weed and the floor stinking, again, it's not his personal floor, it's the communal floor, the living room, hallways, kitchen, bathroom (and presumably his bedroom) that stinks. There are three asthmatics in the house, one of which is severe enough to warrant regular checkups. He knows this, we all do, the other smokers stand by an open window or go outside to smoke, he smokes baccy and weed in the communal spaces, indoors, which isn't appropriate, considerate, and in fact is banned on the tenancy lease we all signed.**

**5. The other, unfortunate victims of my revenge are just unfortunate victims, but hardly my fault, I never offered him the rum, he simply took it when he was high and drunk and shared it amongst his friends, it's entirely his fault they suffered as well, not mine, in exactly the same way leaving a car unlocked so that it can be stolen doesn't make you liable for the people the thief runs over. I expected him to take a few shots of it, and suffer the consequences, not down the entire thing along with a dozen other friends.**

**6. the first port of call if you decide to assume something is communal, especially something expensive, is to ask if it belongs to anyone. Any of the other five people living in the house could have told him without any hesitation the bottle belonged to me and wasn't for sharing. And, for the record [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ADMIRAL-RODNEY-St-Lucian-Bottle/dp/B004EY5FQC/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359667779&amp;sr=1-1) is the expensive rum he stole. It's quite clearly not cheap stuff random guests bring to a party and never come back for.**

**7. The guests he brought over didn't take it themselves. He brought the bottle in, claimed it was his own, and shared it out with them. Additionally the only time I realised the party was happening was when the music started up. HAd I known in advance, I'd have removed the bottle until a time when only he would have been affected, to avoid strangers having to suffer. Also to note, we made sure to keep an eye on all the suffering guests and told them to drink plenty of water when they worked out they were 'ill'. All of them are entirely fine and healthy now, no one needed the doctor, a hospital, or anything more than plenty of water and access to the toilet.**",You like my booze? here...try -this-.,776,pettyrevenge
Lurker777,33,,67,1lhkpf,,440,"My friends and I were coming back from the lake one night. The only way home is through a two lane winding country road. It's standard for slower traffic or motorists pulling boats to use the shoulder to let other pass because there is no other way for people to get around those going 30 miles below the speed limit.

So it's dark and we're approaching a truck ahead of us hauling a boat. He is going very slow but not slow enough- we noticed he's losing his stuff like crazy as it gets sucked out the back due to the wind. We see clothes flying out, coolers, fishing poles, backpacks- this guy had to have been losing hundreds of dollars of stuff all over the road and he was oblivious to it.

We decide to try to speed up next to him and warn the poor guy that he's loosing all of his fishing and camping gear. But every time we get near, he speeds up. We realize he is purposefully being an ass because he thinks we're trying to pass him even though he's going probably 20 miles below the speed limit.

So I flash my brights and try to yell and point at the back of his boat. He completely ignores us and keeps playing the game of not letting us 'pass' when all we really want to do is help the guy out!

This goes on for a good twenty minutes with the guy losing his gear all over the road. We finally come to a stoplight and pull next to him. We roll down the window and say, 'Sir, you have been losing your stuff all over the highway- probably $1,000 worth of stuff by now. We were trying to warn you. Have a good night!'

The 'Oh Crap!' expression on his face was priceless. 

**TL;DR:** My friends and I try to warn a guy hauling a boat that his fishing gear is flying out the back.

haleyhaleyraerae,27,,61,1cjp1c,,439,"This story is one of my mother's

Context:

One of the side streets connecting my parents street to the other is about 100 metres long and has this one jackass' garage backing onto it. He *used* to constantly park his car funny and block that little 100 metre stretch to people wanting to go through to get to the other street. Now that that's over with...

Anywho, so this guy would always block the way from one street to the other and was veeeeery rude about it when you would ask him (heaven forbid) to move out of the way. His english was almost non-existent so he would just scream and wave his hands at you to back your car up like you had inconvenienced him from being an asshat. 

Now, my mom is a no bullshit kinda gal. If you want something resolved, she is a fierce mama bear. So she's driving home on her day off from an outing of grocery shopping or something of the like and wants to use this side street to get through to her street. Low and behold, she's pulling up and fuckface has blocked everyone's way again. This particularly time, the guy's son was outside with him and luckily, his english was perfect. My mom rolls down her window and tells him to move out of the way and that he can't park like that to which the snot nose kid replies,

""What are you gonna do lady, call the cops?""

My mom just smiled, calmly rolls up her window, and backs up to go home via a different route. Not the typical actions of our frightening Eastern European mutter. But you see, ol' fraulien here was actually a member of our local police department. Yes, that same department our lovely snot nosed kid told my mom to call.

So my mom waits a couple of days until her next shift and makes a special trip down to her neck of the woods only to find that, she was in luck!

Well this girl is majoring in English and French and writes poems all the time and she just happens to think she's curing cancer with it. For the most part I don't care about your major if it makes you happy but this girl was fucking arrogant about it. At one point she told me the name of her 3 cats and looked at me like waiting for me to get something.

The teacher gives us the opportunity to submit a poem (in French of course) for extra credit without the expectation to win.

I put all my emotion into it and even cried remembering everything we went through in that time and I made it as deep and personal as I could make it. I even got a couple of my poetry-writing friends to review it and fix some things here and there to make it better. All in all, I spent about 20 minutes on it. I submit it. 

This was mid semester and for some reason they didn't tell us the results of the contest until the last day of class right before the final exam. They announce the winners. Guess who won? ME! That's right ME!!! Out of all the 400-500 level classes, I won the fucking contest! And in the most bitchass move I have ever made I say, ""Omg! I won?! I can't believe it!

Hotshot619,73,,68,13bjzn,,439,"I was working at a pizza shop about a year ago. I did everything from make/deliver the pizza to washing the dishes. Now every Friday the same couple order a big meal with deserts and soda($30+) and every time I deliver they never tip me. I don't mind a great deal since I know they live in lower income housing and the woman is always very nice to me. They order 2 different sodas, Pepsi for him and Ginger ale for her. One Friday night the man answers the door, and asked if I get tipped frequently. Excited at the idea I might get a tip I say sometimes and I always appreciate it. He pulls out a 5$ bill and says, ""I would tip you but your nothing more than a bad waiter that just brings my food to me and leaves"" and jokingly pockets it while closing the door.

scairdycat,30,,76,1erhez,,440,"When I was in high school, there was a bully at the school who was a jerk and was always talking about how ""great"" Hitler was.  One day between classes, I overheard him talking about how wrong interracial relationships are and how ""disgusting"" black women are in particular, using very crude and degrading language, using the n-word, calling biracial people ""chocolate swirl"" and so on.  If it had only been me overhearing it, I would have let it slide, but as there were some young black ladies who were within earshot, I knew I had to engineer some karma.

My favorite uncle had always hooked me up with adult magazines since I was still too young to buy them, and I had several issues of Black Tail.  I didn't do it the very next day, because I didn't want it to look obvious, but a few weeks later I brought them to school inside a big book and put it in my locker.  During the middle of a class, I asked to go to the restroom and set it up, quickly planting the porno mags in his locker and positioning his textbooks as a ramp to where the Black Tails would slide out of the locker.

After the bell rang, I went to my locker and got my book for the next class, but wanted to watch it go down from a distance.  The anticipation was intense.  He opened his locker and, sure enough, the magazines slid out and onto the floor.  The best part about it was it happened in front of some girls he obviously had crushes on.  He was saying he didn't know how they got there, that they weren't his, etc.

A day or two later, I overheard him bragging about how he had put a padlock on his locker and nobody could do that to him again.  I identified the vents in the locker door as a point of vulnerability and spent a few weeks letting people somewhat forget about the Black Tail incident and also to give me time to figure something out.  In the meantime, he kept bragging on his padlock.  

I asked my uncle if he had any smaller magazines with interracial or kinky content, and he hooked me up with some really off the wall non-mainstream material, showing fisting and other kinky things even I hadn't seen at that age.  During basketball practice after school, I went and slid a couple of them through the vents of his locker door.  The way they fell must've had them leaning against the inside of the door, because when he opened his locker then next day, they fell out.

Teachers saw it and were telling him, ""Stephen, you've got to STOP bringing that filth into our school!""  The other kids were saying things like, ""OMG, I can't believe Stephen looks at black women fisting white guys!"" with other kids saying, ""Maybe she was an amputee and her hand really wasn't in there!""

Now on the drive back a traffic cop cut my relative up on a duel carriageway and sped off. Being the driver that he is he started bitching to passenger he is dropping off about this. The ""officers"" in the traffic car infront of him must have seen this and decided to pull him over to have a little chat.

They requested his license and asked what the problem was and when he explained they decided he deserved a ticket. He protested about this but there was no stopping the cop from giving him this ticket, until the passenger also protested advising the cop he cannot give a ticket for his bad driving.

The cop clearly enraged by this thinks he will get his little bit of revenge by giving the passenger a ticket also. He requested his details (and this is when the revenge is).

The passengers response: Chief Constable ***** I expect to see YOU and YOUR colleague in my office first thing tomorrow morning.

My relative never did get his ticket

The subway pulls up and I was happy because I chose a spot on the platform right where a door stopped. There was a large woman in the door and I thought she was getting off. I do as I and everyone else always does, moved to the side to let the people who are on get off. The large woman didn't get off and took up 2/3 of the door space. She just stood there. Usually, they will get off and back up so everyone else can get off then they are the first ones back on. But she just stood there. After everyone got off, we on the platform started to get on. She still didn't move and people were glaring as they squeezed past her. The doors closed before everyone was on and there was ample space to fit everyone. It just took too long getting off and on (its NYC so the conductors don't care if you're left on the platform and don't get on).
 
The next stop, she doesn't get off and people again squeeze past her. The next stop after this was my stop. I squeezed next to her and people started to line up to get off. She was hinting that she was getting off too so I took some revenge. People were lining up behind me to get off (grabbing her purse, preparing her large body to move, etc.) and I squeezed in front of her so I was between her and the door (it was a very tight fit) and she was obviously annoyed. I held onto the bar to my left and to the area right above the door. The doors opened and people squeezed past us and I didn't move. She nudged me but I wouldn't move. She couldn't go around me because everyone was squeezing past her. She pushed harder but I'm strong enough to hold my own. I moved when the announcement of ""stand clear of the closing door"" came and then left right as they started to shut. Because of her size, she couldn't get through or move fast enough to get a body part through to stop the doors from closing.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was flying back from Vancouver to London and had settled in nice and early.  I was all ready to sleep most of the flight (popped some NyQuil, plane was landing in the afternoon, no jetlag!).  Now this really short guy gets on in the seat in front of me, he must've been 5'0""/5'1"" max (not hating on shorter people, just making an observation for the story).  Everyone settles in and gets ready for the flight and I pass out.

Cut to about half an hour into the trip, plane had just taken off, and I'm woken up by this guy just slamming his seat all the way back onto my legs.  Captain hasn't even turned off the seatbelt sign (the universal indication for ""go for it"").  I lean forward and politely ask the guy, ""can you please move your seat back a bit forward please.  I'm tall and you're bruising my knees"".  His response?  ""Whatever man, I paid for this seat"".  @$$hole mode, engage.

I make myself comfortable, take the magazines out of the seat pocket, slouch down a bit, and extend my legs to get comfortable to comfortably sleep.  I can now literally feel his spine on my knees.  Great.  I can poke him.  Man I feel a bit uncomfortable... guess I'll have to readjust my position every few minutes.  Does that mean my knees keep digging into his back?  Too bad.  Even when I'm not moving I could feel him trying to find a comfortable position.  I'd quickly move my knees so that by the time he leaned back again my knees had found his spine again.

Fat_Head,59,,116,1hlw2n,,439,"(Sorry for the wall of text, I got carried away)

So I currently work in a large department of a large company, providing tech support for clients. One of my fat colleagues, is a total buttwipe. He's rude, stinks, never shaves his neckbeard, constantly eats chocolate bars and drinks only Red Bull. He's quite literally round like a giant watermelon, so we'll call him Hamplanet. Here are some examples of why I dislike him:

He steals lunches out of the fridge.
He makes racist jokes that everyone can hear.
He stares at women as they walk past him.
Once, I was happily walking past his desk with a coffee in my hand, and he got up and shoved me so the coffee went everywhere, then shouts ""JEEEEZUS WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING"" and I got told off for spilling a lot of coffee on the carpet.

But what really sent me over the edge into ultimate retribution extreme mode was that one day I get pulled into my boss's office and had the following conversation:

Boss: ""Hello fat_head, please sit down. I've called you here to talk about an unfortunate situation that has arisen. I've just received a complaint from a member of staff saying that you sexually harassed a client on Monday.""

My boss hands me a document which shows a written explanation of how I made rude remarks to a female customer on Monday, and then the customer's manager called back the next day and spoke to Hamplanet with a complaint against me. Hamplanet's name was written at the bottom of the document.

Oh dear, I thought. Our calls aren't recorded and I certainly never harassed anybody, so how can I prove that this was a lie? It turned out to be quite easy.

Me: ""Uh, ok, but I don't work Mondays.""

Boss: ""Oh. That's right. Uhhhhh...... sorry. I'll speak to Hamplanet.""

Great! I'm off the hook. Normally, I'd just return to work glad that nothing bad came of 1 on 1 meeting with my boss. But this time was different. This time, the score needed to be settled. I'd had enough, and it was time to strike back. So I began to scheme and plot my vengeance.

It came to me the next morning while in the shower. A genius plan for revenge against Hamplanet.

I drove to Krispy Kreme on my way to work and picked up a four pack. For those who are unacquainted with Krispy Kreme, they're a well-known and much coveted iced donut. I personally think they're a little overrated, but everyone I know goes nuts over them and so they fit my plan perfectly.

I got into the office and discretely handed out the four donuts to my friends in the department. They loved me for it. That was just a bonus though - the real prize was the all-important, empty Krispy Kreme donut box. Phase one complete.

I waited until Hamplanet got up to make a coffee. I crept over to his desk, planted the empty donut box right in front of his keyboard, and snuck back to my desk. The trap had been set, and now it was time to just sit back and enjoy the show. *ooooooh I am sooooo diabolical!*

Hamplanet started walking back to his desk. When he was about 10 feet away, his eyes locked onto the donut box, and he started running. His coffee splashed everywhere as his pounding feet propelled him closer to the . He shouted, ""Hell yeah!"" and sat down, ready to devour the sweet donut deception in front of him.

The next 10 seconds was the greatest moment of my life. I watched on with indescribable anticipation, like a child waiting for his first sparkler bomb to go off. I can't emphasize enough how much joy and excitement setting this trap gave me. the suspense was KILLING me.

Hamplanet opened the box, and actually reached inside of it, trying to grab the donuts that he didn't realize didn't exist. When his efforts proved fruitless and his tiny brain kicked into gear, the most perplexed, what-in-the-actual-titty-sprinkles-just-happened look washed across his face, and he just stared at the box for 5 seconds in disbelief. Then he looked up, directly at me, with the most fantastic how-could-you-do-this-to-me look on his face. It was like I'd just kicked a puppy down a staircase, and it was *supremely* satisfying. It was *delicious*. I'm getting goosebumps just writing this. I exploded into uncontrollable laughter as Hamplanet looked again at the box in disbelief.

jeffholes,57,,58,137uqu,,439,"One of my jobs is supervising a research analytics department for a financial services company. My job, besides the supervisory stuff, is to create data ingestion and reporting software. My little department isn't the only research analytics department within the company, we have another one that specifically deals with billing. They take all of the data that's generated by workers using my software and use it to bill clients. The reason for there being two of these departments is that VPs wanted/needed to fudge numbers sometimes and I simply won't allow inaccurate data to come from my department so the VPs found some people who were perfectly willing to do that. My department has 10 people in it, the lying department had 2.

The guy in charge of the lying department screws up. A lot. Sometimes even too much for the VPs that want to fudge numbers. He over bills so often that we run the risk of losing (huge, think banks that got bailout money) contracts every couple of months. A hired liar who screws up? Weird, right? Rather than accept the blame himself, he'll often blame our department for producing bad data. Nope, sorry, our shit is solid and we can prove it. When he gets called out for fucking up he'll email a ton of people, often even including clients in the emails, trying to blame his shitty numbers on us. Then I have to spend an hour showing how he's fantastically wrong (omitting the clients from the communications to at least save a little face for the company by not bickering in front of them).

The absolutely most infuriating thing that he does is goes into our code, fucks it up, and then pulls his calling-out bullshit. Through extensive user activity logging that I built into all of the software in response to this, I can tell when he's messing with my code. The most recent change to this activity logging stuff that I've made is, whenever he messes with code, unbeknownst to him an email is sent from his computer to all of the usual important people (except I've included the owner of the company in these emails, a multimillionaire who doesn't like to deal with ""the little stuff"") saying something along the lines of ""I'm messing with code, if the numbers are wrong that's why,"" although the actual body of the email is a lot longer and more detailed.

After messing with the code the last couple of times, he tried calling us out again. The owner of the company asked him what the fuck he was talking about seeing as how said owner received an email from the Head Liar that he was messing with code.

The Head Liar and his underling were soon fired after that, they never responded to the owners inquiries. Not only that, the lying VPs came under heavy scrutiny for fudging numbers and they're watched very closely, now.

I admitted what I'd done.

Our clients are consistently happier with the numbers, now. Everyone in my department got a raise. We're in charge of billing, now.

All of the justice happened earlier today. I'm having a fucking whiskey. I may or may not regret this in the morning, but here it is.

My dad owns a small business, very small, consisting of him and 5 other employees.  My sister just started working at a pharmacy and on her first day one of my dad’s employees, let’s call her Jane, comes in.  The transaction was normal and life went on as usual, until the next day when Jane came into work.

**Jane**:  “I made $20 off your daughter yesterday!”

**Dad**:  “You what?”

**Jane**: “I went to the pharmacy and your daughter was the cashier.  She gave me $20 too much change!”

**Dad**: “You stole $20 from my daughter?  If her register is short at the end of the night it comes out of her paycheck! You need to give that back!”

**Jane**: “No way! It was her mistake, not mine! It’s my $20!”

At this point, my dad was pretty pissed at Jane but kept his cool until he went home from work to ask my sister about it.  My sister told my dad that Jane did in fact come in, but her boss had counted the money in her register at the end of the night, right in front of her, and the totals matched up exactly.  She was 100% positive of this because her boss had made comments about her good job, how everything was fine etc, etc.

So now my dad was pretty happy, but he didn’t go and brag to Jane about it.  He just let her think she had gotten away with an extra $20.  What he did instead was from that point forward every time he gave pay raises, Jane got less.  Christmas bonuses? Jane got significantly less.

A lot of the customers are very understanding of the circumstances and are as pleasant as I am, (arrogance on the matter aside, I get people writing to head office about how nice I am in work). Except one male customer not even so far back in the queue over dramatically yawning, shouting and seemingly trying to start a mob of customer service hatred, the fact people ignored him only added to his growing anger. 

He eventually got to me, with three baskets of pretty expensive alcohol, Grey Goose vodka, whisky, gin a fair medley to say the least. I ignored his theatrics and begin serving him, it's at this point he begins to basically scream at me. 

""I WAS WAITING IN THAT LINE FOR NEARLY FIVE MINUTES YOU PAIR OF FUCKING RATS! DON'T YOU KNOW I HAVE PLACES TO BE!?"" 

I smiled ""My, that's quite colourful language, I might have to start using that to myself to the height of popularity"". I've no idea why I said this, but even more baffling it made a few customers behind laugh, he was getting more angry, he turned around to the queue this guy was desperate for the customers to be on his side. 

""WHO HERE THINKS THIS PLACE IS SHIT!?"" To my surprise nobody actually cheered. ""WELL I DON'T CARE WHAT THOSE CUNTS THINK, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE IS AWFUL! AWFUL!"".

Does anybody remember watching Aladdin? During the final fight scene Aladdin calls Jafar a cowardly snake to which he replies ""A snake am I? Perhaps you'd like to see how snake like I can be?"". 

For some reason this ran through my head as I replaced 'snake like' for 'awful'.  Whilst he was trying to rally a hate mob, I had poked a tiny, tiny hole in each of his bags not big enough to notice, but it had potential to grow. He throws his money at me, I hand him his bags ""Cheers pal, enjoy the booze!"" I nod, he snarls at me one last time ""Fuck off, I'm never setting foot in here again"".

About forty five seconds later, I hear the sound of angels. £60 worth of alcohol bottles smashing on the floor, the bag plan worked quicker than I anticipated. I also hear the sound of the next few leaving customers laughing one of them shouting about karma (which sadly took me a moment to realise he was not talking about Reddit). He tried to come back in and demand a refund, but the security guard coming off his break intervened and refused him entry.

I poke my head out the door to console him.

""In fairness, you did say you were never setting foot in here again"".

secularflesh,38,,88,1l2fl1,,427,"In third grade, there was a kid in my class I'll call Jon. Jon was a popular kid and a practical joker. Jon always made fun of me for wearing sweatpants for some reason. One day he put paste all over my seat while I was in the bathroom. When I returned and sat down,  all the kids around me started laughing. I got up and the paste had matted down basically the entire butt area and gave it a grey appearance that very noticeable on my black sweatpants.  I had to walk around with this paste-butt for the rest of the day.

A month earlier, I had threw up on a bus during a field trip (I got motion sick very easily), so most of the other kids were already avoiding me. After this last incident, I became completely ostracized. Every other day I would come home, hole up in my room, and weep. I vowed to get him back but never did and a year later his family moved away.

6 years later, I was sitting in French class when a new transfer showed up. My teacher introduced him as Jon and asked me to show him around the school. I didn't make the connection at first, but during the tour Jon's best friend from grade school (another douchebang) spotted him and they started chatting like old times. It dawned on me that this is motherfucking Jon. Naturally, he didn't recognize or remember me. Over the next few weeks, I stayedon friendly terms with him while I tried to come up with a suitable punishment.

You might be expecting something elaborate and disproportionately awful but unfortunately, I ran out of time. A couple of months later I found out that my family was moving away and I would be switching schools in a couple of weeks. I would have to act quickly.

Now Jon's parents were divorced and his dad lived in another country but once in awhile he would show up, spend some time with him, buy him expensive crap, and then take off again. On his last visit he bought Jon this fancy pair of jeans that cost a couple of hundred bucks. Jon bragged about this frequently to anyone who would listen. I also discovered he was really into comic books.

On my very last day (I waited til then so I couldn't get into trouble), I was sitting in English class to the right of Jon. On his left, was my friend, who I'll call Mike. Our teacher often left the class to do errands, leaving us unsupervised. During one of these absences, I gave Mike the signal and he started distracting Jon, getting him out of his desk to check out some new comics he had brought. Immediately I smeared his seat in paste and added some sprinkles on it for good measure.

When the teacher came back, Jon quickly slid back into his seat none the wiser. When the bell finally rung, Jon got up, noticed the resistance and couldn't believe it. His fancy ass jeans were covered in paste and sprinkles. I heard a chorus of laughter behind me as I quickly booked it out of there. 

I later learned from Mike that Jon's reputation had taken a huge hit. He was called ""Sprinkle Butt"" for the rest of the year.",Patience is sometimes rewarded. Revenge 6 years later.,515,pettyrevenge

DevilWorshipper,31,,82,1egmib,,425,"About 8 years ago, my wife (now ex) and I were active members on an amateur poetry site where folks would submit their poetry and get feedback and friendly criticism from other members of the forum. At the time there were approximately 1000 members and maybe 100 who contributed and commented on a near-daily basis. 

The community was overall a non-pretentious bunch with the glaring exception of two members who thought their shit didn't stink and took it upon themselves to shit on everybody else's work at every turn. Typical internet know-it-alls with a nasty penchant for putting people down and making them feel bad for sharing their poetry with others. Over time, we noticed members were not returning, particularly after being on the receiving end of one of these asshole's criticisms.

We got tired of the community being torn-apart by these guys and hatched a plan: we created 5 new user accounts. One contributed nothing but lesser-known poems by Sylvia Plath. Another nothing but obscure William Carlos Williams. You get the idea. The others were e.e. Cummings, Ralph Waldo Emerson and T.S. Eliot.

Over the course of three months or so, these users regularly contributed their ""poetry"" to the site. As usual, most of the community was positive in their feedback and a few were genuinely impressed. We even had to PM a few users who were hinting at being suspicious and let them in on the joke. 

However, the two aforementioned almighty warrior neckbeard ""poets,"" just as we knew they would, shit all over the work at every turn, even offering their own ""improvements"" every now and then. It was hilarious to see these guys offering their 'critiques' of poets like T.S. Eliot and Sylvia Plath as if the authors of these poems were just anonymous, unenlightened and angsty teenagers on the internet.

After three months of this we finally unveiled the truth in a lengthy post that referenced every single poem and it's true author. There was a day or so of futile and desperate justifications by the two overlords of all-things-poetic. They tried to make the distinction that there was a reason these particular poems were not-well-known by the general public, but, the laughter shared by the rest of the community became too much for them and they eventually gave up and never returned. The site went on for another couple of years until it was inexplicably shut down by it's creators. Every once and a while an asshole or two would show-up and try to belittle people, and, if it got too bad we would pull the same stunt. 

EDIT: I should clarify: these two guys weren't assholes so much as they were *pretentious* assholes. This was a site for **amateur** poets and these two guys treated every submission as if it was meant to be ready to join the ranks of the immortals.

It's possible that at least one of them was a literature professor at a community college. Nevertheless, they were both extremely confident in their breadth of knowledge and expertise and, in a few rare cases, they did manage to offer something constructive, but, that was not the norm. 

They were arrogant fucks who got-off on taking advantage of the fact that maybe they did have more knowledge and expertise on the subject of poetry than the rest of us who never made such claims.

So, the beauty of this revenge is that we turned the tables on these guys and they couldn't see the (in their world) obvious fact that this ""amateur"" poetry was really written by professionals.",My poetry lacks 'depth' and 'clarity' you say?,507,pettyrevenge

TokkiGoesRawr,54,,91,15xuyq,,430,"Ehhhhh... I think it's petty.

So I am currently employed at Chuck E. Cheese working as a cashier that bounces back and forth between registers and the merch counter (you know, where kids get to pick their prizes and such).  It is rather ironic because, truth be told, I really do not like children... at all.  Oh well, it is just what you make of it; that, and it is a job for the mean time.

One day we are just beyond busy, with only two registers and only one person alone at merch.  I decide to jump in and help my fellow co-worker because it was just obvious she needed someone to help her.  This one dad wanted to get a prize that his daughter wanted but was just a wee bit short but I mentioned that he could pay the rest of it with cash.  I had told him I could help him at my register.  As I he was following me, I noticed that this older lady had got out of line to follow him to my register.  When his transaction was completed, I had every intention of going back to the merch counter to help my co-worker since the line was still long.  As I was about to step away, the older lady that was behind the guy slammed her purse down on the counter and just scowled at me as if she knew I was going to walk away.  'Okay,' I thought, 'this is no big deal.  I'll just help her and be done with it.'

When I was hired I was told that I had to suggestive sell because it helps bring in more money, so that is what I did (even though I honestly do not like to do it).  There is this promotional deal going on that prints out this long receipt and I have to explain what it is to every “guest” that completes a transaction, no matter how big or small the purchase (no big deal even though it is a mouth full).  I guess she felt like I was trying to dismiss her or something and when I read her back what she ordered she said in the most snottiest tone “And I want a coffee... FRESH.  And while you bring me my FRESH coffee, I will be speaking with you manager *takes a look at my nametag lanyard* TokkiGoesRawr.”  Now mind you, since coffee is not exactly a highly ordered item, the coffee is just in one of those hot water dispensers so it stays warm/hot all day and it is made as soon as we open, so at 9 AM.  This all happened around 5 PM.

Honestly I did not think I did anything wrong, so I was not upset or even remotely phased.  I bring her out her “fresh” coffee and, as she had said, she was talking to my manager.  I hand her the coffee and she scowls at me once more and says “see, I am talking to your manager like I said I would.”  With a stoic face I reply “I'm sorry” (obviously not sincere).  She retorts with “that's not sincere enough!”  Once again, with stoic face unwavering, I reply with “I'm sorry”.  Her scowl just intensifies and she goes back to talking to my manager and says to him “she's only apologizing because you're here!  I come here all the time and I have NEVER had anyone treat me with such disrespect and carry such a bad attitude!”  My manager turns to me and just tells me to take 5 in the break room.  No big deal.  I am STILL not even remotely phased or upset.  Later he pulls me aside and tells me “she has complained about EVERYONE here, so to be honest with you, I just wanted you off the floor so it looks like I am doing something about it.  I'm not even mad or upset with you.”  I just smile at him and tell him I'm going back to merch.  

***SIDE NOTE***
Now, I am usually generous enough to round up on a receipt that has like 1 ticket on it to 10 because the lowest prize you can get is in the 10 ticket bin.  Besides, I think it is so disheartening to tell a kid that they can not get a prize because they only have like 3 tickets.  Also the managers do not really mind when we do that.

Two hours pass by and as I am stocking the merch counter, I see that the old crotchety lady is back with her grandson to pick out a prize.  However they were looking at the other case and did not even acknowledge that they needed help.  I was done filling one bin, I turn around and this once kid who was barely tall enough to see over the counter hands me his receipt and he has 2 tickets which he then tells me that he wants stickers, and he even threw in a “please”.  Honestly, it is such a rarity for kids now-a-days to have and know manners, that it just always makes me smile whenever a kid can use it.  Just as I was about to hand him his stickers and send him on his merry little way the old lady was like “I know you saw me standing here!  That little boy was behind me!”

I gave her this flabbergasted look because honestly, I did not know what to say or do because it was just a super quick transaction.  I gave the kid my most apologetic look and told him that I would be with him in just one second.  As I was walking toward her and he grandson, she yells “Do you want me to talk to your manager AGAIN?!”  I just sigh and ask the little boy what he wanted and he insisted that he  gets a lollipop which can be bought using tickets.  She just throws his receipts at me and I look at them and instead of rounding up, I just add them just the way they are.  OH WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!	  He is JUST 3 tickets shy of getting his coveted lollipop.  

“Sorry kid, you do not have enough for you lollipop.”

“Can't you just give it to him?!” she screams at me.

“Sorry, I can't do that.  It's against company policy.  Maybe next time he will win enough to get it.”  I reply with my biggest smile.

She is fuming as her kid flops on his back on the floor and throws a huge temper tantrum.  She snatches the receipts out of my hand and literally drags he grandson out of the store, but before she leaves I yell “Have a MAGICAL day!”

I go back to the sad little forgotten kid and I give him his stickers and throw in a couple pieces of candy on the house.  He smiles an adorable smile and repeats “thank you thank you thank you!” as he runs to find his parents.

Our story begins in September, where SRP was taking the same class as me. He showed up to maybe two classes, then proceeded to believe he is is too good for school and never showed up again (note: There were no online lecture notes). Because SRP was in our friends group and I wanted to be nice, I let him know a couple of times via text that we had a quiz the next day. After the 2nd or 3rd time a mutual friend told me he was resonding to every text by telling people I was ""obsessive"" and ""wouldn't stop texting him"". So I stopped, and proceeded to ignore him. He asked for my help an hour before the final, but I ignored his texts.

Cue second semester, I have a lovely boyfriend who I am very close to. SRP proceeds to tell my boyfriend that he ""hates me"", and on another occasion ""Don't worry, targaryenpie's boyfriend, I wouldn't punch anyone in the face, no matter how much I hate them.""

Parking was VERY tight.  I had JUST gotten in with enough clearance on both sides to barely be able to crawl out once my friend was ready to meet.  The parking spaces were just that narrow.  I had barely made it in between the lines.

Enter guy to whom I will refer to as Entitled Jerk (EJ).  EJ and his parents were, as I learned, parked to my immediate right.  EJ's mom notices that the space is very constricted.  She says something to the effect of ""Wow, there's no way I'll be able to get in on that side,"" but not in an angry or accusatory tone.  Further, there was an open space next to their car, meaning they could easily get in and just deal with crawling over a passenger seat.

EJ took it upon himself to perceive this situation as an affront to his very existence.  He noticed me in the car and started yelling.  ""Hey asshole, move your car!"" ""Come out here and settle this like a man!"" and on and on.  Being legally and correctly parked between the lines, I knew I was not in the wrong.  As a result, I did not move my car or even acknowledge him.  I simply looked at him and his parents and went back to texting on my phone.

EJ could *not* handle someone not listening to him.  He cursed more and more and started getting into it with his parents.  EJ's dad tried to calm him down, and even went so far as to say ""he's in between the lines,"" noting that there was no wrong committed here.  Defeated, he (along with his parents) gets into their car on the right side.  As they leave, his parents wouldn't look at me out of embarrassment, but I gave EJ a nice wave.

She has gotten to the point she just says, ""Candy? (pause) candy? (pause) candy?"" and helps herself, no more please or thank you and climbs on my counters!

She is playing in the yard. I drive up and see her, so I close the garage door as quickly as possible to avoid the, ""Candy Candy Candy"" routine. She waits about 2 mins and comes to the front door. Rings the doorbell for 20 seconds straight, I ignore it. Then 30 seconds, then 1 min, this goes on for about 10 mins. She finally leaves.

Suddenly, the kid runs up to me in a bathrobe and towel wrapped around her head. ""Oh, I was in the bath, sorry. Do you need something?"" (She still has clothes on under the bathrobe.) I hand her the book for her mom and know I have been defeated in petty revenge and stalk off home.

scordatura,48,,91,1qnmdk,,419,"One day I got called down to the office.   That was nothing new.   I used to skip class a fair bit, and do other things that teachers, the principal and vice-principal found very annoying.  I was in French class when I called called down.  That was great; I didn’t like French.  I had no facility for languages.  Either that, or I was just plain lazy.  Probably the latter.  So anyways, I got called down to the office.  Off I went, and sat on this bench in the outer area with the secretary, waiting to be called in.  

I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  I waited for forty-five fucking minutes, without being brought in to see the principal.   This was in the 70’s.  I had no smartphone to amuse me, and I hadn’t thought to bring a book.  So I was sitting there, bored as hell.  Finally I stood up, told the secretary I wasn’t going to wait anymore, and left in time for science class, a class I did happen to like.  I was curious about whether I’d get in trouble for not sticking around, but the funny thing is, I didn’t.  I didn’t even get called back.

When I realized I wasn’t going to get called back to the principal’s office, that really pissed me off.  It meant he’d been deliberately wasting my time.  Hitherto the principal had never been the direct target of my vengeance, but now he was squarely in my sights.  That night, I got to work.  Or rather, early the next morning, for it was 2 am when my alarm went off.  I jumped out of bed.  Time to call the principal at home!  I couldn't believe he’d be so stupid as to have a listed number.  

There was no call display in 1979.  There was no chance the call would be traced.  Unless the principal recognized my voice, there was not the slightest fucking chance I would ever be held to account.  So I rang the number, and after a few rings, the principal picked up.

“Who is this, and why are you calling at 2 am?”  said the principal, annoyed and puzzled.


“Mr. Pxxxx?” 

“Yes.  Now who are you?” he demanded, even more annoyed.

“Freen.”  I was keeping my words short.  Less chance of being identified.

“What??”

“Freen.”  I hung up.

A few nights later, I’d set my alarm again.  Same call.  Same word:  “Freen”.  Sometimes I’d call three nights in a row.  Then skip a few days.  Just to change things up, I’d call at the dinner hour.  Occasionally I’d call the principal at his office, from the payphone in the school’s entrance, just to keep him on his toes.  And always I’d say one word, and one word only:  “Freen”.

Now if you’re thinking that calling the principle at 2 am was my revenge, you’re very much mistaken.  There was a purpose to my calls.  I was waiting for my opportunity for real revenge, and after a month or so, I got my chance.  

One day I was sitting in the lunch room.  The lunch room was this tiny cramped converted classroom.  Small and crowded, and you weren’t allowed to be too noisy because there were classrooms down the hall and the teachers would get pissed if you yelled or something.  So here I was, munching a sandwich, when in walks the principle.  I don’t know why.  Maybe he wanted to speak to the teacher who was supervising that day.  Anyways, in he walks.  He was about ten feet away from me with his back to me.  And then, loudly and distinctly, I said,

“Freen.”

The principle whirled around in my direction.  But right after speaking, I’d shoved most of the sandwich in my mouth and started to chew.  He looked right at me, but I was the kid with his mouth full.  Had to be someone else.

“WHO SAID FREEN???” he shouted.  Utter silence descended.  He looked around some more.

“WHO SAID FREEN?  One of you said Freen, and I want to know who it was.  SO WHO SAID FREEN?”

The students all looked at each other with what today would be called WTF expressions.   After realizing he could not find out “WHO SAID FREEN”, the principle gave up, and stormed out.  People were too shocked to laugh.  We just looked at each other.  That day, word got around that the principal had a meltdown in the lunch room and was saying crazy shit.  


Of course I set my alarm when I got home that day.  At 2 am I made my call.  The principal answered.

thedictatorscut,34,,61,181gfo,,425,"I work in a building on a pretty busy street in the middle of NYC. In recent months, one specific TV show has taken up filming on our street a couple times a month, two or three days a week. It's fucking annoying. The entire street is basically blocked off save for one tiny area that cars can squeeze through, with the rest being taken up by trailers and electrical trucks. Half the time I have to walk all the way around the block in order to get into my building, because I get halfway down the street before a PA tells me ""Nope, can't go down this way."" When it's 19 degrees out, an extra four or five minutes outside is A BIG DEAL. The crew are uniformly dicks (speaking as someone who's worked in production, I know dickishness from professionalism), the trailers are huge, and it's just horrible.

Let me reiterate: this happens between five and ten times *each month*.

So. Lunchtime the other day. Nothing in our building cafeteria really appealed to me that day (lentil soup and shrimp wraps? come *on*, I just want a breakfast sandwich or something), so I decided to run out to a deli down the street. Except - oh, wait. The entire street has become a holding area for the crew of this damn show. A PA yells at me to cross the street. So I sigh, and I do, and I start navigating through the mess...

... and then I notice the catering truck set up just a few trailers away. And what with my nondescript black winter jacket and my naturally brusque manner, nobody blinked twice when I strode up to crafty and asked what was for lunch. Chili! Sure, I'd love chili. And then I took my chili back to the office, sat at my desk, and ate it. And it was damn good.

I may never pay for lunch when they're filming out there again.

billraydrums,27,,83,16xu5w,,418,"I was the drummer on a cruise ship back in 1993. We had a new band member come on board, a sax player who liked to come up to people and scream ""CAW"" in their faces, like a crow or rook. Really loud, very annoying.

I was in my bed one day; our cabins had two bunks on either side of the room. I was lying on my stomach and I heard this guy come in. ""If he screams in my ear it'll""...""CAW!!!"" Yep, he had put his mouth right to my ear and let loose with his stupidity.

It was with that sound that I raised up a little bit too quickly in bed, you see I'm easily startled and when that happened, I suppose it scared me and the back of my head connected with his nose with such a way that I actually felt it snap. I laid back down as if nothing had happened and went back to sleep. As he was leaving I could hear ""That guy just hit me""... ""Dude, your nose is pushed in, go to the ship doctor NOW"".

Honestly, I didn't mean to hit him to cause damage. It just happened that way. 

Needless to say, I was addressed from that point on as ""hi, how are you today?"" 

He had to relearn to play sax with a busted nose, and from that point on his CAW habit was cured. We actually became friends too and nothing was ever said about me hitting him.

ShaneL79,65,,86,16vduq,,420,"One afternoon a few years ago, I was at my apartment for lunch. When I was leaving I found a note on my windshield that read:

*Hi ShaneL79,*

*This is [neighbors name]. I just witnessed a grey honda civic with license plate ____ hit your car as it was parking. They moved to the other side after hitting your car, probably to make it look like it wasn't them. If you have any questions, my number is _____.* 

This neighbor was a nice older woman I had met a few times in the parkade of our building. On this day I was parking in the visitor parking because it was a better spot and empty during the day. 

After doing some investigating and evidence gathering I was able to determine that the honda civic next to me had a fresh scratch that started and stopped at the exact same height as the one on my car. I knew it was fresh because there was a loose black chip of paint (the color of my car) hanging from it. My car had grey paint in the scratch. The scratch itself was about 4"" tall by about 16"" long. There was also a unique deeper impression about a 1/3 of the way up the scratch that lined up perfectly with a protruding piece of the civics bumper. Took photo's with measuring tape on each part.

As I was doing my ""investigation"" the owner came out. A girl in her 20's along with her boyfriend. I confronted them but as expected they denied it despite the mounting evidence to the contrary.

I explained my situation to the building manager and then went to the police. The police were impressed with my evidence and said they would send someone out. When I got back to my apartment the building manager explained that she had the car towed for parking in the visitor parking spot. They normally don't care, but because of the situation she wasn't giving letting this girl off.

The cop showed up shortly after and looked through my evidence and spoke to my witness. She said she was going to press charges for hit and run but it would be a few days since she was on days off as soon as she left my place.

A couple days later I get a call from another cop telling me they are no longer pressing charges because there wasn't enough evidence. I was shocked and asked what type of evidence he needed is a witness and scaled photo's didn't work. He told me he never seen the photo's and my witness told me she didn't talk to anyone else.

That night I got a call from the cars owner demanding I repay her the $375 it cost her for towing and impound charges. Claiming it was all my fault and the police told her she was innocent.

Another couple days later and I called the original cop I dealt with who was now back on duty. She explained her partner screwed up and confused the files for two similar cases she had. She explained they were still pressing charges but were having trouble getting a hold of the girl.

Knowing that the girl wanted money I came up with a plan to meet her at a specific time so the cop could charge her. When I showed up the girl did as well with two guys who I assume were there to intimidate me. Once I confirmed it was the girl, the cop came out from around the corner. She became very difficult towards the cop so the cop actually arrested her and then had her car towed and impounded - AGAIN!

A few weeks later I realized that this girl was parking in the visitor parking overnight on a weekend. It was a holiday weekend so the building manager office was closed so there was no fear of parking in those spots. The best part was I was on the 20th floor of our building and had a balcony looking straight down on visitor parking.

One of the places I stop by to grab lunch at employs a man who I believe may have some form of autism.  He doesn’t make eye contact or show much facial expression and is a little slow when it comes to entering your order but he is a very diligent worker(DW) and if he makes a mistake, he fixes it and apologizes.  This isn’t a problem for me since I can come and go to work as I please but today I had the most impatient, heinous cunt(HC) standing in line behind me.

She was on her phone complaining about how long it was taking to get through the line to whoever was on the other end.  It started off with the usual huffing and bitching but then the nasty remarks about the cashier spewed out.  HC was just loud enough that I could barely overhear her.  It was that hissed kind of whispering that people do when they really don’t want to be overheard.  Unfortunately for her, I overheard right as she said that the retard was taking too long.  I am not a confrontational person but I turned around and stared right at her until she gave me a withering look more said, “What? It slipped.”

I turned around and got called to a second register to place my order.  DW was unfortunate enough to take HC’s order.  She was off the phone and placed it and her oversized purse on the counter next to me.   As I picked up my to-go order, I deliberately turned and let my bag hit her belongings hard enough to knock them to the floor.  She looked livid but didn’t say a word as she went to pick her things up.

What she didn’t realize was that as her precious belongings were falling to the floor, I let out a silent fart that I’d been holding in since walking inside.  Her face as she encountered the invisible cloud of stink was priceless.  And my words to her?

PXRPTRVPSTVR,106,,110,15mvzf,,421,"I *think* this is the proper place for this, as I'm an incredibly petty individual and really love what's happening in this sub-reddit. My story goes as follows:

I live in a city with a sizable gay neighborhood. One day, a college friend found a sweet drink deal ($5 all you can drink drafts for the 3 hours our alma mater had a football game scheduled) in the heart of said neighborhood. Being the reasonable alcoholics we are, we bought ten drink tickets and began inviting fellow alumni to join us. Giving away free beer on short notice proved marginally more difficult than we thought, so a few friends-of-friends found their way into the fold. 

Things started off well. They had Rogue Dead Guy on tap, the bartender aired the game on three TVs, and the place was pretty much all ours. As the game progressed on, we drank heartily as our team took a commanding lead. By the fourth quarter we were well on our way to being ripshit drunk, the drink deal was near expiration, and the usual clientele (gay dudes) began filing in. 

One of the friends of a friend was particularly hammered, and apparently quite homophobic. He began dropping the F-bomb with an astounding proclivity- and I don't mean fuck. This condescending asshole kept audibly calling gay dudes in a gay bar in a gay neighborhood faggots. 

Needless to say, my sensibilities were quite offended. Being the spiteful jerk that I am, I calmly told him my phone had died, and asked to borrow his phone (to text myself his number). I then grabbed a handful of cocktail napkins, scrawled his digits on them, signed them with his name and ordered half a dozen whiskey shots. I requested the bartender distribute them along with the napkins to the most single males in the room. I gave him a reassuring wink and a nice tip, and took a seat next to the homophobic shitbag who couldn't keep his mouth shut. 

In a mere matter of minutes, men started walking up to our table and asking who Marty was. I pointed him out, and announced I was stepping outside to have a smoke as they thanked him for the drinks. A few minutes later, he comes flying out of the bar, ranting about how all the fags are hitting on him and it's gross and they're disgusting and he shouldn't be there. I agree, and hail him a cab. 	

For your average individual, the prank might have stopped there. However, I am extraordinarily petty, and proceeded to set up Google Voice accounts for the purpose of masquerading as the recipients of the drinks bought under his name. Every time I'd catch wind of him doing something homophobic or otherwise intolerant, I'd send him a text telling him how much fun we had, how we should get together again, etc. I kept at it for a solid 6 months until he moved 1000 miles away and started threatening to report phone harassment to the cops.

**TL;DR- Homophobe shows up at gay bar to watch football game, gets wasted, uses homophobic slurs to insult gay people. I buy drinks for patrons of the bar under his name, they hit on him, and he spazes. I then proceed to text him from Google Voice accounts masquerading as the dudes who hit on him for months when he shows signs of intolerance. He eventually freaks out and moves 1k miles away.**",Homophobe Gets A Taste of Intolerance ,531,pettyrevenge
k-squid,32,,111,1qytdq,,418,"My first job was in a bowling alley/arcade. I originally worked at the prize counter, and then switched over to the food court. They're not the best stories of revenge, but they felt pretty good for 16 year old me.

The first tale of revenge comes from a real prick of a coworker. During my first week, he constantly left me alone behind the counter to go hang out in the food court with some other employees. If I had a problem and went to ask him for help, he would refuse to move if I didn't have every minute detail, leaving me running back and forth between Prick and a now annoyed customer. There were many times where he left the counter to go play games on the clock, something I had been told was a fire-able offense. He constantly had a problem with anything I said or did or enjoyed. When introducing me to other employees or regulars, he would always say, ""That's k-squid, the lesbian,"" because I had a short hair cut. He also would refer to me as ""retard"" or call anything I liked ""retarded"".

You may be wondering whether or not I went to management. I did. Multiple times. I told them exactly what Prick was saying and doing, but they either ignored it or laughed and said something like, ""Yep, that's Prick for you!"" I tried going to the arcade manager to get different shifts, but there were none available. I was stuck working with Prick all the time.

Eventually, we all found out that Prick had dropped out of high school. In May of his senior year. No intention of continuing elsewhere or getting a GED. 

Wat. 

On this particular night, some of Prick's friends had come in to say hi and play games, and Prick started making fun of everything about me, his friends joining in and all of them having a good laugh at my expense. Finally, Prick says, ""K-squid, you're such a fucking retard."" Without skipping a beat, I replied, ""Yeah? I may be a retard, but at least I won't have to work here for the rest of my fucking life."" He stared at me, slack jawed, while his friends were rolling with laughter. He never called me retarded again.

The second story of revenge took place after I switched to the food court to get away from Prick, and while I was planning on putting in my two weeks notice. A friend from school had gotten me an interview at the coffee shop he worked at, and it seemed definite that I would be hired. (I was, in the end.)

Being that the bowling alley was my first job ever, I was a total ~~model employee~~ suck up. I'd be there early every day, stay late, do whatever the managers asked without complaint or question, and took shifts for people whenever they asked. After switching to the food court, it was also rather common for the food court manager to schedule me from 2pm-10m, and then come to me at 7pm the day of to say that she was leaving to see her boyfriend and that I was to stay until close, at 2am. I did this without complaint, and often without a break even though it was illegal to have someone under 18 working past midnight.

I had put in a request off for a particular weekend well in advance. I was promised that I would have it off with no issue. Lo and behold, I get scheduled both Saturday and Sunday. I went to the food court manager who told me that she and her boyfriend had decided to go away for the weekend, so I would just have to work. I went to the GM, who told me there was nothing he could do. I had to find someone to cover both shifts. Of course, not a single person was willing to take my shifts. Even though I'd taken at least 3 shifts for each of them. I went back to the GM who told me, ""It's not my problem. I don't care.""

Defeated, I went home at the end of my shift and just bawled. I was so sick of being treated like complete shit, of being talked down to and taken advantage of. It was then that I decided my revenge. 

Cue to Saturday afternoon, 1:58 pm. I'm sitting comfortably in my PJs at home. The bowling alley, arcade, and food court were likely already swamped with customers and it would only continue to get more and more busy. I called the food court and said I wouldn't be coming in. I'd quit. The guy I was supposed to work with immediately got the GM on the line. ""You can't quit now! It's the busiest night of the week! [Male coworker] is the only one we've got! [Food Court Manager] is out of town, and I know you couldn't find anyone else to work for you! What do you expect us to do?!"" I took a breath, steadied my voice and said, ""It's not my problem.

On attempting to book a table the next day I was informed that I'd have to pay an extra £60 as they had since improved their menu. I was pretty pissed off as I'd paid for the deal the day before, so this was clearly bullshit, and when I asked to just get my money back, I was told to fuck off basically. Anyways, I paid, we went and had a good time, I grumbled a bit afterwards and all was forgotten.

Many months later I receive an email from them, stating that as I am a loyal customer I am invited to participate in their first 'Pay what you want' night they were trialing, brilliant I thought! I quickly forwarded this to my girlfriend, saying 'At last, we can get one back on these bastards and get a free dinner!'. Seconds after sending I realised that I had pressed reply instead, woops! I got an email back from the manager, basically stating that I had a shitty attitude and shouldn't take advantage of them. 

So, I got my girlfriend to book instead, enjoyed a great night with some nice food and then gave them sweet fuck all at the end! (I did tip the waitress pretty well instead though).

I then replied to the email from the manager, stating how they'd fucked me over before and ending with -

He's one of those guys with Charisma 10, who could talk his way out of any situation, while I was a severe SAP (still am, but I've improved). At the same time, he wasn't a great roommate. He'd be up late, with people in the room while I was trying to sleep, take my nice beers from my fridge and try to pay me back with his shitty ones, mooching food I'd make while never providing any of his own, etc... Whenever I'd try to confront him, he'd turn it around and I'd end up apologizing to him for some reason. 

So, having issues, and being as socially awkward as I was, I'd respond, mostly when I was drunk. First maybe once a year, I might get angry and try to fight him (though I'm kinda small, I definitely was in better shape and the better fighter- he hated physical activity of any kind).

When the guy comes back to pay he sees all theses after-market parts and all the extra costs of getting this parts shipped across the country. (Granted, the price difference of getting cheaper used parts shipped really far or getting more expensive new parts not shipped as far is probably a fairly small margin)  Furious, he storms into my dad's office.

""I said no fucking after-market parts? Are you an idiot?"" he yells.

My dad looks him in the eye and calmly says, ""Well Mr..."" pauses to look at the invoice, "" Grebowski, it's a fringe benefit of my job that I can decide to use whatever parts I like.""

The guy stares at him for a while, then his eyes widen.  ""You're that crybaby I gave a ticket to.""  My dad just smiles and hands him the invoice, knowing that the guy has no choice but to pay it at this point.

jpffrt,34,,113,16fgla,,418,"I've just discovered this subreddit, so sorry for the late holiday story, but I figured that you'd all enjoy this.

I work as a cashier at a lovely hardware/houseware/everything but grocery store, and I was pulling an 8 hour during that wonderful season we call Christmas.

It was a normal night for December 15th, busy and cranky customers - which is to be expected, especially 10 days before Christmas. Almost all the tills are open and we're still lined into the shelves. It was about 2 hours until closing when I notice this woman at the end of my belt loading her items, even though the gentleman in front of her hasn't completed. I think no big deal of it and carry on. All is going well so far, and my shift is almost over.

So the gentleman whom of which was in front of the woman runs out of rooms for his items, so I stop the belt and manually reach for the old man who was in front of him's items. Whatever, right? Nope.
That damn woman at the back calls out to me in her mightier than thou voice, ""Excuse miss, I **need** you to move the belt. My stuff isn't on yet, and I need it on the belt so you'll complete my transaction quicker.""

I have to give her some credit, she did want to put everything on the belt at least.

So eventually both her and the man have their stuff up on my belt. Then I hear sighs. You know those bitchy, impatient sighs? Yep. A lot of those.

*Whatever*, I think, *its the holidays. She's probably got somewhere to go.*

Then I hear her shrill voice ring through my ears. She's telling the customers behind her about how long I am taking to finish the gentleman's order and then started making remarks about my goddamn appearance. I'm a short female with short blonde hair, mind you, but I can't stand when people get unnecessarily rude towards me.

I finish that transaction and its the lady I now refer to Cunty McCunterson's turn. Cunty is trying to be all nice and smiley. *Maybe she didn't know I heard her, or maybe she does know that I heard her..* So whatever, I start scanning her stuff, and begin to place it in bags. As soon as I place the first item I hear her pipe up, in an awkward trying to be nice tone of voice.

""**Excuse me** but I hate plastic bags. They're harmful to everyone. I'm kind of a plastic bag Nazi.""

I've had enough of her, so I look up at her with a dead look in my eyes and (mis)inform her that my grandma had escaped from the Holocaust and I'm Jewish.

The look on her face made the night so much better. The rest of the transaction was awkward and quiet, and I never saw Cunty again.

**TL;DR Christmas season, cunt in line, is an asswipe, calls herself ""bag nazi"", ends up looking like more of a cunt than before.**

multiplesifl,70,,106,16biph,,421,"About seven or eight years ago, my fiance and I were doing some minor ""Hey, we have no kids, let's buy dumb shit with our extra money"" shopping. We pulled into the lot of a local shopping plaza so he could go to GameStop and buy a game or two. Since he acts like a woman does in a shoe store when it comes to games, I opted to wait in the car and listen to music so he left and I proceeded to sing along poorly without spousal judgement. 

After a few minutes, a white car pulled in kinda close on my side for no real reason since the spot next to it was empty and as the middle-aged cow inside was getting out, she opened her door hard into mine. I looked over at her through my open window, expecting an apology I would immediately wave off because our car isn't exactly dent and scratch free. The bitch didn't even look in my direction. Acted like nothing even happened. I stared daggers at her while she walked into the CardSmart next door to GameStop, talking to myself about how much of an asshole she was, wishing there was something I could do to get her back. I didn't want to scratch her car up, not because it was wrong but it might take too long to do enough scratching to satisfy me before either the door-banging twat or my fiance came back and I didn't really know if he would approve. Right then, I remembered that we always stashed extra fire sauce packets from Taco Bell in the glove compartment. I opened it up and there was about twenty of them hanging out in there, so I grabbed six of them, opened all of them at once, and splattered her door and her door handle with the spicy sauce. 

The next three minutes were pretty tense, I have to admit, because I didn't know who was going to come out first. But the gods of passive aggressive must have been smiling down on me that day because my fiance came out of the store. I told him what happened and what I did in retaliation. He laughed heartily and we agreed she was a cunt. Part of me wishes she would have come out first so I could see her face but I think the way it went down was better.

110011001100,29,,72,1lemii,,417,"(AM a software developer)So, on my team in office, there is this guy. 

He checks in code, without testing it. And, immediately after checking it in, he shoots off a mail to the entire team including the manager that he has completed his work, unblocking XYZ (XYZ being me in this case).

Now, I discover that the code is terribly broken. Going and complaining to the manager is not really something I want to do, so I inform him via a mail just to him of the errors and to test his code before committing it.

He says OK, 2-3 days later it happens again. Tell him offline again.

Wait a week,this is on a Friday morning.He checks in broken code yet again, mails the team saying I am unblocked,etc. I have had enough. Decide to tattle on him

Now, I know he is going on a vacation and planning to leave the office during lunch.(hasnt taken approval,etc. Not needed where I work as long as noone elses work is blocked) Also, flights in India dont have internet yet, so I know he will be without internet access during the flight.

So, to summarize, the situation is:

* Guy has checked in bad code

* Told the manager he has checked in good code

* Is disappearing without approval

* Will not have email\phone access for a while

Now, I just spend some time before lunch listing out in some detail the bugs he has, and around the time his flight is to depart, I send off a mail responding to the mail he sent.

Manager sees mail, drops a mail asking me and the other guy to see him. I walk over, the guy (obviously) is not there. Manager shoots off a somewhat angry mail to the other guy. 

No response till Saturday evening. On Monday morning dude is missing again. Team meeting is called, guy is declared unreliable and moved to doing manual testing. Guy comes in post lunch directly from vacation and switches on his phone in office while logging into PC. -- turns out, his cell had run out of battery while leaving and he never cared to charge it over the weekend.

While mowing the lawn at a very wealthy condo complex, I had been assigned the (shitty) job of using the small push-mower to cut the areas inaccessible to the big, stand-on mowers. This includes the small 'courtyard' that each unit has. At around 2PM, a black (this is important) woman came out of the unit I was mowing, and starts yelling at me. As I reached down to turn off the mower, she ripped my earplugs out of my ears. She said: "" Look at you, white boy: you're taking jobs away from all the immigrants! And look at how shitty that half of my yard looks!' me: ""Uh, ma'am, I haven't cut that part yet. If you have a problem with us, I can call my boss [who owns the company]."" her: ""Just because I'm African-American you think you can be condescending to me?!""     

  

  


  
  
My boss was planting flowers right around the corner, so he had heard all the commotion. It was at this point that he stepped in and said: ""Hi, [Ms. Harris, we will call her]. I'm [call him Rob]. What is the problem?""  Ms. Harris: ""this little white kid thinks he is smarter than me, is doing a terrible job cutting my lawn [*points to uncut portion*], and was being extremely rude!""  Rob: ""Well, Shock_Hazzard is one of my best workers, and he can cut designs into the lawn like the baseball fields have!

Ms. Harris: ""well he needs a talking to! You'd better speak to him NOW.""

tttt4,80,,83,1ezf9d,,413,"I had a step-mom that I would visit every weekend from about the age of 4 to 14. My step-mom on several occasions found me (only child) and her sons/daughters doing something we weren't supposed to be doing, and she would only punish me for it, letting her kin go unscathed. She would make me feel guilty for things when, looking back on it now, I realize I was doing nothing wrong at all. I was a shy, quiet, easily-intimidated kid and she took advantage of that and bullied me. She would yell. I remember her even forcing me to drink milk at the dinner table after I told her I was lactose intolerant. She was all about asserting her control over me, which was easy because I never fought back. She never physically abused me, but all this was enough to set the seeds for issues that I still deal with as a 25-year-old man. She busted into my room once when I was naked after just getting out of the shower (I was probably 10) and I quickly covered up with the towel and, expecting her to apologize and leave quickly, I instead was told ""Oh please, there's nothing there I haven't seen before."" That in particular really made me feel violated. She made me feel guilty for wanting my own privacy. I remember being a little child and having to say ""I love you"" to her and feeling sick about it because it was such a blatant lie. In reality I was terrified of her. 

When I was 18 she wrote me a letter asking for forgiveness for how horrible she had been during my childhood. The thing about forgiveness is that you can't really force it, even if it does seem like it would ""taking the high road"". And I didn't feel an ounce of it. This letter was long. It was clearly heartfelt. And it got no response. A few months later she sent me an email wondering if I had gotten the letter. I replied with a single world: ""yep.""

I hope she feels guilty for being such a piece of shit to me during my most vulnerable and formative of years. She has reached out to me more times telling me how much she loves me and misses me.  She will never receive anything satisfying back from me. I still have to deal with issues of self esteem, guilt, and relationship problems because of her.

Clearly_Im_lying,21,,62,1ch2ez,,414,"I am relaying a story my wife told me recently, and I thought it to be a pretty good candidate for pettyrevenge.

Back in the late 80s/early 90s, my wife (lets call her Sara for this story) was 6 or 7 years old, and had an older sister (we will call her Laura) who was 9 or 10 at the time.  Nowadays, Laura has a good 3 or 4 inches on Sara, and it wasnt much different back then.

At some point, for reasons unknown to Sara, Laura got into the habit of randomly punching 6 yr old Sara in the stomach, multiple times a day.  Sara is a tough cookie, and for the most part didnt cry too much, but most 6 year olds would probably break down a little after too much of this.  Oh, Sara would try to fight back, but her being 6 yrs old and Laura being 9 and much taller than her, Sara's punches didnt have as much of an impact, and in no way deterred the actions of Laura.  This went on for days.

After 4 or 5 days of this happening, Sara was watching Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon, and saw a brilliant idea she could translate into the real world.  One of the characters used a metal serving tray as a chest protector.  

So Sara finds the thinnest, hardest cover book she can find (like a children's book, or where's waldo) and stuck it underneath her shirt.  Then she began taunting Laura, ""I bet you cant punch me as hard as you can!""  What bullying older sibling is going to turn that down?  So Laura cocks her hand back, and swings with all her might.  My wife said she heard 2 noises.  The thud of Laura hitting the book, and the crunch of laura's hand buckling from the pressure.  Instantly, Laura dropped to the floor crying hysterics.  Their dad rushes over and askes them what the heck happened.  Sara explained the whole situation with the biggest grin on her face, to which her dad responded, ""Way to go Sara!  That will teach Laura to punch you like that!""

And it did, because Laura stopped that little habit right away.

Lokified,36,,79,1o1ddj,,415,"This happened about 15 years ago.  There were two girls on my highschool bus that were just absolutely horrible people.  They would constantly yell rude things at people and the bus driver.  One of our passengers had really bad acne and they picked on her relentlessly.  


So, I secretly made a petition to have them removed from the bus.  I had every single person on the bus sign it, including the ones who acted chummy with the bullies but were really just protecting their own asses.  I then took this petition to the principal and both girls were banned from our bus system for the remainder of their high school careers.  They both had 2 years left.


My only regret is that the parents were REALLY pissed off about the incident because we lived about 20 minutes outside of the city, and now the parents were responsible for getting the brats to school.

Well, in case you didn't know, we are a parts department. We have many parts for many cars. What car do you have and what part do you want?

Anyways, I survived his grumbling about my incompetence and got him his part.

As I was getting the carts together in the cart coral, he walks out the door, pushing the car with one hand and carrying the pulley with the other. Since it was too difficult to walk the cart over to the coral, he just pushed it towards the wrong side of the coral.

Well, it was just his luck that our parking lot is far from even. As the cart is headed towards the coral, it started a gentle right turn towards his car. Then he started yelling.

&gt; Hey kid! Go grab that cart, its going to hit my car!

DutchessSFO,34,,92,1lrltt,,409,"This is from a few years ago but I still love telling this story. Sorry it's kind of long. So, I owned a townhouse in Chicago and as it is when you live in the city, we had very limited parking. We each had a garage and in addition there were two guest parking spaces shared with 4 townhouses. I lived there for a year and all was fine, when my BF came over he had a place to park and it made things very easy. That is until a new neighbor moved in. New neighbor moved in and proceeded to park his junker car in the guest space and never moved it. 

Now, the bylaws of the homeowners association state that the guest spots are for guests and absolutely no non-operational vehicles or vehicles with expired tags could be parked there. New neighbor's car sat there for weeks and never moved. I left a note for him, because I never saw him, and asked him to move his car. It never moved. So, getting tired of this ugly junker parked in front of our house, taking up a precious parking space I called the property manager and complained. It worked initially the car was parked on the street for a few days but because it didn't move, the city tagged it for towing and it was immediately back in the guest parking spot. 

I gave the guy a chance but a week later, car was still in the guest parking space collecting dust. I called the property manager and complained and car moved. This went on a couple times and then nothing happened. Car just stayed there, no matter how much I complained the property manager would ignore it. She was ignoring my calls and wouldn't talk to me. I finally got her on the phone and said I needed to stop complaining because the owner of the car ""Needed more Time"" to figure out what to do with his car. I asked her, how much time is ""More time"" and she just kept saying he ""Needed more time"". I was pissed because he was tying up a hard to find parking space with a car that doesn't run and it was obviously breaking the rules and he had been given plenty of time. All I could get was ""He needs more time"". Fuck it, I give up. 

Fast forward three months and I'm doing some remodeling on my house and I drag a bunch of garbage to the curb on a Saturday. Carpet, tile, wood flooring scraps etc, all building materials from my remodel. I know the city won't be there till Thursday but I have a business trip and figure it sitting outside for a couple days won't hurt anything. I leave on Monday and I get a call in the evening from the Property Manager basically yelling at me saying I can't leave that stuff on the curb and I need to bring it in my garage immediately until thursday when the city picks up the garbage. I explain that I'm out of town and I can't get there to move it etc and she blows up on me about this and that and rules. Finally, I pause and say ""I need more time."" She says, ""what did you say?"" I said, ""In the past when rules have been broken, a I need more time is a good excuse. So, that's it. I need more time."" She stuttered and I just kept repeating ""I need more time"". You should have heard her rage on the phone. It was absolutely glorious, the frustration and anger in her voice as I just kept repeating ""I need more time."" She hung up on me she was so pissed. 

Now, like a good neighbor I called the city immediately and asked them to send a special pick-up the next day but god did I like throwing her own words back in her face.

Today is my last day of work. I work in a large food and beverage factory which has surprisingly terrible food and beverages at the cafeteria. As a result, my coworkers and I often speed out on our lunch break and get some fast food near by. One such place is a famous sub sandwich shop. I have only eaten there twice because of the terrible service. Yesterday I was running late and decided to stop there out of convenience.

The infraction

I placed my order for a generic 12 inch sub and the woman behind the counter gets to work; she tosses on the meat cheese, toasts that mother, and then comes the veg. Now, I'm no sandwich artist, but I'm fairly certain I know the way things work around this establishment, I'm a seasoned vet if you will. I ask the woman to throw on some lettuce... With pitiful results. Okay fine. Lettuce is just the filler anyway. Then comes the pickles... Three of them. Doing some quick sandwich math you can see that this is insufficient by most standards. So I ask for more politely, to which I get "" sir I can't just load your sub with all the free stuff you want, now please finish your order"".

Da fuck. 

I quietly accept defeat and scarf down the most pitiful turkey sub that ever was.

The revenge!

So I return to the sub shop today, and low and behold, it's the same sandwich nazi that took my order last time. Even better. I proceed to order the most outlandish sub known to man: tripple meat mix, tripple cheese, chicken breasts and 12 whole strips of bacon. This thing is one for the record books. Just for shirts I tell the woman to absolutely load it with every veg in the case. Ofcourse her version of ""loaded"" is nowhere near mine. It comes time to pay at the register when suddenly I seem to have forgot my wallet in the car. I told her I would be right back. I wasn't.

Me: Yes, ma'am.

Her: You're so God Damned stupid! It has spices in it! It's spicy and I CANT EAT IT! It burns my throat! I want my chicken battered in flour! Only flour! Do you got it?

Now, it was truly not a problem to batter her chicken in flour (an option for people with allergies and maybe high-blood pressure as there is not salt added unless specified), but a simple, ""I'll have the flour-battered chicken"" will suffice.

One night, we decided to eat out in one of our fav restaurant. One of the cook there is BF best friend. He's making the best rib in the entire world, also the restaurant is known for it's amazing smoked meat sandwich. We decided to get seated in a more remote place of the restaurant because I'm an ex fatty and have problem eating in public. The waiter come to take our order, raw steak for me and a pint (or maybe more) of Creemore. Bf decide to have the rib sandwich (because rib sandwich, nuff said). Waiter is about 50 something y/o, pretty cool, apologizing because it's saturday night, it's pretty full. Two middle aged lady are seated next to us, after a certain time I start feeling like somebody is looking at me (If you suffer of social anxiety you know that you always feel that way in a crowded place) so I don't really pay attention to it. Having a good time, holding hands, talking about the beer since we are home brewers. I still feel looked at, start to feel anguish, looking around, seeing nothing ... Feel even worst because I think that I'm starting to paranoid and I hate when it happen. Then I hear the lady next to us tell her friend: Good lord, I really hate it when the employee can't talk in french! Why do they have to hire so many immigrant, they are taking jobs opportunity from our people(The bus/hostess girl is a extremely beautiful south-american girl, with the most sexy accent in the world and she's really really shy, so she barely talk to the customers when she seat them but she have a perfect french despite the accent.) Finally our meal arrive and I stop paying attention to the bitch. The food is delicious, as usual. It's like angels having an orgy in my mouth. Exchange food with the BF, ribs are as delicious as usual, waiter is kind, everything is AMAZING! 

While we are eating I hear the lady calling the waiter to her table: this smoked meat sandwich is full of fat (Well it's pastrami you know...) like big layer of hard chewing fat. The waiter being his amazing self tell her, oh I'm sorry we'll get it back to the kitchen and bring you another one free of charge. You must be pretty unlucky, we served them all evening and people keep telling us that they were fantastic, I'm sorry you felt on a bad piece, I'll be right back. This dialog ensue:
Bitch: No it's ok I will eat it anyway, don't bother going back in the kitchen I waited so long for it the first time I don't want to wait again.
Waiter: No, no don't worry, the rush is almost over and I will ask the cook myself to proceed your order in priority because you've already waited for your meal and he didn't verify the quality of the meat before making your sandwich.
B: No, no it's ok I don't mind I will eat it anyway *sigh* I'm not really hungry anymore anyway, all the fat in that sandwich made me sick *sigh*.
W: Ok then, I will cover your meal. Do you want me to bring you a coffee, a cup of tea? We also have delicious home made apple pie!
B; No no I'll pay for my dish, I don't want to eat nothing else from here.

Waiter come see us, asking if we want another beer and if everything is ok, BF telling him a little louder than usual that THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD HERE AND THAT WE WERE NEVER DISAPPOINTED OF OUR MEAL WHEN HE WERE VISITING HIS ESTABLISHMENT. 

Continue eating, barely listening to the annoying lady conversation, because steak is too delicious. Start to feel observed again, gets uncomfortable, stop eating and hold BF hand. He whisper to me, don't look but the lady next to us is looking in our direction since she arrived. That's why you feel tensed. Giving quick glances at the aforementioned old bitch. Yes she's indeed looking at us and not being real subtile about it. She starts telling her friend about girls willing to go out with ugly guys for cash or drug, basically saying they are worst than prostitutes (which I agree with) and glancing directly at me. My BF got really, really pissed, turned around and look at her directly in the eyes and tells her: No she's not with me because I'm rich, just because I have the biggest dick known to mankind. We silently glanced at her until she leave, which was done in a record time I must say.

FFW to end of the meal, the waiter come back, asking if we still have room for cake or home made pie and apologize again because we had to wait almost 45 min for our lunch. He told us that since 2 waitress called-in sick that day he did the waiting but hadn't done in in years since he's now the owner of the pub/restaurant. He also apologize for the way the lady acted earlier by complaining on her meal, almost throwing a fit for pretty much nothing (turns out the sandwich was totally fine). So we told him about what happened and learned that she use to come at least once a week, usually drunk off her ass and complain and pass comment on everyone. Since it was the first time a customer answer back to her and made her leave he paid for our drinks and decide to tell the staff she wasn't allow in anymore.

CFO422,23,,94,1ihcet,,409,"This was about three and a half year a go. I was working in a supermarket, specifically in the candy and crisps aisle. A huge obese woman enters the aisle with her 7ish year old son. I've seen them before, they are regulars. The kid is obese too. It's not hard to imagine why as they usually fill up the shopping cart with so much food that it's literally filled to the brim. 

Now this kid is always annoying, running around screaming and being a general waste of space. But this time he was accompanied by two of his friends, which made it even worse. To demonstrate how cool he was, he kicked over a stack of boxes I'd put in my aisle when his mom was in the next aisle. There were glass pots with Dorito's dip in there, and I saw that one broke because  dip started pouring out of the cardboard box. He obviously ran away with his friends before I could say anything to him. I was too busy to give a shit. The really annoying thing is that the mother returned to my aisle. I was expecting an apology because she obviously heard boxes fall and products break as her kids ran away laughing and screaming. But no apology, she just came back for more candy. She leaves her shopping cart in my aisle and walks away, probably to grab even more food.

I'm still stocking shelves by this point when I have a brilliant idea. I put at least €50 of candy in her shopping cart. It was so full, I figured she wouldn't notice. I chucked some expensive chocolates and whatnot in there. 

She comes back and takes her cart, she does not notice the extra stuff and leaves. She arrives at the registers and screams for her son to join her. I heard this and went into the manager's office for a good view. She starts putting her items on the belt when she notices the expensive chocolate. She proceeded to scream at her son (do you know how much these are?! etc.) and the kid obviously claims he didn't put the items in the cart. His mom doesn't believe him and makes him put the stuff back, which amuses his two friends.

I wish he could see my smug grin from the office. I hope he realized who actually did it and learned a lesson.

AggieChick13,58,,71,178qak,,405,"So my Junior year of college I transferred Universities to a school where I did not know a single person. As a poor student in a new city, I had not choice but to go potluck on a rooming situation at a student housing complex near the school. I did not know the name of my new roommate until a week before I was due to move in, and sent her a friend request on facebook to introduce myself (She never accepted the request). Although my school is 12 hours away from home, my mom drove down with me to help me set up my apartment. Walking in, she saw my new room mate setting up the living area and greeted her with a pleasant ""Howdy!"". This bleach blond, talon manicured, raccoon makeup-ed, princess brat glanced up from her Iphone, looked my mother up and down with a disdainful look, and turned her back to walk to her room without saying a word. I was shocked at her appalling rudeness, but figured we could talk it through later when it was just the two of us in the apartment.

  I opened the fridge we were meant to share, and found that she had packed it to the point where I could hardly fit a couple of water bottles in, with cheap light beers and diet food. I stacked some of the stuff that was not too fragile so that I could make some room for my own groceries. Later when I went to go buy some apartment supplies I found she took out some of my stuff she deemed as able to ""survive outside the fridge"" on the counter (my water bottles, apples, etc).  Upon viewing our bathroom, I found that she had moved my stuff around so she got all the prime space in the cabinets and the best towel rack (don't act like you don't know there is a better towel rack in your shared bathroom lol). I was upset about all this (mainly the issue with my mother, so I text her asking if we could have a little chat).
We met later that night and she listened to what I had to say but failed to apologize. Never one to raise my voice or express the depths of my frustration, I took her ""sorry did not hear your mom"" and ""yeah, I did not realize that would bother you, you can have some fridge space"" and decided not to pursue things over for the sake of peace in our apartment.

   What I did not know is that there was a different reason other than ""she is just a brat"" that she was treating me like this. I heard her speaking on the phone to someone that ""she did not understand why she had to live with someone ""like her(me)"" and that she ""did not want to live here anymore"". I did not get the big deal, until later that week when her friends came over and I heard one of them inquire about my Dos Equis beer in the fridge... ""Oh. It's like from the motherland for her lol"", she replied. She did not know I was home so I heard her continue with some jokes about my being ""Mexican"" and a ""loner"" (not that it makes a difference, but I'm a third generation American. I'm proud of my roots but also where I am now). She got really drunk with her girls that night and went out on the town. She began the weekly tradition of bringing home a guy from the bars, sleeping with him, and leaving him face down and buck naked on our shared living room couch (never understood why he did not just sleep in her room). I was hurt. I'm a proud Latina and never really thought hard that an educated individual would be so ignorant as to judge me solely by my race. I stewed about it and being timid and not the arguing kind, chose to fall into the most awkward living situation ever with us living side by side, completely ignoring the other's presence.

   I got sick and tired real quickly of her sexual escapades and drunken messes (Did I mention she faked orgasms so loudly that even turning up my Ipod all the way could not cover the squealing sound?). I got sick of hearing her tell her mother about the ""Mexican"" and how unfair it all was. I spent a lot of time away from the apartment largely to avoid her, which helped out in the long run because I made a solid and fun group of friends pretty quickly.

   Towards the end of our time together I thought... you know what? I have put up with this long enough; Time for some payback. I thought of all the things that might annoy her and remembered the Dos Equis incident at the very beginning. If she was going to ignorantly judge me on stereotypes, then stereotypes were what I was going to force feed her. I decided that if she was going to complain about a ""Mexican"" roommate, she was going to get the full ""Mexican"" experience.

  I called up a bunch of my Latino friends, and asked if they would like to spend  the night at my apartment and get uproariously drunk. While she hid from us in her room (she always disappeared whenever I had company). They set up their sleeping bags all over the apartment, and we proceeded to get wasted on Tequila I provided, while listening to ranchero music as loud as possible. We talked about her in Spanish loud enough for her to hear, making sure we threw in her name ever so often so that she could know she was the topic we were laughing about. She came out of her room around 4am when everybody was snug in our little Tijuana of sleeping bags, and I could nearly feel the intensity of the disgust rolling off of her. It was quiet enough for me to listen as I heard her sobbing in her room, on the phone telling someone that ""They"" were here, and were so loud earlier she could hardly hear herself think. Gee, I wonder how that feels?

The rest of the semester I hardly saw her, I think she stayed at a friend's house.

A bit into the trip, the train had to stop because the tunnel through the mountains was blocked.  Everyone on the train had to get onto buses to get past the blockage.  When this was announced (in German), the conductor came to find me because there were several English-speaking passengers who needed to have the situation explained to them.

After an hour of driving through the Alps, we are able to get back on a different train.  We returned to our reserved seats only to find that they were already occupied by a very rude group.  They insisted that the seat reservations only applied to the previous train (though the numbers were the same) and that they refused to move.  I challenged them, and they told me that I would have to talk to the conductor if I wanted them to move.

I told them that I would be very happy to talk to the conductor.  (Ja gern!)  Since I had recently done him a huge favor, he was most happy to force them out of our seats and scorn them appropriately for their attitude.

The pub is quite close to the course so, on race days, we get A LOT of business from people on the way to the races or getting their minibuses to drop them off at the pub. A few weeks back we were having a particularly busy day and after the last race we were flooded with drunken race-goers wanting to drown their sorrows/celebrate their win. At one point an extremely inebriated scouse dickhead decided in order to get my attention he would start leaning over customers in front of him and shout at me, wafting money in my face. I dunno about anyone else but I find that really fucking insulting. After making the guy wait a bit longer than it would have taken him to stand patiently I eventually served him. His drinks order consisted of 6 bottles of Becks poured in to glass (presumably 'cos he was too fucking good to drink from a bottle). As I handed him the first few I noticed he was passing them back to his friends, so I assumed the last beer would be his. As I was just about to remove his drink from the fridge he shouted ""Wanna take any fucking longer you little faggot?"". It was at this point that I decided to replace his bottle of Becks with a Becks Blue (non-alcoholic beer).

VigilantInfidel,69,,131,1m2nrp,,404,"This happened a couple hours ago. I'm a manager at a retail store and it's policy to welcome everyone as they come through our doors, as well as following-up with them often as they shop in case they need assistance. Some people perceive this level of attention as annoying but customer surveys tell us this is the thing that makes us stand out against our competitors. Apparently corporate thinks it's worth aggravating the few customers a week who hate social interaction to make sure all our customers are attended to promptly.

I greeted one particular gentleman at the door and we made eye contact but he immediately broke it off and he ignored me when I asked if I could help him find anything today. This reaction isn't unusual and I moved along to greeting the next person. I eventually moved to another part of the store for my rounds and kept running into the same gentleman. I'd ask him each time if he was still doing alright or if he wanted any help and he started going out of his way to avoid me if he saw me at the end of whatever aisle he was on.

Note: I wasn't constantly badgering him. He was a slow shopper and I was doing laps in the store keeping an eye on everything. I actually broke policy and stopped asking him if he needed anything because I didn't want to be annoying but he'd still go out of his way to turn his back to me every time he saw me. Oh well, I hate bothering people but his reaction was a bit overdramatic. I carried on.

At one point a customer waved me down from the other end of an aisle where I was and I had to walk past the gentleman to get to the other customer. He turned away from me to walk away, realized a very large woman was blocking his exit, and turned back. As I neared him he gave me this look of....oh, I want to say smug annoyance and condescendingly said ""Nothing's changed since the last twenty times you asked."" I raised an eyebrow at him and said ""Okay?"" and continued by to go help the lady who called me over.

The lady took quite a bit of my time and, since we were understaffed today, no one else was on the sales floor for general customer assistance. Well guess who started reluctantly standing around waiting for me to help him when he suddenly couldn't find the last item on his shopping list? He'd try to be in my peripheral and look impatient but would randomly walk off to (presumably) see if anyone else could help him, coming back more annoyed and impatient each time. Finally when I broke free from the pleasant lady it happened to be in the middle of a spell where the guy had wandered off. I caught him in my peripheral in the distance, trying to get back to where I was but I had already achieved escape velocity and was heading toward the Employee's Only backroom. Petty? Yup. Bad customer service? Admittedly so, but letting him see what that felt like was pretty cathartic.

TL;DR: I work 76 hours a week and my willingness to tolerate entitled pricks is not an infinite supply.

During my teenage years, lots of kids who were just getting their drivers license found huge fun by playing mailbox baseball.  This is where you drive down a rural road at night with your friend hanging out the window of your car with a baseball bat.  Your friend then proceeds to smash mailboxes as you drive past like a bat out of hell.  This game was played religiously on our road every year on Mischief Night (October 30.)

Since we were all more or less headed in the same direction, career-wise (that is, into the Oil Patch), and since all were geology majors, we were required to take rather a lot of chemistry. Inorganic was fun, organic was even a larger bales of cheers, but detonic chemistry was were all the really inspired stuff transpired. 

Now, there has to be a certain fly in this scholastic ointment, and there was one student was thought oil companies to be evil incarnate and wanted absolutely nothing to do with those “sell outs” that would gladly trade their souls for an overriding royalty interest and opportunity to get filthy rich. 

Also he (whom we shall dub ‘Mark’) was an avid environmentalist. 

No, screw that. He was a rabid environmentalist. 

He hated, with the burning passion of a thousand blazing supernovae, any of the extractive industries (coal and metals mining, oil and gas, hell, even dimension stone quarries and gravel pits were objects of his not-infrequent vociferous denunciations) and let us all know, full well, he was studying not only geology, but the ‘softer, kinder’ “geology” that is hydrogeology. 

Bleedin’ waterheads. 

However, in order to obtain his degree, he still had to take most all the same courses as we regular land-raping, cigar-chomping, booze-swilling, small-furry-animal-abusing petroleum types. 

Two key points: he didn’t take the same amount of chemistry as we (foregoing detonic chemistry for aqueous chemistry) and he loathed just being in the same classroom with us evil, more practical, types. The upshot being is that he never learned what are and what makes (hell, for that matter, how to make) certain contact explosives, and he eschewed going to class. Rather, he’d learned that if you give a dorm room’s door a good short, sharp shock (i.e., bashing the door just above the lock with the palm of your hand), the door would flex and pop open (hell, the doors were so flimsy, you could just about knock one down with a blunt remark). He’d then secret himself inside, swipe our class notes (we took the best notes), run down the hall to the copier and Xerox the living hell out of them. 

He’d hit everyone, but give the devil his due, he was one sneaky bastard. Never the same room twice for the same course’s notes and he never left any form of incriminating evidence behind (reminding everyone the time frame of this particular sneakery, before CSI and DNA analysis). But, more than once, he was discovered with Xerox’ed notes obviously not in his handwriting. We never confronted him (I mean, where’s the fun in that?) but did concoct a plan, so devious, to extract our little slice of payback. 

Remember detonic chemistry (the science of what makes things go *BOOM*)? Well, we all had fully two semesters of this under our collective belts and had practically memorized the chapters on ‘contact explosives’. 

Contact explosives are truly wonderful compounds. Simplicity itself to whip up a batch (cheap as well, as they all used common off-the-shelf chemicals), and lie in wait to plan our next move. I won’t list the identities of  all the compounds we were creating, for fear of some less chemically-minded person trying to create a batch and end up blowing their eyebrows off, but there is one that I simply must mention: Nitrogen triiodide, good ol’ NI3. 

Very stable stuff when wet (which allows for easy transfer, as soon will be seen) and fiendishly easy to detonate, with a satisfying flash, boom and puff of purple, with the lightest touch when dry. 

So, while ‘Mark’ was in his water class, and none of us were, we ‘entered’ (ahem) his dorm room and began to paint everything he owned with NI3. It doesn’t take much and when dry, it really doesn’t show up well at all, especially against darker surfaces. Safety note: we only used the smallest amounts (though everywhere) more to pixilate, rather than annihilate. 

First was the door lock, a little NI3 on a Q-tip, and deposit it right in the very bowels of the lock, then onwards to escalation…on the handle of his toaster, on each and every knob of his little black and white TV, more on the stereo controls, on all his loose change (which he kept in a shallow bowl), much of his silverware, under his coffee mugs, we went nuts, but restraint stayed our hands as we did not paint the interior of his Koss headphones (as much as we wanted to…). 

We all retreated to the commons for a cold brew and fine cigars (thought I was kidding earlier?) and await Mark’s return. I recall that a spontaneous poker game broke out as well, so much the better for our cover story. 

About halfway through a fine maduro hand-rolled, Mark shows up, gives us all a collective grimace (think Kent in “*Real Genius*”, but without the charm) and harrumphs himself off to his sanctum sanctorum. Down the end of the hall we all sat in the commons and had a pretty good view of his room and awaited the inevitable. 

*POW* There was the first one, the old key in the lock full of NI3. Beyond a look of surprise and a muffled “bastards!”, he shrugged it off like the harmless little prank that it was. 

Keys tossed into the change bowl *BLAM*. 

Stereo switched on *KERPOW*.

Fridge opened *FAGROON*.

Mark realized he was well and truly boned. He began to get a bit manic and ran around his room slapping everything and recoiling every time some heretofore inanimate object started lusting for his giblets.  

*BLAM*, *POW*, *KERFOON*, *KERBLOOIE* and other associated noises of really, really rapid chemical decomposition. So much so in fact, that his room was actually leaking purple smog which started drifting down the hall in small cloudlets. 

After 15 minutes or so of this, Mark thinks he’s finally found all the spots we sabotaged, walks out of his dorm room door and gives us a joint sneer that if fatal, would have sent us all home in buckets. 

After all this brouhaha and communal buffoonery, it goes quiet and things, as are their wont, lapsed back into a state of scholastic serenity. 

“I wonder if he found the spot where I painted the NI3 under the toilet seat?”

A sudden flash, a muted *boom* and Mark, screeching at us with his pants around his ankles told us that, yep, he just did.

**TL; DR: Don't swipe course notes from people who have easy access to a chemistry lab.**

drunkdinosaurs,30,,74,1chi4y,,397,"A few years ago, a then-coworker complained to me that his roommate had bought a brand of laundry detergent containing a chemical to which he is allergic and that he had a mildly uncomfortable rash all over his body because of it.  At the time, I strongly suspected that he and my then-girlfriend were sleeping together while I was at my other job in the evenings.  So, a few days later when my girlfriend was at work, I rewashed all of her underwear with a double dosing of the offending detergent and cut the rinse cycle short.

Lokismoke,13,,93,1l0baz,,397,"So yesterday I stopped by a big box retailer store.  I live in a college town so about this time of year a lot of parents are visiting and buying their kids school/living supplies for the coming year; the store was reasonably busy.

At every cash register in this store there is a lit up number above the register that can be set to 1) steady light, 2) off, or 3) blinking light.  The blinking light is used to call over a supervisor if there is an issue.

I come to a lit up register, but there is no cashier to be found.  It appears that the cashier is away from her post flirting with someone that I presume is her boyfriend.  This is ridiculous because the store is busy, and now I have to find a different register with a decently short line.

So I turned the register light to blinking.  Have fun explaining to your supervisor why your light is blinking!!!!","You waste my time, I'll waste yours!",490,pettyrevenge
emmadilemma,37,,61,1cnkr0,,397,"Today I was the First Class flight attendant, which I normally love. Except for LA flights. Everyone on the place to LAX is a princess and deserves to be treated like a celebrity - in their own minds. Generally, I try to accommodate that - within reason and rules. 

The lady in the first row was just rude to start with. It was all non-verbal. That huffy, breathy 'ugh' when I asked her to turn her phone off. The same one when I asked if she wanted me to hang her coat and the scarf was tucked inside it. 'Um, I'll *keep* the scarf' (okay, like I knew.) 

It was in total contrast to how almost everyone else behaved - the guy across the aisle even rolled his eyes and smiled at me after one particularly loud teeth-sucking response to my polite reminder to put her bag in the overhead bin.

So when it came time to offer drinks in the air I made sure she got the napkin that I had dropped ice on. All moist instead of crisp and dry. Truly petty. ","Don't be rude to your flight attendants, either, please.",458,pettyrevenge

One day, a lady comes up to me and says that our diet soda is out, and she REALLY wants her diet soda. No big deal, easy fix. As i begin to walk to the back to change it, she shouts something about how i suck at my job. i didnt like that one.

pettyjobthrowaway,23,,72,1ke0gs,,396,"So I had been looking for a job and was recommended by a friend to apply to a temp agency she used to work for. I did that night and got a call at 8am the next morning asking if I could come in for an interview the following day. Not to toot my own horn, but I am more than qualified for temp office work, with experience, a degree, foreign languages and appearance and not to mention I was **REFERRED TO THEM** by a long term employee, like... *one of their own* that quit only a few weeks prior. I go into the office for a mock interview with the agency completely friendly and optimistic. The girl who interviewed me was around my age, recent college grad, and was so rude to me. During our ""interview"" she kept looking at her watch, and when I answered her questions, trying to engage her in conversation, she just kept saying ""okay."" At one point she even cut me off and said, *""Okay, that's enough, I get it.""* She ended the interview by saying she would call me that afternoon. Well, she didn't. And she also said she would email me a link of sills tests to take (that would be the last step of the hiring process, and I couldn't be sent on assignments until they'd received the results of these tests), and she didn't. So I called her the next day, and she said she would email me, and she didn't. So the THIRD day I called her and we had the rudest exchange I have ever had with anyone, and it SUCKED because I wanted to be hired at this temp agency.

I told my friend about this girl and the experiences I kept having with her/their office she said to call the office back and ask for this other guy (Let's call him Jim) because he has a soul, unlike this girl. So I do, but instead of getting put through to him, the operator routes me to the same girl. She gets on the line and without even saying Hi, she just goes, *""Why did you ask to talk to Jim?""* I say, *""Oh, [Friend] mentioned she'd worked with him and I was still having trouble receiving the emails you sent me so I just figured I'd try someone else.""*

I kid you not, she says, *""Okay, I don't think they ever worked together, number one, and number two, I have sent you that email like four times already, so maybe somebody can help you use a computer.""* Jesus...

I say that I am really sorry but I haven't received any emails. Without hiding any annoyance, she says she'll try to send it to me one last time and to hold. TWENTY MINUTES LATER she comes back on the line and says, *""OK I sent it, did you get it?""* Wow, it showed up in my email. 

I politely thank her and casually say something like , *""Okay, so just take these tests and you can show them to potential employers?""* just trying to politely end the phone call...

And she says, *""Well, I already told you that after our interview, but I.... GUESS I COULD TELL YOU AGAIN... YES... BLAH BLAH BLAH""* I thank her again and hang up.

Maybe I am too sensitive, but this girl was a total asshole to me, and the entire time I had to be polite to her. I continue my job search and move on. I actually land a new job pretty quickly and it ends up being a GREAT fit and I love it (and have been there for about three weeks now).

About a week following that exchange, she calls me again and tries to schmooze me into accepting this temp job that is one month long and 40 minutes away. She WILL NOT STOP TALKING and I can barely get a word in to tell her I've found a permanent job and am not interested. I had time to process our interactions and decided that I really don't want to work with that temp agency if she is my assigned recruiter and I'd have to constantly be in communication with her. Just as temp workers are disposable to them, there are more temp agencies in this area if I am ever in need again. When she finally stops talking, I tell her I actually found a permanent position and that I am no longer available for temp work with her office. She asks me where I work. I say I'd rather not say. She asks me why not. I say because I'm not interested in having further ties with their office and to please remove me from their records as an available temp. She sounds completely indignant and says, *""Oh, okay then, well goodbye...I guess...""* (Goodbye yourself, wench)

Flash forward to today, when I am working. Someone comes into the office and I hear them talking to someone on my team. I head over to the copy machine and see that it's her. She greets me with this HUGE smile like we're old friends or something, extends her hand to shake mine and shoves her business cards in my hand, saying if our office ever needs any temps her company would be happy to provide them to us. She goes on and on listing various stats from her company and saying that I was indeed a temp at her office(!!!!) My supervisor looks at me and I just say, *""Yes, it was a very interesting experience. I should probably get back to work. Nice seeing you.""* After she left, my supervisor comes over and asked me why I reacted like that. I tell her I had been hired on at that temp agency and that girl was my recruiter, and she had absolutely no people skills whatsoever, I quoted some of the things she said to me (as it only happened less than a month ago) and I just had a really bad experience with the agency in general. She was still holding the business cards, and after hearing that, she ripped them in half and put them in the trash and said, *""Wow, thanks for letting me know. We've been thinking about hiring a temp agency before next summer.""*

Probably doesn't mean anything, but I know recruiters focus heavily on their business clients, and obviously treat their temps like shit. Funny, how if you're working with a bunch of people who are trying to find permanent work, it's likely that one day you'll run into them in a business you're wanting to to business with your company. This probably isn't the greatest Petty Revenge but it sure made my day.","Temp agency recruiter treats me like shit as a temp employee for her firm, awkwardness ensues when she later tries to schmooze me and my boss at my new permanent job",468,pettyrevenge

I had started marinating them days before. And they were looking *good*. 

Enter roomate. I told him DONT EAT THE STEAK. I coudnt have been clearer. You shoudl not eat this steak. This steak is not for you. I put a note in the steak, specificly designed to let him know not to eat the steak. 

Well, the big day is here! my brother is at the airport, and I am going to pick him up. We are super close and love when one visits the other. When I got home, I smell it. A glorious smell. The smell of expensive steaks cooking. 

I being foolish deside he cooked the steaks so we could eat right when we got home. Wrong. 

I enter the kitchen and what do I find? A huge mess, greese everywhere. and no steaks.

She still refuses to break the bill and tells mr brown to come back with smaller amounts of money.

Soon after, she started banging one of Jay's best friends, Adam, and they started flaunting their new relationship all over Facebook.

Obviously, Jay found out about it. They came to him with the, ""We meant to tell you first, we didn't want you to find out this way"" blah blah blah.

GingerSoul44,19,,68,183x59,,395,"I don't know if this is petty revenge, or really interesting to anyone other than me... so I apologize in advance if this is lame.

In high school, I had a classmate (let's call her C) who hated and bullied me. She and her friends were very outspoken in their dislike of me and made up countless rumors. I dealt with it quietly for a couple years because I really didn't want to deal with the drama of getting into a catfight. I hoped ignoring it would make it go away.

One day, a friend mentions that there was something very crude and sexual written about me in a bathroom stall. I recognized the handwriting immediately and knew it was C (we used to be friends and her writing was very distinctive). It was enough to push me over the edge, and I decided that something needed to be done. Sadly enough, I didn't know what to do.

Then one glorious Friday, I saw my chance for a bit of fun and revenge.

My school's broadcasting club did a short televised news show on Friday mornings, and I was one of the anchors who read annoucements and such. When I was handed the list of stuff to read, I saw the line with Homecoming court nominees. Sadly, C happened to be nominated. The candidates had already been announced Thursday at the end of the day, but no one really listens so most didn't know who the nominees were.

C wasn't one of the most popular girls, but had quite a few acquaintances who were willing to nominate her (at her request). Even though most of you probably think that getting crowned as Homecoming Queen is irrelevant and stupid (which it is), I knew that this was something she really wanted... she was not particularly smart or motivated to make much of her life, so she really didn't have much else going for her. It was my golden opportunity.

I arranged it with my co-anchor to make sure I got to read the female candidates. I ""accidentally"" didn't read her name. Final voting was at lunch, and not many knew she was nominated. So most of her acquaintances didn't vote at all and never saw her name on the ballot.

Shit hit the fan. She was beyond furious, and I had numerous people throughout the day asking me about it. I played dumb, saying that her name was on the next line and I somehow missed it. I told everyone that I was ""so sorry"" and ""felt horrible"". C knew I was full of shit, but everyone else bought it so I got away unscathed.

She lost miserably. If I had read her name and people knew she was nominated, she probably would have won. Our school tended to vote for the ""underdog"" or most tolerable of the nominees, and the others nominated were the stereotypical popular girls but only really liked inside their own circle. I saw C during the Homecoming game and in my most insincerely sweet voice, I told her ""hey, too bad you didn't win. I totally voted for you!"" She looked like she wanted to puke.

I wasn't messed with after that.

**TL;DR** Stupid girl made high school shitty for me, so I dashed her stupid dream of being Homecoming Queen.

**Edit:** You all are delightful. This happened 5-6ish years ago and only a handful of people have known the truth behind the story.

That being said, a lot of the problem students end up attending this particular school, because they get expelled from public high school for whatever reason.

 Anyway, on this particular day I was working in the testing room. The students bring a pass from their teacher, I hand them their test, then I grade the test. Pretty standard. Working in a school full of ""bad"" kids can be challenging especially when you're a 20 year old male. (A lot of kids don't take you very seriously when you're practically the same age) That day, this muslim student had just handed her test into me, and I should point out that this is one of the best, nicest well behaved students in the entire school, and I always try to be nice to her because some of the kids give her a hard time, due to her hijab. 


In walks in this complete shit of a kid. Rude, loud and obnoxious, you know the type.

When he's finally done, I watch him stroll up to my desk, kind of just toss the test at me and request that I tell him what he scored. I proceed to put on the nicest warmest smile I can muster, and just rip that test in half right in front of his face. He just stands there with this shocked expression, and starts yelling and asking me why I did that. I calmly tell him, that I will not tolerate such hateful and disrespectful behavior in my testing room, and ask him to leave the room, and try again another day. Success.

catsouptime,22,,64,1dsxqq,,395,"During the summertime in Seattle, it's often fun to go across Puget Sound and visit Vashon Island (actually, there are lots of great islands!). Because of this, sunny Saturday mornings cause a gigantic line for the ferry to Vashon.

My brother, my two best friends, and my dog were all packed in our car, expecting to wait for roughly 2-3 ferries worth of time before we could catch a ferry ourselves. The line intersects driveways and park openings, so there are a lot of gaps in the line made from places where you aren't supposed to park.

We'd been sitting in line for about 20 mins and were thinking, ""Hey, maybe there's a chance we'll get on the next ferry!"" when a car pulled up into the gap in front of us. We weren't sure if they realized they'd skipped in line, but we made a lot of ruckus so they stuck their head out their window and asked what was up.

My brother yelled, ""You cut in line!"". The chick rolled her eyes, pulled her head back in the car, rolled up the window, and blasted music for the rest of the wait.

Meanwhile, we threw up our hands and mimed yelling (we were ready for vacation, so it was moreso just acting and making big gestures than actually getting heated) whenever we saw her eyes in their rearview mirror.

Another half hour of following this girl in line and both our cars had finally made it to the ferry dock. There was a police officer directing traffic and, since he was right next to our car and the windows were open, we said, ""Is there anything we can do about people who cut in line?""

He asked who cut, so we pointed out the car (as she was just pulling up to the ticketing counter to buy her ferry pass). He walked over, chatted very briefly with our nemesis, and we got to watch her car pull out from the normal queue and go all the way back to the end of the line. She avoided eye contact as she passed by going the other direction.

In addition, it was nice knowing that we'd headed out early on this day. I bet by the time she finally got to the end of the line she'd have had to do another hour (at least!) of late-to-the-ferry traffic on top of the 30 mins she wasted from cutting.

They were great.  As they were getting toward the end of their meal, I got sat with a party of 6. Unfortunately, these 3 men and 3 women were the biggest jerks I've ever seen.

They insisted it was fine, and I went on caring for my tables as usual. However, every time I'd walk away, they'd complain (loudly) about having to sit across from ""the niggers"" (Honestly, I hated even typing that.) Luckily, my couple cashed out and left before that word was used. Even though the couple was gone, they still complained to each other. Again, I asked if everything was okay and they started including me in their little bitch-fest. Saying things like, ""Can you believe they honestly thought it was okay to make us sit across from those porch monkeys?"" and ""This is ridiculous. I come out to enjoy good food, not to see an ape sitting near me. I thought I came to a restaurant, not the zoo.""  When I didn't join in on their racist slurs, but asked them if there was anything else I could do, they turned on me. They started complaining hard core. I told them that there was nothing I could do, and left to find a manager. Two different times, a manager checked on them and both times they told her they were fine.  This table then worked me like a dog.  They would run me as much as they could, wait until I got half way away from the table before throwing out a ""Hey, one more thing."" Whistling to call me to them like a dog. Laughing at what a ""pathetic"" job I had (while I was at the table) and just generally being dicks. 
Now these guys, as I said, were typical rednecks. They all had Tbone steaks all well done.  Of course they demanded A1. Well, because we were busy, there was no A1 in the back. I would have to get a bottle from a table who wasn't using theirs and pass it over.     
As luck would have it, the now clean table across the aisle had an A1 bottle on it.    I, very conspicuously,  picked that bottle up and sat it on their table saying, ""Enjoy your meal!!"" with the best Barbie smile and tone I could muster.  
They ate (didn't touch the A1) and then demanded a manager comp their entire meal because of the inconvenience.  
I told the manager this, and she laughed and said ""Hell no!"" within earshot of the table. I dropped off their bill and told them she just wasn't able to do it. She could only comp a meal for food related issues, and since they ate their entire meal without complaint (she checked twice!) they would have to pay.  
  
Their bill was 97.70, they left me 98.00. (So with tipshare they actually COST me money by eating.  Don't care.)

 I lost money but didn't care knowing they either had to use the A1 from that couple's table.. or eat super well done steaks that would taste terrible (not my fault they ordered extra well done intending to drown it in sauce.)

Cormorant11,49,,61,1fo2ab,,394,"I posted this once before in an AskReddit thread about standing up to bullies, but I just discovered this subreddit and thought it would fit in here nicely.

I was a shy kid. I usually sat with my older brother on the bus, and I tended to mostly have friends who were older than me because they were actually my brother's friends. Well when I entered fifth grade and moved up to the middle school I got a new bus driver who was mean, incredibly obese, and absolutely set on segregating the bus by age. He yelled at me a few times for sitting with my brother. At some point I just gave up and sat in the front, sitting alone and reading books. I was pretty introverted (still am) so I didn't like talking to kids my own age. 

At some point during the year, I guess my bus driver noticed that I was reading books pretty often. He started to make sarcastic remarks about how I must be really intelligent to be reading all the time. He even came up with a super creative nickname for me: book boy. Every time I would get on the bus he'd say ""Heya book boy, whatcha reading today?"" or ""Why don't you have any friends? You need to put down Harry Potter."" Hah, not a chance. The final straw came on the bus ride home one day when he actually said over the intercom ""Will someone come sit with book boy? He needs to make some friends."" I was 10 years old.

I went home in tears that day and told my mom about how awful my bus driver was. She told me not to feel bad, that I'm a smart kid and he's just a dumb bus driver. She said that when I grow up I'll surely be more successful than him, and don't take anything he says to heart because he's just unhappy with how his own life turned out. Maybe he wishes he read books when he was my age.

I was feeling pretty good about myself after that, and I read books with continued vigor. A few days later when he was dropping me off, my bus driver finally asked me, ""So book boy, why are you always reading so much?"" And without missing a beat, I replied, ""So I don't grow up to be a bus driver."" I hopped off the bus without even turning to see the wreckage.

On top of that, a kid who lived down the street from me getting off at the same stop heard what I said and thought it was absolutely hilarious. We've been friends ever since. My bus driver never bothered me again.",How to sass out your bullying bus driver.,455,pettyrevenge
[deleted],75,,104,15oymx,,394,"When I was 9 or 10 my mother married a guy she had been dating for about two months. During this time she changed completely and was a complete bitch to me. The first year the marriage was ok and she was smitten. I had to hear lots of loud copulation which frequently made me want to barf, but whatever. The last two years of their relationship turned to not so good. Most of the time I spent in my room and away from both of them. My stepfather enjoyed making snarky comments about me when I would walk through the living room. He started blaming me when things of his went missing. I was scared of him and so I never had done anything to his stuff.

Some of the highlights of his behavior:
Couldn't find his shoes and told my mother I probably stole them and proceeded to call me all kinds of vulgar names, completely unprovoked.

Tried convincing my mother to send me away to a boarding school in England (he was British) so he wouldn't have to deal with me.

One time I was in the shower and he came home from work and started banging on the door and screaming vulgar insults at me. For what I am not sure. WHen I came out he was sitting at the dining room table not moving, not doing anything. He just stared at me with this bizarre look on his face.

He started getting into guns a lot and would spend his time in the basement messing with them. On his way up the stairs from the basement he would pound his fist on the wall and make my pictures fall in my bedroom. I slept with a door up against my door handle so no one could get in because I was terrified he'd kill me in my sleep.

He threatened to beat my mother. In his defense, I can understand this. This woman is trying in the best of times.

His 20 something son stole from my room. (I was 11-12 at the time).

So now for the revenge.
This man had barely any hair but he was very vain and would spend HOURS primping in the bathroom. In the morning before work and in the evening also. We had one bathroom and so for years I was forced to wash my hair, brush my teeth and do any ""washing"" in the kitchen sink because he would hog the fucking loo. Finally my mother came to her senses and we were to move out. The day before we did I filled his shampoo and conditioner bottles halfway with Nair hair remover. Even if it didn't make his remaining locks fall out he had super sensitive skin and it was extra strength so I knew it would irritate the fuck out of him.

Next I collected all the dead bug corpses in the basement and garage I could find. We lived in the woods so I got quite the nasty collection. I dumped this under and in his pillow case.

He was a ski instructor and skied all the time. Anyone who skis knows that you have to push your foot hard to get it into a boot. I placed tiny light bulbs in each pair of his ski boots. Don't know if it worked but whatever.
I probably should have taped tacks inside his shoes too.

**Edit I slept with a chair up against my door...lol

***Edit: he also threatened to kill my pet bird (cockatiel) once in a fit of rage and so that day forward I dragged my bird's cage into my bedroom and that is when I started putting the chair up against the door since it didn't have a lock.

Fierce_Fox,68,,84,1npqx0,,394,"The other week I got some new neighbors in my apartment complex. A nice elderly couple and their douchey man-child son. I like the parents, they're the sweetest folks I've met in KC yet but their son... their terminally unemployed douchebag son is a different story. This guy loves his Edd Hardy bullshit shirts, cologne,  and spiked hair like its cheap liquor which he also loves judging by the bottles left on the porch. He also has a penchant for playing shitty rap as loud as possible once everyone else goes to work for the day. This isn't a problem for the other two units because they're at work but I'm home during the day and usually asleep since I work nights. 

The first day I ignored the loud music because I was tired from a crappy night at work and not in the mood to deal with his shit. I turned on my own ambiance /white noise stuff and tried to get some sleep. His music kept going until about 3pm when folks start coming home after which he turned it off. I got some real sleep after that which was nice. When I woke up that evening and went outside to have a smoke and let my dog run around and potty I caught the douchey son having a smoke too. We made a bit of chitchat and learned this guy's parents paid for all his shit so he didn't have to. He was recently divourced so his parents had taken pitty on him and taken him in. He bragged about the shiny blue hatchback with the bitchin rims that belonged to him which was double parked at the bottom of the lot and shity stereo system he liked to bump in the day. This was great, a perfect segway into what we needed to talk about so I asked him to maybe turn it down during the day sighting the fact that he's not the only one here during the day, that I live next door and sleep in the day, and common fucking decency. His response was for me to go fuck myself and my shitty rat dog (she's a Belgian Shepherd/Grey Hound mix so she isn't rat sized, but she is shit colored). He said he had a right to play his music as loud as he wanted to during the day and to mind my own business.

Installing youdunfuckedupasshole.exe

Installation complete.

Okay chief, I'll play your game. I then spent my night at work trying to figure out how to get back at him. My first idea was to burn the building down whith him in it because I hadn't leveled a building in a while but I like my place so that was out the window. His car was next on the list and I thought about torching that too which would have been fun just too over the top. With fire still on my mind I decided to fight fire with fire and shitty music with one the greatest pieces of music ever written, Beethoven's 9th Symphony. on repeat.

When I got home that morning I unpacked my surround sound system and placed all my speakers right up against the wall. These aren't tiny little things either. These are four foot tall speakers and I have six of them. When their volumes are maxed out these things will leave your ears ringing for day and a half. For whatever reason Douchey McGee didnt bump his beats for a few days and I started to think that maybe he had just had a bad day when I first talked to him. When I'm in a bad mood I can be a pretty gaping asshole so it wasn't too far fetched to me. And then Friday rolled around and at about noon he started his shit again.

I roll out of bed, put my robe and moccasins on, and went next door to try and resolve this shit. I knocked on the door a few times and then pounded on it before he answered smelling of liquor and bullshit. I asked him to turn the music down once and was called a faggot for the pink robe I was wearing. I then demanded he turn the music down before this gets serious. He took that as the threat it was and got all up in my face like we where back on the block and chest bumpedme in an attempt to intimidate me.

Lolgoodluck.gif

Six years in the Army and Afghanistan have made me immune to this kind of shit so I just shrugged it off and put my plan onto motion. I put my CD in the player, cranked the volume and brewed some coffee. I listend to my music for a couple of repetitons before grabbing my ear muffs out of a tough box. Now these things are awesome, they're basically military grade noise cancelers so once they go on I can't hear anything. After about an hour of the Beethoven barage the Douchemaster came and pounded on my sliding glass door with the most pissed off expression he could he could muster. 

Expecting a surrender I turned the music off and opened the door. I was immediately assaulted with a torrent of profanity and threats because he couldn't hear his shit music. He went on for a few minutes before losing steam once he realized I was more interested in my coffee than his tyrade. Once he stopped I let him know in no uncertain terms that I can do this longer than him and that it will continue until he starts acting like a reasonable neighbor. He swore at me a bit longer before storming away. He turned his crap down so I turned mine off and minus two other times his music got too loud in the day things have gone swimingly.

dwaynebank,52,,84,1lnyw5,,391,"During my sophomore year I dated this girl. The relationship wasn't anything spectacular. We only dated for a couple months and she ended up spending more time with other guys than me towards the end. When I told her I didn't like that she broke up with me. I was upset about it for maybe a day, but I wasn't really attached to her. I quickly moved on and assumed we could be friends. A few weeks later a mutual friend tells me she's been spreading rumors about me. Apparently my ex has been telling people how horrible I treated her and she was actually asking people to stop talking to me. I didn't take her too seriously, but people started talking to me less and less and suddenly I only had a few close friends that would talk to me. When I confronted my ex and asked her to stop she said she was emotionally upset, was sorry and it would stop. A few minutes later I noticed a new post on her tumblr where she talks about how her exboyfriend ""begged for her to come back"" and how ""She wasn't going to listen to him and do what she wants."" I took that as a big ""fuck you.""








Here's where the revenge comes in: She was a photographer for our school newspaper and was also an ""aspiring artist."" She would often have her artwork featured around the school and in the newspaper. Although she created the art, it was still owned by the school and they had a strict ""No posting our artwork on your own website policy."" Apparently she didn't like this so she posted a ton of her work on tumblr with these words: ""Fuck [school name here], Fuck [Newspaper teacher name here], and Fuck Copyright laws.""
I took a screenshot of the post and forwarded it with the URL to our principal and the newspaper teacher. I guess they didn't like what she had to say because they suspended her for a few days and she was removed from the class. She called me crying the next day saying how she'll never be able to get into an art school now with copyright infringement on her record and how I was an asshole. I told her I didn't know what she was talking about and hung up.

ShaneL79,28,,89,1agit9,,396,"One of my first serving jobs was at a large 200 seat restaurant. This place was horribly managed and because of that it was empty most of the time, especially weekend afternoons.

We had a manager who was a server for only a couple of months before that and didn't know shit about the business. When I say manager, I am referring to the no power type of manager that can't hire or fire anyone. He was basically there to correct problems and help out wherever he was needed. 

For a couple of weeks prior to this incident this manager was being verbally abusive to staff. Whenever he got stressed out it was like he would explode and say the worst possible thing imaginable. Finally he did this to one of our well liked and pregnant waitresses calling her a whore and her husband a piece of shit. Being highly emotional she cried and everyone was pissed.

A couple of days after he insulted the pregnant waitress just so happened to be April Fools Day. There were three of us scheduled to work that afternoon. He just so happened to be kind of rude to us while we did the typical restaurant setup. 

I convinced the other two servers to play along. I called my girlfriend at the time and had her call in a reservation for 30 people. I then had the hostess do the same. I had a couple more people do the same. The kitchen staff were in on it (we didn't want them prepping for massive amounts of people and wasting good food). 

So we have multiple large party reservations all scheduled for the same time which was right away. He comes running over to us and told us to setup the tables for these large parties. We told him it was too many for just us and that he would have to help out (which was his job). He refused and went and sat at the bar and watched TV while we were supposed to be setting up.

We went to him and said ""fuck this, we quit."". We walked outside and into a little storage area we had out back. The other server had a smoke while we let the manager stew in this dilemma. We were outside for about 15 minutes and had the kitchen staff watching in case a real customer arrived.

Finally the kitchen manager came out and said the owners were there. I knew the owners pretty well so they came directly to me and asked what happened. I told them about the fake reservations, but not the fake quitting. They didn't seem upset or bothered by our prank, which was a relief. 

At that moment I looked at the manager and his face was red and he was sweating badly. He did not look well. Then it happened, a full blown breakdown. He began screaming at us, the owners, the chairs, everything his eyes could focus on long enough to yell at. His yelling wasn't making sense. He began knocking over chairs and tables. Then just like it began, it ended. He walked out. 

I was promoted to this manager position. He was not allowed back in the building. 

I later found out that when he left the restaurant he checked himself into a hospital. Apparently he had serious mental issues and our little prank triggered them worse than he had seen before. I really did feel horrible about that, but it was never our intention to break his brain. Piss him off a little? Sure. But nothing more.

PhishnChips,66,,112,1l7im6,,391,"My neighbors are really nice people for the most part. We get along pretty well, share neighborhood gossip, lend each other garden tools, and generally help each other out when needed.  

The problem is, our neighbors are older than us and have grown children our age. Well, let me re-state that, THAT isn't the problem, the problem is how well they take care of their property. It's beautiful. You have that kind of time when you're retired grandparents I suppose. My wife and I always feel that we're trying to ""keep up"" with their yard. Being that we both work full time and have a 1 year old child in the house it can be difficult. We take care of our yard pretty well, but not nearly as meticulously as these people. 

I actually enjoy mowing my yard, throw on the tunes, light up a smoke and just zone out. It's relaxing.  I know they're well meaning, I don't think they do it out of spite, but sometimes I'll come home from work and my yard will already be mowed. They're just helping us out, but it's embarrassing having another grown man mow your yard. And just so you, my dear reader knows, it's not like it's ever over-grown. You see, this guy mows his yard almost twice a week. His yard is pristine, always watered and well manicured. It looks like a freak'n putting green compared to ours. We've thanked them each time they've done it and politely asked them not to do it again. We are actually quite thankful, but more embarrassed that somebody else thought they needed to do that for us. 

So my deliciously petty revenge has been: On the east side of our lot the property lines meet up in the grass. You can tell when one neighbor has just recently mowed because you can see the line. For the last month I've been paying attention to when he goes out to mow his yard then later that day or early the next morning I get up and mow my side but set at a lower setting so his yard looks like it's grown or to the casual observer, that his side needs to be mowed. 

Without fail he's back out the next day re-mowing his yard. I got him to do it 4 times in a single week once. 

Now he has resorted to telling us that we mow our lawn too short and need to move the wheels up. He's probably correct. But it's fun watching him get annoyed each time the ""mowing line"" reappears. 

**Edit**: *Some people have commented that they felt this was ""mean"" Here is my response in the comments below*: 

&gt;I usually drop off a 6 pack of my home brew. Like I said in the original post, we get along, and we don't feel that they are doing it out of spite. But it still bugs us (not in a way that makes us upset, hopefully I've made that clear, but bugs us in a way that we should be taking care of our own property), we are a prideful people. Besides, it's just a little fun I'm having fucking with him. Completely petty and not ill spirited.

**Edit 2** *Another response to comments below about how people hate mowing their grass*: 

&gt;Mowing the lawn for me is a time where I get to be alone with my thoughts, kinda like taking a poop. It's just me, no child to watch, no boss to make happy, and no wife talking about whatever drama is going on at her job. Just me and the grass. It's zen.
Start mowing your own lawn, find your inner peace.

&gt;After the 3rd or 4th time of asking them nicely not to do it anymore because we're uncomfortable with it and them continuing, is it still considered a favor?

fostok,32,,77,1jkac1,,388,"**BG:** This past week I've had tonsillitis. It wasn't severe enough that I needed my tonsils removed but I was told by the doc that had I waited any longer to see him then I'd have likely had to go to the hospital - so it was pretty bad. 

**Scenario:** My friend's birthday was this past Tuesday and he was having a small little get together at his place before we went to the clubs later. Everything was going well and we eventually got to a club that night.

I ordered myself a drink at the venue and was enjoying it when our group decided to go for a small bit of dancing. Being the naive person I am I put my drink down on a railing right next to where I'd be dancing and hoped it would be safe. I was wrong. As soon as I stepped away from the drink I saw out of the corner of my eye a girl scurry by and pick up my drink on her way. Naturally I wasn't going to let her get away with it so easily so I caught up to her and explained that she had my drink but she was having none of it. I placed my hand on the drink and tried to explain some more that she may have taken mine by accident because it was definitely my drink. She then jerked the drink away from me and spilled half of it on the floor and over me. At this point I didn't care for the drink any more and just said ""Fuck it, take my drink"" and walked away. 

**Revenge:** Remember that tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is rather contagious, or at least the case I had of it was according to the doc. It could get passed onto somebody else by kissing them, coughing on them, or quite delightfully drinking from the same container as an infected person. Yes, I had warned my friends of this earlier as a just in case measure, but I didn't warn this girl who stole my drink. I did think of it but by this point most of the drink was either on the floor or on me so I simply didn't feel like it. I had slobbered all over my glass before she stole it and now she was slobbering all over it too. Enjoy your tonsillitis girl, maybe next time you'll think twice before stealing somebody's drink because you've no idea what they may be infected with. It should also be noted that visits to a doctor here normally go for about €50 and the anitibiotics for tonsillitis I got were about another €20. How's that for an expensive drink?

When I was 20 I got out of a bad relationship where I had lived with my ex. Shortly after, my ex started stalking me at work and harassing me through email, IM, text, leaving notes on my car, following me to and from my home, and it even escalated to him calling the police on me a few times. Fed up, I got the police involved myself and charged him with harassment. We had a court date and I showed up completely unprepared as I was alone and he had an attorney who grilled me until I was in tears. The judge ordered 120 days no contact.

In retaliation he then charged me with withholding the security deposit, my engagement ring, and damages (holes in walls and doors from him punching them) to the apartment that his father had fixed. I went prepared this time. I ~~hacked~~ gained access into his bank account that we had once shared and printed out records from the whole time we had been together to show that I was the main source of income and payments for the ring came out of that account. I had a copy of the receipt from the jeweler. I went to my bank and got a copy of the canceled check proving that I had paid for the security deposit alone. I had a certified letter from our landlord stating that he had given the security deposit in full to my ex. And I also had an attorney. I'm assuming he thought that I would show up as unprepared as last time because he did not have an attorney. With my evidence I was able to disprove EVERY statement that he made leaving him speechless for the first time since I had known him. At the end I sat there and watched the judge berate him and his father calling their behavior disgusting and pathetic. He told my ex that based on his behavior he doubted it would be the last time he saw him in court and told hid dad that that he was the lowest scum for ganging up on a poor innocent girl and not acting as a father figure.

daviannamorgan,35,,42,1esepl,,391,"My husband and I went out with a friend last weekend to see Star Trek Into Darkness. I'm a huge fan of the new franchise, and was super excited. We got there early (half an hour, but that's because the restaurant we go to before the movies was less busy than normal,) got decent seats, and just waited for the previews.

This woman comes into the row in front of us, and is reading on her tablet, at full brightness, before the movie. No big deal, I was facebooking on my phone during the AMC ""First Look"" things. The lights weren't even down, so I couldn't complain.

She keeps reading through the previews... slightly annoying, but I can deal. When it gets to be 20 minutes into the movie, however, she hasn't made a move to put it away. It's also on full brightness, and it's BRIGHT.

I politely lean forward and ask her if she would at least turn the brightness down (I didn't even ask her to put it away) only to be met with a ""Fuck off.""

I'm in the middle of a row of a FULL theater. I refused to get up and inconvenience a ton of people just to get a manager (I also have issues walking due to injury from a car accident. I would probably have landed in someone's lap due to balance issues.)

So, what do I do? I start hitting her chair. First, ""accidentally"" then full on ""I don't give a fuck if I'm annoying you."" After 10 minutes of me tapping on her chair like I was tap dancing, she has the nerve to turn around and say, ""Do you mind?"" Only to be met with a ""You first. Fuck off."" I then start hitting it harder (The theater is relatively comfortable, and I know that I wasn't distracting my two companions, and the people next to her were her companions, so I didn't really care if I was distracting them because they didn't care enough to tell her she was being rude.) She has apparently made up her mind to ignore me, and decides to take a drink out of her soda. That's when I gave the seat a good, **hard** kick (I was just tapping it before.) It jolts her and makes her spill her soda on her chest, dripping some of it onto her tablet.

Even better? The people around her were so annoyed that one of them DID go get the manager and they asked her to either turn off her tablet or leave the theater as she was bothering other patrons. She opted not to leave, turned off her tablet, and proceeded to huff, puff, and sigh.

plonce,39,,80,1jdzzq,,391,"This is a bit long, but I am confident it will be one of the most satisfying petard-hoistings you will read this week.  But only you can be the judge of that...

---------------

Norman was my locker partner in grade 7.  I guess our school was too old/poor for each kid to have their own.

Norman was in grade 8 and was much, much bigger than me.  Norman always wore a jean jacket and smelled like cigarettes.  Norman had a very bad attitude and he was also known for beating the holy hell out of anybody at any time for any reason.  I, like everyone else, was extremely afraid of him.

Now then...

Every day I would bring my lunch in a brown bag.  And Norman would steal them at least once a week.  He wouldn't rip it out of my hand or anything, no, I would just go to my locker at 12:00 and it would be missing.  Guess who?

I let it go once, twice, ten times until I just could not take it any more.  But I had a problem.

I could not simply ask Norman to stop taking my lunches, because that would be me *accusing him*.  I could not go to the teachers or my parents, because that would be me *accusing him*.  In the ~~logic~~ thought process of a couple of 12 and 13 year old kids, you could never tell somebody to stop stealing your lunch without hard evidence that they were actually the one stealing them!  Why that would be the most outrageous accusation anybody could make and would most certainly be deserving of several thrashings and a lifetime of being on the bully's shit-list!

Does this make sense to an adult?  No.  But when you're 12 years old the rule is this: the school menace does what he wants when he wants and your job is to take it and like it.

Anyways...

I knew I had to do something to stop this.  I also knew that I had to do it in such a way that if he ever confronted me about ""getting him back"", that it would mean he'd have to basically admit that he was stealing the lunches.

I hatched the perfect plan.  I make the most sumptuous lunch any kid could want.  Two luscious PB &amp; J sandwiches with the jelly bursting at the seams and not one, but **two cans of Pepsi**.  The stack of Oreo cookies would surely make this a lunch no hungry child could resist stealing. But of course, I put my special twist on the lunch.

At lunch time I walked as casually as possible to my locker, but my mind was racing and I wanted to sprint.  But no, I had to play it cool.  I unhitched the lock and opened the locker door.  Would the lunch be there?  Would it be gone?  Please please please let it be missing....

The lunch was gone.

I won.

Flawless victory.

What Norman didn't know, but discovered upon first bite, was that I had taken the peanut butter and mixed it with fine sifted sand from the playground.  What looked like a perfectly delectable sandwich was actually 6 hours of sand in his mouth with sticky, oily peanut butter keeping it in place.

Not a word was ever spoken and he always treated me with a lot more respect after that day.

There was a certain twinkle in his eye the next morning when he said ""Hi Plorf"".  The look was undeniably there.  It said ""You got me dude.  Checkmate.  Check Fucking Mate.""

kthxbai,50,,70,1fhivd,,386,"This goes down as the single meanest thing I have ever done. Told in 2 parts:

Part 1:  The Backstory: I grew up in a religiously divided environment (Utah).  Being a non-mormon kid generally meant you always had to be ready for rejection when you made new mormon friends.  It wasn't uncommon for the mormon kid's parents not to let them hang out with you or being shunned by your new friend's pals.  In the third grade, I made a new friend the same age on my street and we hit it off like gangbusters right away.  One day I went to pick her up from her house to go and play.  As I walked up to the back door,  an heard her step-mom chastising her saying ""I thought we already talked about this.  You are not to play with her anymore, do you understand me?""  My friend sheepishly came out and told me she couldn't play and we were both just super bummed out.  I would see her at school and we would say hi to each other, but she pretty much went back to hanging out with this boring churchy girl in our grade, lets call her 'Robin'.

Part 2:  The Act:  Robin was horribly rude to me and made a habit of rubbing it in my face that she was in good with the mutually coveted friend.  You know, typical third grade girl bullshit.  She always had this smirk on her face when passed me at recess when she and awesome friend were playing hopscotch or jacks or whatever, and of course I wasn't allowed to join.  One day, we were all playing out on the grass doing our version of gymnastics which amounted to cartwheels and round-offs.  Robin was wearing these white pants that had rainbow stitching up one leg and then went around her waist and down the back of the other leg.  Quite cool for the mid-70s, the bitch had some style, I'll give her that.  Ever the show off, Robin did a cartwheel and I noticed a crimson spot on her pants right between her legs.  Doing some quick memory work, I recalled our Life Science Library book and knew that Robin was having her monthly visit from Aunt Flow.  I knew then what I had to do.  I said ""Hey Robin!  That was the best cartwheel I've seen!  How many do you think you could do in a row though?  I bet a lot!""  Robin proudly wound up and completed 12 cartwheels right in front a watching crowd of kids.  She was really excited that her activity had drawn such a group of spectators and was gleaming when she completed her amazing acrobatic show.  Awesome friend was looking on in horror as well, and whispered something in Robin's ear.  Robins gleaming smile slowly turned to an anguished grimace, and she ran off the playground crying.  And it was fucking awesome. ",Mean Girl Grade School Classmate Revenge - Mormon Edition,456,pettyrevenge
vibroguy,25,,68,1kq4ui,,391,"I used to serve in the Royal Air Force and as a junior non-com was expected to do a stint of guard duty. It usually came round once a year and due to the Gods being cruel and unkind, my turn was at the tail end of the calendar when the weather in Blighty is slightly shitty. 

Part of our duties was manning the gate to check IDs and car documents. Most folk coming through knew the score, roll down your window, show the ID to the guy with the rifle, get waved through. 99% of the guys had done guard duty and knew what a ballache it was.

So one wet and windy winter morning, when I have been stood there for well over two hours and was piss wet through (the waterproofs, they do nothing) a car approaches at a fair rate of knots. Slams the brakes on right next to me and my oppo and pushes his ID card against the window. I had had enough, decided the disrespect I had received for the past two weeks would be meted out on this buffoon that didn't have the decency to roll down his window. So I stare at him with a curious look on my face. Our eyes meet and he taps his ID on the window. Clearly not getting through to the neanderthal I make the internationally recognised sign for roll down your window. After much huffing and puffing he opens his window a crack and jams his ID through it. I thought our fun was over at that point until he uttered these fateful words, ""get on with it, I'm late as it is.""

Rank is a curious thing in the military. It should always be respected and obeyed. However there are certain circumstances where a junior rank can order a senior rank around, this was one of those circumstances.

I ask him to roll his window down further, adding that I need to properly identify him. Reluctantly, and with much huffing and puffing, he complied, taking a face-full of North Yorkshire rain in the process. I take his ID card and saw that he outranked me by 2 tiers, so being the good little Airman, immediately start calling him by his rank. I returned his ID after confirming it was him and he rolled up his window without even thanking me. Unfortunately for him, my job was incomplete. I tapped on the window and gestured for him to roll it down once more. He did, getting wet again, and I asked him for his car pass. 

And here is where my petty revenge for his blatant disrespect comes in; it was out of date. Not by a long time, in fact as I recall it had only expired the day before, but it was out of date! Now I'm a fairly casual guy, relaxed to the point of lying on the ground. Generally in situations like this I point out that its expired and advise them to get a new one before returning it, but not with this plonker. Looking up at my wet faced sergeant, I told him with nary a smile on my face that I had to confiscate it. 

And he exploded, started screaming obscenities at me, threatening to have me charged (military punishment) for insubordination etc etc etc.None of this was washing with me though as I placed his car pass into the lockbox, for which I didn't have the key. There was no way he could get his car pass back now even if I wanted to give it to him. 

So he had to join the queue in the guardroom with the visitors and contractors to get his temporary pass, adding to his lateness. And he would have to come back during the working day to get a new permanent one, wasting his precious time. 

Not being vindictive, after he got his temporary pass, I did wave him through. Well the first edict of identification is recognition

ffstriker,107,,96,1icjs3,,390,"So here is the story.

I was with, lets call them The Red Bank. I have savings accounts, credit cards, chequing accounts. The works. Well, turns out that the bank was suppose to be charging me ""service fees"" on the Savings account I have.  I was not aware of this nor did I get told this when I made the account 2 years ago.

So, when I saw them deduct 200$ from my savings I got a little upset. This was for service fees for the past 2 years. (in their words) I went to the branch and they said they cannot put the fees back in as it was ""something I had to pay, but wasn't"" I agreed to start paying their fee for the account if they would credit the money back in stating a banking error. They said they can't.

So I said, give me all my money out and cancel all my accounts. I'm going to another bank. The teller said ""I need to get my supervisor."" Ok, No Problem. 20 min later the ""Branch Manager"" comes up and asks me if I can get my issue resolved. I explained to him what I wanted and he said. ""No, I cant authorize that"" So I then reiterated, Give me all my money and I'm going to another bank. His response was ""HA, that will take hours even weeks to switch everything over and its not worth it""

So I left the bank. Went to the other bank I wanted to sign up with. Lets call them ""The Blue Bank"" turns out they were closed for lunch. So, I went and had lunch myself, Chicken Soup actually, and came back when they were back open. Spend 15 min, opened all my accounts and applied for my VISA card. DONE.

It took actually 30 min once all the money was deposited and I talked to the manager there for a bit. Hours eh? Nice customer retention.

TtotheA,48,,199,1hpat6,,386,"Possibly important context info: I'm a single female and the ""culprit"" seems to be pretty insecure (and female... if demons have a sex)

Went out last night for a friend of a friend's birthday. The birthday boy's girlfriend seemed to be singling me out for the most condescending treatment ever. Every comment I made within earshot of her would be responded to with a snide remark. 

I wish I could give the best examples, but lots of the people that were there are redditors, and I could be found out. So I'll give the more generic (less awful) one: we're stopped at a red light behind a vehicle. The biatch is telling the driver, ""Just go around!"". I'm not really understanding why we would do that, since the light is clearly red, so I say, ""They don't even have their signal light on."", because I assume what the asshole chick's point is that she doesn't want to have to wait for them to go because we are turning right, and could do so when the light is red. She looks at me with disgust and says, with all sorts of rude tone-age, ""You can't go straight here."" WELL SOOOOORRRY! I don't know every street in this city as well as you. How embarrassing for me! 

Anyway, I know that doesn't seem too, too bad but, take my word for it, tone is important here and hers was evil. Not to mention it wasn't the first unnecessarily harsh ""point"" she had made that night.

Fast forward to bar time. A mutual friend of ours is talking to jerk-face about dancing, and she's like, ""Blah blah blah, I can dance because I took xyz class."" She wants to show him her stellar moves, so she looks down her nose at me and says, ""Hold this,"" handing me her beer. 

I do, because I am a pussy. But then I see my opportunity: my instinct is to hold it by the neck, as I would hope a considerate person would do for me. But FUCK THAT. I move my hand down so that it's sending sweet, sweet body heat all up into her brew. That shit was probably at least three degrees warmer when she got it back.

So I went to our dad, and he also thought I was lying to get her in trouble. After getting a lecture, I decided to finally stand up to her.

By this time in my sister's life, she had discovered makeup. My sister had bought herself really expensive makeup brushes and other beauty products a few months ago. I took the extra strong hairspray and sprayed it all over the brushes, and then left them exactly where I found them.

A day later, my sister came in and asked me if I knew why her brushes were stiff. I said no, and she left. I later found out that the brushes were still somewhat stiff after washing them, and if she ever used them, they would make her break out really badly.

she-hulk,25,,50,1bmx06,,382,"Back when I was in my first semester of college, I had my very first ever group project. It was a fairly large presentation that would take up the last 3 weeks of class for presenters. It was an Aboriginal History class and we were assigned a subject to do a multi-media presentation on. 

I had partnered with a friend, and 2 girls, lets call them Blonde Barbie and Brunette Barbie (or B1 and B2 for short) asked to join our group. I knew why they wanted to join our group, we both did really well in this class but we accepted anyway. 

We had a month to complete the project, but we also had final projects in every other class and final exams due the week after we were scheduled to present so we agreed that we should focus on this project first and get it out of the way. 

These girls clearly were not as concerned with their marks as my friend and I were, so we took on the bulk of the project, leaving them only 1 section each to complete. The subject was Aboriginal People in the Media and their sections consisted of 4 questions each. It should have only taken them about an hour to complete. 


My friend and I worked hard, putting lots of images of examples of media campaigns, cartoons, mascots etc and glued them to a big poster board to hang on the wall behind us while we gave our presentation. We found videos (the ""why is the red man red"" song from Peter Pan, news reports etc), we even prepared a reading where we changed some of the language in a news report and talked about how a simple change in language painted a totally different picture of the story.

About a week before it was all due I emailed the girls about sending me their part so I could add it into the cards. Of course they hadn't completed it yet. BB1 promised to have it to me by the next morning. 

I emailed again the next afternoon, this time the response I got from BB1 was ""if you stop nagging me I'll be able to get it done"". Naturally I was pissed. I told them to get off their ass and get it done or they were out of the group. BB2 called me a bitch and a tight ass. 

Naturally I went to my prof and explained the situation to her, complete with emails and they were removed from my group and given big fat zeros. 

Apparently they decided to go to the program coordinator and claim that they sent me their work and I claimed it as my own. The decision was made, without hearing from me, my friend or the teacher, that BB1 and BB2 would present in another seminar the next week and I would hand over a copy of the project. 

I handed it over, but I changed the language in the presentation so that it had a very different point. But BB1 and BB2 didn't know the material and were fairly stupid so they had no idea that when they got up to give the presentation that they would say things like ""and here is a great example of how there was an Aboriginal Presence in children's movies even back in 1953"" and their whole presentation was about  the positive depiction of Aboriginal People in the media using obviously racist examples. They received the material with more than enough time to review it and notice the changes I made if they had been involved in the creation of the presentation and if they understood the material. 

Apparently, their presentation was cut short because it was so offensive to the teacher and the class that he wouldn't allow them to continue with it. My seminar professor thought my changes were hilarious and neither teacher felt that I deserved any kind of punishment for changing the material because it was their responsibility to review and edit it.

Locrian_DM,18,,67,14nahv,,386,"Thought of another one about my dad again.  The two of us finished a short shift at the restaurant where we worked as parking attendants on a day that was not particularly busy.  As we were getting into our car, these two teenagers (just slightly older than myself) peeled out and raced down the street, just barely missing several cats (had about 30 strays that lived under the docks there) whizzed past some customers and a kid on his bike further down the street.  The cars stopped in front of a house near the top of the road.

My dad drives us up along side the lovely (I'm exaggerating, she was a 5, tops) young lady and, very politely asks,

""Hey, we'd really appreciate it if you guys watched your speed on the road here.  There are customers walking all the time and kids.""

Well this bitch starts popping off about ""blah blah blah, you can't tell me what to do, bitch bitch bitch, self-entitlement to be a jackass because of it being a free country""  He responds properly.

""Please, I'm trying to be nice about this.  There are people all over down here and you're drag racing on a residential street.""

She replies, ""Well what are you gonna do about it, tell my mom?  Go ahead, she's right up there!""  and points to her house (I think this girl's about 16, btw).

My dad gets a grin on his face...  ""Well, yes, I think I will!""  parks the car and approaches the girl's mom.

She and the guy in the other car both get an ""Oh shit"" look on their face as my dad flashes what appears to be his badge at her.

Oh, did I mention he was a cop?  I think I forgot that...  Retired by this point, but he had a badge from a current job as well.

After a brief conversation he walks back to the car, still smiling.  The girls mom screams her daughter's name and makes a really angry face at her.  The girl has a disgusted look on her face as my dad gets back into the car, makes eye contact with her and proclaims just loud enough for both her and the guy to hear,

""Have a nice day!""  He then waves like a little prancing gay hobbit and drives away nice and slow, observing the 25mph speed limit.  Didn't see her driving around the restaurant for quite a while after that.

lawnseed,45,,63,14irus,,381,"This dates back to 1992 when I lived with my parents in a university town. We used to have students live next door and a little downhill from us, and they'd continually park their cars inside our property near a dodgy fence between our properties. Their place was full of junk and only had one accessible driveway where one of the longer-term students would always park. Dad was a lawn-proud man, and while he was incredibly patient with these guys, and would ask them repeatedly to move their cars, he hit breaking point one weekend there was a big race in town. Half a dozen visiting student guest shitbox cars ended up in our lawn, and he went around to protest, saying it'd gone beyond ridiculous, especially in wet weather when it'd be likely to damage his lawn all the more. They promised like they always did that they'd get the cars out and not park there ever again but hey - the race was on, they all wanted to watch it and have a decent sunday and they'd leave them there until the race was over.

As I mentioned, our back yard was uphill from theirs, and part way through the race it really started bucketing down. Dad didn't show any outward anger, but he went into town, came back with a few bottles of dishwashing liquid, and coated the whole lawn in the stuff. Come evening some of the guys needed to move their cars and when they got to the downhill slope to go out our driveway found they couldn't steer or brake.

Two made it out without much damage, but the third slid sideways, got onto the steeper part of the lawn and went straight through the fence and into one of the other students' cars and pushed it sideways into the house. Total damage? four student cars with dents, one with busted front suspension, one wall of the student rental totalled, a bunch of arrogant students kicked out, and a few skidmarks on dad's lawn. Total cost to my dad? four bucks in dishwashing liquid, a few weeks lawn regrowth and a brand new fence shared with the new neighbours, who were pretty decent people.

signu1230,37,,61,1jpb0a,,392,"**Background:**  I work in the Audiovisual section of a library, so I handle all music and movie questions.

One time I noticed a lot of the same historical movies were being checked out over and over.  I later found out one of the History classes at the high school was doing a project where students had to select a film from a list of several options, watch it, and write a report about it.  People would come in and ask about the movies, I'd look them up in the computer, and tell them if any copies were available.  More often than not, all copies would be checked out because someone else got there first.  If the patron wanted, I would put a reserve on their library card so they would be in line in case a movie was returned.  Generally, people were pretty understanding.

Not so with one woman.  One Sunday night, I noticed a LOT more parents were asking for the movies.  I realized it was the Sunday before the assignment was due and these were all the parents of the kids who put it off until the last minute.  A woman with her son walked up to me and presented me with the the list of movies.  I looked each movie up in the computer.  Every one of them was checked out and had been for days.

At first, I had to explain to this woman what ""checked out"" meant.  There was no language barrier.  She spoke perfect English, she just apparently didn't understand how a library works.  She demanded to know why I wasn't getting a copy for her until it finally sunk in that SOMEONE ELSE had the movies she wanted.  (A side note:  the son was texting on his phone the entire time, not helping out or contributing in any way even though this assignment was his responsibility)

Unfortunately, none of the movies were going to be returned in time for her son to complete the assignment.  I relayed this information to her and I was actually genuinely sorry because I knew she was dealing with something that wasn't her fault.

**The Offense:**  I told the woman none of the movies were available, but I also suggested she try her resources at home (the library is in an upper middle-class suburb where everyone has something like Netflix or OnDemand) and these movies are popular or recent enough where they might be available electronically.

The woman stared at me for about thirty seconds without saying anything.  And then she said, in the snippiest tone I've ever heard, ""So what are you going to do about it now?""

Boom.  Any sympathy I had for her evaporated instantly.  I wanted to tell her it's not my fault her son can't prioritize.  It's not my fault her child put this off until the night before the assignment is due.  It's not my fault other parents and students were on top of this before her.

**The Revenge:**  I came up with an idea.  Through some very fast-paced searching through a secondary database, I looked to see if any other libraries had available copies of the movies.  Several did.

New tab.  Google Maps.  I put in the addresses of the libraries and did some calculating.  I made a phone call and gave the woman the address of a library that  would hold one of the movies for her.

I picked the library that was the furthest away, even though there were closer options.  From our library, the drive was over an hour long.  That's at least two hours she spent driving back and forth to get the movie!

Got an ex (then my fiancé) a job at my company.  We split but still have to work together and we're physically in the same room together for eight hours a day, five days a week. My ex, in a successful attempt to be obnoxious, would chat on hookup-apps on his phone and leave the ringer at its highest setting so as to let me know when and how much he was sexting.  I chatted on these apps as well but I never felt the need to broadcast my business and kept my ringer off.


The Petty Revenge:

Cell coverage in the office is spotty/non-existent.  In order to chat on the apps he needed to use the office wifi.  I don't have control of the wifi or the cell towers but was still able to put a wrench in the works.  

I picked up a cheap Belkin access point and configured it to broadcast with the same ssid, wireless frequency/channel, security protocol and pass phrase as the company wifi.  I then left the router disconnected from the LAN. It would let devices connect and hand out IP addresses just fine but wouldn't provide a connection to the Internet.  He tried switching over to his cell data connection but it was too spotty/slow to use for his apps.  In order to get a cell or wifi connection he would have to walk 20-30 yards down the hall. Managers would give him odd looks because they would see him on his phone all the time.  Warm fuzzy feelings for me.


Unexpected Benefits:

I sit fairly close to some offices for mid/high level managers. My rogue access point kicked all their iPads off the wifi network.  

Now, I had been complaining to IT about the network for a while.  We had plenty of access points but they were all broadcasting on the same channel killing the network speed.  My complaining never got IT to address the issue but when so-and-so with his iPad couldn't FaceTime you bet that IT kicked into high gear. More access points were deployed and they're actually configured correctly now.

TLDR -  Ex was being obnoxious with hookup apps on his phone at work.  Setup a rogue access point to kill his Internet connection.  Side-win: IT finished setting up the company wifi correctly.

LovesEwoks,72,,68,1ri9iq,,386,"I have a recipe that my (now deceased) grandmother had always used for a potato dish. Over the years, I perfected this recipe, experimenting with ingredients and seasonings, creating a nearly perfect dish. (it's always a hit at parties, dinners, and gatherings)
After I was married, I brought this potato dish to one of my spouse's family gatherings. People raved, and immediately requested I bring it to every gathering.  I am happy to oblige, since the dish is inexpensive to make and very quick and easy to put together. The potato dish quickly becomes known as ""LovesEwoks Potatoes"" (well, my actual name, not screen name, Although, I always refer to them as ""my grandmothers potatoes"")

Over the next few years, I bring these potatoes to every family function and every holiday. (mostly by request) I share this recipe many times with my spouse's family, every aunt, uncle, cousin, and sibling who asks. I even give some tips for best results.

A week before Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law calls me, explaining she wants to take the potatoes to her in-laws house, and asks for specifics on the recipe. (the exact brands of products I use, where I purchased the pan, etc) I go into great detail, giving her step by step instructions for perfect results.

A few days later, my mother-in-law calls me, asking what dish I planned on bringing to the extended family gathering. ""Oh, I thought I would bring the potatoes?"" She informs me that my sister-in-law, Kelly, is bringing potatoes, and I should bring something else. This is not a problem for me, since I have a collection of exceptional recipes from my grandmother.

We gather for Thanksgiving, and in walks Kelly with her potato dish. She removes the cover, and it's funny, because it looks exactly like the dish I always bring. I had just assumed she was going to bring something else. Nope, exact same recipe, exact same pan. She walks around telling everyone ""you MUST try Kelly's potatoes!"" 
At first I thought this might have been a joke, so I let it go. (this is not the first time she has acted very jealous, and did things for attention. In the past, she had made comments about not liking the potatoes to family members who complimented my cooking skills)

Christmas gathering, same situation. I decide to ignore it, and let her have ""Kelly's potatoes"" - just not worth dealing with her. I had brought along a dessert, again people raved, and requested I bring it again, at Easter. (thanks grandma!) It seems I might have a new ""signature dish."" 

My sister-in-law calls me a few days before Easter, asking for the dessert recipe I brought at Christmas. (can you believe it?) I give her the recipe, except this time, I leave out a very small, but critically important ingredient. 

Easter gathering. I bring my the dessert, as requested by the host. Just as I suspected, in walks Kelly with the exact same dessert. I was actually starting to feel a bit guilty, until she said, ""everyone must try this, I found the recipe on pinterest..."" Needless to say, they were terrible.

sinspider,46,,92,1ibgmy,,385,"Everyone has had shared living at certain points in their life as have I. In this particular house i had a housemate who would sneak into my room when i was at work and steal my lube for some of his alone time. I know this because when i would go looking for it, it was always in his room and always a noticeable level lower. So i plotted a revenge.

Some years ago i had heard from an 'extreme' mate what the experience was like using deep heat as lube. (You know the type of guy, the type where snorting wasabi sounds like fun) So i decided to buy some new 'warming' lube to put where i would normally stash my lube except with a minor addition. I added a few squirts of deep heat and mixed it in well. 

I changed my hiding place for my real lube and forgot about it for a few days. A few days later this housemate starts a weird sexual conversation with me leading towards me having some strange sexual fetishes. Such as he had 'seen' the new lube in my room and 'heard' that it was really extreme heat.  I was trying to stifle my laughter but asked about how he'd heard it. He admitted that he'd tried some before (but not mine of course) and that it was like firing lava and that the burning was so intense for hours he couldn't get out of bed. 

It was satisfying to see his obvious discomfort and he started to get his own supplies after that.

IAmTheWeregoose,38,,76,1f6yas,,386,"Last year I worked for the front desk of my dorm. It wasn't a glamorous job, but it allowed me to get paid to study and listen to music so I didn't complain. The work was mostly exchanging money so residents could have quarters and checking out games/equipment, but I had an additional responsibility was to sort the building's mail when it came it, which took about an hour after all of the processes. Every time I would work, this girl would walk down and ask if mail had been done yet. Mail started at 3, and she always walked down and checked at 3, so I always told her to check back in an hour. As time passed, she became more stuck up and even went so far to say I didn't know how to do my job right. Normally, I can handle when people give me crap but I always put 100% into whatever job/work I have AND I'd been doing the job for almost a full year, so now she was on my crap list.

Well one night I was working a late shift, which is prime time for residents to come down and exchange money for quarters. She came down with a five dollar bill and nicely asked for quarters for laundry. I smile back and start counting her quarters, realizing that I have a chance for revenge! There was a quarter that was bent up and I knew it wouldn't go into the laundry machine, so I grabbed it and gave it to her. She didn't notice it and went on her merry way as I smiled devilishly.

Fast forward 30 minutes, she came back down and asked for a new quarter because she needed it to dry her clothes. What she didn't know, and I didn't expect, was that a ton of residents came down and ran the desk completely out of quarters, meaning she couldn't get money from me. She stormed off and I giggled to myself at the thought of her not having dried clothes.

She likes to walk behind me and made snide comments under her breath about how ""we are paying our interns to watch YouTube"" and give me sarcastic ""Good Mornings"" to see if i minimize my window when i know someone is watching.

My family doesn't live in stable economic conditions, so a present like this is a HUGE deal. Shortly after receiving it, Emma carelessly broke the ipod screen.

This Christmas my mother wanted to surprise her with a replaced ipod, much more affordable than the new ipod model she wanted that came out this season. I knew she didn't have earphones so I buy Emma's favorite type of earphones as a surprise (although she gave obvious hints that she wanted new earphones). 

That night, my family sits in a circle and exchanges gifts of socks, shirts, and plush toys. Emma throws my first gift aside (a blouse and an ethnography) and sighs in frustration. This upset me but I decide not to make a big deal of it. We were tired from work and just wanted to enjoy our first Christmas in years. Mother hands her a gift bag and smiles with anticipation. Emma reveals a new package of fuzzy socks. After realizing that she was not going to receive the ipod she wanted, she threw the gift bag aside and rants. I noticed the joy leave my mother's eyes as she picked up the bag and told Emma to look for more presents inside. 

""There's nothing in there! I already checked! Ugh, there's probably more socks or something."" 

Seeing mother beg Emma to take the gift bag made me really upset. After a few words of encouragement from everyone else, Emma finally takes the gift bag and finds it. She doesn't smile.

RapeWalrus,43,,192,1pzgdh,,382,"Today, there was a group of Born Again Christians evangelizing on my college campus. Naturally, this brought out the hecklers on campus goofing on the evangelists. No big deal, I'm not a fan of young earth creationists. One of the hecklers was a rather flamboyant gay man, who had is own sign noting that he was gay (it was obvious) and that God wouldn't care if he was gay, straight, or whatever because God made him. Cool, you're not being a total douche like some of the other hecklers. 

Well, as the crowd grows larger to rubberneck, a few guys started heckling the gay kid for advertising his sexuality. ""Go home and fuck your boyfriend, fag!"" ""Nice sparkly shirt, queer."" The whole 9 yards. Nobody seemed bothered by this flagrant queerbashing. Seriously? We're in New England, we're a bastion of equality and acceptance. This shouldn't ever happen! On top of it, the evangelicals jumped in to it.

At this point, I'm furious, but in the apparent minority. As the heckling continues, the gay kid completely unaffected, an older gentleman turns to the bro-douches and let out the first thing that comes to mind, ""Hey, man, do you have some closeted issues or what? Do you really have to flex your manhood in public to show how straight you are? I bet you're going to go home and beat it to the Village People and put on your sister's dresses.

CarryOnMyWaywardPun,45,,45,1drhkx,,383,"Myself and a group of friends decided to rent a house together near our university. This went well, and all of us got along fine. We weren't terribly strict about using other people's stuff, it was okay as long as you weren't using it all, replaced it quickly and asked the owner beforehand. Very civil, and things continued nicely for a couple of months. 
   
Then began the washing powder drama.   
   
As I discovered, washing powder is quite expensive so we all agreed in the house to buy our own. One of my friends had noticed her fancy brand name tablets were running out very quickly, so she decided just to keep them in her bedroom. I disagreed with this, because it's I didn't think I should have to lock my stuff away so some dickhead wouldn't use it. Especially after we had stated clearly not to use each other's laundry detergent, and everyone had agreed.   
   
So, as female friend's stuff was now unavailable my own started to be used up rapidly. I could normally make a box last a couple of weeks, however this person was clearly washing their clothes every other day. I left a note on the box, explaining how much it cost and that it was expensive as hell having to get a new box every four or five days. I came back a few days later to find the note **ripped up** and stuffed into the opening, as well as the box being significantly lighter than it had been since I used it last. Cue my petty rage.    
I managed to narrow it down to one possible roommate - let's call him D. Generally a good guy, but with the capacity to be an enormous dick.  I waited until I was the only one home, carefully removed all the detergent from the box into a sandwich bag, and replaced it with a mixture of salt and zero calorie sweetener. This was months ago, and I am still topping up the box with salt, and occasionally other condiments just for spite.   Bonus: he buys the salt. 
   
Every time he complains his clothes 'smell strange' or 'feel itchy' I'm filled with the pettiest of glee. Don't use other people's stuff unless you want them to fuck with it.

The back of my parents property that connects to the neighbor is a 6 foot high retaining wall(the back street is slightly higher for some reason) that is their backyard. The garage butts up against this retaining wall and the shed is a few feet away from the wall.

So they want my dad to tear down the shed and move it five feet. My parents pay to have a surveyor come and tell them where the precise line is for the property line.

rumplesplitskin,62,,79,1m0sm4,,385,"Back story. I'm a team leader in charge of the morning/day shift at a petrol station in the UK. We've just had a new transfer from a other location join the late shift a month ago and he's bitching about my team to anyone that will listen to him.

We operate a three shift rotation for our cashiers/assistants 6am/12am 12pm/6pm and 6pm/10pm. This works out rather well for our staff and some are students and some are single parents who enjoy the flexibility of a three shift rotation. However we recently had a guy(lets call him Dave) transfer from a other store that closed due to cutbacks.

Now Dave is a bit of a prick. Well not an entire prick, he's more the tip of the prick than anything. He makes mistakes like everyone else but he always and i do mean always tries to blame someone else or simply lie and say it was not him. He worked in his old location for a number of years and due to it being a company that our company took over they had slightly different procedures and i guess he's just stuck in his ways.

But i digress the reason for the revenge is that he is going around saying that my team is slacking off during the day leaving him more work on the late shifts that he asked to be put on. Now i take pride in making sure when my shift is over the shop is stocked up and clean. It's not unknown for myself and my team to stay behind until is done.
But Dave is finding fault well he's going around looking for faults. He will write anything he finds in the store log book and i do mean anything, last week we found entries in there of really insignificant events like out of stock tickets being placed at the wrong angle and he found a packet of chewing gum the wrong way round on the shelf.  

I had a little chat about this to my boss and it turns out Dave was a supervisor in his old job and is not happy to now be a cashier here at this store. My boss also let is slip that he is being paid at the same supervisor level due to no positions for a supervisor when he was relocated. So i'm thinking that he's trying to get me and the other supervisors canned so can jump in. Well while i can't be certain if this is why he's doing these things or not i'm certainly not going to allow it to continue without a little petty revenge.

I found out that the reason Dave asked to be put on the back shifts is that he is a gamer. Not just a regular gamer but a WOW addict.  Can you see where this is going ?
Dave likes the back shift so he can play with his buddies in America. So when he gets home at night his friends are just starting to get online due to the time difference. Well when i found out about this i never gave it much thought that is until the next day i was asked to help sort out a schedule change by a fellow team leader.

It turns out due to three of our staff being students they have requested to be on nights for the next few weeks so they can attend classes during the day. But that leaves the problem, who's going to have to switch to working days ?  Mmm.. i wonder.

He refused because he's just pissed of when he doesn't know how to do one thing and when somebody else, especially an intern know how to do it. (like for some computer stuff and so on) So we now lack some important stuff on this paper just because of him.

REVENGE :

Petty, simple, I just loved it. I had to make a few calls in the afternoon, to some wine seller in Paris. I managed to find an Irish wine seller, saw on Qype that he spoke mostly English and not much French. I waited for my boss to come back from his lunch and sit at his office just next to mine and then called guy. I had a long speech with him, in English, staring at my boss who was grumping for the whole call.

tl; dr : Boss won't admit he can't speak english properly and refuse me to help him. I just gloriously show him off my English skills and he get pissed of.",Boss can't admit he can't speak English. I gave him a little English demo to piss him off.,472,pettyrevenge
Carnephex,65,,58,147oac,,385,"I'm a handyman for my neighbors. 

I'm not really Tim the Toolman, but more like Wilson with a lot of Tim's tools. I do the things that are too small to call in a contractor for, or fix something a spouse has ""fixed"" and to make it look like I was never there. 

Now I deal with all sorts of problems from plumbing to electrical to setting up and maintaining a network system for the HOA. I even whack the moles occasionally when the landscape guys can't get to em. 

This means I'm all over the place almost every day just doing my thing. I don't ask for a lot, and most of the folks are genuinely happy someone can help them. Especially the spouses of those who watch way too much HGTV. Oy. 

Anyhoo... 

Ernie is a condo commando. He hates everyone, and since his wife is dead there's no reining that asshole in. He goes around with a yardstick to measure peoples grass and where they park. If your bumper is an inch over the sidewalk, he slips a ""I'll have you towed!"" notice under your wiper blade.

A real winner. 

I've gotten tired of the petty bullshit from listening to him rail at me for being blue collar and proud of it and the snark when participating in the monthly HOA meetings. So it was time to fuck ol' Ernie over. 

One fine day I went out to HD and picked up a couple 15 pound bags of chicken manure, a couple packets of toilet gel powder and a new bucket with a spout lid. Now if you've worked with bagged chicken shit, it's a half liquid half solid all nasty mixture. 

This stuff went into the bucket for storage out in the hot sun to ferment while I waited for night to fall. Around 3am, I wake up and put on my coveralls and grab my pipe wrench and bucket of shit and walk over to Ernie's place. I make sure to avoid the streetlights, just for safeties sake. 

Once there, I open the white drain cleanout plug for his sewage system and set the funnel up on the bucket. The reek from the fermented manure was horrible, and if anything, it had gelled up worse than before. The bucket contents went right into the cleanout and just sat there clogging the pipe like some horrible Jello nightmare. 

On went the cleanout pipe cap and off I went back home. I cleaned the bucket out and stowed it so there'd be no evidence. Then went back to sleep, content in knowing that no amount of flushing and plungering would dislodge that giant hunk of shit now lodged squarely in his pipe. 

Cue the midday: Ernie has Roto-rooter out there and they can't get rid of the clog because it merely gets sliced apart and then slumps back together. They've got to water-ram and slice it and vacuum it all out. This takes a few hours to do. All this time Ernie's fuming and getting pissed off like noones business because of a giant plug of shit. 

Mmmm, the smell of revenge stinks like a chickens ass. ",So I live in an HOA and there's a condo commando who hates everyone...,443,pettyrevenge
IVIagicbanana,20,,87,1jakbq,,379,"I worked for a big chain pizza joint (actually quit yesterday!) and we had a kid, we'll call him Luke. Luke was a lazy, mooching, ungrateful human being. He came in on his first day and I started talkin' to him to get to know him a bit. He seemed alright. I asked him where he lived.

""Oh on this cross street"" 

""Hey I live near there. If you need a ride sometime let me know"". I made a huge mistake

Well he started making me his only way to work. That's fine, we worked the same schedule. I just told him to pitch me a couple bucks here and there for gas and we'll call it good. He'd do it... for a week and then stop. This pissed me off. I'm taking a little extra time out of my day to come get you and all I need is a couple bucks (Yes $2) every weekend so I can cut it even on gas. He'd say he didn't have money but would ask to stop on the way home for cigarettes.

Then on days his mother was home (guy was 20 with no license). She'd drive him but wouldn't tell me. So I'd go to his house and his sister would answer saying, ""Oh our Mom took him"". It'd be nice if he'd tell him so I wouldn't waste my time coming over. I told him, you gotta tell me or I'm not getting you. He did it another 2 or 3 times.
Being the pushover I am, I still give him rides. Then I tell him, ""Hey I gotta go to some place right by work before work. I'm gonna get you about 5 minutes early.""

""Um, no?"" replies Luke.

This is one of those little things that irk me. 

Finally he'd start EXPECTING me to pick him up before work like I owed him something. I was 2-3 minutes late getting him and he started going off on how we are going to be late for work. 

After being a pushover for these couple of months, I decided to get back at him and make work a better environment for everyone (Nobody like him at work for various reasons). 

Luke called me, ""Hey you gonna come pick me up?""

Me: ""Yeah sure"".

Luke: ""Ok, I'm gonna nap for a bit. If you could call me to wake me when you are about to head over, that'd be awesome so I could get ready"".

Me: ""Sure thing buddy!""

click.

I never called him, I never picked him up, about 7pm (he called me about 3:30) he called work, after blowing up my phone with texts, saying he's sorry he didn't come in, it's IVIagicbanana's fault he said he'd get me, blah blah blah. My manager was dying to fire him just didn't have a reason. So he told him, ""Our work policy states that a ""no-show"" for a shift is considered a voluntary resignation. I hope you realize a job is a privilege to have and you should be happy to have one"". 

Luke: ""But its not my fault!""  

Manager:""You should have had another way to work""

Click.

Manager pulled me back asking if I did what Luke said I did. I rolled my eyes and obviously sarcastically said, ""Oh no sir, of course not!"" He laughs, fist bumps me saying he's happy he's gone, and scamper off to go work in front of the hot ovens for another day.

Catticus,43,,84,168ndv,,380,"Several years ago when I was studying abroad in Korea, I would often go shopping in boutiques and other outside night markets. Now, in Korea, places like this would have often dirt-cheap clothing (quality akin to that of Forever 21) so it was fun to peruse the wares and occasionally buy a cute skirt or scarf that would fall apart in a month. But more often than not, I would go with a friend or two – mostly my American friends who were studying the Korean language/working as English teachers because at the time I was incredibly homesick despite being 100% Korean and fluent in the language. 

One particular afternoon, a friend suggested that we go to a department store/mall because she was going home for the holidays and wanted to bring back some nice gifts. In Korea, it’s very common for department store/nicer boutique employees to follow around the customer and ask questions because most department store employees worked on commission. Both of us had shopped in relatively “fancy” places  (considering the fact that anywhere that wasn’t an outdoor market is considered rather upscale), so we knew that the sales ladies tended to hover so we weren’t bothered by it. 

So as we were enjoying ourselves, drinking coffee, window shopping and speaking in Korean – me fluently and my friend practicing hers - we entered this adorably cute store. We both were looking at different things when from behind me, I heard a rude saleslady tell a customer that she was too chubby to fit into their clothes and would the foreigner please get out? I turned around – and there was my friend, getting picked on by this… this… *bitch* of a sales lady, trying to explain that the item she wanted to buy wasn’t even for her and she was buying it for someone else, all the while nervously stuttering in what was obviously not her first language. And the whole time, the salesbitch had the **nerve** to look smug about having the upper hand because the other person couldn’t even comeback to what she was saying, nevertheless apologize!  Meanwhile, I was shocked and didn't even realize that when the entire ordeal was over, we sort of stumbled out of the store, me overwhelmed, frustrated and totally blind sighted and my friend in tears.

Later that week, even after my friend had calmed down and probably brushed off the incident as a one-time bad experience, (she was incredibly sweet but meek like that), I was still upset. Furious, even. I decided that I would get my petty revenge. So I stalked the saleslady; I would go back to the store every once in a while in hopes of seeing her there. It wasn’t until about a month later that I managed to catch her and by then my anger had cooled – but my desire for revenge hadn’t. I wanted to get even. 

I walked into the store pretending to talk to an imaginary person my cell phone – but in English. Now, in Korea, all students are expected to learn English until they graduate high school – from as early as kindergarten. Koreans also pride themselves on being able to speak it well (mostly conversational stuff only) and most department stores around the more popularized areas like Hongdae or Apgujung where there are lots of tourists, management tends to hire people who can speak English (relatively speaking). So, I’m browsing around in the store, the salesbitch hovering at my shoulder until I pretend to turn around and catch her eye. Having overheard my “conversation”, she comes over with a toothy grin and asks me – in English – if she can help me with anything. She was clearly proud of her ability to speak “fluently”. Well, I wasn’t about to take that from her. I proceeded to grill her about every article of clothing in the store and then some, purposely using longer words than necessary and asking if items could be shipped to different places and if they had different colors and if the sky was blue and the grass was green and whether the cow jumped over the moon – all in English. By the end she was visibly sweating and struggling to please my uppitiness in hopes of getting a sale. 

Finally another co-worker (boss, maybe?) came out from the back/helping another customer and saw my impatience and the salesbitch struggling to close a sale and unknowingly asked me in Korean if there was anything that she could do to help.  I just looked at the terrible saleslady in the eye and in fluent Korean responded with a, “Nope. I don’t think that there *is* anything you could help me with. Thank you though, and have a nice day” and then walked out after having wasted her time.

**tl;dr:** While in Korea, I pretend to not speak the language (despite being Korean) to get gloriously petty revenge on a bitchy sales lady who was rude to my friend.

I run across the city centre and take many shortcuts. Finally, I get to a bus stop. Bus comes and I get on. Gave him £3.50 made up of 1,2,5 and 20p all within legal tender.

OhYeahThat,58,,46,12uwyf,,380,"This happened a couple months ago.

I was shopping at a Dollar store and had quite a few little items.  The clerk was an obnoxious, loud young guy.  I was already irritated by him while waiting in line-- he was making comments about how he was the best clerk this store had, etc, it was laughable.

Anyway, I always bring my own bags.  So, after putting my stuff on the counter, I handed my bags to him.  He tossed them right back into my cart, ""I don't use cloths bags!""  and he went on some anti-global warming rant.  I don't even know what all he said because I was too pissed.

So, I let him ring everything up and bag it and then I said, ""If you're not going to use my bags, I'm not going to pay.""  and I walked out without my stuff. 

He kind of just stood there stammering.  I do feel really bad for the people behind me because it probably delayed their checkout. Also, I had to go shop elsewhere to get my stuff, so this may be a case of petty revenge to spite my face.

But I was happy to think of him having to cancel the purchase and deal with all my stuff. ",You don't want to use my bags? I don't want to buy your stuff.,426,pettyrevenge
Trishlovesdolphins,28,,92,1qxa3e,,373,"A couple of weeks ago, I went to Petco. I was actually having a great time, my mom kept my kids for the afternoon so I could do a few errands and I was happily petting the cats up for adoption when I started hearing a tantrum. 

I look over, there is a kid, about 8-9 who is throwing a screaming fit because he wanted some dog toy. This continues through out the whole store. Kid sees hamsters, can't have one, 5 minute tantrum. Kid sees turtles... you get the idea. 

I'm a little miffed that my nice quiet errand has been blasted by a brat. My 4 year old doesn't behave like that in the store, WTF is a 8-9 year old doing it for? My luck, I get behind them in the checkout line. 

This particular Petco has a bar full of self serve treats. They all look like cookies, and some smell really good. Bratty kid asks his dad for cookies. The dad says no. I watch as this kid shoves 3 or 4 of the cookies in his mouth when his dad wasn't looking. 

Now, I *COULD* have said, ""sir, I just saw your son put dog biscuits in his mouth..."" But I didn't. I waited until that little shit had chewed them up, really good. Just as he was about to swallow them I pipe up, ""Excuse me, I think your kid just ate a dog treat."" 

Kid spits it out yelling about how he was eating dog food. He's scraping his tongue, begging for some water. Of course, there is no water for sale in the store so he had to wait to rinse his mouth out... 

Enjoy your dog breath fucker. 


TL DR: Tantrum throwing kid eats dog treats. Hilarity ensues when I tell him. ","Be a brat in the store, enjoy the dog biscuits.",465,pettyrevenge
