ctm,279,2217,19760w,5035,Last Thursday we experienced a lot of snow and freezing rain I was driving home cautiously since the road were unplowed and in very bad condition Naturally a person zips right behind me and begins to tailgate me I am not going to speed up and risk killing myself or others so I maintain a safe speed The tailgater begins to honk at me repeatedly even as we pass multiple people stuck in the snow on the side of the road After tailgating and honking incessantly at me for a solid five minutes he zooms past me and barrels down the road Not  meters ahead he reaches a sharp turn loses his traction and slides straight into a snowbank He immediately tries to back out of it but his tires spin uselessly in the snow He jumps out of his car and flags me down for help I am driving a truck and I am sure he got a good look at the winch on the back of it while tailgating meI stop my truck and he makes a visible gesture of relief I lay on my horn for about  seconds and drive off ,I never knew revenge so petty could feel so good ,7252,pettyrevenge,top_all

TheCannibalLector,283,443,12oe1y,4463, years ago when I was in th grade my sister who was  at the time built a giant snowman after an unusually heavy Pennsylvania snow  She spent all day on this thing and it was actually pretty impressive  The town Im from is actually a borough and it only has something like  people who live there meaning High School classes were small and relatively tightknit  There was one particular kid who Ill call Scotty who drove me up the fucking wall  He never did anything to me personally but he just had a massively annoying way about him  To make matters worse it seemed as if I had way too many classes with him to be statistically possibleOne of Scottys irritating behaviors is that he drove a loud redneckish JohnDeeregreen truck  It was obnoxious as hell and important to the story later had a huge brush guard on the front of it    Well on the evening after she built her snowy sentinel I heard the sound of Scottys truck making its way down the street from inside our livingroom  Then I heard the pfft of someone running over a snowman and laughing  Unfortunately for my sister she had built it close to the road and too easily within the range of this semiguided asshole  She was rather upset to see her days work splattered all over the street  Something needed to be done about thisSo the next morning I woke up early and began building another snowman  It was glorious  I made the classic three section scarfwearing sticksforarmsandvegetablesforaface snowmanThis new snowmans cheery countenance betrayed a grim and dark secret however Frosty was built on top of a fire hydrant at the corner of our yard where there was no curbFor a good two days I dreamt of Scotty wrapping his stupid truck around my masterpiece out in the yard  But no dice  I didnt see him at all anywhere around town so I thought I was out of luckThen on the evening of the th day I heard it  My family was eating dinner and I heard the low grumble of fates motors kicking from gear to gear  Would they find themselves abruptly halted in about  seconds  It all depends on you Scotty boySo I start chewing my food really fast because knowing the idiot I knew what was happening next  The final acceleration sounded off like a chaotic crescendo as he plowed straight intonot throughthe snowman with the deafening crunch of twisting metalMy family ran outside and it took everything I had to not laugh before I got out there  There stood Scotty dazed and bewildered and caughtoff guard by a battle that he lost before he realized it had begun ,Runover Another Snowman JackassI can build these all day,4906,pettyrevenge,top_all

msingerman,214,1501,1euxnt,3112,This story dates from last June  I was headed to San Diego for a conference  The night before I went out for some drinks with a coworker who would also be there  A few drinks turned into us pretty much closing down the bar  When I woke up at  later that morning I actually felt great  I figured I must have drunk my way through the hangover  This was of course a very stupid thought and as the morning dragged on through getting to the airport getting through security and waiting at the gate my head decided I am an idiot and deserve to be punished  It was not wrongI made my way through the plane to my row where I was to be seated in the window a personal preference  As I approached my row I saw a woman sitting in the middle seat with her belongings on my seat  I politely said that it was my seat and waited for her to move them  She let out an overlylarge sigh then laboriously moved her things onto her lap  She then sat there  And sat  I asked her if she would mind letting me by and she said the oddest thingGo over meNow at first I assumed that this was my fault  I assumed that in my awful terrible hangover I had forgotten how people board cramped seats and that I was wrong for assuming she would and should get up to let me in  But then I remembered Im an idiot  So I assumed she had some sort of physical disability which made standing and sitting difficult or painful for her and rather than embarrass her I did as she requested I went over herShortly before takeoff she stood up and hollered at her husband who was in the back of the plane with their two childrenI dont know why you couldnt get us seats together  Honestly this is absurd why didnt youLady I got an idea whyI didnt really care about her constantly reshuffling things or her armresthogging  It did bum me out when her daughter came up to our row with a cheese and cracker platter and asker her mom if she wanted some and the lady simply said No  Eventually I was able to fall asleepFor those who dont drink there is a phenomenon called the beer shits  After a night of heavy drinking you will often have a large amount of gas and other things which go along with it the next day  About halfway through out flight I felt this coming on and I decided I had no choice but to go  I asked her if I could please get out  The gentleman in the aisle seat immediately got out but she again saidGo over meNow by this point I was pretty irritable  I had an awful headache my stomach was doing somersaults and I was about to blow an Oring and this miserable bitch wanted me to go over her  On a moving plane  Fine I would  I swung my right leg over her then put my ass over her face nearly touching  A slight tremble in the flight and I released a fullon seemingly never ending fart a cloud of noxious gas which should have had me arrested for war crimes  I let the whole thing go  Afterwards I turned made full eye contact and said Sorry  Turbulence  Everyone around me was fully and truly disgusted and to them I am still so sorry but I did what I did for the greater goodWhen I got back from the bathroom she got up to let me in,Really I just wanted to get to the restroom,4613,pettyrevenge,top_all

Decyde,543,1820,1kcno0,2689,Someone told me to cross post my comment here from yesterdayA couple of kids who lived in my neighborhood who were around  years old kicked my cat while it was laying out in front of my porch sun bathing  I was looking out the window while I saw them walk by and do it and when I opened the door they took off running  My cat limped up onto the porch and I could obvious tell it was hurt so I took it up to the vet who gave it an xray and confirmed she had a couple broken ribs but no internal organ damageThis whole thing happened at about  pm and I ended up getting home at  pm  When I got home I put Bonkers in the house and went down to talk to the kids parents about what they did  They told me that their kids wouldnt do something like that and I must have been mistaken  I told them that I wasnt and I wanted to make sure they were disciplined for what they did  She told me again that her kids wouldnt do something like that so I went home and called the policeThe police came and got my statement and talked to the parents  They denied everything and then came and told me there was little they could do  I could try filing in small claims court to recoup my vet bills but I told him there was next to no way Id win and he apologized to me and hoped my cat would get betterI went to work the following day and told my coworkers about the incident and they felt sorry too for my cat  I got pissed off to the point where I wasnt going to let them get away with it  The day after this I got off work and stopped by the hardware store and bought some bolt cutters  I waited till about  am and went and stole both of their bikes off their porch and put them in my garageI went to work and thought about dumping them on the other side of the city but instead I decided to cut them up instead  When I got home I took them apart and cut them on my work bench and tossed the crankshaft and bolts in the car wash dumpster a couple blocks away  I waited till Friday night and dumped them down the street in the field they liked to play at on the weekends  I was on my porch most of Saturday when I saw them crying and dragging their cut up bike pieces home to their parents  I saw the police come over to their home later in the day but I was sure they told them that there was no proof I did it so they didnt stop by and talk to me  In the end my cat didnt get to go out side the rest of the year and they didnt get bikes to play with the rest of summerThis happened about  years ago and my cat was  at the time  She lived to be  before she passed away in her sleep one nightTLDR  Neighbor kids broke my cats ribs so I cut up their bikes they got for Xmas and dumped them in their play area to find,Neighbor kids kicked my cat and broke a couple ribs,4509,pettyrevenge,top_all

Trashmannn,378,1539,1l2cq1,2579,So I live in a low income housing area of the town i attend college in I was initially drawn to the apartment Im currently living in because it was extremely cheap and on the second floor this is a house converted into two living units I immediately signed the lease and everything was dandy for the first few weeks However I had taken notice of the neighborhood riff raff and was wary to keep my distance I wasnt exactly scared of a bunch of young teens but after observing their absolutely appalling nature i tried to give them no excuse to fuck  with me through vandalizing my car or apartmentWell not so long ago I was sitting on my second story porch enjoying a cigarette after a long tedious shift when the teens decided to fuck with me At first i didnt realize they were speaking to me until one of them called out hey you indian fag Now even though Im not indian people often assume i am because of my skin tone so Im aware theyre attempting to heckle me I look up and merely raise my eyebrows in acknowledgment when one of them kicks over my full garbage cans and tells me to get on my knees and pick up my trash you insert random racist slurs here They laugh and leave Knowing that Ill be fined by the city if i dont clean up the mess i begrudgingly clean up the mess It was while i was kneeling among the strewn garbage that my revenge came to fruition A few nights later I was sitting on my porch again waiting for my targets to arrive Sure enough the pack of them comes strutting down the road talking shit and fucking things up When they get to my house I shout at them to keep it down and that theyre being obnoxious Just as i had planned they took my bait and the one who had kicked over my trash cans a few days earlier told me that i was a fag and aimed a full forced kick at my trash cans Little did he know that i had filled them to the bursting point with packed down rocks and dirt making them extremely heavy and almost unmovable I savored the moments leading up to contact and burst out laughing when the garbage can failed to move and the kid howled out in pain when his foot connected Judging from the time he spent on the ground clutching his foot and the fact that he limped away on the verge of tears Im assuming he broke a toe or two i slept like a fucking king that night  ,Kick my trashcans will you Enjoy the broken toe,4118,pettyrevenge,top_all

whiteknighting for Shelly  They have a kid together so I dont blame him  But I could not resist seeing what would happen if I confronted himInstead of calling I decided to get up early this morning and go to the law firm where Silas had a job  The business card he gave me just said The Offices of Legal Guy Legal Eagle and Law Dude you can substitute the names of actual attorneys here none of which are SilasAs soon as I walked in the front door I saw Silas sitting at the back of the front room  He looked up panicked and I swear to Zeus he skulked out of the room like hed shit himself  Went into an office and closed the door behind himNow my brother had already told me that he knew Silas worked for a law firm Shelly had told him  He couldnt remember what Silas did there but we reasoned that Silas couldnt possibly be a lawyer because he graduated from a year community college just two years ago  The timing you seeI asked the receptionist who that guy at the back was and she said his name is Silas he is one of our best paralegals  I asked if that meant he could sue somebody and she laughed  Yeah thats what I thoughtI asked if I could talk to him and she said Id be better off talking to an attorney and that Law Dude and Legal Eagle were in the building no thanks I really need to talk to SilasShe said Is this a personal thing and I said well sorta and she whispered to me Look Silas has already gotten in trouble once this week for personal stuff  Can you wait until lunch when hes out of the officeUh no  He came to MY office tried to embarrass ME no way in hell Im letting him get off that easyIf Id thought ahead of time I wouldve taken today off  I could only wait half an hour for him to come back to his desk yes Im a sucker but he stayed put in that closed office and I had to get to work myself  I wrote a note for the receptionist to give to Silas  ILL BE BACK AT  ON MY LUNCH BREAK  IF YOURE BUSY OR GONE IM SURE ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS HERE CAN HELP ME INSTEADHe showed up at my office at He closed my door and sat down and looked like he was about to cry  He couldnt even look at me but he mumbled how he was trying to spend more time with his son and he believed some things that werent true and how very sorry he was and how his life was falling apart  He said he was trying to get custody of his kid but it was hard to do because he  was trying to go back to school which took time and money and  was not a woman  His words not mineFuuuuuck  Hell make a GOOD lawyer someday  Almost made ME cryWe started talking about the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  I told him how Shelly had mowed every few days and I was refusing to pay her for the last day because she didnt do shit except sit in her car for an hour  He said that was his fault she had called him while she was waiting for me that day and she was in a panic because she had been seen breaking into my house and she Wait WhatHe calmly continued that she said she had broken into my house and that she was all upset because she had taken a laptop WHATHe said calm down she put the laptop back but she was upset because the neighbors had seen her climb through my window and she was worried she was going to get arrested  I asked why she didnt just leave that day then  He said she was afraid that would make her look guiltyOh  My  GodHe said that he had told her to wait until I arrived and to explain  She told him that she was going to try to get into my house once I got home so that her fingerprints would have a reason to be there  Well that explains why she was so pushy and insistent on getting insideWait wait  HOW did she put the laptop back  She went in through the window twice  She said she left the front door open so she could say that you left your door open and that was why your laptop was missing  I told her that wasnt a good ideaNO SHIT SHERLOCKI really really want to hit this guy but I manage to stay polite and ask him nicely if he would mind telling the police that Shelly admitted to him that she went through my window  I omit the part about the neighbors saying they didnt want to get involved I think Shelly brought her kid to along a few times she mowed and they saw and felt bad for her  He says he doesnt want to make an already ugly situation even uglier  I remind him that if he wants custody of his son this would be a good start  He says Ill think about itI resist the urge to get up and danceThen this happenedA friend of mine that works for the town newspaper gave me thisShelly got picked up this afternoon  she was speeding and got pulled overCouple of things you might notice from that press release Shes not being charged with breaking and entering because according to the investigator I talked to earlier if I left my window open she didnt technically break in The cops are claiming that I had complained of a missing laptop the day that I called them  No I didnt  I didnt notice anything missing that day  I wouldnt have known she was even in my house until my neighbors told me they saw her break in  Im guessing this is to make the cops look less like idiots  I love how they called it an investigation like they had actually done their job Shelly apparently told the cops that she had temporarily lived at my house  My brother used to live with me right after our dad died and he and Shelly dated during that time and she slept over more than a few times but she never paid rent or anything  Its possible she thought she could tell the cops some excuse about how she was my roommate  This pisses me off more than anything she did before  When she was arrested she gave her moms address as her permanent residence  I think she and her son had been staying there since Silas kicked her outShe made bail immediately  I would bet Silas paid it out of guilt but I cant be sure  I do know that she left her kid at her moms house and that no knows where she is right now  I really really hope she doesnt skip town but I wouldnt be surprisedGuess shell owe Silas some money,UPDATE on the UPDATE Stupid bimbo scams me brags about it on Facebook threatens to sue with a fake lawyer VENGEANCE IS MINE SAYETH THE

DrRat,509,1376,1g78ps,2342,A little bit of background before I get into the petty revenge Im a dancer at a strip club in Florida Its a small club in a relatively conservative area so its pretty tame compared to a lot of other places Its more of a bikini bar as we must keep our bottoms on and our nipples covered with tape or tassels at all times under penalty of losing our job which Im OK with In the past few years strip clubs have become more mainstream and popular with all types of people  not just the clichéd perverted old men although we definitely still get those guys We regularly host bachelorette parties couples groups of women and groups of couples come in to enjoy the show We even get middleaged couples theyre always the most fun and surprisingly accepting to the scene  For the most part the women are pretty cool with being surrounded by halfnaked strippers and enjoy hanging out with us and were happy to have them there MOST of themnot all We get the occasional girlfriend or wife who comes in with a holier than thou attitude who just sits there and scowls at everyone Clearly she was dragged in against her will and wants to show her displeasure by trying to ruin the night for everyone If you try to make conversation with them they make passiveaggressive remarks putting you and your profession down  Thats fine Dancers have to have tough skin and lots of confidence so we usually just go to the dressing room and laugh about how insecure the girl is For those of you who arent familiar with how most strip clubs are set up here is a brief explanation Most have a bar right when you walk in so you can grab a drink There is typically a stage with a dancer on it either in the middle of the club or running along one wall Generally the closer to the stage you sit the more open you are to talking to girls and getting private dances The stage will have chairs around it which is called the tip rail At the tip rail you have a very close view of the women on stage but it is heavily implied that you must tip the dancer to sit there At my club there are about a dozen chairs around the stage  When a dancer receives a tip at the tip rail she normally does something a little extra for the guy If its a dollar or two I just let them stick it in my Gstring If its  Ill motorboat or shake my butt If its  Ill wrap my thighs around their neck and jiggle the lady bits Anything over  Ill climb off the stage and give them a  second lap dance  If a douchebag sits at the tip rail and tips nothing then I will completely ignore them An additional note if youre sitting at the tip rail and all the chairs around the tip rail are full and the club is packed your ass had better be tipping generously because if youre just sitting there taking up space from someone who would otherwise be tipping then youre essentially taking money out of my pocket Its truly frustrating but we cant really say anything about it because tipping at the tip rail is only heavily implied not requiredHere is where the petty revenge comes into play Every once in a while one of those scowling angry women sits at the tip rail usually with the boyfriend or group of friends who are having a GREAT time  and doesnt tip a single dollar Her friends are usually tipping but she will just sits there arms crossed pissed off and bitter For the longest time my reaction to these women would be just to ignore them just like I do with nontipping men Then I mentioned it to a coworker about how annoying these girls are because they bring down the mood of the night and dont tip when they should be She told me Im taking the wrong approach in ignoring them Next time it happens treat the girl like she tipped   wrap your legs around her neck and stick your crotch right in her face So I did The next time a pissy girl came in and sat at the tip rail during a busy night and didnt tip I SHOWERED the girl with attention boobs in her face ass jiggling thighs wrapping around her neck pussy in the face the whole nine yards despite her not tipping a single dollar This is what happened the guys LOVED it and threw TONS of money on the stage because hey girl on girl The woman Madder than hell but unable to do anything about it because shes sitting at the tip rail and Im just doing my job In addition Im the one smiling having a great time while she looks like a curmudgeon Its a winwin for meI now do this on a regular basis with almost the exact same results each time I make more money and at the same time piss off someone who clearly looks down upon my jobEdit I really hate when people edit but its pretty clear some of you have never been to a strip club The atmosphere is VERY relaxed and chill No one is sexually harassing anyone The tip rail is literally the only place I do this If someone isnt comfortable with it they have a choice of about a hundred other chairs they are more than welcome to sit at without any disturbance,Petty Revenge at the Strip Club,3718,pettyrevenge,top_all

MagnusFojar,173,561,19emql,2070,Ive been reading this subreddit since it started and its definitely  become one of my favorites So Im glad to finally contribute I apologize if its a bit longBackgroundDuring college I was in a longdistance relationship with my girlfriend Mary now my wife We went to neighboring state schools which meant a lot of  hour drives back and forth most weekends On this particular weekend Mary discovered that her friend Jess was also planning on visiting my school They only lived about  minutes apart from each other so it made sense to carpool for the long ride up Jess offered to use her car if Mary would drive them up there with the condition that Jess would drive Mary home on the way backSince its a college town parking was at a premium and free parking was even harder to find Luckily some of my friends had a free lot on the outskirts of town Since were all doing each other favors I offered to park Jess car there and save everyone some moneyI met them both when they arrived Friday afternoon  Jess went to hang out with her friends  and I parked her car in the free lot I should mention that its a very large town and it was easily a  minute walk from Jess friends apartment to the free lot That is if you know where the free lot is locatedAnyway we had an awesome weekend and Sunday rolls around meaning its time for Jess and Mary to go home I was engaged in an allday student club event when I got a phone call from Mary stating the following  Jess had decided that she didnt have time to drop Mary off at home anymore And that she would leave Mary several towns over At which point Mary should call another friend to take her the rest of the way Oh and can I go get Jess her car and bring it to her since I still had her keys  Oh hell noI was pissed and I was certainly not going to let Jess strand my girlfriend in an unfamiliar place with no means to get home Mary was upset and didnt really know what to do since Jess was being a selfish bitch It was at this point that I realized the only way I could guarantee for Mary to get home was to make the long drive there myself to drop her off So I left my event leaving my understanding friends shorthanded and went to meet that bitch JessThe revengeI told Jess Sure come to my apartment and Ill take care of you She arrived expecting her car and was handed only keys I pointed her in the direction of the lot walked to my car and started driving Mary home The thing is the free lot was in an obscure and far away part of town It took me  minutes to walk there moving at a relatively fast pace and knowing exactly where I was goingJess was still calling me  hours later trying to find her car from my intentionally vague directions Mary was half way home before Jess even started her trip I hope she grasped the irony that by trying to save  minutes and screwing over my girlfriend she ended up losing  hours of her time But thats probably giving her too much creditTLDR  My girlfriends friend was willing to strand my girlfriend to save herself a half hour She completely went back on everything she promised after taking advantage of our kindness So I cost her  hours of her time and a lot of stress,Strand my girlfriend Enjoy your hike,2631,pettyrevenge,top_all

MoonshineBaby,285,794,1pnwh6,1925,I was at my parents house last night when my mom answered a call on their landline I perked up when I heard her say with a worried look on her face my computers infected I knew immediately this was a scam call so I told her Id handle it and took the phone It was a guy from India in a call center saying he was with Microsoft and I needed to follow his stepbystep instructions to clean up all the viruses on our pc ie give him remote control steal whatever info they can get install malware turn it into a zombie or whatever else they do with this scam Now I hate scammers with a passion but Im especially pissed off because my mom is getting up there in age and isnt as sharp as she used to be and wouldve fallen for this had I not been there In fact she did fall for this exact same scam about a year ago I had to wipe the computer and told her very plainly that no one will ever ever call from Microsoft or for any other internet related issue Unfortunately her memory isnt so hot these days   In a very thick Indian accent this guy tells me how bad the computer is with all its viruses and infections Oh no Really I have viruses How do I fix it I say He assures me hell walk me through the clean up process and I express my relief and gratitude Sweet  I dont have shit to do at the momentOk sir I need you to hold down the Windows key and the R key at the same time Ok I did that Now what do you see My computer is off now Sir no why is your computer off You should see a menu Please power the computer back on I actually had turned it off so I would be able to blare the Windows logon sound to make it convincing Now this is like an  PC my mom has so the start up time is NOT exactly fast So after a good while I tell him Im back up and ready Ok sir Now look at the keyboard and find the WINDOWS KEY and the R KEY Please hold these down at the same time Now please tell me sir what do you seeHmm My computer turned off again I held down the main Windows button and the R key just like you told me and it turned off again Im sorry I just dont know what Im doing wrong Hes getting a little frustrated now But the beauty is Im thinking this guy probably has to call hundreds of people before hes got a sucker on the line as willing and eager as I am to remedy this particular computer problem So I do this cycle a full four times each time giving him more little hints that I think the Windows Key is actually the power button By the fourth time I thought for sure he would get it because I was calling it something like the main Windows power button on my Dell but sadly he never did figure it out He gives up on that and moves on to try something elseOk sir forget that we will try something else He goes on to explain that were going to do a bootup sequence where I have to press the F key while the computer is booting back up Obviously this could not have worked out better The chance to continually miss hitting the F key in time has me absolutely giddy inside I assure him Im ready to hit the key and restart the machine I let it fully boot up and blare the Windows login sound again and say OK Its back on and Im hitting the key now He sighs with more frustration You have to do it WHILE THE COMPUTER IS STARTING BACK UP he explains So I apologize again and feign frustration myself while holding back my unfettered delight The next round he is more careful to make sure Im hitting the key during the bootup sequence So Im punching away on the space bar key as loud as I can during the bootup and after a couple minutes or so here comes that beautiful Windows start up sound again and he lets out an even louder more frustrated sighSIR Did you hit the F key Well Ive gone this far I think to myself I may as well lay on another level of frustration by insulting his English Yes I was hitting the S and H keys the whole time I dont know what went wrong Yep that did it No no no the F key The F   key Sir look at your keyboard Do you see the F key OHOhthe F key I say Yes I see Ill try again We sit there waiting a few more minutes I repeat the whole process this time after the startup sound I tell him I hit the F and  keys but again nothing happened Holy Shit Hes fuming at this point but trying as hard as he can to hold it back Right then I heard my mom call that dinner was ready Normally I would have blown off dinner for something this much fun but wed grilled out these beautiful ribeyes and I wasnt about to let mine get cold I tell him Im really sorry I have to go to dinner now and I will have to fix it later And with that after this  minute phone call I just hang up I sit at the table admiring this beautifully marbled steak and tell my folks it was all a scam and I was just wasting his time The phone rings My mom jumps up and says I got it In the sweetest voice my mom said Im really sorry but we are having family dinner at the moment and I have a rule that everyone has to sit down together and after a moment listening to his reply she hangs up and sits back down Whatd he say I ask Mom replies He said Fuck your family dinner,Try to scam my mom and I will ruin your day,2719,pettyrevenge,top_all

hipsterhijabi,452,907,1gx8r0,1904,Thank you to uFireCrouch for the Reddit GoldIm mildmannered Im quiet I dont really go out of my way to speak at all I enjoy observing and it takes a lot to phase or irritate me A lot Im also Muslim and I wear a hijab head covering like a nunbut not I live in a small rural town in Southern Ontario and for the past  years I have loved it here Its really nice the townspeople are wonderful and inclusive and its just a beautiful little town really I have never really encountered rudeness aside from my brief foray into the world of retail I have also never been on the receiving end of any racial abuse That is until the fateful day I went to my local grocers to see that it was in fact closed early that day Sighing I resigned myself to the fact that Id had to go to the next town over to get my bread and eggs The next town over wasnt nearly as nice as my town It was rundown unpleasant and had a very long history of the KKK being active in there But its  and no one had heard of any such horrible business for a good long while right And itd be silly to not get bread and eggs based on things I wasnt even sure were true right So off I went I walked into the grocers and began perusing the fruits The town thus far hadnt been at all what I had thought of it as Sure it was rundown but no one had given me any dirty looks I was contented and went on my way Until I heard Why is she hereI didnt pay no mind until I heard again People like her should not be allowed in this countryMy back stiffened I was quite plainly the only minority around I turned around and saw a wizened  year old woman Long of face and sour of expression she looked at me with such hatred I was shocked Her bony fingers pointed at me in an accusingly My eyes widened but I stood my ground and decided that perhaps she was just batty and went on with my shopping calmly Standing next to her was her husband I presume He was tall large and just as meanfaced as his wife But he said nothing and I was going to say nothing too Id let it go II didnt want to get into a verbal altercation I just wanted to get my things and go home The old lady did not rest however She followed me around the shop and began spewing more hatred Religion is evil but Islam is the most evilYou are dirty they should burn everything you touchYoure a pigIslam is disgustingGo back to your own country you illiterate bitchI bet you fuck pigsAnd on and on it went Each new epithet more horrifying than the last They were only words though she hadnt touched me or assualted me in anyway But I was starting to get annoyed What had I done to her anyway I just existed and she hated me based on my existence I for the life of me dont understand how you can hate someone based purely on their physical appearance The other customers and the cashiers were starting to stare now but no one said anything Fine whatever I dont really expect people to jump to my help at all and most of them were seniors anyway I have by now finished paying Her insults still ringing in my ears Im about to exit the store and then I calmly turn around and face her for the first timeThis whole time I had been silent she had been going on about my illiteracy about how I should go back to my own country how disgusting I am etc etcSo I said in my clipped accent I find it surprising that you know so much about me just based on my appearanceShe gestured to my headscarf and spat That thing tells me all I need to knowSo I said Well I thought you looked like a crack whore when I first saw you But now I can see your face I realize youre far too ugly to be oneShe turned bright red in apoplectic rage and began screeching at other customers at this injustice I had caused her Suddenly a greenaproned man with a name tag that said manager appeared She turned to him saying how horribly I had been her how Im a terrible person for calling her such foul thingsHe calmly allowed her tirade to abate and said Youre a sorry excuse for a human being and you and your husband arent allowed back here again Please get out of my sightHe then turned me and apologized profusely for not being alerted sooner to the situation and said Im welcome back anytime I thanked him and left The old lady was spitting with rage so as I drove off I gave her a cheery wave TLDR Called a racist too ugly to be a crackwhore manager backed me upAside I know its not that juicy but it was satisfying for me I hardly ever speak up for myself so it was a big deal to me to have said anything Thank you for readingAnother Aside I apologize to all the middle aged redditors who have read this You are all very right  is not old Sorry Yet Another Aside There has been much history of the KKK in Canada the KKK is not an exclusively American organization httpwwwthecanadianencyclopediacomarticleskukluxklan here is a link which you can find out more They were not as active as they were in the United States because Canadians generally have none of that nonsense Aside  Thank you for the comments Your kindness has made my thighs quiver in joy,In Which OP is accosted by a Racist Old Lady,2811,pettyrevenge,top_all

brunee,203,442,1bmy84,1792,My friends bought their very first home not long after he and his wife graduated college They had lived their whole married life in married housing which basically consisted of a one room apartment on campus Needless to say they were beyond excited to have their very own place and lots of room Within the first day only hours after moving in the neighbor next to them started yelling and screaming at them to move their cars and that if they did not move their cars he would not only have them towed but he would file trespassing charges on them for being on his property My friends were beyond upset and didnt know what to do they were just certain that their realtor had told them that the gravel driveway was theirs as was the very small piece of land that connected the driveway to their home So for the time being they parked their cars directly in front of their house practically on their lawn In the meantime the neighbor had rented a bulldozer and parked it in the spot that he claimed was his He moved piles and piles of dirt into huge mounds blocking off entry to the gravel driveway Seeing as how I work for the state as a social worker I know quite a few people at the local court house I called a few people and was directed to someone that could get me a copy of a land survey that had been done on my friends property After pulling a few strings I managed to get a copy of it This is where it gets reallllllly good Almost makes me want to jump up and down again while telling this story You seethe land survey showed that the gravel drive way and the little patch of land connecting it to my friends house was THEIRS The crazy neighbor was actually trespassing by having his rented bull dozer on their property What makes it even better is that he had used this bull dozer to destroy their property by moving the huge mounds of dirt all over So I told my friends and they called the police there was no reasoning with this man  The police officer was just wonderful He explained to the neighbor that he was trespassing and that he had to remove the bulldozer immediately and that he was lucky because his neighbors had declined to press charges against him for destruction of their property on the condition that he repair the driveway to its original condition so that it could be accessed by the owners Needless to say the neighbor hasnt caused anymore problems for my friends and avoids them at all costs ,Neighbor kept threatening to tow my friends car and file trespassing charges against them so I took care of it for them,2234,pettyrevenge,top_all

discobigwig,214,637,1k5vhu,1670,So I work as a bartender at a smaller bar in downtown Minneapolis It is considered standard for the servers to tip me out at the end of their shift based on a percentage of their tips in order to compensate me for the time I spend making drinks for their customers  Most of the servers are good for giving me  of their tips when they are having their free shift drink allowed  rail drink or domestic tap per shift but there is this guy who never tips back its not technically required This same guy lets call him B also feels entitled to all the free booze he wants actually a lot of people do and some of the bartenders will actually give them free booze all night  I dont usually but sometimes I do give them an extra drink or two if they had a slow shiftSo fast forward to last night I made somewhere between  and  drinks for this server while having a slower night at the bar it was nice and people wanted to sit at the patio and I knew me must have made at least  based on the fooddrinks he was selling His shift was nearing an end and a cute girl he was trying to impress came in to wait for him to get off He comes behind the bar a big nono and tells her that her drinks are on him then tells me that she can have his shift drinks turns back to her and suggests she order an expensive microbrew and she does  Here is where the revenge part starts i know he isnt going to tip me out for the drinks i made for him during his shift and it seems He is expecting me to just GIVE her beers So I start a tab under his name for the craft beers She has several more and he gets off and asks for a rail whiskey with ginger ale  which he would only order as a shift drink otherwise he would drink top shelf and another While I did give him his deserved shift drink they eventually rang up a  tab and when I reminded him to take care of the tab before they left and presented him with the bill he gave me a look like WTF man They studied the bill and I explained the shift drink rules He continues to argue that he should get at least  shift drinks and I remind him that he only ordered  drink that could have qualified the rail whiskey and reminded him of the rules While he did pay his tab it was grudgingly and he left no tip She ended up paying for all her own drinks and left a great tip and left without him  I saw him trying to pick up sleazy girls for the rest of the night with no success he was too drunk by thenTipping goes a long way in the service industry Dont tip me dont get laid,Dont tip me Dont get laid,2307,pettyrevenge,top_all
RadicalChic,179,567,1ne9m5,1658,I work at an upscale restaurant that is half bar Last night a group of pretty well dressed women in their thirties strolled in about  and demanded a food menu When I explained that our kitchen closes at midnight one of them angrily pointed at another table and screeched Well THEY have food When I tell them that that particular table ordered their food twenty minutes prior and that is why they in fact have food on their table she waved me away telling me to ask the kitchen what they can doThe kitchen relents and the ladies get a hummus I set it down and they descend upon it nary a thank you They dont order anything else and I keep enough of an eye on them to make sure they are taken care of without me actually having to interact with them more than I have to The last time I check up on them asking if they need anything I get a curt no Five minutes later theyre gone My annoyance turns to glee when I go to clear the table One of them has left behind her iPhone I drop it into my apron and walk up to a guy that I saw chatting them up earlier and ask if he knew them He tells me no that they were horrendously bitchy and that he got the fuck out of that situation as soon as possible I tell him my experience with them and he asks how much their bill was it was  He then shoves  into my hand telling me hell cover it and I can keep the rest I try to refuse it since it wasnt his fault that they walked out but he insistsI go to the office and explain the situation to my manager who is as pissed off as I am When one of the womans friends calls the phone my manger answers it up and tells her that she is welcome to come by to pick up the phone and pay her tab otherwise she will have to wait until Monday at  PM to get it were closed on Sunday If it had been any other customer we would have worked something out to get her phone to her earlier but fuck herWell apparently this woman has a friend who knows one of our bartenders This friend calls our bartender who Im fairly close with and knew about the situation asking if he could bring the phone to her on Sunday He tells her no that the woman skipped out on her bill and will need to personally come in to get her phone The woman never came in that nightSo basically this woman will have to come back into the restaurant she essentially stole from is going to be without her phone until tomorrow and looked like a complete twat in front her friend in the process Bet you wish you paid that  tab now bitchUPDATE The bartender relented and brought the woman her phone on Sunday night on the condition that she pay her tab According to him she was a huge entitled bitch who just shoved a  at him and didnt apologize for skipping out on the bill And yes I could have thrown the phone away but I felt like that was a bit much I think the inconvenience of having to go nearly  hours without her phone and the embarrassment of acting like a complete shithead was punishment enough,Skip out on your bill Probably shouldnt leave your phone behind,2225,pettyrevenge,top_all

Sanderf,117,435,1dh244,1536,For the past few months One Directionfever has taken my home into its cold unforgiving grasp My sister has been more than obsessed with those kids and well teenagers will be teenagersMonths go my sister learned about a One Direction concert in our home country Belgium As a good brother I decided to get her a ticket because I couldAs the months passed on she started to realize a bit of a problem The concert would be done at midnight in the other side of the country this is Belgium so it isnt that far Neither my father nor I could pick her up from the concert so after looking for parents who were driving their kids as well she told me none of her other friends were going note that all tickets were also sold out and trying to fix my schedule so I could pick her up I ended up finding the ideal solutionA busservice was riding specifically for the concert from my town to Antwerp where the concer was taking place and back It seemed perfect and she agreed with me so I paid another  bucks for the bus fare and arrenged her a seat in that busThat was  weeks ago Three days ago she suddenly tells me she wont take the bus afterall the bus was already paid and there was no refund possible She had discovered the bus would arrive an hour before the concert which according to her was not early enough The concert starts at PM but she wants to be in that city at AM Her plan is to go to the boys hotel and attempt to get autographsI told her it was unlikely shell get autographs which made her freak out She started throwing stuff screaming at me calling me the worst words and telling her how I was taking everything away from herI pointed out that without me there wouldnt be a concert for her and for all intends and purposes that ticket is mine and I can just sell if I wanted to This made her go berserk and she shouted that I should start treating her more like an adult and stop trying to arrenge everything for herI just told her I wasnt comfortable with her taking the train from and to that city on her own especially if I already paid for the busfare on her requestShe then told me she had arrenged for going with the train with her friends for the past few months which is a blatant lie as she stated she didnt have friends that were going to the concert only a few weeks back Now comes the revenge bit note it is very petty and I could probably do more to have my revenge but Im too much of a softy for thatMy sister is notorious for never setting an alarmclock She depends on me or our father to wake her up in time for school and other things If we dont do that shell easily spend the entire day sleepingShe was taking the AM train but it is currently noon and shes still sleeping I wont wake her up even if it means she misses the concert She has until PM to wake up which should be reasonable I think so she can take the bus like I arrenged for her If she gets angry for not waking her up Ill tell her she asked me to treat her like an adult UPDATEAt  PM she woke up She was of course grumpy and started demanding why I did not wake her up earlier I reminded her that she wanted to be treated as an adult and told her that if she had waken up in time she could have left without a problemThe message came across though there was some shouting involved She has locked herself up in her room now and Im going to leave her and her emotions alone now She did apologize for her behavior which I think is progress Shell be able to go to the concert and have a good time later today ,If you want to be treated as an adult maybe start by setting an alarmclock,1971,pettyrevenge,top_all
StrangerJ,102,654,1mwrlo,1527,Back last year during the summer I was able to get a summer job and buy myself a laptop for taking notes with at school I had always gotten good grades and my teachers use to compliment me on how well I took notes compared to the rest of my class So with my notes being typed out and it not being any extra work I decided to start posting my notes on my classes facebook page We made this page about a year prior incase someone forgot their homework or flatout needed help with something So weekly I would post my notes for a few classes and people loved me for doing this But one day this guy who we shall call Jerk Jock JJ for short begins fucking with me in class JJ starts doing shit like throwing my lunch in a tree stealing my mouse in class and start fucking up all my shit and even goes as far as to report me to teachers telling them I played video games in class All the teachers trusted me and knew I didnt play video games in class though if a teacher did think I was playing video games in class I would have been banned from using my laptop in school gotten some detentions and maybe even suspended So this guy really want to fuck with me because he thought I wouldnt do jack shit because I am passive as fuck Well I know for a fact that he flat out stopped taking notes in several classes and entirely relied on my notes for tests So that Friday when I go to post my weekly notes I just hit the lil ole Let every one see this except JJ buttonThe night before the test Dumb bitch doesnt study before that JJ comes on our page wondering where my notes were and asking people if he could use theirs I then proceed to tell everyone if anyone gave him my notes I would stop posting all my notes foreverHe failed the next  tests we took until he finally started taking notes again One of his friends told him about what I did and he confronts me and makes me look like a dick in front of everyone until I remind him what he did I then told him that if he stops fucking with me then I would continue to post them for him but one more piece of bullshit and I cut him off for goodI dont actually plan on ever letting him see my notes againEdit How do I even word,Piss me off Prepare to fail your tests,2181,pettyrevenge,top_all
FinalEnemy,157,618,1pj7o8,1535,This happened a while ago but I stumbled into this sub and figured it might fit Its work related but Im going to try to keep the jobspecific jargon to a minimumQuick backgroundI had been working at my job for a few years and decided to apply for the management program  No easy task to even get in and when I went through  of the people who were accepted actually completed the course The course was a major ball breaker and those in it were usually regarded as subhuman throughout It sounds weird but it was effective in trimming the fat Those directly associated with the course were trained in the art of balancing this facade with actual learning points The problem usually came from those who saw this and assumed it was cool to be an asshole tooThe actual storyI get told that Im going to continue my course and the horrific jobs that entailed but also drive the big boss around and play chauffeur for a while  I go to the guy in charge of the vehicles and other logistical boringness and get the bosss vehicle and go about my way Dude was uber douche throughout our entire interaction  Ill call him Major Douche After days of babysitting this stupid truck and massive amounts of arduous awfulness it comes time to head back to the main complex and return to some semblance of normalcy  I park the bosss truck in the bosss reserved spot boss leaves and I start taking care of things that need to be done Putting the bosss work truck back is on the list but not the topI return about an hour later to an empty parking spot These work trucks do not have keys Super Someone stole my bosss truck that Im responsible for We were somewhere where anyone not working in the same place wouldnt have access to the truck so it wasnt in a chop shop Being optimistic which never works out well for me I walk across the street to MAJ Douches office MAJ Douche knew I was coming to him with this truck and maybe he saw it and just took it back saving me an errand NopeMAJ Douche shifts into maximumoverdouche and tries to take a page from the instructors handbook  So after an obscenely condescending Igotyounowfucker speech he essentially denies having the truck I gleaned he did and was hiding it to teach me a lesson and smugly sends me on my way because if I dont find it Im done for Figure it out I am in no moodSo instead of panicking and running around on the impossible scavenger hunt like he expected as he chuckled his way back to his office I walk my ass straight to the complexs police station we have our own cops Not security guards Arrest power throw your ass in jail cops I find two cops and explain the situation I tell them Im in the management course and MAJ douche has issued a learning challenge of sorts and Im supposed to figure out how to properly handle it  The senior cop laughs and says MAJ Douche I fucking hate that guy Were inI watched from a comfortable distance as the cops roll in and smugly say they are investigating grand theft auto and he was the prime suspect and in a world of hurt  Quivering and sweating he threw out his side of the story and the cops played it better than I could have imagined This went on for  glorious minutes Eventually he led them to his locked hiding place and all was wellThe big boss walked out of his building and asked me what the hell was going on I explained how I was overcoming a training related challenge and told the story He laughed and we stood together and watched the rest of the drama unfold  The cops left and I walked over Hey sir I see we got the truck back Good news huh He glared and stormed off I throw in a Sir isnt that what I should have done with a stolen vehicle He slams the door  I engaged smug face myself and turned back across the road I know technically I did have the truck stolen from me and Im an asshole But technically in that situation one would report it to the cops He started the technically game and I saw it through,Coworker threatens to ruin career if I dont play his mindfuck game I play by the rules Different outcome than expected for coworker,2153,pettyrevenge,top_all
SoonerE,146,539,1o813r,1528,I was inspired by a previous post by a parent who got some sweet revenge on his kids in the storeIll preface this by saying that Im a single father of  kids  at home   in college   I get home from work a few nights ago and everyone is lounging on the couch after school and eating snacks and having a grand old time  I came home as I usually do ready to cook dinner and eat with my children  I immediately notice the sink overflowing with dishes the dryer full of clothes floor needs swept etc  Each has their set chores to do every day  So I started cleaning the kitchen kid s chore today while they said Hi Dad and just continued on their merry way  Then went and done a load of laundry kid s chore  You get the drift  This went on for about an hour until one of them said Dad Im hungry what are we going to eat  Oh  eat you say  That sounds like my chore  I dont have time to do my chores children Im too busy doing yours  This is as Im finishing the last chore and sitting down with a sandwich and a glass of tea  House clean and ready to watch some baseball  The chores were done the next day when I got home  Funny how that works  ,Oh Its no chore day I had no idea,2067,pettyrevenge,top_all

Carnephex,172,253,148etz,1508,Okay a little while back I was an HVAC technician working for a company here in the limp wang of the country Florida While schlepping myself around repairing installing duct taping and in general making shit happen in a all together too sweaty living Ive met many different kinds of people Some love it when you show up because theyre sweaty and miserable and they know youll make them as frosty as an ice queen by the time you blow out of there and others just fucking hate you because you happen to be the avatar of their cheapness come to visit them in their hour of defeatNow when installing an AC system legally you need to have it inspected by the County or City Building Dept Usually these inspections are cursory at best and a real bear if youve drawn a pissed off inspector Or if not pissed off someone looking for a bribethis is Florida bribery is a part of lifeThis day I drew a man looking for a bigger than normal bribe Typically its  This guy wanted  Shit my takehome on the job was only  and I wasnt about to split that with an overzealous asshole with a clipboard I refused to pay and he struck my inspection card with the big red pen This meant that he found everything incorrectly installed even if he didnt look The miserable fuck This meant I had to reapply for another inspection at the first ones free So this asshole had cost me time AND money This meant vengeance So I waited a couple weeks and followed him home from a busy day of gouging blue collar guys plying their trade skills I still hadnt formulated what I wanted to do to him but it was going to be fucking rude Thankfully he lived alone on a busy street but not many other houses and some long lines of sight Perfect So I watched and waited hearing stories from other guys about him The numbers never changed really except they got more expensive the bigger the job That fuck When he left for work one morning and I didnt have anything to do I slipped on my coveralls with the City Public Works Dept logo slapped on the back and did the measuring on his windows and doors Wood framed house no siding that stuck out too far good strong timbers Perfect Took note of where his water meter was and checked what type of electrical meter system he had All easily accessible I worked a few construction sites over the next few weeks and collected some sheets of leftover plywood Not the lightweight stuff but heavy fire rated sheathing The sheets I cut to size from the measurements I took earlier on I stowed these pieces one by one and collected a few other things Finally the day of reckoning had come Id had another runin with that greedy fuck and again I refused to pay the exorbitant bribe rates That was the last fucking straw I waited until the next week which was a government holiday  day weekend that sort of thing Either way the very places hed need to call would be closed to deal with the shitstorm that was coming He trundled off to work that morning while I was watching from down the road in a rented white pickup truck filled with precut wood and my framing tools Again I was in my faux city coveralls and hard hat I backed the truck right up and started setting the wood panels around the house corresponding to their measurements Once those were set up I started whacking them in with the framer as fast as I could with plenty of extra nails Windows and doors front and back Boarded up as tight as you could please Then I moved on to the electrical meter can and pulled that free padlocking the panel shut Then it was off to the water meter which I shut down and detached That was padlocked shut too The meters went into a cardboard box and into the truck For the coup de grace I slapped up Building Condemned by Court Order and Caution Hazardous Materials Within sticker signs on the plywood window covers and a faked but real court order on the front door declaring the house unsafe because of methamphetamine production You come across this kind of stuff in the course of your days doing construction and if you find extras why not grab emI then cleaned up my work made sure everything looked kosher and hauled ass for a Publix sub I needed to be back there to watch the festivities After getting lunch and ditching the extra tools back at the house I chilled out and sat in a parking lot down the road with a pair of binoculars and a good book I didnt wait long as my target came home early and was completely floored at seeing his house boarded up with those horrid green and orange stickers all over the place I watched him call the cops and when they showed up there was much pointing at the signs and eventually they left without pulling the wood off The court order looked way too real and the Clerks office was already gone for the weekend so there wasnt anyone to confirm it was a fake This was part of the plan I watched him try to pull the wood off and since I used way too many nails he just couldnt do it I smiled so hard I thought my face would crack It was beautiful watching that man have a breakdown in his front yard enjoying the schadenfreude from a half mile away Poetry I drove away after watching for as long as I dared and spent the weekend enjoying life and doing service calls I still smile when I think of that day The inspector was fired a couple years later by the city when people started really bitching about the bribery accusations tldr Guy wanted a bribe pissed me off I condemned his house,Not petty but industrial strength revenge Do not fuck with men with nailguns and plywood Long,1761,pettyrevenge,top_all

jeedee,77,401,1hfbe9,1455,The office park that my office is situated in has pretty limited parking Each office suite has a handful of spaces and theyre clearly labelled Typically each office suite has a couple of spaces right outside the door and then another few spaces in the middle of the car park If you use all of your parking spaces you have to park half a mile away on the main road and walk back so it pays to get in early enough to grab a space Theres enough space behind the spaces in front of the offices to park a car without blocking the car park if you park sideways behind two cars ie blocking two cars in but not stopping other cars driving around which is what the postman delivery drivers etc do Some offices use this knowledge to provide an extra parking space as youre just blocking in your coworkers cars and they can easily get you to move if they need to get out My office is in the corner of the office park We have a space next to the wall and the space next to that The next couple of spaces are obviously allocated to the office next door I usually get in early enough to grab the space next to the wall Now the office next door is the regional HQ for a small company and they often have people from other offices visiting As theyre not familiar with the parking arrangements it isnt unusual for us to find that one of their visitors has taken one of our spaces In that case wed just knock on their office door and ask the owner of the car to come out and move it It happened so often that the landlord put a sign on the door of their office to remind visitors that they have to park in assigned parking spaces if were having visitors we make sure we leave a space for them as there are only a couple of visitors parking spaces for the whole office park and theyre always takenSo one day I get in early and park in the corner space next to the wall Lunchtime rolls around and I have to run some errands so I pick up some lunch while Im out with the intention of eating it in the office I got back to work to find that someone from the office next door has taken my space while Im out I recognised the car straight away  it was one of their salesmen Hes a real arsehole totally full of himself thinks the world revolves around him etc You know the type It isnt the first time or even the tenth time that hes taken one of our spaces eitherI dont want to have to drive right down the road and walk back and I can see him standing outside the office next door smoking and talking to someone I shout excuse me He ignores me I shout excuse me again Still nothing I beep my car horn That gets his attention He turns round and I ask him if he can move his car He says in a minute points to his cigarette which by the look of it hed only just lit and turns back to his conversation I say excuse me again and get ignored again I beep my car horn again He turns to look at me I point out that theres assigned parking and I need to get back to work He shrugs tells me hell only be a minute and turns his back on me againObviously trying to reason with him isnt working and I wasnt going to sit around on the car park for another few minutes He could have moved his car out of my space and parked behind the two spaces allocated to the office that he was visiting but hed rather inconvenience me so I reversed my car right up to the wall blocking him and one of my coworkers in I got out of my car and he demanded that I get back in my car and wait as hed only be another few minutes I told him that I needed to get back to work and that he could knock on the door when he was ready and Id come back out and move TWENTY MINUTES later glad I wasnt still in my car there was a knock on the door One of my coworkers answered it and came to tell me that I needed to move my car Now usually Id be straight out but as this person was a repeat offender had ignored me turned his back on me when I was asking him to move his car and had talked down to me when Id parked I decided to make him wait I told me coworker to tell him that I was on a call and that Id be out in a minute Half an hour later I went out and moved my car to find him pacing backwards and forwards and complaining that hed missed a meeting on the other side of the city I told him that he should only park where hes allowed to park as per the sign on the door to the office that he was visiting that hed been told several times before and that he could have moved his car when Id asked him to earlier He never parked in our spaces again,Steal my parking space and ignore me Miss your meeting,1856,pettyrevenge,top_all

HorribleHistories,244,523,1mnhz1,1398,My sister and I mostly get along now being in college and living three states apart plays a large role but we absolutely hated each other while we were growing up She was selfish and irresponsible with a quick temper She would frequently borrow my possessions then hurl them at me in anger when I wanted them back She was careless with her own things and would often steal mine to replace what shed destroyed It wasnt uncommon for her to intentionally break something of mine when I made it clear that I wasnt going to cave in and give it up without a fight She was a nasty piece of work and was unfortunately encouraged albeit passively by our exhausted parents refusal to come to my aid when I was treated unfairly My sister had been a problem child since she was in diapers at home that is  she knew better than to melt down in the presence of other people and they were just too worn out to care what she did to me unless I was left bloody or bruised Id long before grown wise to her selfishness and thieving ways by the time I reached high school Id established good hiding places in my room for some smaller valuable things and was shrewd about keeping these things from her sight and reach My clothes and shoes were always up for grabs though and shed even go through my underwear drawer and take what she wanted My cosmetics and toiletries werent really mine Shed stopped hurling things for the most part as a teenager but still had her eyes peeled for anything she wanted for her own Our birthdays are in the same month and our parents often bought us the same gifts when we were younger so that we wouldnt squabble over who had what But as I said she wouldnt take care of her things and would steal mine to replace what she had lost or broken Living with her was horrible During my freshman year and her junior year she signed up to go on a weekend trip to the mountains with the youth group from our church I had no interest in it and couldnt see why she did The boys were okay but the girls were stuckup and Id witnessed them ignoring my sister when she followed them like a lost puppy I imagined a trip with the group would be a lonely one for her Our birthdays were a month or so before the trip and we had found favor with the birthday fairy We both received  Mastercard or Visa gift cards from our childless aunt and uncle who have no other nieces or nephews to spend money on Our parents let us pick out our gifts from them I chose an mp player to replace the one Id had for years that now had a nonworking volume control My new toy was the same model but had twice the memory I set aside the old one to see if my dad could fix it and use it My sister chose some suede boots and gave me strict orders to stay away from them I remember feeling really angry about that considering all the things shed taken from me She took my moms advice and saved her gift card for the church tripAfter Mom had dropped my sister off at church to get on a bus for the long drive she suggested that we go shopping with my gift card I wanted to but had some trouble finding it It wasnt in the drawer in my vanity where I knew Id put it and I searched my room for several minutes before it hit me I knew I just knew I went straight to my sisters room and opened the tacky rhinestone box on her bookshelf It was her money box and my gift card was in it I knew it was mine because one of the groups of numbers was the last four digits of my friends phone number and another group was my birth year Id noted this when I first received the card and looked at it My sister had stolen my gift card from my room and was probably going to pass it off as hers after using hers up My sister had done a lot of nasty things to me and had taken a lot from me Not just my possessions but shed chipped away at my dignity over the years and left me without any selfconfidence But this insult stealing my birthday gift right out from under my nose is what I still consider to be the worst The icing on the crap cake was that I couldnt tell my parents Theyd stopped listening to my complaints and pleas when my sisters everyday bad behavior became too much for them to stand It was easier to just ignore it When my mom and I went shopping I didnt bother getting anything that my sister could make use of I knew shed just take what she wanted Shes taller than me and has an inseam at least three inches longer so I bought some jeans that I liked and knew would be too short for her I also treated myself to a couple of bras any bras that would fit me would overwhelm her wee attributes I love makeup but didnt bother going to the mall counters because my sister frequently raided my makeup bag and used my stuff even the germy things like mascara I wanted to get things that would be mine and only mineNow heres where the sun comes out She was in a right snit when my parents and I picked her up at church the following week She was still flaming mad about opening her bag when she got to the hotel and finding that the shampoo shed packed MY shampoo natch had a loose cap and had spilled all over her clothes and some other things She accused me of going into her bag and fiddling with the bottle so it would leak I didnt go into her bag but I did loosen the cap on all my hair care and body wash bottles before she left and then tighten them again after shed gone I knew shed take some of my stuff with her and I was getting the sticky results Id wanted I denied it of course Hotel staff had to take her clothes down to the laundry room and throw them in the washer This was mortifying to her She sobbed and screamed at me for what I had done Then she regained her composure long enough to tell me that I wasnt nearly as clever as I thought I was Ill never forget the selfsatisfied smirk on her face as she told me that she had used my gift card to buy tshirts and snacks for her friends and threw away my new shampoocoated mp player as soon as she took it from her bag Mom confused piped up before I could with the news that I had used up every cent of my gift card at the mall and that Id been using my new mp player all weekend My sister snapped back at her that it was my old player Id been using and I took great delight in setting her straight She had a total meltdown when she realized shed cost herself a  shopping spree and had not actually destroyed my property Mom and Dad for once were having none of it and shut her down pretty quickly when she tearfully demanded I hand over my mp player as a consolation prize She was still a jerk after that but was never as bad after the wind was knocked from her sails Mom and Dad started sticking up for me tooJusticeEDIT Im sorry about the overall length and the fatness of the paragraphs I hope its not a problem,My selfish thief of a sister helps me get revenge on her,1921,pettyrevenge,top_all

appledap,150,1010,1lwvy4,1401,My favorite way to finish while fucking my lovely wife is  once she has had her fill of orgasms  I like to flip her on her back on the edge of the bedcountercouchwashing machinerocking horse and cup her thick ass in my hands and thrust angrily until Im ready to burst and pull out and let er fly Oftentimes the result is a respectable shot across her breasts or an adequate belly button filler Sometimes if I havent cum in a day or two Ill land a couple drops on her face and neck Needless to say my cumshots are quite variable depending on a lot of things  arousal time since my last orgasm level of hydration etcA few weeks ago we were wrapping up a quickie in the shower and my wife starts begging me for my cum Usually this is her polite way of letting me know that she has had her fun and I had better hurry the fuck up before the river runs dry Still please cum on my face has a better ring to it than cant you cum or similar so Im pretty thankful she has a good way about her Besides if I am in the zone and Im still a ways off begging me to cum on your face is akin to donning a top hat and waving a magic wand  here I cum I pull out she kneels down in front of me and I cum Sort of Now in my defense I was terribly dehydrated from working hard all week and this was my rd orgasm of the day thanks palmala handerson About a half load dribbled out and landed on her cheek She grabbed my crank and rubbed the cum around on her face a little I could tell what she was thinking though Wow she said that wasnt very much She had to needle me of course its just the way she is I guess I would do the same to herSorry I said not really feeling all that bad about it dehydrated I guess Well dont let it happen again Mr was her reply in a fake stern sounding voice We laughed and cuddled under the hot stream of water My playfully vindictive side however was plotting It wont happen again I thought because next time Im going at you like a forest fire I didnt dare tip my hand though as I wanted the element of surpriseSo began my mission to drown my wife in cum I did research and found a few supplements that supposedly increased cum volume I masturbated constantly  in the car the bathroom at work on fair rides Not to completion though just enough to almost cum and then let up for a bit I spaced my orgasms out to every other day and then every third day I drank water All Day Long I mustve peed every  minutes Whenever we did fuck I made sure she didnt see my loads  in her ass crack after doggy on her ass cheek during cowgirl For weeks I kept this routine going I was completely dedicated to my mission leave no sperm behind I noticed my spunk volume was up Way up Like triple what I normally produced And it was becoming a nuisance I had to switch from klenex to paper towels and then from paper towels to bath towels  and then beach blankets I was like a ketchup dispenser at a busy fast food joint I decided it was time I let my trouser snake lay dormant for a few days knowing that would antagonize him into a frenzyFinally we made love Well actually its hard to call it making love when one of the parties involved is planning to secretly release a cum tidal wave on their lovers village She may have thought we were making love but I knew I was going to try and fuckwaterboard her It started innocently enough a simple shower as our kids watched Busytown We loved throwing on a cartoon and sneaking away to the bathroom to fuck quietly But this time my intentions were secretly very sinister Grab a couple extra towels I said Youre going to need them I whispered but she didnt hear meWe fondled as we adjusted to the steamy setting As we faced each other I picked up her leg and entered her slowly When she had time to adjust to my slow in and out I pressed her up against the wall and thrusted more aggressively My pounding was driving her crazy She loves getting fucked hard and fast but with us standing she can only get to the edge of her orgasm and she just plateaus over and over in agonizing fashion Fucking sit down she grunted So I sat And she climbed on top of me and was bouncing up and down in quick succession Fast and shallow slow and deep she alternates She knows how to satisfy her dark passenger and wastes no time Soon enough she is thrashing and grunting and slipping all over the placeShe barely had time to come back down to reality before I had flipped her over with her hands on the floor and I was entering her from behind My hands grabbed and pulled her hips into my body faster and faster until she said the magic words cum cum on me cum on my face  Well allow me to retort  It was like a crack of thunder followed by a monsoon Stream after stream of hot cum flew out of me The first bundle was met with a shocked gasp her eyes blinked as if they couldnt believe what they were seeing The next shot was even bigger and she started laughing uncontrollably as she fell over backwards attempting to avoid enemy fire I was quicker though and was able to adjust strafing my flow in her direction pinning her into the corner of the shower stall When it was all said and done she was laughing so hard she couldnt catch her breath laying on the floor of the shower with her hands trying to fend off my charge and I was standing over her a la Muhammed Ali standing over Sonny ListonSorry I said sarcasticallyedit  thanks for the feedback guysgals  it appears some people feel that this type of story doesnt belong here  i was going to xpost another couple of similar stories i submitted to

FranzJosephWannabe,86,337,1hv4wt,1339,So I thought Id share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago Be forewarned this is a serious wall of text comingAs anyone who has worked in retail knows you will always have at least a few quirky regulars who come in to your store Sometimes its a good kind of quirky like She bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in Sometimes however its a bad kind of quirky This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirkyThis customer not his real name but well call him Mr Rogers because I always thought he looked like he could be Mr Rogers evil twin brother had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about  min before we close This would happen every time he came Now when doing a water test back then it would take a couple of minutes we didnt have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals We were doing oldfashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything Normally it didnt take too long but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night Not to mention it can be a messy process meaning wed have to clean everything again before we close upHe would come in get his water tested ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions Mr Rogers Does the Turboshock come in a  lb bucket Me No sorry it just comes in  lb Mr Rogers Why Me  and tap impatiently waiting for everything making me feel like I was defusing a bomb Most of the time we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after but seeing his car pull up at  was enough to turn an ok day into a fullon panic attackSo one day I was at a highschool soccer game when who do I happen to see but Mr Rogers He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didnt notice that I was there His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr High team and he was there to see her I debated whether or not to say anything to him but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was And then completely by accident I overheard him talking to one of his friendsMr Rogers told his friend what he thought was the secret to getting good service at any place He claimed that by coming in at the last minute right before they closed he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs Mr Rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail After all he said why should they get rewarded if I dont get the best possible service He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows for a fact that this technique worksI thought about confronting him right then and there but I managed to restrain myself By the time the  minutes were up in the match I had already formulated the basis of a planThe next day I went to my manager the sweet older lady from my last post and told her about what I had overheard She was furious She wanted to refuse him service shred his file and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit and she agreedThe next time Mr Rogers came into the store of course at  til closing we made sure to treat him like a king We gave his water sample every test under the sun Ph Alkalinity Calcium Free Chlorine Total Chlorine Copper Iron Phosphates Total Dissolved Solids and many many more No test was too obscure for Mr Rogers When he asked why we were doing so many tests we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect We wanted no stone left unturned But my water is clear protested Mr Rogers No no we just want it to stay that way After all we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight So we continued to do tests all the while his foot was tapping tapping tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall We found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately We advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness We discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system Then we talked about Baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the Chlorine But Im not It looks great We took him on a minitour of some of our newer stock explaining in excruciating detail how it all worksFinally when I started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use he made it very clear that he had had enough By now it was well past closing time We had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago He was trapped and he knew it He looked at me and my manager and asked why are you doing this Why are you taking so long And why are you talking to me about things I dont care about My manager looked him in the eye and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice she said We just want to give you the best possible serviceIt took a second but then he got it Someone had let his secret slip His foot stopped tapping and the only thing that he could say was Oh So we decided the torture was over We let him go after that And while he did continue to come to our store and get excellent service I might add he no longer came  minutes to closingIt was one of the only times Ive ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career I will always treasure that momentTLDR Guy comes in  minutes before closing to get better service So we gave him the best service of his life as a form of torture,We just want to give you the best possible service xpost from rTalesFromRetail,1676,pettyrevenge,top_all

Mosvicious,86,372,1k7utf,1320,Alright this didnt happen to me but I did witness it This happened when I just started working on towboats I was a greenhand along with another guy We had just both came from deckhand school and were both put on the same towboat Having already spent two weeks in school we werent given anytime to go do any shopping or anything else So we were put on the boat with pretty much the same stuff as we came to deckhand class with minus what we used during the classThe lead man on deck we will call him LM was a pretty cool guy and always wore overalls Always The greenhand that was put on the vessel with me we will call him Bum So Bum and LM both chewed tobacco and Bum was quickly running out of his remaining tobacco in the first week and we still had  weeks to go before we got to go homeLM was a pretty cool guy and told Bum that since it was his first hitch that he wouldnt mind sharing his chewing tobacco with him but only for this first hitch He told him that he understood that he didnt know how much to bring since this was his first time being out here but that next hitch he would have to bring enough for the entire four weeks or he is on his own Bum quickly agreed and expressed thanksSo next  weeks went by uneventful Bum and I went home Two weeks later we were back out there again This time Bum barely brought more tobacco than he did the previous time and was out of chewing tobacco halfway through his hitch He started bumming off of LM again LM was a cool guy but I could tell he was upset about it So one day we are on the head of tow at the furthest end from the vessel on the barges or unit of barges we push and we are about to make a lock Its just me and LM at the head He is helping me make the lockHe told me had a plan to get Bum to stop bumming It was near watch change so Bum was coming out to relieve me The first thing Bum ask for is a chew from LM LM agreed and pulled out a bag of chewing tobacco that was nearly empty save for one last chew Bum was kinda hesitant about taking his last chew but LM insisted saying it wasnt a problem It didnt take long for Bum to lose his guilt about taking LMs chew and took his last chew from that bag As soon as Bum started chewing LM immediately pulled out a brand new bag and opened it up With Bum watching LM pissed into the bag and sealed it back up Bum asked him what the hell he was doing LM simply told him that his grandfather had told him when he was a kid that if you pissed in a fresh bag of chew it will keep it fresher longer Bum immediately started vomiting on the barge LM later told me that it was worth wasting a bag of chew for that and Bum never did ask for any more chew from himTLDR Guy doesnt bring enough of his own chew and ends up getting pranked,And thats how you get someone to quit bumming your tobacco,1692,pettyrevenge,top_all

neenerneenerboo,69,495,1qw75b,1272,Sorry this is long But oh so sweet This guy that went to my high school Jimmy was the absolute worst He was the typical asshole jockeveryone let him get away with shit But I acted cordial around him because we shared mutual friends and classes I would sometimes call him out in a teasing way so he thought we were even friends My main beef with him was the way he treated girls Though Jimmy wasnt very attractive he coasted on popularity and our school was very small with more girls than boys He mostly preyed on underclassmen my first interaction with him was turning him down as a freshman because he seemed creepy but he was a great charmer and manipulator when he wanted to be so I witnessed over and over again as hed suck in one of my friends who would be convinced that hes changed for her and being genuinely nice this time and then turn on the assholery once she was emotionally invested He dated one of my friends Jane who is the sweetest person in the world She was going through some tough times at home with a prolonged family illness and Jimmy just would not give her a break Telling her shes gaining weight flirting with other girls in front of her general toying of her emotions You could tell she was super stressed out and finally she broke up with him Wahoo But it didnt end there We had assigned seats in computer class and I sat between Jimmy and Janes sister Beth who is equally sweet On the other side of Jimmy sat all of his jock friends close to Mr Teachers desk so he could try to keep them in check where they would act obnoxious and talk loud so that the whole room could hear about how awesome they were Right after the breakup Jimmy talked about how hes over it and already has a few public school sluts lined up lols private school lifethis was the equivalent of having a girlfriend you met on vacation so she lives in a different city and other stuff that was really disrespectful to Jane and it seemed very intentionally done in front of Beth who was not a confrontational person I plotted Jimmy was very insecure about his intelligence Since he was put in the spotlight so often it was easy to see that while he could get an A at getting girls to send him nudes he struggled academically So I left lunch early one day to get in the computer room before everyone else I hooked up an extra mouse and keyboard into his computer pulling the cords behind and underneath the desk so that the mouse and board could rest hidden under my pullout keyboard there was a lot of hidden room they sat just out of view above my own keyboard Jimmy made a loud and unnecessary entrance as usual but when he tried to log in to his computer to start the assignment he just could not get it right This is because I would sneakily tap a key as he would type in his student password He tries a few more times before yelping for help from Mr Teacher who looks annoyed after typing in Jimmys information just fine Maybe you had your password wrong he says but Jimmy is insistent that he isnt that stupid and something is wrong with the computer I tormented Jimmy for weeks pushing the extra keyboard and mouse as far up as I could to hide it in between classes He would put his mouse icon over a button and then Id slightly wiggle my extra mouse before he clicked on it infuriating Jimmy that he could not select something Inputting passwords and other information was often impossible His documents were full of typos He would type a word and I would just press one letter to throw him off and then hed try again only for the same thing to happen Pretty soon he just used spellcheck instead but rightclicking that function was difficult for him when I was paying attention Open the task manager while hes in a program Hed look away and Id close a window or document or just press backspace until he turned around I was careful to be pretty inconsistentwhen other people were looking Id back off to make him look crazy Whatever hed been trying to do would always work when Jimmy called the teacher over My movements were minute and mixed in seamlessly as I typed on my real keyboard I started to punish him this way Wandering eye Wandering mouse while hes trying to play a game Distracted as he bragged to his friend about texting with that naïve freshman Oh look his PowerPoint text boxes somehow all got rearranged Ignore new girlfriend because its funny Unexpected shutdown because losing unsaved work is funnier One time he tried to reset a password where the characters are replaced with dots for privacy and I put a number at the end of his new password and the same thing when he confirmed the password This new password then didnt work and he couldnt reset it again without knowing the current password Jimmy was going nuts but it was all so subtle that his complaints made him look like a crazy person who didnt know how to use a computer He insisted over and over again that something was wrong with the computer His assignments took longer so he had less time to horse around with his friends People started to talk about how irritable and unpleasant he was during computer class and people would even tease him about not being able to use technology if he had any problems with his iPhone or anything One time when I was sure that no one else was looking and Jimmy didnt even have his hands on anything I wiggled the mouse slightly back and forth as he stared at the screen His eyes widen and he shouts Look interrupting Mr Teachers lecture I stop It was doing it My mouse was moving and I wasnt even doing anything We all look at each other in disbelief over Jimmys delusions as he keeps yelling myself and Beth included although we were laughing on the inside giddy at the thought of telling Jane later about Jimmys meltdown Thats it Mr Teacher said worn thin over Jimmys incompetence No one else is having problems with that computer Youre just not compatible I guess Move to that one He points to a computer far away from his buddies and any other students which is usually used by people giving presentations or student teachers Jimmy protests suggesting Mr Teacher just fix it but at this point Jimmy is pretty done with that computer too We werent bothered by Jimmy too much the rest of the year in that class But to my surprise Jimmy still had problems Almost all the stuff I was doing He stopped complaining since it made him look like he was just hopeless with simple tasks but he would still ask me questions about what it could be after class since he thought I was relatively good with computers One day alone in the computer room I was inspecting the computer that Jimmy used when Mr Teacher comes in He sat down at his desk and got a sly look on his face as he messed with a cordless mouse which wiggled around on Jimmys screen Wifi he explained Turned out Mr Teacher knew what I was doing all along He hated dealing with Jimmy too and distracting him meant less class disruption But after his meltdown Jimmy just raged quietly in his corner as he failed to engage his faraway friends Tldr Guy is a douche to my friend plug a secret mouse and keyboard into his computer and mess with him He goes crazy and everyone talks about it Edit for more info We had a pretty relaxed atmosphere our teacher was a young lad who just taught an easy class in order to be a coach and he was Jimmys track coach so even though Jimmy annoyed the shit out of him during class they joked around a lot At our school the real authority was with the coaches so a prank like this between them would have been a big deal He was the kind of teacher that let us spend a lot of time playing games and helped us with senior pranks as long as they were tame enough He was just a few years out of college and only really messed with jimmy when he was a disruptionJimmy really actually was bad with computers At one point he thought his MacBook was totally broken because he accidentally leaned on the dim screen button so his screen was black He would never notice anything unusual plugged into his computer I know that using Bluetooth doesnt always require a USB and it has been many years since I was in high school so perhaps thats what the teacher meantI am really not that great with that stuff myself Jimmy only thought I was good with computers because he was amazed by things like keyboard shortcuts ,The time I played with a high school player,1767,pettyrevenge,top_all

Rhode,194,530,1p4ck2,1173,So my boss is a total bitch to me  Shes a bitch to everyone but she gives it to me double because Im the only man in the department and she hates men  Shes also married to my stepmothers brother and she and my stepmother no longer get along so as they say shit rolls down hill  The revenge is a twoparter  My boss is a classic middlemanagement narcissist  She has this thing where she thinks that other people actually give a shit how much time she spends in the office which couldnt be further from the truth  So she puts in a  hour week virtually every week thinking that people see her as this great martyr thats making huge sacrifices for the good of the company  In reality we all know that her marriage is horribly broken and she is just desperate for attention and validation  But nonetheless it absolutely kills her if shes ever not the first person in the office each morning  So I come in early  It makes sense for me to come in early  Were in Chicago traffic is brutal here I like to get a head start  So Im here at  AM every day and about once a week Im here by about  just to stick it to her  To compensate for me being here early shes now here at  most days which is madness because her drive is at least  minutes even without traffic  Then she stays here past  PM to miss the evening rush hour while I leave at   Like I said its just madness the work we do here is not important at all  The second part of my revenge is great because Ive been doing it forever and shes only just now starting to figure it out  The first thing I do every day is run a report the details of the report arent important for this story   I log in to our system generate this report export it to excel clean up the formatting and then send it out to the department  The whole thing only takes about  minutes but my idiot boss thinks it takes longer  Not only that but she actually thinks shes helping to do it When she was trained on the system and they showed her how to run this report they taught her to set a bunch of filters to reduce the size of the report  I figured out right away that the filters just slow everything down and make the system run slow  So what my boss does is she runs the report on the system with all the filters in place and it takes forever like  minutes and then she saves it on a shared drive thinking that I then take her file and run with it from there  But in reality I just run the whole thing myself and never touch her file  Running the report without the filters takes only seconds so its so much easier to just do it that way and then remove the stuff you dont want once youre in excel  By the time she gets done running it on the system Ive already got it in excel and Im almost finished with it  But every day without fail shes been dutifully saving this report for me on the shared drive and once saved that file never gets opened again  This has been going on for years and she has no idea  Recently however shes had a couple of early morning conference calls and has been late getting the file on to the shared drive  I didnt know that though because I dont ever bother to even look for it  When she realized that I had completed the report without her assistance she actually got mad at me  Youve got to understand this woman has a bonafide personality disorder she needs constant validation  That I could do something without her help diminishes her value and therefore makes her mad  It was like she didnt even know that I could run the reports on my own  So she came over to me in rage and told me she wasnt going to run the report anymore and that Im just wasting her time  I played innocent and used my boyish charmI always do shes clueless Oh gosh Im sorry Sandie I took her abuse while laughing at her on the inside  Its been a few days now she hasnt quit running the report for me  Every day that file has still showed up on the shared drive she genuinely thinks shes doing important work  Its greatTLDR Asshole boss wastes her time every day generating a file no one ever touches  ,Be a complete bitch to me for no reason Thats cool here lets just waste a bunch of your time first thing in the morning every day for the rest of the time I work here,1703,pettyrevenge,top_all

gasmaskrevenge,232,469,1dsm7k,1174,TLDR Got violent drug dealers arrested after shooting my TV via gas bombsI found this subreddit and I dont know where else to put this story I dont really consider it petty revenge but dammit if I dont get a warm and fuzzy feeling thinking about itAfter my second year in college a friend and I moved in with another friend He was renting a  bedroom house in a lower income area so it was pretty cheap It was fairly close to the university campus and as all three of us were attending we were able to work it out where it would be a whole lot cheaper living there than on campus The neighborhood itself wasnt bad at all It was mostly other kids elderly folks and a few others here and there Everyone in the neighborhood was pretty relax and chill except for our fucking neighbors Well call them Walter and JesseNow Walter and Jesse were brothers and entrepreneurs of sorts They ran a small inhome business selling product in niche market that required very little advertisement They were meth cooks and dealers Obnoxious loud violent drug dealers Everyone hated them but nobody would say anything about it due to the constant threats they would make while strung out from there front yardWe pretty much fell in line at first They would blast music and porn from there house from am until am Wed hear screaming matches at there house that became full blown fights on their lawn Huge fucking parties that would go on for days And to our chagrin we ignored it allWell up arrives march and my income tax comes in I only get about  but goddammit thats my  dollars and Im gonna fucking buy something for me Everything has gone to college and bills and I want to splurge I go out and buy a  LCD TV Its a VIZIO but its the first HDTV Ive ever had My friends and I set it up and oh boy did we have fun that week And only that week for thats as long as I had itThe Meth bros decide theyre gonna shoot their BB gun at whatever the fuck they can see At birds bushes fences and especially windows Well one little BB decided to go straight through my window and hit my TV cracking it while I was playing some MW My face dropped and I heard laughing Which then immediately turned to death threats if I called the cops Now I know they had real guns They had no issue showing them to anyone who looked at themMy friends and I were all disappointed at the turn of events And both of them had submitted to not doing anything about it But nay not I The one time I purchased me a bit of joy in my life I grew up fairly poor it was taken away from me So I plotted And I plotted And I plotted some more And an evil plot I did accomplishI saved up every gatorade bottle I purchased for about  weeks And every other day I would go to a different store and purchase pool cleaning tablets and rubbing alcohol at a different one all with cash of course Now some of you might see whats going And youd be right I had about  bottles saved up And I made some spectacular chlorine gas bombsI waited for a night when both of them were gone It was about three in the morning so virtually everyone was asleep I had prepared the gatorade bottles with the alcohol prior so I started loading the tablets into the bottles and throwing them over the fence Since I didnt break down the tablets it took a while for them to go off I was able to get them all over the fence before the first one went boom And boom they wentI go back inside and into my room I hear them going off BOOM BOOM One of my roommates wakes up and goes WHAT THE FUCKBOOM He wakes my other roommate his room was closer and there both freaking out BOOM Time to put my game face on I scramble on out of there and react visibly scared BOOM I look at them and tell them to call the cops BOOM BOOM He calls  and tells the cops he hears explosions I go outside and pretend to look like Im trying to find out whats going on BOOM I tell my friend that its coming from next door BOOM He tells me that the cops have already been sent to the area by a previous caller BOOM BOOM I tell him theres a bunch of smoke coming from outside BOOM They tell us to stay inside BOOM The last one goes off We close the doors and watch the mayhem unfold Right before the cops come the Heisenbros show up freaking out Right as they go inside about  cop cars show up and go through the front door The officers haul them away and we go outside They question us we tell them what we know As far as the chlorine gas is concerned It has already wafted into the atmosphere They came back a couple days later and asked us questions specifically about the brothers We told them what we heard about them and how they acted what they did The officer left and that was the last time I talked about it Nobody knows about what I did but me And it was the happiest weve been in a long timeThe last I heard about them they were doing hard time for their drug ring being in possession of illegal firearms and human trafficking

Coffeegorilla,81,274,1ibcks,1168,   Many MANY years ago Im old Sixth grade me was walking home from school during the wintery month of December  I was not a popular child but even if I had been it wouldnt have mattered for there was this gang of  eighth grade boys that were just jerks  They picked on everyone and today during my cold walk home they decided to pick on me  I had  blocks to walk in the cold and snow to get home and for the entirety of those blocks those four jerks threw snowballs at me specifically at my face  I couldnt run anywhere the snow in the yards was too deep so I had to walk with my head down slowly starting to cry while these four guys kept about twenty feet ahead of me constantly throwing snowballs  By the time I got to the walk leading to my driveway I was a wreck tears and snot frozen to my face the inside of my jacket all wet from snow melting down the inside  My dad was outside shoveling he saw what the boys were doing and started yelling at them to leave me alone  They started to run and as they ran in frustration I bent down and picked up a large chuck of ice and salt and slush along the curb the kind of chunk that had fallen off a car  I hurled this chunk in a large arc not at the boys just in the air in frustration  The leader lets call him Mike took this moment to stop turn around and start laughing Ha ha Coffeegorilla you puss  Im sure he was going to say pussy but I wouldnt know because that ice chunk I hurled into the air hit him directly in the face causing him to slip on the ice and fall on his back with a huge thunk  Immediately I felt better  My dad started laughing and Mike got up nose bloody and sort of screamcried at my dad to stop laughing at him which only made my dad laugh harder  Mike sort of shuffle ran home and my Dad took me inside  There is no way I could have hit Mike if I tried as I am the least athletic person in the history of ever but hes the one who stopped to turn around for one last dig and put himself directly in the path of my ice chunk  So perhaps this wasnt petty revenge but damnit if I dont smile when I think of it especially around Christmas  ,Not exactly revenge because I wasnt trying but instant karma to be sure,1442,pettyrevenge,top_all
Raregan,222,320,1i5acp,1177,A few years ago when I was in Comprehensive School High School for you nonbrits there was this horrible little kid called Andrew He was your typical bully He would make sly remarks towards people trying to provoke them into fights He was constantly vying for attention from everybody due to his own insecure issues I assume Everyday on the way home from school I would walk for about half a mile to this bus stop where I would sit and wait for my mother to come and pick me up It was the worst time of the day Andrew and all his horrible friends would always walk past and feel the need to say something horrible to me to try and get me to react I would just ignore them as I was never the bravest outgoing kid and the idea of a fight really scared me One Thursday he and his little group of social rejects decided to stop and intimidate me while I was at the bus stop They would do this from time to time there seemed to be no coherence to it They must of just got the urge to make my life miserable for those few minutes The usual insults started lanky nerdy gay This went on for a few minutes until Andrew came up to my face and spat on me He had always been mean to people but I had never experienced anything like that before I had no idea how to react His friends were all egging me on the punch him as they clearly wanted to see him kick my ass but I was too in shock to really do anything They left shortly afterwards as I wiped my face furiously I got in the car with my mother when she arrived shortly after went home and locked myself in my bedroom and just cried I had never felt that humiliated and weak in my lifeThe next day was a Friday and we had to finish off our IT Coursework for that year For those of you who might not know IT is basically a dumbed down version of Computer Science It involves a little bit of Word and Excel but nothing too strenuous The entire day was dedicated to us finishing this off and handing it in by the three oclock deadline I had already finished mine and just intended to sit around all day talking to friends Andrew came into the class grunting something about how he couldnt be bothered to do anything and I overheard the teacher telling him that he hadnt even started yet and needed to work hard today I knew the teacher was going to give him all the answers and basic points he needed to pass as he was from a low income background and it would look really good on the teacher if he could get him to pass This wound me up but I figured there wasnt really anything I could do about it For the actual revenge itself you have to understand the type of school I went to To put it bluntly it was crap The IT department was one room of about  computers and the teacher was a PE gym teacher who took a weekend course in Microsoft Office Nobody there knew how a computer worked and the concept of programming languages was above everyone I had meddled a little bit at home with computers but I was far from good at anything but I did know a few tricks As he was beginning his coursework typing out what the teacher had written for him I decided to try something I opened up the command line on a nearby computer and typed a shutdown command Every computers name was written on a little sticky note on the monitor so I typed his in with the relevant syntax of course pressed Enter and voila his computer shut down      I was so happy He started ranting and raving and swearing He told the teacher but the teacher must of thought Andrew was just being the little brat he was and making excuses not to work The nasty bully went on to try other computers but no matter which one he loaded up I kept shutting down his computer He was getting so furious and the brilliance was just amplified by the fact noone believed him This continued for the entire day I would sit talking to my friends notice he loaded up a computer and shut it down Sometimes I would let him get a bit of his work done and then shut it down so everything was lost He would call the teacher over to watch how it kept happening but I would just back off and not do anything Then when the teacher turned his back I would do it again At the end of the day everybody handed in their finished work and he had nothing to give in He got a  for the entire course and out of  GCSEs that he needed to get to pursue further education he got  Sometimes I feel bad for making him fail At the time I didnt know that this course was the difference between him passing and failing the entire year If I had known that I might not of done it but whenever I think about him spitting in my face and how humiliated I felt then this revenge always brings a smile to my face ,Petty Revenge against school bully,1497,pettyrevenge,top_all

ShaneL,59,215,15oarh,1170,Early in my relationship with my wife then gf we did the long distance thing She had a two bedroom apartment but was living by herself Then one of her friends needed a place so she offered up her second room I was down every other weekend and since I was working I paid the cablephoneinternet bills and always bought groceries  mainly for my wife but the roommate benefited from that as well The roommate happened to be dating a good friend of mine and he usually stayed there a couple nights a week despite having an apartment not too far away About  months into this arrangement and after returning home to massive parties several times we received a note on my wifes bedroom door It read shortened version ShaneL must pay  rent and bills since he regularly stays here I would like that amount to be returned from this months and last months rentbills My wife was definitely annoyed and shocked that she would make demands She was even more shocked that she wanted those demands to be retroactive My wife decided to write up the greatest response letter Ive ever read It saidDear RoommateI have considered your demands and have decided that it would only be fair if we both charge our house guests for their stays I also do not think it is fair that ShaneL pays our month cablephoneinternet bill and still has to pay to stay when he visits while your guests do not So I have included that bill in my calculations Rent is month Bills are month We each paid month as per our previous arrangement The new and more fair arrangement would see an increase of  to the total amount with the addition of the cablephoneinternet bill That is a total of month or day in bills On days when there are three of us staying here that is about person per day Days when there are four of us staying here it will be personLast month ShaneL stayed here  days for a total of  he owes us This month he will be here  days for a total of  he will pay for staying here Last month roommates boyfriend stayed here  days owing us  and this month he has already stayed here  days owing us  Your parents stayed for  days last month and since there were two of them the amount per person per day is  since there were four of us staying here That equals  Your mom is staying with us for  days next week for a total of So that leaves us with our portions Since we are responsible for the entire month that means our portion is day when there is only  of us here day when there is three of us here and day when there is  of us here Last month there were only  of us here for  days each  of us here for  days each for our portion and  of us here for  days each for our portion Our total portion for last month is eachThis month there will be only  of us for  days each  of us for  days each for our portion A total of eachSince we are responsible for our guests I will include their totals to our portions and you can collect from them however you like and I will collect from ShaneLThat brings your total from last month to     BF   parents My total is     ShaneLThis month your current total is     mom   BF My total is     ShaneLSince you already paid  last month and this month you only owe  which you can collect from your guests Please have the money by the end of next weekThanksNeedless to say she completely expected her roommate to move out after reading that They had been having some arguments leading up to this whole event so the roommates note was the final straw for my wife The problem is her roommate waited until rent day to give her notice that she was moving out that day expecting to get away with paying the next months rent and leaving it all on my wifes shoulders While my wife was at school her roommate moved her stuff out without a mention of where she could be reached So my wife called her roommates parents and explained the situation about a week later giving her roommate enough time to resurface That same night her roommate returned and paid her  Needless to say they are no longer friends One night shortly after we were at my friends house her bf for a party and I jokingly handed him  and said in case your gf wants us to pay cover for visiting you That was the first time he had heard the story As far as he was aware we just decided to increase her rent month for no reason Once I explained it to him we had a good laugh and I came to find out he was in the process of breaking up with her As it turns out she moved in with him and tried freeloading He kicked her out the day before the party and hadnt spoken to her since TLDR  Roommate demanded money from houseguest who was already paying bills Roommate didnt realize she had guests more often and it was explained to her using math in a way that showed she owed more money

HarryMonk,74,313,1no06s,1170,I commute about  hours to work on overcrowded trains Today I was on a later train that had people packed in like sardines in the corridor I was in a narrow bit of the corridor along with the refreshments trolley normally it would move up and down the train selling craps sandwiches and lukewarm coffee and teaSome hipster fuck who got on with us decided to sit on the floor and take up even more space One of my fellow commuters asked him to stand up because we were all crushed and he simply looked up and said No before putting his earphones in and turning his head Perhaps its true that were all too polite in the UK as nobody said anything I then resolved to teach the twat a lesson for putting his own comfort over others if the chance presented itselfMy opportunity came at the last stop The refreshments trolley had to move due to the penultimate stop being on the other side of train so hipster fuck ended up blocked in by me and the trolley against the doors that wouldnt openI let about  grinning commuters off before I let him out The best part was whilst I was doing that he tried shoving into me I was a fair bit taller than the little cunt and said can you moveNo I responded gleefullyApologies for any spellingformatting errors Im writing this on my phone on the return journey after a long day,Can you move,1483,pettyrevenge,top_all

alyx,60,261,1ffxy3,1152,Last year I took the train home after bringing my husbands car into service station As I live one station from the airport I chose a good time and thought it wouldnt be that crowded I was surprised to find the whole train nearly empty A few minutes later a guy entered the train with a whole bunch of luggage There were like  huge bags and suitcases and by the sweat on his forehead I could tell it was a heavy load I offered my help but he would refuseHe was arranging his luggage so everyone could easily pass by what took him a good two minutes credits for that As he was finally sitting down in the opposite cabin the train ran into the next station and I see an elderly lady with a kid entering the coach The woman approached the guy pointed to a small sign that said handicapped people only and claimed the seats saying she was handicapped She started flipping off the guy in a very rude wayThe guy instantly got up when I chimed in and offered my seat for them I also pointed at all the unoccupied seats in the coach but the woman wouldnt even look at me and kept claiming the seats I felt sorry for the guy and this time he accepted my offer to help him move the luggage I was boiling inside and I couldnt believe my eyes when she stood there for a whole minute watching us move the bags instead of sitting down with the kidThe woman mentioned the airport a few times so I thought it would be their destination I dont know why I didnt get out when I arrived at my stop but my guts told me Id miss something and it was maybe my time to shine in a petty revenge so I stayed for the airport stop and helped this guy bringing all the luggage to the door When the door opened he jumped out and I passed him one suitcase after another and hell some of them were pretty heavy About  of the bags were out when I heard the lady nagging behind meLet me out of the train youre blocking me and my kid to which I replied with use another door then or wait old LadyShe yelled at me and started pushing me which makes me fucking furious I hate people pushing near trains and tracks but I kept passing the bags to the guy as clumsy as one possibly can and told her to shut up  I knew the train wouldnt wait forever and when the last bag was out I heard the annoying beep of the doors which indicated the train was about to depart The kid and I hopped out and the lady was so busy with her rant she didnt notice She was probably expecting someone miraculousy to show up who says something like Yeah you fucking old lady I got your back here The doors shut and once theyre shut theres no way back The train slowly departed and I was in shock I mean I didnt expect that I just wanted to delay her getting off the train by acting clumsy but then I noticed the kid and the luggage guy laughing hard next to me I started laughing too and the woman in the train was pounding the glass gasping and I will never forget her swollen red face of anger and rage oddly no horror or fearWe talked to the kid and I took him to a cafe where he called his mom which wasnt the woman in the train and she came shortly after to pick him up The kid told her the story and exaggerated a little too much casting the care taker in a very negative light and thats basically how this woman lost her job Im still in contact with the kids family as we found out were actually neighboursFun Fact   The woman was far away from being handicapped she was just a lazy twat who liked to harrass other peopleFun Fact  I chose the cafe next to the escalator so we could see this care taker to come back with the next train to search for the  year old kid shes responsible for Lady kept noshow What kind of person does that TLDR Care taker harrasses a guy in a train gets petty revenged by blocking her way out and ends up departing with the train while the kid shes in charge of stays at the airport train stationEdit typo and some additional fact at the end,The gasps behind the glass doors,1413,pettyrevenge,top_all

koolbeanz,163,311,1j8219,1102,BACKGROUNDSo I used to work at one of those large retail homeimprovement stores as a cashier and one day I messed up pretty bad On this one super busy Saturday I had been assigned to be at the customer service desk and since I was fairly new I wasnt exactly sure what to do when an angry or suspicious customer came up to the desk Usually when you suspect people of trying to return stolen merchandise you would call over your manager and they would tell the customer that we werent going to take those items back However on this fateful Saturday I found myself in that situation and I panickedTHE ACTI had been doing well with no hiccups at the customer service desk and I was getting the hang of all the duties There had just been a rush of customers and my area around my register was quite messy I was trying to organize everything before another wave of people came in Thats when this very large ghetto and overall unpleasant lady came around the corner with a cart filled with the largest and most expensive cans of wood stain that we sold My suspicions were already up since she came around the wrong way and not through the front entrance She makes eye contact with me and slowly lugs her heavy cart up to my register Now this bitch then starts to tell me this bullshit story about how she had left over stain from a project and that she didnt have a receipt but she would gladly give me her drivers license and take a store credit At this point I tell her I need to call a manager to get an override for a return of that amount but when I try to call their phone they wouldnt answer I called one of the head cashiers next the head cashiers were basically glorified cashiers who told people to go to their lunches and breaks and told him I have to get an override for a return over  He simply replied Ok Ill be right there and hung up Now this ghetto bitch starts to get all flustered and tells me I need to hurry up I scan all of the stain in her cart and the total came out to be  but in order for me to put in on a merchandise card I had to get that override from my head cashier He came around the corner looking rushed and held out his card for me to scan I tried to signal to him that this lady was suspiciousasfuck but surprisingly he didnt catch my subtle gestures I opened my eyes wide and raised my eyebrows I was too worried about insulting this bitch so I didnt say anything I got the override and gave her the merchandise card and she quickly leftMY REVENGEAs soon as she got out of the doors I called the paint department and asked them to check how many cans of that stain they had on hand Sure enough they had less than what our inventory now said I doublechecked and asked the associates back there if they had seen anyone take any of the stain off the shelf earlier that day They confirmed my suspicions That bitch had taken them off of the shelves and returned them I was pretty upset I was thinking I was going to get written up for the first time for making such stupid mistake Feeling defeated I went back to cleaning up my area as I wait for a manager to come by so I can tell them of what just happened Then by some random happenstance I looked down next to my register by the phone and see a lone merchandise card The cards are usually in a pile on top of my register so I pick this one up and look at the back to see if it had been used Sure enough the security code had been peeled off which meant it had been activated My heart started racing I grabbed the card and went to check the system to see if that was the card I put the return on I swiped the card and up on the screen pops Remaining Balance  Somehow I had grabbed an empty merchandise card on accident and gave that to the ghetto bitch I gleefully go to the purchase screen and ring up the same items and used the card and rebought the stain so our store sustained no loss My day went on and I had no other problems until the same ghetto bitch comes storming up to my register again This time she looked livid as hell and started yelling at me with vengeance Apparently she had tried to buy some top line power drills with her card but somehow there was nothing on it I was thrilled I had the chance to get a redo with this bitch and so I made sure I wasnt going to screw this one up I look at her dead in the eyes and make up the best bullshit story I could think of at the time Maam after you had left we checked the security cameras and it seemed that you had taken those items off of the shelf and never paid for them in the first place We were able to call the credit center and take back the money that you stole We have all of your drivers license info and you wont be able to do any more returns with any of our stores without the Loss Prevention being notified At this point she screamed at me YOU DID WHAT then she turned around and stormed out of the store huffing loudly to herself FURTHER JUSTICEI told my manager about it and he couldnt help but laugh and commended me on not fucking up any further He called our sister stores around the area and told them about a potential shoplifter that may come in they always do that when theres someone trying to steal a lot of merchandise And the next day when I arrived at work I was informed that the same lady tried to push out a cart with several hundred dollars worth of stuff from one of our sister stores and was promptly arrested because they knew she was going to try something like that I hate shoplifters and Im glad she got what she deserved,Shoplifter gets whats coming,1413,pettyrevenge,top_all
barcalonga,123,312,1deoa4,1105,So my teenage son frequently forgets that he is supposed to clean the kitchen in the evening This is annoying not just because it is gross to wake up to a messy kitchen but also because he is constantly complaining that we dont treat him more like an adult He is a smart kid but he doesnt seem to understand that adults dont get to do whatever they want If he wants to be treated like an adult he needs to man up and take care of his obligations rightLast night again he didnt clean the kitchen And he didnt have time to do it in the morning because he woke up late as usual So I loaded up the dishwasher myself and made sure to turn it on just as he started his shower Ha no hot water for him this morning,Petty revenge on my own kid,1417,pettyrevenge,top_all
ShaneL,80,179,1cxasb,1107,I worked at a large restaurant where it was policy to help other servers clear their tables and get refills on drinks when you could Not only was it policy but it was a nice thing to do to help your coworkers I had this lazy bitch of a woman working with me one evening She was the only person who didnt help other servers at all In fact I think she put more effort into not helping then the actual act of helping would have taken There was another policy at this restaurant where you cant leave until the closing server checks your section and your side duties to make sure they are all done Now this lazy bitch Jen was best friends with the usual closing server Amy Jen usually got to leave early without cleaning her section leaving the mess for other servers to clean up before Amy would allow them to leaveOne day I was called in to close the restaurant It was Amys birthday and they needed someone to cover her shift that she booked off I jumped at the opportunity mainly because it meant more money but also because I knew Jen was workingThat evening I cut all servers except Jen I made sure that each of their sections were left messy and their side duties were not done They were fine with leaving a mess for Jen because she had done it to them so many times When Jens last table left she came and asked me to sign her out I checked and every section was still an absolute mess including hers and none of her sideduties were done I told her that needed to change before she could leave and she whined about needing to leave soon so she could make it to Amys party I shrugged in the same noncaring way she had so many times and told her that she better hurry up then She rushed and did a halfass job of everything I checked it with a fine tooth comb and made her redo it Again she did a halfass job so I made her redo it Then a third time it still was pretty bad so I explained that she is just wasting her time by doing it halfass Finally after the fourth time she was done I let her leave but it took her three hours to do that and she missed the better part of the partyThe next day I showed up to my normal nonclose shift and noticed I was listed as the closer The manager said the place was so much cleaner than when Amy does it so they were going to bump me up to the closing server position and try it out for awhileThat night I did the same thing where I allowed servers to leave without doing their cleaning so that Amy would be stuck with it She bitched but I played stupid to whole ordeal and made her stay very late doing a thorough cleaning I did this day after day to both Jen and Amy  whoever was scheduled to be there laterFinally one of them complained The manager told me they complained and said I understand exactly why youre doing that and they deserve it After about a month of that they both quit The managers were not disappointed and the other servers were happy We went back to being a very helpful group that never stuck each other with someones elses work TLDR Two lazy bitches used their impromptu power to screw over other staff I returned the favor until they quit ,Server Etiquette Is Actually Your Job,1286,pettyrevenge,top_all

shehulk,112,218,1bih1w,1075,Ive got a lot of these stories for you guys Im pretty vindictive but in true Canadian form Im also pretty passive aggressive This usually leads to lots of petty revenge This story though is by far my best revenge Its long but its a good payoff When I was  I moved across the country with my then boyfriend now husband I was pretty psyched when I got a job at AampW because it was my first real job and the pay was really good great compared to my former province shit compared to the pay scale in this province I was working day shift and my manager told me it was very important to keep my own record of my hours because the computers didnt work to login After getting my first paycheque and being short  hours I realized why it was so important But the owner assured me the hours would be on my next cheque I had worked there for about  months before being promoted to evening manager with a fairly substantial raise of about ph I was still owed about  hours of pay Technically my boss always put my missing hours on the next cheque but then I would be missing even more hours from the current pay period Things started getting really shitty Some of our kitchen staff quit and instead of replacing them he just moved around the  remaining kitchen staff so that we only had one person in the kitchen per shift We were also really short on staff so I ended up working the counters in the mornings  alone and then coming in for my regular evening shift  Apparently my raise was only in name because my last  paycheques had my former salary on them my boss assured me that it would be on the next cheque Then came stampede For those of you who arent familiar with the Calgary stampede its the biggest event in the city Its a week long rodeo and festival where thousands of people flood the city drunk and wearing cowboy hats Our AampW was right downtown so needless to say it was a very busy week We still only had one kitchen staff and me working the morning shift the day manager came in early to help with the counter and we tried all the staff to see if we could get extra bodies but only one staff came in Breakfast was a nightmare AampW breakfasts are real breakfast made to order eggs bacon French toast none of it premade and there was no time to premake it anyway because the store was packed pretty much round the clock so with  person full time in back and one floater it was taking  minutes per breakfast and the store was lined to the doors and the drive through lined up right into the street We called the owner and told him he needed to come in right now because we needed him and his wife to help us We were drowning in angry customers  minutes pass and we call him again Ill be there right away is his famous line Another  minutes and hes not here we call his house and get VM so we assume he is on his way This is great because he doesnt live far so he should be here in  minutes at the latest Its now am  hours since we first called and no answer on his house phone or his cell Weve had lots of people walk out weve had people demand refunds and leave but the store is still packed and there is still an hour left on breakfast but we havent had a chance to prep lunch not even cut up the veggies for burgers so we were still fucked come lunch I look at the day manager and said fuck it I quit He says you know what fuck this I quit too We call the boss again and leave a message on both lines telling him we quit along with  other staff the only one that doesnt is the  kitchen staff and we will stay for another  minutes to give him time to get here but then we are walking out  minutes pass and no word from the owner We lock the doors and tell the customers in the store that their breakfast is free since they all have been waiting for so long and we are closing the store once all of them are served but they have to take their meals to go We serve at lease  free breakfasts at around  a piece once the store is empty we do our cash out the other manager and I look at the previous schedules to confirm what hours the  employees are still owed and gave them the cash out of the cash out took our hours owed including my raise and left a receipt in the cash out with our signatures detailing where the money went but the cash out in the safe and left People were still coming in the drive through and trying to get in he door confused to why the store would be closed in the middle of the day during stampede I didnt get a call until  hours later after the lunch rush from my former boss claiming we owed him all the money he lost while the store was closedfor the free breakfasts I told him he was well informed about what was going to happen we knew he got the message because we had filled his inbox and couldnt leave any messages but when we called to tell him he store was closed the inbox was no longer full He shouldnt have tried to call our bluff because we werent bluffing Not only did we make sure that some of the staff actually got paid what they were owe costing hundreds but he probably lost out on  worth of sales or more from the store being closed for  hours and missing the lunch rush which on a normal day brought in about G but during stampede could easily bring in  This being Calgary in  I got another job the next day Working as a secretary at Parks Canada making ph and never having to deal with cheap bosses or angry customers again ,Great revenge against a cheap scamming boss,1293,pettyrevenge,top_all

Comms,151,242,1g19jh,1002,Does it count as petty revenge if the target didnt specifically do anything to me personallyA few years ago I went back to school to get another BA because the first time around my GPA could be charitably called aggressively mediocre and I really wanted to go to grad school My wife had a full time job at the time so I didnt need to get a part time job or anything but I get bored easily I applied for a campus security job because it fit my schedule and wasnt particularly demanding work It was a pretty easy gig involving mostly sitting around in the lobbies of various dorms on weekends and checking IDs of incoming individuals to make sure everyone coming into the dorms was a resident or guest It was part of the campus safety initiative Most of the time I just sat there and studied since most of the excitement was just after last callthis is in Canada so its pretty normal for freshmen to be legal drinking age Occasionally I was asked to patrol around campus and ticket cars that were improperly parked I didnt mind the walking but ticketing students never sat well with mewho has money for that shitso this was not my favorite part of the jobAs an aside I tended to not give out tickets unless the person parking was actually blocking something important or their parking job caused a hazard Fuck the manAnyway one day in the late fallstill above freezing but not by muchI was outside the engineering building and I saw a newish BMW seriesor maybe it was an M I dont recall so Im just going to say it was an M for brevityparked in the handicap spot and it did not have handicapped tags As usual I approach the car slowly like Im sneaking up on it I discovered that people who are about to get a ticket tend towards the loud and aggressive Ive found that no one actually likes the meter nazi and a loud blustery car owner tends to attract an unsympathetic crowd Its better to sneak up on the car confirm that it is in fact illegally parked or has an expired pass walk away write the ticket and then casually return and slip the ticket under the wiper gtBe me meter nazigtUse stealthy ticketgtIt is very effectiveI wrote out the ticket stuck it under the wiper and walked off I did another walk around the rear parking lot and then because it was near the end of my shift I returned to that same building because there was a Tims inside and I wanted to grab lunch and a coffee I go inside get my coffee and sandwich then go back outside to have a smoke Im standing by the smoking pawnhttpbpblogspotcomDySWZtETefGONiZXIAAAAAAAAAopfmfKsossmokingpawnjpgI dont actually know what these things are calleddrink in one hand sandwich tucked in my jacket pocket smoke in the other hand and just zone out Next thing I know theres some guy in my line of sight swearing loudly I zone back in and realize it must be the owner of the M Hes this skinny dude wearing a puffy vesthttpwwwgapcomproductsresthumbimgquiltedpuffervestbluejpg and hes got fancy hair I figure hes probably  or   tops Hes got the yellow envelope in one hand and hes all Fucking shit fuck fuck dick cunt shit fuck motherfucker etc While hes swearing and having a bit of a spaz hes also looking around presumably to see if the meter nazi is still around so he can give him a piece of his mindOh wait Im the meter nazi And Im like  feet away Still smoking Sandwich in my pocket coffee in the other hand parking ticket printer slung across my chest Well shit gtBe megtBe at the end of your shiftgtExpect to be yelled at by Puffy Vest Fancy HairI steel myself for the eventual tirade Policy is we have to be all beta about confrontations Our interactions should consist of yes sirmaam no sirmaam I understand sirmaam but overall being firm about why they received a ticket  He swings his vision around several times but doesnt seem to spot me Im not wearing anything distinct other than the mandatory blue campus security jacket and a ticket printer He keeps looking around Left Right Left RightI take another dragFor whatever reason he doesnt see me He angrily throws the ticket and yellow envelope into his car bleeps the car with his remote and heads back into the buildingSo Im still standing by the smoking pawnhttpbpblogspotcomDySWZtETefGONiZXIAAAAAAAAAopfmfKsossmokingpawnjpg sandwich in my pocket halffull medium doubledoublethe old medium not the new upsized mediumwith one drag left on my smoke So I finish my smoke feed the pawn and sit down at the nearby bench to have my sandwich Im sitting on the bench eating my sandwich drinking my coffee and staring at this M that is still parked in the handicap spaceIm gonna finish my sandwich drink my doubledouble have another smoke and then Im going to give him another ticket says I to myselfIts a trap replies my brain making a very good pointI dunno man this is too good of an opportunity to pass upIm just sayingHow could it be a trap What he has a gang of puffy vested bros in there just waiting to challenge me to a dance offhttpnycxplorercomwpcontentuploadsWestSideStoryjpgDo whatever you want just no concussionsMy brain made a valid point This would be an excellent trap I pop the last of my sandwich into my mouth wash it down with my now lukewarm doubledouble and light up another smokeDu Maurier Light Kings with the droopy cigarette impotence warning no doubtand stare at the entrance to the engineering buildingNo sign of Puffy Vest Fancy Hair With one hand I start typing out the ticket on the printer but dont press the print button yetif I hit the button it saves the data and theres no way to undo it once that happens I wasnt yet ready to commit to this course of action I finish my second cigarette pull out a yellow envelope take a breath and hit print as I start walking toward the car The thermal printer quickly spits out the ticket and I quickly insert the ticket into the envelope and sling it under the wiper Nothing happensNo ambushNo screamingNo Puffy Vest Fancy HairAll that buildup for nothingI check my phoneif I recall correctly it was a motorola flip phone of some varietyand shift ended a few minutes ago Im not technically in any hurry to get back to the office we have lots of ticket printers for the next shift so Im not preventing anyone from starting their shift by dillydallying I use the camera phonewith a whopping x resolutionto take a photo of the ticket sitting on his passenger seat and a photo of the ticket under his wiper Then I walk into the engineering building get another coffee and plant myself back in the designated smoking area and I hope that this kid isnt in a three hour class Im now here for a show Im going to get yelled at itll be a huge scene Ill have to be all professional about it but seeing Puffy Vest Fancy Hair have another spaz is totally worth itYoure an idiot says my brainI let my coffee cool just for a bit before I take a swig Of course I forgot to check where the paper cup seam was and dribbled coffee down my chin Son of a bitch I put my coffee down and awkwardly wipe the coffee dribble from my chin just as I hear another stream of CUNT FUCK MOTHERFUCKER WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK erupts from the vicinity of the M WHO THE FUCK DID THISWHAT THE FUCKTheres Puffy Vest Fancy Hair Sack of fast food in one hand jumbo fountain drink in the otherah to have the metabolism of a  yearold againHes whirling around trying to find the meter nazi again while swearing up a storm Hes now making enough of a scene that people are actually staring at him as they walk by For some reason he still hasnt spotted me Im standing a mere  feet from where he is spazzing I am right beside the smoking pawn wearing a blue jacket that says Campus Security on it I have a printer slung over my shoulder and across my chest For some reason his gaze never lingers on me at all After a few more seconds of spazzing he gets in his car throws the other ticket onto his seat and speeds awayWhy he didnt see me is inexplicable The only hypothesis I have is that he was expecting the parking enforcement officer to be wearing something else Maybe a high visibility vesthttpwwwlegionsafetycomhighvisibilitysafetyvestsjpg or maybe something like thishttpwwwsjsueduparkingpicsinterceptorJPG I dunnoI dont recall how much those tickets  run a few hundred I think but that kid had one expensive day My boss did tell me that the kids father called in pretty pissed about the tickets I had emailed my boss the camera phone photos that afternoon because I figured hed probably ask my why I wrote two tickets to the same guy on the same day My boss explained to the kids father that because campus security had witnessed the driver return to his vehicle remove the ticket and leave it counted as a separate parking incident thus two tickets were warranted TLDR Guy in puffy vest gets a double shot of karma for parking in handicap zone,Dont Park in Handicap Spots If Youre Not Disabled or Karma Double Slam,1244,pettyrevenge,top_all

FredFltStn,51,343,1qou04,975,BACKGROUND I own and operate my own retail store Its actually a seasonal fireworks tent but not like any fireworks tent youve seen before Its  square feet of fireworks heaven where the party and the insanity climax at midnight on the th of July and New Years EveFREE STUFF  Im convinced that reddit is the best community on the net and Im trying to kick start Christmas by giving away free TShirts from my company When youre done with this story please read this posthttpredditqnfi to find out how you can help out a child for Christmas and get a free shirtSTORY  In Florida we get our fair share of rain especially in the summer During light showers its business as usual but when the wind and the rain really pick up we batten down the hatches We lower the sides of the tent and use plastic to cover any shelving or product that may be getting dripped onOne afternoon we got the typical fast moving heavy thunderstorm with wind rain and lightning It really came up on us fast and we had a load of people in the tent shopping at the time I grabbed all of my help and we went crazy trying to get all of the sides down and boxes off of the floor before stuff was ruinedWe managed to get everything down and covered before we had gotten much damage We did however get totally soaked while all of this was going on my cashier was still ringing out customers and new customers were running through the rain and lightning to get INTO the tent No offense but in a lighting storm I dont even want to be in a tent in a parking lotOf course thats about the time we lost power It was early afternoon so we didnt really need lights inside of the tent and I actually have my registers on small uninterruptible power supplies UPS so they dont cut out every time the power fails My cashier is still churning and burning trying to get people out of the door About  minutes later the power still hasnt come back on its still pouring outside and the UPSs give up the ghost and run out of juiceNot a problem I was a boy scout and I have a backup plan for my backup plan My parents RV has a generator so I can switch over my critical power to that if I need to It does require us to reroute some power cords and stuff like that so I cant just flip a switch and make it happen but its doableMy dad and I brave the rain and wind to start getting stuff ready for the switch While Im out in the storm one of my employees comes out to tell me that they need me in the tentAt my counter screaming at my cashier is uber bitch UB Shes pissed off that my cashier has refused to ring up her purchase just because the registers are dead My cashier was nicely trying to explain to her that the power should be on shortly and they would ring her up as soon as possible but UB didnt want to hear about itThis particular cashier had worked for me for five years or so at this point and her father is one of my best friends Shed actually graduated high school and was home from college on summer break working for me I always joke with her that shes the boss and Im just there to do her biddingMy cashier is keeping her cool but I felt bad for her so I stepped in to try and defuse the situation UB demands to check out NOW because she has somewhere that she needs to be and I need to take care of itIm soaked to the bone and I just want to get this bitch out of my tent so I pull out my phone and ring up her purchase on that She actually had a pretty big purchase and when I told her the total she didnt believe it She wanted to see my phone to verify She then went down the list of stuff at least  items and questioned each price When she was doing this she actually found a mistake I had made I had entered in an item as  when it should have been  The only reason I knew this is that she was making me verify the price item by item as she called them out from my phoneYou should have seen the look on her face when it dawned on her that the only mistake she found was where I had UNDERCHARGED her I grabbed my phone back and happily told her I would fix the price for her and then gave her the new HIGHER total I should mention that the entire time theres a crowd of people around watching the scene and a couple of them started to openly laugh when this happenedWhen I told her the new total she lost her GD mind She started screaming at me that it was my fault and that she shouldnt have to pay for my mistake In fact she should get a discount for having to wait so long I let her yell for a good two or three minutes just standing there expressionlessIm tired Im soaked to the bone and my dad is outside in the rain trying to get the power switched over by himself because of this bitch I called to one of my employees and told him to put her stuff back on the shelf then I turned to uber bitch and told her Youre going to need to go somewhere else because youre not allowed to shop here anymoreI turned to my cashier in front of the customer and told her Dont sell that bitch anythingShe left screaming obscenities and threats the entire way out and into the rainONE YEAR LATERThe same cashier grabs me from the floor and points out a customer shopping in the tent Its the same uber Bitch lady that I had thrown out the year before and shes shopping with three or four other people To be honest even after seeing the lady I didnt place her face If my cashier wouldnt have recognized her Id have never noticed she was thereCASHIER What would you like me to doME Its up to you Youre the bossThe lady and her party finished shopping and got in line at the counter to checkout When UB got to the register my petite  year old female cashier stood her gound looked her dead in the eye and told her Im sorry you may have forgotten but youre not allowed to shop hereStone Cold BabyThe lady actually walked out of the tent without saying a word I think she was embarrassed because she was with a group In the end one of the people in the group paid for the stuff and they walked out confused as hell Dont forget to check out this posthttpredditqnfi to find out how you can help fellow redditors and get your free TShirt Just trying to make our community great If

the Yo bro guess where I am right now conversation with each complete with LOUD profanity There are a lot of families and young children on this flight including his ownAll his antics so far are annoying yet no reason to kick him off the plane That comes when the guy refuses to put away his phone meaning my mom cant close the door meaning a delay meaning less time my mom has on the ground in Maui to snorkel this bitch LOVES her some snorkeling Another flight attendant had asked him politely three times the third request receiving a Jesus calm the fuck downOh heeeeeelllll no My mom PAs the crew in the back galley saying shes booting him This guy will only get drunker and any aggression towards flight crew is not fucking tolerated She prepares to go into the cockpit to get approval from the pilot to deplane the guy Pilots can be notoriously uncaring about what happens behind the cockpit door  just take care of it is a common response to complaints  so my mom was prepared to have to argue her caseBut she remembers this flights captain is Steve a seasoned pilot whos flown with my mom for  years and has always been famously protective of his flight crews he always buys dinner for the crew at the hotel he gives my mom a Christmas present every year and his connections in Seattle helped me get my first job Awesome guy who wont let anyone do anything to his girls  and says so again to my mom She heads back to deal with Asshat McGeeShe informs him simply and quietly that his behavior has thus far been unacceptable that the captain has deemed him a security risk and that he must deplane This guy naturally goes apeshit screaming things like So youre gonna ruin my kids vacation What the FUCK My mom maintains her composure and tells him that the airline will book him on the next flight provided he deplanes peacefully without security and sobers upThe guy continues his tirade when my mom sees his now crying wife starting to pack up the toys around her kids who had finally calmed down Seeing the distraught look on her face she tells her Maam there is no need for you or your children to deplane Your husband can meet you in Maui if he takes this evenings flight The wife looks a bit torn for a second then turns on her husband with a look of pure ice Dont ruin thisMy moms been divorced so she and plenty other women know that look They also know that the this could mean anything from that flight to their entire marriage My mom also lives fully to the mantra Dont you dare fuck shit over for your wife Whatever it was it worked the guy grabbed his carryon muttered Man this is bullshit but deplaned They were able to take off only  minutes behind scheduleWhile the kids cried a bit at their dad leaving they soon settled down My mom ended up talking to that woman quite a bit and comped meals for her and the kids The wife was embarrassed and extremely apologetic but the flight crew and even neighboring passengers consoled her My mom gave the woman a bottle of wine from first class when they landedA few weeks later my mom got a call from her supervisor Two separate highlevel frequent fliers on that flight had written to the airline commending her for how she handled the situation My mom got a congratulatory letter from corporate and a small bonus almost unheard of for flight attendants nowadaysTLDR my mom kicked a guy off a plane for being a doucherSorry for writing a novel I could have shortened this but I like to narrate Ive got loads more PettyRevenge stories from my moms years of flying if people are interestedEdit Thank you all so much for your feedback Im glad you enjoyed the read even if it was a long one nothing irks me more on reddit than word submissions that could have been written in  words or fewer My mom truly is a phenomenal flight attendant woman and mother this is only the tip of the iceberg I have many more actual pettyrevenge stories from her years of flying Ill post them as comments in a separate post thanks for the suggestion uPigletChopsAlso shameless plug  please remember to do as the frequent fliers in this story did and commend exemplary service you receive from airline staff to the airline  not just flight attendants but gate and ticket agents as well It really does make a big difference and can lighten that employees entire month,Being a dick Get off the plane Youre not flying

NukeDarfur,93,188,19ifue,959,I used to work the night shift at a hotel in a tourist area  During the summer every hotel in town would sell out every weekend  Even the crappy roach motels would fill every room usually with poor bastards who didnt realize that the rooms at the decent places needed to be booked far in advanceInevitably every weekend we would get dozens of people showing up without a reservation assuming we would have rooms available  When we informed them that we were sold out the reactions would range from Okay thanks to the ass clowns who said something to the effect of Youre going to have to do something because I need a room  The latter reaction is the one that always really pissed us off not just because they were rude but also because they were stupid  Were they not aware that we are in the business of renting rooms to people  That this is how the business makes money  We didnt have some secret wing of the hotel that was only available to the people who really insisted  We had X number of rooms and once those rooms were spoken for we were out of rooms to sell  Seemed simple enough to meAnyway the one night Im working the night shift and this car pulls up under our canopy  These four young guys who looked straight out of the frat club come stumbling in obviously hammered  They tell me they need a room and I tell them sorry were sold out tonight  Instantly the one guy jumps in with Thats not going to work  We need a room and youre going to have to figure something out  I simply replied in my most assertive tone Look I dont have any rooms but two miles down the road is a Sheraton and I know for a fact they have plenty of rooms left  They considered it for a moment and turned around and leftThere wasnt a Sheraton two miles down the road but thanks to what some of my later check ins who had driven the same route told me there was a DUI checkpoint,One of my prouder moments,1147,pettyrevenge,top_all

QAAvenger,77,256,1i7zwc,939,This dear Reddit is is a story of justice A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments ampnbspThe Setting  Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but dont want to manage a database to sit behind it     The Heroes  I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about  Ive been working in this place for about  years now and Im frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if theres anything I want to ask about    My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics Great boss    My good friend who well call Greg works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department Gregs got my back and Ive got his If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then Ill help him out    The Villain  The clients project manager who well imaginatively call Douche was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered When paired together these things often mean that bad things will happen To make things worse this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it After all he is a paying customer    The Pledge  The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface It was a good feature and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus    gtMe Hi Douche its Derp at ltCompanygt Just calling abou    gtDouche Oh hi yeah the slacker at ltCompanygt Hows it going    It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call hence why this was obviously MY fault    gtMe biting my tongue Im Im OK thanks Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu    gtDouche Oh this again Havent you finished that yet    gtMe Well no Youll remember that weve delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which youve been infor    gtDouche Oh for the love of Why is it taking so long    gtMe Thats what I wanted to ask about Requirement  says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use The problem is that this equation doesnt actually represent that val    gtDouche Look youre supposed to follow the specification IVE written so just do it I dont want to hear about this again until its done    The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency He can read minds I then completed this piece of work ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction     The Turn  After the best part of  months and the client is about to go live with their site Theyve been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full  months before they were even able to test it and at this point they were going live in  days because thats when their marketing campaign said it would Because of these tight deadlines they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche    About pm Friday afternoon Greg from CS calls me up says hes got an issue with Douche Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system any issues they had integrating were not development issues but customer support issues    I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun    gtMe Sup Greg sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features    gtGreg Hey DerpYou ever worked on this new API that went up for ltClientNamegt    gtMe Yeah I did the verification process on it What do you want to know    gtGreg The Client seems to think it doesnt work    gtMe It was implemented to the letter Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out havent they    gtGreg Yeah thats what I thought when I read the documentation Ok leave it with me and Ill let Douche know    I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly whats coming next After not too long Steve the account manager for Douche storms into QA and straight into Boss office Theres a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually Im called in     gtSteve Would you care to explain this    Steve points at an email on Boss screen I go in for a closer inspection and its an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has obviously not been tested at all Im surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and Ive worked on various projects for him in the past    gtMe I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification    gtSteve But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense It doesnt make sense    gtBoss Derp what did the specification say about this    gtMe I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like    gtBoss I think that would be a good idea    I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me wanting to know whats going on On the way back I see Boss trying to calm Steve down    gtMe Here it is    I slide it across the desk and take a seat Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles    gtSteve But that makes no sense    gtMe I know    gtSteve Why didnt you raise this with the client    gtMe I did I then was accused of insulting the clients project manager and calling him incompetent    gtBoss Who wrote this specification    gtMe Douche over on their side did Im pretty sure you two would have been CCd on the email when it came across    gtSteve Well what are we going to do We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday its now  Friday Afternoon    gtBoss No chance We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless its a priority  issue Even then this is an API that multiple clients are now using and well have to be careful not to break their integrations    gtMe Steve You might want to look at section  on that document    Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered That and Ive made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past    gtSteve OK wait there    Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission The client wrote the requirements signed off the requirements signed off the work in Acceptance Testing and have only  hours before they launch They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight    The Prestige  Its  and I am considering what Ill spend my weekend doing Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me    gtBoss Can you just join me on a conference call    gtMe If its quick    gtBoss Thats up to you really    Intrigued I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone explaining to Steve what needs to be done    gtBoss Steve I have Derp here do you want to explain what the plan is    gtSteve Derp we really need to get this sorted You worked on the original feature so youll know the best way to test this Were still working on getting someone to develop the change but well be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients    gtDouche I really need you to help me out here mate otherwise itll really hit the fan over here    I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice    gtMe Ive already made plans for this weekend and    gtDouche Derp seriously you HAVE to help me out here    gtMe I dont really feel like it    gtDouche WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS    gtBoss Its pm on a Friday Most staff are on their way home or out the door Sorry Steve but it looks like itll have to wait until next week    Douche rages down the phone and once this torrent of abuse subsides Steve lets me go back to my deskIm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings    gtMe ltCompanygt Derp spea    gtDouche Please I need you to do this    gtMe You need to sort this out and calling me wont help you    gtDouche Please Im sorry just help me out    gtMe You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever weve spoken Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason youre here right now I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with

Geotis,119,187,13vno4,911,Heres my personal account with a private school that had corporal punishmentEDIT This was in Southern Mississippi at the timeWhen I was in th grade I was in a private christian school Spent the  years there I was spanked many times due to problems they had with me including demonic drawings I made during free time They were drawing from the video game The Legend of ZeldaI was spanked for many issues that were nonissues but a biased problem they had or came up with I was always spanked by the vice principal normally a male but witnessed by the offended teacher normally femaleOne day I had enough I was spanked for fighting with another student We were playing flag football he got pissed and physically punched me I did not respond and we were tattled on by two girls who witnessed and improperly reported the incident The vice principal paddled me it was always three licks and I turned around severely angered by the injustice that happened and said you will never strike me again The female teacher who I had issues with and was the witnessing party said something along the lines of well spank you until you finally learn your place I said with all the bitterness I could muster The FUCK you wont The assistant principal who was paddling me at the time swung me back onto the desk and said you just bought yourself three more licksBefore he could swing I grabbed the long scissors he had on his desk and swung at him nicking his hand in the process I swung erratically until he and the female teacher vacated the room and locked me inI knew I was in deep shit so I decided to make the most of the situation figuring Id make a point as I went down I took some autographed bat off his wall and destroyed his office breaking everything in the room the nicknacks on his desk the windows the phone everything I spent a good ten minutes in that room until the police arrived I surrendered to them without any problemThis led to the local media getting involved which worked out to my benefit The media investigated the school and reported on the issue of the opposite gender witnessing my punishment the improper reasons for my punishment and the fact that most of my teachers did not even have a college educationI was expelled for the incident but I already had my revenge I caused a major embarrassment for the school so much so that they had a high degree of students withdrawn from the school which caused them to lose a lot of money in tuition funds and also caused them to change their school nameIt was worth having to repeat the th grade I enjoyed public school from then onTLDR FUCK THEM ALLEDIT  Heres some FAQTo be honest my parents didnt believe me up until the incident because of my troubled history Now looking back they can see the obvious catch flaw in their logicWhen they picked me up for the police station they were furious Ironically I was given a spankin from my father My parents had what they called a twoforone deal if I get a spanking at school I get a spanking at home Keep in mind this is the deep south Mississippi where Christian values overrules critical thinking and obvious logicIt wasnt until the TV station called my parents and requested to do an interview with me or them My parents refused trying to shield me from any public damage My parents tune was changed when the reporter basically laid everything out for them basically proving everything I was saying the whole time something that doesnt happen very oftenDuring my time off as I was expelled my parents sent me to a counselor After about a week I was diagnosed with some type of depression resulting from a repressive atmosphere and that a drastic change was needed This is when they decided to send me to public school The problem with that was that my parents during my private school days used public school as a threat for problems related from school poor grades punishments calls from teachers They spun public school as a prisonlike atmosphere in the roughest part of the ghetto where I would be surrounded by blacks Keep in mind Im the deep south of Mississippi the REALLY racists part The concept of public school had forever been etched in my mind as a sever punishment for the poor and bad So when the counselor recommended public school by parents were faced with another problem trying to convince that this was not a punishment and was going to be good for me I spent the time up until the next year of school in a deep depression because of the lies and threats my parents spun towards meAs far as the teachers lack of college degrees no one knew It wasnt until the tv report that that knowledge was hidden I cant remember for sure but either the fact that they were a private school may have skirted state requirements or that they were discovered and had to make drastic changes Either way all my former teachers either quit or were switched to other positiontitles that didnt require degrees like librarian and such Either way the school changed names to avoid confusion with this dilemma Ironically the church under the same name as the school kept its tarnished nameIf it wasnt for the counselor or the television stations intervention into my already repressive life I would have been in a worse situation afterwards I found out that I loved public school as you dont get any realworld interactions black people are not the poorevil people my parents led me to believe this is cliche but one of my best friends through high school was AfricanAmerican much to the dismay of my racist parents and that my chaoticproblem child ways were nothing but the overexaggeration of the privateschools staffWith all that said I love my parents and after all thats happened and the time leading afterwards they have grownout of their ultraconservative ways However I do hold the staff from that school mainlyresponsible for my lingering physiological problems still have a streak of fear shoot through me every time I hear the phone ring at my parents house subconsciously believing its a teacher calling to get me in trouble I hope they have already or will pay in the future for the

lethalaudio,52,210,1ggrj4,883,A few years ago when I was still with Verizon Wireless I was in the store for my next phone upgrade  They were packed as usual and was settling in for a long waitIt wasnt long into the wait that I began to take notice of a small group of children maybe  years old and running around the store laying their hands on each phone being loud and trying to one up each other on the amount of toys or games they hadUnattended children already annoy me and heres a group of them stuck in the store with me  Great   But it got worseThe loud brats kept going over to one phone in particular to play that Crank that song by Soulja Boy  Sometimes back to back  The amount of hatred that I have for that song is astronomical  So theyre just rubbing salt in the wound now  And they wanted the whole store to hear  They maxed the volume on the phone to the point where the speakers were bottoming out  So yes it was loudAfter about the th or th time of them circling back around to the phone and having a loud dance off I looked at my wife and said I have to deal with this  She wasnt sure if I was going to deal with the children or the phone so she was slightly concernedThey all had their backs to the phone when I picked it up and the song suddenly stopped they spun around and looked up to a  lbs scowlNot one of them said a word and my focus stayed on the phone as I went through the menu and did a factory reset on the phoneFeeling quite accomplished I walked back over to my wife and sat down and explained what I did  We both sat there watching the kids trying to bring the song back and finally giving up after about  min  My wife glanced around the room and said there were quite a few people watching them and giggling to themselvesThe icing on the already delicious cake was when one of the kids went to their mother  She was about what you would expect of someone that would let their kid annoy everyone in a store  Around my age at the time ish and obviously not that interested in being a parent  The kid whined about the phone and then looked around the room to point to me  I was watching out of the corner of my eye when he pointed and his mother looked up to me with a squinty look that you typically give an unfamiliar far off noise youve just heardFortunately for me my stature is already intimidating Ive been  since junior high and the default setting for my face is an expression that always looks pissed off  Its just the card Ive been dealt and Im always asked if Im mad at something and have to reply with a laugh and No this is just my normal expressionSo when I saw her squint in my direction I turned my face toward them with enough speed to tell them that I was watching indirectly and gave her a wide eyed stone face stareI could have stared straight at them while the kid whined but it wouldnt have been as startling  The snap to reaction I gave her should have planted that thought that I was going to keep an eye on themPretty sure it worked because when I reacted to her look she jerked back and looked back to her brat grabbed him by the arm and sat him down beside herEvery so often I would catch her glancing in my direction to which I would reply with a slow glare back but she would snap back straight before I fully got aroundThats when I learned just how uncomfortable people can be when they realize theyre being watchedtldr Kids being annoying in Verizon store with Soulja boy song so I reformatted the phone and gave one of their mothers the cold stare to make her uncomfortable,Verizon store annoying children and my last nerve,1093,pettyrevenge,top_all

Geotis,174,250,1buyoe,871,A little background on the  year old male not only has several food allergies but is an all around picky eater So for me to find a restaurant that will cater to my needs and wants is pretty difficult but if and when I ever did you find one I am a very regular and loyal customerOne of my favorite dishes I like to eat is a good ole Southernstyle steak and potatoes One of my allergies is a severe cheese allergy not a milk allergy Im not going to get into a discussion or an argument with anyone online just take my word for it and Ive never been fond of large chunks of garlicThis one majorchain restaurant that I found offered this meal at a reasonable price The only alteration I had to make whats to the potato In the morning they would take the potatoes out of the refrigerators and add cheese and garlic to them The manager there was nice and said that she would happily prepare my potato by taking a fresh one out of the freezer and microwaving it bypassing the additives that I could not eat and did not like All I would have to do is ask for the manager when I was seated and she would take care of the restThis was not a major problem for the manager It could easily be done it just required a little extra effort on her behalfSo I made this a weekly tradition I would take my girlfriendatthetime out for lunch make my special request enjoy my meal and leaving nice tip for the managers and waitresses effortsI did this for a good year Then one day when I ask for the manager I was greeted by a younger lady I was told that the previous manager had been shifted to another restaurant I proceeded with my order When I made my special request I was told that was not possible I told her about my history with the restaurant and the previous manager is she quickly retorted with a story that they had switched difference food suppliers and that the cheese and garlic was added prior to the freezing process it was delivered to them prenate I was irked by her callousness but succeeded my goal of eating a cheeseless potatoFlash forward a month or so I traveled about  miles north to visit my been girlfriend at her college We go out to eat at the same name restaurant Once we were seated I notice that the manager was the same lady from my hometown restaurant she comes over and takes my order asking if I wanted my usualI hesitate a moment informing her of her restaurants change in policy She informs me that there has been no change the new manager straight up lied to me and that manager has been known to be lazy and a liar She further tells me that she only gets all her ass to serve customers only if there is a group of eight or more and she only cares for getting the large tips at the efforts of her helpArmed with this knowledge and a birthday coming up in the near future I gather my parents and a group of my friends totaling  people in all for my yearly treat of a birthday dinnerBefore going into the restaurant I discuss my plan with my entourage everyone goes in with their knowledge of whats to comeWe are all greeted and seated by the manager she goes to everyone around the table and takes their drink order Everyone suspiciously orders water with no lemonAfter everyone had their chance to look at the menu everyone places the order with the manager are you insisted everybody go ahead of me as I was  still decidingAfter everyone that placed their order I make my move I order my state with my plane potatoes She immediately tells me that that is not possible shop in slightly disappointed I asked her why that is She gives me a similar yet slightly different excuse than she did before When she finished I said that was funny because the previous manager I drop her name which seems to spark an aura of worry is a good friend of mine and still works for the company and that she told me that that story was a load of bullshit and thats a feeling my order as requested it is easily capable Irked by my ever so clever game she defiantly refuses my order as requested I sheeplishly ask since it was my birthday and a special occasion if an exception to be made She seem to enjoy telling me absolutely not I slump my shoulders and defeatedly say alright and with my command everyone at my table stands up in unison almost as if we had practice this all before Realizing shes about to lose a big payday she quickly backpedals like I have never seen she says that shell go back and check with the cook to see if an exceptions can be madeCuriously I ask her but I thought you said  absolutely not She says well let me just double check I thanked her and asked her if she didnt mindShe quickly scampers off to the kitchen during which we all leave because we had a reservation at the restaurant across the streetTLDR

flatfrog,70,121,18w2gd,847,I used to room with my best friend her boyfriend and his three friends  The ONE bathroom was beyond disgusting  Apparently aiming was something only done with a gun while hunting  They never bought toilet paper and werent even considerate enough to replace an empty roll with a new one from the stash I bought under the sink  Besides the fact that they were inconsiderate slobs they guys would devour all of the food I purchased  One time I made lasagne from scratch  I took it out of the oven and set it on the stove to cool  While it was cooling I figured I had time to shower  During the twenty min I was showering those assholes ate the entire pan  I was fuming and they thought they were hilarious After a month I had had enough and decided to move out  My best friend moved at the same time because she had caught her boyfriend cheating  The guys were at work while we packed boxes and loaded them in the truck  In addition to taking everything that was mine including toilet paper I also packed up every newspaper magazine and paper product I could find  When everything was safely in the truck I went back into the house and proceeded to bake a large pan of brownies containing the secret ingredient exlax  The guys came home from work just as I was pulling them from the oven  I told them I had to take a load of my stuff to my new place and I would be back to get the brownies and some other stuff in about  minutes  They exchanged looks and grins amongst themselves and said Ok  I left and came back  min later just long enough to pop my head in the door and see an empty pan of brownies At the request of many I am editing the followup into my post  A few months later my friend got back with her boyfriend for a short time She had bad taste in men but was a loyal friend and never ratted me out She said that after three months the house still didnt smell right and there were several large dark stains on the carpet that had not been there when I left Her boyfriend told her that while they were broken up he and his buddies all got food poisoning at work They all worked in the same restaurant kitchen  His words to her were Horrible explosive diarrhea As I type this I feel an overwhelming sense of pride to report that numerous pants were shat a bucket and trash can became improvised commodes and tshirts utilized for wiping Apparently they discovered that socks not only werent absorbent enough they were quite abrasive to a raw asshole I shudder and smile simultaneously when I imagine them cleaning up the aftermath justice served,Sweet Sweet Revenge,968,pettyrevenge,top_all
calibur,110,206,17akqr,852,I was just reminded of this while chatting with some friends I know its a wall of text but trust me its worth the readWhen I was a child I was severely dehydrated because I had no natural thirst In attempt to get me to drink more often I was allowed to take a small cooler to school that contained different types of juices which I would be more inclined to drink than straight water This generally worked out fine but my second grade teacher was a real miserable bitch She was grossly fat morbidly obese always wore sleeveless muumuu dressthings that displayed the horrific growths in her unshaven armpits sported a steelwool mustache You know the typeThere are many examples of shit she did to me constantly keeping me inside during recess kept me from going to lunch one day I went home and told my mother about that one so it never happened again she cut my fucking hair in class when one of the other kids got gum stuck in it but the constant battle was the drink cooler At first she tried refusing to let me drink in class I was accustomed to having drinks at my desk and was always quiet about it never spilled and never taunted the other kids about it mostly because I really hated drinking even delicious juice and never saw having a special circumstance as something worth bragging about When she was overruled by the principalmy doctors note she started enforcing random rules about the drinks One instance I remember was while we were trying a new juice only it turned out to not really be a juice but was a weird JellO consistency thing in a bottle that was similar to a Mondo drink Ive always been repulsed by JellO ITS FUCKING CREEPY DONT JUDGE ME  and the taste made me gag even if the consistency wouldnt I wasnt allowed to throw it away I had to finish it in front of the class gagging and crying the whole time Keep in mind I was not the only object of her torment throughout the year There were a handful of other students she loved to single out and humiliateMy attitude toward this hateful bitch may come across as petty but I loved school until I had to stay with this bitch eight hours or longer when she kept me after school too a day for nearly a full year She killed my love for school I wont even begin to guess how she contributed to my subsequent depression and severe anxiety and I struggled right up until the day I graduatedThe revenge almost twenty years later I am a receptionist and a returning college student at the front desk of a nursing home One of my duties is control of petty cash which includes releasing funds from a residents private account I come in one morning last autumn to see a familiar surname on our resident roster Curious I check his personal information Sure enough his spouse is a certain miserable bitch who tormented me and destroyed my budding passion for academiaOne of my other duties is to accept guest meal orders It wasnt really intentional but the circumstances were perfect when she came down the first evening looking for food She showed up at my desk with labored breath from that dreadful elevator trek down one floor down from her husbands room and asked about how to get dinner I patiently explained the ordering process two choices for full meals a full variety of à la carte items to choose from etc and took her order When I told her it would cost  I got a blank stareBut my husband is staying hereYes and his meals are covered by the cost of his stay here As a visitor your meals are notWell thats stupid I dont have any money down here Annnnnnd it hits me Of course Its possible to withdraw the money from your husbands private account Would you prefer to do thatAnnoyed sigh YES This could be a beautiful thing Due to a recent unrelated incident we were cracking down on family members accessing a residents private account So naturally I respond cheerfullyOkay Are you your husbands Power of Attorney OH THE HATEFUL GLARE YESNo my sister is Internally Im so excited Im practically squirming I dont even wonder about why her sister would be her husbands PoA though I later check out his information and see that the sister is his health care proxy which is completely different Of course I remain coolly professionalUnfortunately you arent authorized to withdraw money from his account then I manage an empathetic frown as I pull out a withdrawl form for her however you can take this and have him sign it then have one of the nurses witness it and bring it back Once thats all taken care of I can order your meal right awayBut Im his wife I have authorization for all of his bank accounts YOUR TEARS ONLY MAKE ME STRONGER BITCHYes but this is a personal account through the care facility we are very careful about the security of these accounts as a patients trust in all aspects of the care they receive are of utmost importance to us It also prevents any legal complications that may arise from miscommunication She tries to argue some more but wielding a vocabulary full of syllables I quickly send her waddling back upstairs I know by this point that all of the nurses will be busy performing their evening care duties and she will have to waddle from one end of the unit to the other to find one that isnt elbowsdeep in bathing changing or feeding a resident Its almost half an hour before she returns panting for breath and covered in sweatI made that bitch go get a withdrawl request every single time she wanted to feed that fat fucking face  times a daytldr fat miserable second grade teacher torments a meek student destroying her

likewhatalready,98,195,1gazf1,844,This is the kind of petty revenge story that Im sure will bring in some haters but this IS about being petty  Back when I was in high school I worked at a local Stop and Shop as a porter cart bitch and mess cleaner I hated it a lot but I liked some of the people I worked with and it was a really easy job where I got to fuck off a bit and just hide behind the store or something and listen to music or watch movies on my iPod  I hated it though in large part due to the customers If you have ever worked in a food store or any service job you already understand People are miserable people are rude and they will take out their frustration on the minimum wage high school student  More often than not I worked the  closing shift on carts They had  hour shifts and I wasnt home from school until  or  most days so I never could work the  shift This story takes place during the night shift   I was pushing a long line of carts maybe about  of them They become a bitch to steer at this point but it was more efficient Maybe Probably not But the managers didnt like us doing this and I did it just to feel rebellious So Im pushing this line of carts and I have it angled perfectly to go into the store vestibule where the carts are Its going to be flawless I just gotta get it up the slight incline pain in the ass but good for water runoff  This is where Douchebag comes into play Douchebag comes flying into the parking lot off the highway in his Nissan Versa Cool car bro Anyway hes definitely driving at an unsafe speed for a grocery store parking lot Im about  of the way into the road really just the space between the store entrance and the parking spaces and pushing the carts pretty hard Douchebag doesnt care and doesnt slow down He finally realizes hes not going to make it I wasnt really aware of how fast he was going because it was in my peripherals and slams on his brakes and honks his horn He then just drives up the curb behind me and goes around the long way of the parking lot  I was on my way back into the parking lot and he was on his way into the store when we crossed paths Hes probably in his late s or early s with a goatee sunglasses its like  pm in February get real dude wifebeater and tatted arms He looks at me and says Watch where youre going with the carts fatty  So that was pretty uncalled for It didnt bother me that much because the guy is a loser and people are rude anyway But I still want revenge this Douchebag because its a pretty shitty way to treat people  I walked over to his car stuck two fingers down my throat and vomited up stomach acid on his drivers side door handle  TLDR  If you nearly run me over and call me a fatty Im going to vomit on your car,Dont mess with the people who will be near your car,1039,pettyrevenge,top_all

MHCII,72,218,1oq671,824,I worked in the service department at a certified German auto dealership for a year It was fun job because I got to drive some amazing cars I was the guy that handled all the money in the service department and took care of the loaner cars This meant that every customer in the service department got funneled to me When I wasnt handling clients cash I made sure every loaner car was clean and fueled up Its a simple job but were constantly busy I was able to keep up with the work and keep customers happy so the manager was always happy to have my back when I needed himWe had some pretty cool customers For example we had a guy with a Carrera GT invite us onto his yacht to watch the th of July fireworks We also had a nice little lady that brought in a plate of better than sex cake for us every time she visited this cake really was better than sex The vast majority of our clients were pleasant but Ive had my fair share of difficult customers as wellOther than getting to drive s and Ms all day the best part of my job was the petty revenge I got to dish out on the difficult customers Normally the car I loaned you depended on the car you brought in Mercedes gets a C class Porsche gets a Panamera BMW gets a i Audi gets an A However the management gave me discretion to deal with customers that were a pain in the ass We had a couple of Hondas that we kept around just for the difficult customers If you gave me shit I might run out of Mercedes and give you a Honda Accord instead Hondas are great cars but theres something about going from German to Japanese that annoys entitled pricks Of course its never my fault that we ran out of Mercedes so theres nothing they can do about being stuck with a Japanese car other than huff and puff about itIf petty revenge were a competition I had a winning streak that would have put George Foremans boxing record to shame No difficult customer went unpunished Like George Foreman however my winning streak had to come to an end Our new service writer told me that an outoftowner hambeast needed a loaner car while we serviced her Mercedes the new guys always got the new customers so they could build up their clientéle By outoftowner I mean this lady drove twoandahalf hours north from Irvine to reach us Kinda strange but whateverHambeast walks over to my department where I go over the rental car agreement with her dont damage the car no pets  flat fee etc When I got to the loaner fee she flipped her shit Everybody in proximity turned their heads as she shouted about the  fee Jesus Christ lady If you can afford a Mercedes you can certainly afford a  rental car Im given discretion to waive the loaner fee if its a really good customer but I refuse to give her a free car She storms off to New Guy and makes him waive her loaner feeWhatever She got her way and didnt have to pay for the car Hope she enjoys her free Honda OH SHIT We ran out of Hondas and only had a Mercedes left for her I had to give her the Mercedes now there was nothing I could do about it I knew I was defeated so I downtroddenly handed her the keys to the Cclass loaner car She snatched the keys from my hand grabbed her dog out of her car and placed it into the loaner car NO PETS and drove off victoriouslyLater in the day New Guy handed me a pair of loaner keys to check back into the system They belonged to Hambeasts loaner car I went over to inspect her loaner car and found the front seat covered in fur and vomit Im only  sure it was the dogs fault Hambeast was nowhere to be found New Guy ringed her out while I was busy with other customers and gave her back her own car This was a huge nono because I have to check the rental cars for damages before giving the customer back their own car Hambeast circumvented the loaner car inspection got her own car back and escaped before I could discover the dog vomitAs soon as I told my manager what just happened and have him ask me why the hell I didnt give her the Honda he picked up the phone and called her He demanded she come back to the dealership and pay to get the car cleaned she refused You can fuck with the employees all day but never EVER fuck with the manager He banned her from the dealership on the spot When she heard this she shrieked in a fit of rage and hung up on usRemember how she lived  hours away from us Well we called the dealership in Irvine and asked if they knew about her They laughed and told us she was banned from their dealership They told us that she moved on to the next closest dealership When they got sick of her shit she got banned and had to get serviced at the next dealership Then the next one Then the next one She pissed off so many dealerships that she had to drive  hours north or jump the border to Mexico to get to a dealership she wasnt banned fromUnfortunately for her the next closest dealership was a  hour drive north of us This was great for our business because we covered a large geographical area But for Hambeast that meant that if she needed her car serviced she would need to take another  hour drive on top of the  hours she had to drive from Irvine Five hours of driving just to get to the northern dealership Jokes on her though We warned the northern dealership about her and they preemptively banned herWe never heard from Hambeast again Mercedes customers are fiercely loyal to the brand so theres no way she would sell the car just so she could get another brand serviced in Irvine Some say Hambeast is still driving up the coast of California looking for a dealership thatll put up with her shit Others say she traveled to Nevada to get her car serviced Either way New Guy learned a valuable lesson and never made that mistake ever againTLDR Unlike Jesus I speak of my own Accord,Treat your loaner car like shit Your closest servicing center is now  hours away,1042,pettyrevenge,top_all

JudgmentalOwl,44,307,1mtgjm,796,I want to make one thing clear before I tell this story I never considered the girl this is about my friend and in all honesty thought she was a rude cunt With that knowledge in hand lets continueMy girlfriends brothers ex wrote all over my car window with a dry erase marker telling me to stop parking like an asshole and pull up more when I parked on the street next to her houseWhat this bitch had to have realized is that the reason I never pulled up was because if I did Id have to park under a tree that a bunch of shit eating pigeons hung out in I made that mistake only once and my car was promptly covered in pigeon shit because of thisIm guessing she knew this too but instead of just parking on the other side of the street and walking her fat ass an extra  feet to get to the house she felt it prudent to draw all over my car in an attempt to passively and aggressively intimidate me into pulling forward so that she could claim the spot A spot mind you that had always been a first come first serve sort of spotI confronted her about this asking why she felt the need to deface my property by drawing snide remarks all over my car windows instead of just talking to me about it like an adult She laughed in my face and in the bitchiest tone she could muster said Oh I was just joking Couldnt you tellI simply smiled and told her that I didnt like to park under the tree because the pigeons living there dropped more shit from their perches daily than bombs the Luftwaffe dropped on London in all of WW I told her the spot is first come first serve and that I never once complained when she snagged it first  I then told her to please wash the marker off of my car and all would be forgiven Of course the bitch refuses to clean up her mess and proceeds to laugh in my face some more At this point I just walked away because I was starting to get pissedFast forward about a month and I still think about what this bitch did every time I see her pasty fat face and Sonny Moore wanna be hair cut So Im pulling up to visit my girlfriend and notice that super bitch is parked in the good spot so I park on the other side of the street As I am getting out I notice my SOs brothers car is gone and guess he and thundercunt are gone for the dayAs I am walking past the demon bitches car I get this gloriously mischievous devious idea in my head I immediately walk up to her door and try the handle and guess what friends Yes you got it She left her fucking door unlocked I quickly disengage the parking break and proceed to push her shitty civic underneath the pigeons shit stained lair I giggle like a school girl the whole time and hustle inside when the deed is done All that is left for me to do now is waitTurns out whore tits and the brother were having a beach day so her car was underneath the shit zone for a good  hours By the time they came home in the evening her car had been covered caked and slimed with a full days worth of pigeon excrement She stormed into the house demanding to know who moved her car I proceeded to laugh in her face exclaiming Oh I was just joking Couldnt you tell I had the biggest shit eating grin on my face and the whole family just burst into laughter Needless to say she was upset with me and stormed off without another word That day was one that I basked in the glorious light of victory and one that will never be forgottenEdit The more I read the title the more I dislike it This post was originally a comment I left in another thread and I just took the TLDR from that comment and made it the title I should have titled this something like That Michelin man motherfucker will never draw on my car again,Dont you ever fucking draw on my car with dry erase marker you Michelin man looking motherfucker,1103,pettyrevenge,top_all

hockeychick,92,179,17rruh,768,I am currently enrolled in a Chemistry  lab at my University and my lab partner is a thickheaded moron  I wouldnt mind working with someone who doesnt understand the material but hes not just stupid Hes lazy and hes an asshole  Examples     First day of class he blunders in  minutes late to an am class shouts his apologies loudly and then refuses to take the quiz because I just transferred in from another Chemistry  class so I shouldnt be responsible for this quiz all the classes cover the same material The TA made him take the quiz anyway saying she wouldnt grade it and he got a  anyway   Second day of class one of the girls at our table asks if he can move his chair closer to the table so she can walk by and he shouts that he cant possibly move a chair with wheels so she a  pound little asian girl can walk by He then mumbles something rude about her when she walks away    So by the third class Ive had it with this guy Its a Friday morning lab and Im not a morning person so my patience is already worn thin He decides that he wants to get out of the lab as soon as possible so he decides that we should only perform the experiment once instead of  times so we can get out of there and just fudge the data  Now Im all for taking shortcuts but this is just plain dishonest But hes a big guy really intimidating so I become a pushover and let him do this  The first time we I did the experiment I messed up and requested that we do it a second time So after this I had data of two experiments and he had nothing since the lazy ass wont write anything down  As he is surfing twitter on his iPhone I take out a sheet of paper and say Im writing down the data for your lab report and completely skew my data so his is all off Add ten here subtract  here take the average wrong etc  He snatches the paper off the table and runs out before am  Since it is a  hour lab I still have  hours to finish the experiment by myself and do the report So I finished it did the report and gave it to my TA before     I cant wait to see his face next Friday when he gets a big fat  on his lab and I get a perfect    I also plan on emailing my TA and requesting to work by myself Anything is better than working with this waste of space,You get the grade you earned,947,pettyrevenge,top_all
outofphase,80,137,1h09vg,768,So as someone who has adult ADD for years now Ive been prescribed Dexedrine ER extended release I just moved into my current apartment three months ago and to help with the bills I found a roommate via craigslist Lets call him Ron Ron seemed like a decent guy Hes in his midtwenties like me is a musician like me said he was a clean guy had a decent  job downtown Everything seemed like it would be greatIt was right about a month after we moved in  one morning I went to take my pill for the day and noticed that it seemed like there were a decent amount missing I counted and sure enough I was short by  I only take  a day every morning before work at  AM on the dot and Ive never given any out so I knew something was upI asked Ron about it casually not wanting to sound accusatory Hey man I just noticed Im missing a bunch of my ADD pills have you had anybody over recently who mightve taken some Im not pissed just curiousNope He sounded totally uninterested and didnt even look up from his laptopAlright man Just checking I shrugged it off even though I knew someone or something had to have removed ten pills from my bottle I decided to start keeping them in my room instead of in the bathroom cupboard just to be safeBecause of this theft I had to go  days without my pills I take a relatively low dose so it wasnt that big of a deal I didnt go through any sort of withdrawal that Im aware of but it certainly threw me off at work I work with computers and have to deal with quite a lot of text  something that without Dexedrine I find almost impossible to do without my mind wandering haplesslyWhen I finally got my prescription refilled I made sure to count them out There were exactly  the correct amount for a month I decided to start counting them every  days so that I could hopefully notice if any went missing with some sort of accuracy Sure enough when I counted for the second time I noticed that there were  missing I began to think it could be Ron I usually keep the door to my room closed and none of his friends seemed like the type who would go through a strangers roomOn top of this Ron and I were already at each others throats He turned out to be a lot messier than he initially led on Im not very anal about cleanliness the policy I had adopted with him was sort of a do whatever you want in your room just help me keep the kitchen and living room clean He had a hard time adhering to this policy he would never do his dishes until there were no clean dishes left he would leave beer cans and pizza boxes all over the living room he would use my shampoo bodywash toilet paper and towels and he was always so late on rent that Id have to cover him for a couple weeks each month Hed torrent things stream videos and use so much bandwidth that I could barely use the internet connection I was solely paying for Ron was turning out to be not a very nice personI confronted him about the pills again and this time I was very forward about it Ron do you have any idea why Im missing  of my DexedrineNo man would you fucking leave it alone It wasnt me okay He was incredibly defensiveAlright alright If you are taking them though I need you to stop I shouldnt have to hide my pills in my own apartment I was trying to keep my coolWhatever dude Im heading out Later He leftI decided if I couldnt get him to admit it and if I couldnt find out who it was I could at least make them pay for it I had a plan I bought some empty capsules from a vitamin shop and some maximum strength exlax pills I went through the painstaking process of opening the dexedrine capsules and putting the little beads into my new capsules I ground up a bunch of exlax pills and filled the old dexedrine capsules with the exlax I only made  fake dexedrine pills as I was feeling lazy and it was hard to get the old capsules to stay put back togetherAfter putting the fake pills back in my original bottle I put it back on my desk exactly where it would normally be and put the real Dexedrine in a baggy and hid it The fake pills didnt look too believable but I figured whoever was stealing them probably wasnt examining them very carefully anyway Now it was time to waitA mere three days later I get home from work and go and sit at my computer I notice that all of the fake exlax filled pills are missing A few hours later I hear someone go in the bathroom I immediately hear some of the most awful disgusting noises Ive ever heard in my life along with some pretty intense breathinggroaning I go and knock on the door and say You okay in thereUgh yeah I just have the shits man Reallllly bad shits Its gonna be a while sorry Lo and behold it was Rons voice coming from the bathroom Victory was mineRon has since moved out After not paying rent for a month I explained the situation to my landlord and he asked him to leave But for the next two days after the original diarrhea episode on more than several occasions I heard Ron groaning in the bathroom I can only assume that he didnt make the connection between the pills and his shits and continued to take them Moral of the story dont steal shit from your roommates and dont take pills that arent yours Not only is it potentially dangerous but in Rons case its just a shitty thing to doTLDR My ass of a roommate keeps stealing my pills I swap them with laxatives and instead of a buzz he gets massive diarrhea,Finally got sweet hilarious revenge on a recurring thief,905,pettyrevenge,top_all

Tightanium,87,250,1pm6r8,747,I was out running errands last weekend enjoying my time off from a stressful work week I was walking out of the grocery store when I see a middle aged lady with grocery bags she was looking through them probably for a specific item because she made this face and began rummaging through her purse she had maybe  or  grocery bags and when she decided to go back in im assuming for the missing item she started taking the items out of their bags placing them in her car and just dropped the empty bags on the ground and locked her car and went back inokay bitch game fucking on it was time to do some recon I snag the bags she left put them in my car and go in to see how far along she was on her second store trip she was in the back of the store in the dairy milk frozen section PERFECT I had AT LEAST  minutes I headed to the toolsappliance section and immediately looked for some duct tape clear tape masking tape whatever I grab the clear tape since its by far the best the kind that you use with tape guns and I check out I look around at the registers for the lady but she isnt around meaning shes still shopping again PERFECT I go out to my car and grab her bags the way she was parked made it so that she would walk up to the front of her car she wouldnt even see the back so I took the tape cut some off and taped one back to the underside of her car in the very back I made it so that maybe if for some reason she was back there she might not see it I proceeded to do this to each of the bags so that when she gets going on her journey the bags will just be flapping in the wind and she will never know until someone tells her or she investigates herself so I waited in my car for her to come out and as luck would have it she didnt even get near the back of her car she started it up and zoomed off out of the parking lot I follow her for maybe  miles as I turned off the street toward my place she still hadnt noticed and the  bags were just a flappin in the windGG miss litter queen,so you like littering,997,pettyrevenge,top_all

photolouis,102,163,1h97z7,738,When I got a call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft and telling me there was a problem with my computer I knew I was getting scammed They get victims to allow a remote computer to access their machine and install whatever spywear and malware they want I had some free time so I thought Id entertain myselfWhen he said he wanted me to open my computer I told him OK but this will take a little while Id make all sorts of metalsounding noises and grunt occasionally OK its open Now what It took several minutes of nothing happening and my naive descriptions before he clued in to the fact that I had taken the case off my computer and unplugged it from everything Actually I was just doing the dishes It took several more minutes to get the case back on and figure out which wires went wear You know my cousin set this up for me so I dont know about it so much Its pretty hard you know Now how is it you know that my computer has problems He goes on about TCPIP and whatnot and Im baffled of course Does that mean Microsoft is spying on me No That how come you know my computer is so slow He goes on about junk files but his pronunciation is so bad that I hear something entirely different and have to make him spell it phonetically Oh junk files I thought you was saying something differentMy computer is very slow naturally so it takes some time to boot OK Im putting in my password  dang I spelled it wrong Just a minute Dang I got the big letter key stuck or something It does that sometimes Say how come they have that key anyway Whys it so big How come its so much bigger than the Delete key I use the Delete key a lot more than that one Hell I never use that oneHe has me look for the Windows key on the keyboard Its next to the control key Control key Is that a key Im supposed to use for something That sounds important  Can I control stuff with that My buddy can control his TV with his computer Is that what thats for That should probably be a big key if its so important  bigger than that big letter key anyway It takes several minutes to get him to finally get me to the run dialog box By that point Ive had to shout to someone off camera that Im busy and Ill be with them soon I did this three times before finally telling the helpful technician that I have to go because some idiot needs my help I dont know what the hell theyd do without me here I tell the technician that he can call me later  when Im outHe calls the next day and let him run through the whole script again careful to have him repeat stuff we covered before I apologize about not being able to stay on the phone with him before You know I told those guys to take the doors off before they go downstairs with the fridge I told em But they got stuck and the guy at the bottom couldnt get the door off so we had to get a guy to get the tools and climb over the fridge so he could the other guy get the door off Im glad that want a good fridge You know we had that fridge for the longest time It was a good fridge but it was just running all the time and the ice didnt get cold enough and so anyway we decided  He hands me over to another tech and I have him go through the issues about my computer again and he has to step me through the processWhen I press the Windows key Im careful to release it before pressing r so instead of the run dialog box Windows pulls up all the  programs starting with the letter R It takes some minutes for the tech to figure out what Ive done I finally get the Run command Im supposed to enter a web address and he gives me every letter phonetically and makes me repeat it back Yeah I got it shown my pc spelled SHOWN  MY  PC He hears that as showmypc and cant figure out why its not working After several respelling we get it right At this point Im editing some images and can quickly jump between his requests and my real work on the computer So Im not wasting too much of my own timeYeah well something popped up but its all white What Oh it says something about not being able to find it After some retries I ask if my computer should be connected to the internet Oh OK let go find that wire You know I dont use this so much just to check email from my cousin Maybe my wife should do this You want to talk to her No its all right she downstairs Itll only take a minute No just wait here she uses this more than me Hes still on the line when I get back Naw she says shes too busy I dont know why she so busy when this is so important I ramble on about something I have no luck connecting to shownmypc of course so he tells me hes going to transfer me to another technician During the transfer I hang up He calls back a few minutes later apologizing about losing me I make the new tech run me through the commands to get to run and I screw em all up again Just when we get to the point where he can almost taste the access to my machine I start into a rambling story and hang up He calls back a minute later and apologizes I go back to my story and just as we get to the climax I hang up again Before he gets a chance to call back I call a talkative friend and spend an hour shooting the breeze Within minutes of hanging up the phone right I let the machine get it but the caller does not leave a message It rings again and again and still no message Ill wait until later today and pick up the phone and make up a good story I wonder how long I can keep this fish on the hookTLDR Scammers try to take control of my PC I act like a moron and take control of their time instead,You think Im stupid enough to fall for your scam

YesYouCannot,204,218,1r7zub,733,So I have an  year old nephew who can be pretty alright sometimes but is normally quite a brat especially when something gets in the way of his gaming addiction If you tell him to get off his PS at am on a school day hell chuck a tantrum and throw his controls across the room and kick everything in his room over Sometimes when you give him helpful advice hed palm it off and act like he knows everything already and what youre telling him is useless or wrong in a very stubborn wayAnyway the other day he was at home on a school day I woke up when his mum he and his mum live in the house with us had already left for work I assumed immediately that he had told his mum he felt sick and wanted to stay home something he does a lot and something she gives in to a lot After having to experience this many times I knew straight away the day would entail him screaming and yelling on Skype with his friends whilst playing his PS I decided that even though I wasnt certain of his excuse for being at home on a school day I figured his recent outbursts against his grandmother my mum and owner of the house entitled him to a bit of karma So I turned off the router He had no internet for the entire day which meant no online gaming with all his friends and no Skyping either It was great The entire day he was at home I heard barely a sound from his room also the justice for his despicable and ungrateful behaviour towards his grandmother made it all the betterLater during the day as I was getting ready to leave the house some  hours after he had been awake I walked past his room and heard him on Skype with his friends It was very civil and didnt involve loud screaming which I think normally only happens when hes gaming with them I was impressed by his good behaviour He approached me after he saw me and asked what was wrong with the internet He said he had been playing offline mode all day and had to Skype with his friends on his iPhone his mum spoils him which I think explains a lot of his abhorrent behaviour I palmed it off and said I didnt know because I didnt want him to know how easy of a solution it was but had the intention to turn the router back on before I left the house I figured that although he had played games all day and probably lied to his mother to stay at home he had been relatively good today compared to other days so I figured Id cut him some slackAs I finally finished getting ready and started going downstairs to turn on the router before I left he approached me asking me again if I knew what was wrong with the internet and if I could please fix it He was very polite at this point so I was quite happy to help him I continued to say I didnt know what was wrong with the internet but Ill check soon and then mentioned that he could actually connect his PS to his mobile for internet He for some reason became very defensive at this and kept telling me You cant do that Ive tried it and it doesnt work I told him yes you can I use my mobile phone to connect to my computer to the internet all the time I told him my friends connect their PSs to their mobiles all the time too a lie but I just wanted him to know that you can do it He started telling me I was wrong and that my friends were probably doing it on the XBOX and that PSs cant do that So I told him that if his PS connects through WiFi then it definitely can connect to a mobile phone to use internet I spent around  minutes calmly trying to explain to him that he can use his mobile phone to tether whilst he kept butting in to rebut everything without even listening to what I was trying to teach him I ended up snapping at him Fine You know what If youre going to have that attitude when I try to help you then Im not going to bother checking on the internet He didnt say anything went into his room and angrily slammed the door I didnt care and just left the house He spent the rest of the day gaming without internet and knowing that was deeply satisfying for me Not only that but I intend on doing this to him every time hes at home from now on I cant wait for his school holidays to start where hell be at home all day without internetAlso I found out later that day that his mum didnt even know he skipped school until she got a call from a teacher Apparently he just decided to take the day off to play games so what little remorse I had for what I did all went down the drainEdit Holy shit woke up to so many comments Will begin replying now Sorry for the delay  scratch that will reply in an hour or two after I do some errands firstEdit Whilst most of my comments show how bad my nephew and my sister his mother can be I do want you to know that this isnt a constant thing They can be very nice and loving and caring people sometimes and I still love them they just drive me insane sometimes haha,Okay you can play in offline mode then,951,pettyrevenge,top_all

BenBraddock,48,164,1mlxng,715,Sorry this is so longWorking at a restaurant you learn that a lot of people have little idiosyncrasies and preferences that can be a bit annoying but more often then not its not a big deal in the least In fact if youre any good at your job it can be pretty rewarding to make someones night with a little extra thought There are however those people who are thoroughly aware of the dynamic and take advantage of the situation They use their night out to work out some deep rooted sadistic tendencies nodoubt instilled by what can only be assumed to be a horrific existence Sadly when you get a table like this and theyre so easy to spot theres really nothing you can do but take it its not worth losing your job or getting the managers mad at you and losing the much needed hours A little while ago I was working a shift at a very busy large restaurant at a very popular tourist trap The kind of place that doubles the price of your entree because we have a pretty view and claims their staff is a big family that exists only to serve Anyway a friend of mine gets a table like this and theyre honestly beyond the average degree of terrible Anytime something displeased them they shouted as if announcing it to the rest of the guests and my friend would turn beet red Theyd got upset at things like Her fork is cold how come I dont get a cold fork Well Maam traditionally we only provide a chilled fork with salads but Id be happy to bring you oneDont be making excuses Dont give me attitude because you fucked up and Im calling you on it Just get me the damn forkRidiculous things like this Or throwing a fit because this particular seafood restaurant didnt have tater tots What kind of classy place doesnt give the customer what they wantThere was a problem with everything They were the kinds of people who started setting in the ground work for a free dessert before they step through the doors And you could tell that they were good at what they did they mustve been given free desserts at every meal for years Its the only explanation for frankly impressive level  of obese theyd become considering how cheap they were Well our city had realized they could make loads off tricky parking metersrules and wed get a lot of questions from our customers needing explanations Another important detail to note is that while there were expensive meters and parking lots near the restaurant there was a MASSIVE hill a few blocks up where youd have to park if the place was busy Easily a  minute walk up this steep hill to the nearest parking spots And it seems that they people had to park waaay up there At one point near the end of their meal the guy waves me down and asks What time is it safe to park without filling the meter Its about six now its fine right Knowing full well that parking was free at six I realized this was an opportunity to get in some petty revenge I looked him dead in the eye and said Oh gee Im not exactly sure but Im pretty certain it doesnt end until  You know were so busy around here I think they made it later then normal And if I were you Id check just in case theyre very strict about ticketing around hereThe guy rolls his eyes wheezes and lifts himself out of his poor chairI saw him like  minutes later red faced and sweating His buddies ended up having to wait for him before they ordered dessert but by then I guess they were too tired to try and scam us for a free sundaeTLDR Obese man was cruel to his waitress and I pretended not to know the parking laws so hed have to trek  minutes up the hill only to realize metered parking had ended hours ago ,An obese man was cruel to his waitress so I tricked him into exercising,879,pettyrevenge,top_all

foobnum,41,154,180ghf,711,I love this subreddit  I have a story for you guysThis story took place just over  years ago  I worked for a pretty upscale hotel night manager for a few years  I had two other night auditors on my team one of them being the relief night manager who had become a really good friend  This hotel had a real bitch of a GM but working nights I just heard the horror stories from the day staff and I never really had to deal with her until one morning when she came in really early with the operations manager to have a talk with me  Apparently they read the key log from a previous night and wanted to know why I was going in and out of a vacant guest room that had been left dirty by housekeeping  I explained my laundry machine had broken down at home and I was washing doing some laundry at the hotel while on my shift  I was severely reprimanded and threatened to be fired which was a bit excessive in my opinion by I understood that it was wrong  I was a loyal hardworking employee and that was the only thing I had done wrong a lapse of judgment by meFast forward a year later and I am finding that working nights is not working out for me anymore I have trouble sleeping during the day and its really taking a toll on my health  I love the hotel and the company though so I stick it out until two day opportunities open up  One is a daytime duty manager position on the front desk and the other is an accounts payable position  I have the experience and knowledge so I interview for both and am told by the controller and the front office manager that they both want me and I just have to make a choice  I am quite excited and I have a meeting with the bitch GM to discuss where to go but during the meeting she puts the brakes on my daytime employment dreams  She tells me she doesnt want me in either position and she wants me to continue working nights  I explain my reasons for wanting a day position and she says I will not get any of those positions but she will find me a housekeeping or janitorial job in the day if I really want to  FUCK THAT  That night my drunk girlfriend pops into the hotel to visit and we let ourselves into the bitch GMs office and have sex all over her desk not cleaning anything up after  I type up my resignation giving two weeks notice  Upon seeing what was happening the relief night manager says and I quote fuck this shit if you are quitting then so am I  He types his resignation as well giving his two weeks notice  We want to be fair to the third night auditor so we call him up the next morning and explain what happened and he decides to give his notice as well  The next night the three of us are scheduled and we celebrate by showing up a few hours late and quite intoxicated  We make it through the shift and the three of us spent the remainder of our two weeks notice either calling in sick or taking lieu days  Having the whole night audit team up and quit with no notice left the hotel fucked  We heard stories of the operations manager working nights and even the GM having to pull night shifts because there was nobody else never mind the lack of training and the fact that nobody else knew how the night procedures  The aftermath the positions I applied for were both filled by hiring from the outside  The girl who was hired for the DM position was fired within a couple weeks for sleeping with one or more or the bellmen  The accounts payable person was fired about  weeks in for being useless  I went on to find a great job for an extremely great company as an accountant and they are paying for me to become a CGA  I still see the old bitchy GM around town and I make sure to give her a big smile and waveTLDR Bitch GM holds grudge fucks me over so I fuck someone in her office fuck over her hotel,Dont mess with your night employees,865,pettyrevenge,top_all

fotoTaker,40,147,1o9n8r,690,Back in college I worked the front desk of a luxury hotel in the north Dallas area One night we had a douchebag who needed an extra suitcase just to carry his attitude He acted very condescending tossing his credit card on the counter while I held my hand outstretched All the while looking around too amazing to bother to make eye contact with a lowly serf like me He asked for the biggest room we had Even though we were at less than half capacity and I could have given him any choice of excellent rooms I put him in room  Not only was it on the inside of the curve so the room was smaller than the other side of the hotel but room  was extra special About  months earlier a man had passed away in his sleep Housekeeping would stop by to clean the room but when they saw him in bed they quietly closed the door This went on for four days until management checked on him since he was due to check out We never could get the smell out of the room It wasnt overpowering but you could definitely smell something We usually avoided checking people in to room  unless we were overbooked I hope Mr Asshole enjoyed the funk,Assholes get checked in to room  where the dead guy was found after four days,837,pettyrevenge,top_all
AmaterasusBrush,42,127,1n3uu8,694,I live on the border of Texas and Mexico and every day thousands of people cross from Mexico to Texas Because there are so many people there is a special express lane in which you can pass with usually zero line In order to use this lane you have to pay  a year per car   per person and go through a background check Since most people use this lane to go to school andor work the biggest rush is from  AM Even though its the express line you can still be in line for  minutes before crossing which is still a lot better than the  hours you take in the regular line A lane oneway street goes perpendicular to the bridge at which point one of the lanes turns into the line while the other lane continues This means that there is no protection from people who want to cut in lineTo the story today the line was especially long like maybe km and after  minutes I was almost at the turn to enter the bridge when I saw the Hummer behind me leave a small space in front and another car rush in from the other lane and cut the Hummer off The Hummer blared its horn but yknow what can you do So this means the asshole behind me shaved  minutes off of his commute while making everyone who was still in lines commute longer ClassyOf course watching this I couldnt help but do something about it After allowing the line to advance a little bit so he would think hes golden I turned on both of my blinkers edged closer to the sidewalk and stopped completely Its not uncommon for cars to overheat after standing in line in the sun for so long so I watched the guy curse and start maneuvering around me into the other lane As soon as he was next to me I accelerated and stuck ridiculously close to the car in front of me The Hummer behind me followed suit and the asshole had no choice but to do a uturn and try to edge in somewhere else as I doubt he learned his lesson and went to the back But at least I made his day that much worse,Cutting in line behind me is a bad idea,821,pettyrevenge,top_all

MrSnap,136,158,14ijp6,692,I apologize for walloftext and if this one is a little too technical  This involves a somewhat popular cardbased trading game MTG  I tried to strip out as many unnecessary details as possible to make it easy to read  Plus I dont remember them allI usually am not the one to take revenge since Im riskaverse  However in this case I found it was the most logical thing to do since I knew ahead of time that the other guy was going to try and screw meThere was this fellow in my high school  His name was David  He was one grade above me and he was a complete asshole a compulsive liar and a compulsive cheaterOften times during lunch hour students would get together at the tables to play card games and such  I usually got involved in these games as well  David did too but not as often  When he did I watched him  Honestly this kid fascinated me since he was completely blatant about his lying and cheating  I remember distinctly watching him play a game of Magic The Gathering with another student and I would watch him take   even  cards at a time when he should have only been drawing   His opponent was completely oblivious to this and was so concerned about her own cards to really pay attention to what David was doing  I just kept my mouth shut  Pretty soon he had something like  cards in his hand while his opponent had   It was very ridiculousI usually avoided playing with him but I must have played with him at least once  He would continue to cheat in the open until you called him on it  Of course he would try to lawyer himself out of it or tell me I got it wrong  He would try to change the rules of the game to benefit him in the moment for his specific situation  He would throw a fit if you tried to argue and would only back down if you got the whole audience to agree unanimously that he was wrong  Playing him was an exhausting experience since you spend more time arguing and watching him than playing the gameIt was  at the time and I had played some Magic The Gathering MTG  I was nearly finished with this game since all the great expansions came out before I even got involved and people with money held all the power cards  I had dropped my own money in the new expansion Fallen Empires which turned out to be one of the worst expansions ever made in the games history  Therefore I was pretty sour and was basically giving up the game since I didnt see how I could ever catch upA guy I knew Alex decided to organize a starter pack tournament where the players had to compete with only the cards they got with the starter pack  This sounded like an interesting variation on the game and I thought I might join to try and squeeze some fun out of this game I was quickly losing interest inIncidentally David joined this tournament  Now his reputation was well known by Alex but he let David join anyway  The logic being that he needed people even if those people were assholes  There was only something like  people in the tournament so it was hard to argue with thatCan you guess whom my first match was against    Thats right  It was fuckface himself  DavidNow I didnt want to lawyer and argue with David the whole game since that was no fun at all  If I was going to play him I wanted to completely royally screw him over and embarrass him in front of the whole player tournament  A sort of preemptive revenge for the shit I know he was going to pull on me Knowing that he was going to cheat ahead of time gave me some unique opportunities  I felt it relieved me of any ethical obligation to play a fair game  I needed to stack the deck in my favor so to speak  Let me explain what I didSo each player was given a starter pack and one booster pack MTG Revised Edition for those who care  This gave you an assortment of cards that made overall fairly weak decks  Most games resulted in waiting for the person to get enough land to play a monster and start doing damage against their opponent  Any sizeable monster in play usually results in that player winning since our decks were so weakIn order to give yourself a chance of getting the right cards you need to strip out all the fluff that was going to do you no good  So your cards were divided into your active playing deck and your reject pile  You only played with your active deck  At the end of the game the winner gets to draw at random a card to keep from the losers active deck or your reject pile  Its the winners choice    This is important laterMy deck had an unusually useful card for this sort of tournament called a Demonic Tutor  It essentially lets you go through your own deck and pick out the exact card you want  If I ever got this card it would be my key to winning since I could pick out the only monster I have that actually does damage  So now I have two chances of winning  If I draw my monster or draw the Demonic TutorDavid also had an unusually useful card in his deck as well  I think it was some kind of rare card and he cherished it so much  I dont remember what card it was but I remember it did him no good against me   My goal was to completely win the match and then pilfer his Precious Rare at randomTo prepare I took my uberpowerful Demonic Tutor card and oh so gently put a tiny fold in the top right corner of the card  This way if you put it in a deck you can see it stand out from all the other cards  You only see this if you know what to look for  When we met for our match we get to browse each others cards so we know what to expect  I browsed through his deck and took out his Precious Rare to admire  While David was too busy looking through my cards I put the same tiny fold in his rare card and put it back in his deck  I didnt have time to check if it stood out so I crossed my fingersNext we shuffled our cards  Since I could see where my Demonic Tutor was I shuffled it carefully so that it was below the  mark in my deck  So when he cut my deck theres a good chance that the Demonic Tutor would end up near the top  If I didnt end up getting this card I have a second chance of getting the monster insteadLuckily when he cut my deck he cut it above my Demonic Tutors location so I was good to go in that department  Next I cut his deck but since I could see where his Precious Rare was located I made sure to cut the deck so that his card was as close to the bottom as possible and wouldnt show up during the match  David was too selfabsorbed to suspect that anyone other than himself might have evil intentionsThings are going well so far and Im starting to feel bad for David  Im starting to question whether what Im doing is the right thing  These doubts are quickly erased by subsequent eventsWe start to play  My job here at this point was to watch him like a hawk and call him out every time he tries to cheat  And try he did  He tried to do the whole multiple carddraw on me  I called him out on it  David tried to act like it was an accident  This got the tournament organizers attention and David a verbal tongue lashing from AlexAlex basically told David to stop acting like an asshole and play the game  This had the effect of crucially destroying Davids credibility and getting everyone in the room on my side  I shined a spotlight on his douchey ways so to speakNext thing he did was try to lawyer his way to do something that was clearly against the rules  Of course I made a calm but loud enough scene for everyone to notice and eventually called Alex over again to adjudicate  Alex told him hes full of shit and ruled in my favorSoon enough I had the Demonic Tutor in my hand after several turns since it was near the top  By this time I had all that I needed but the monster  I pretended to act joyful and surprised when I threw down my Demonic Tutor and went rifling through my deck to get that monster  Davids face started to go red and his body was very agitatedThe next round I threw that monster on the table with gusto  I celebrated with Yes and I cant believe it   The other people in the room were starting to admire my skill and good luck  They were really watching my game now and clearly wanting to see me winThe best David can do at this point is pull out a monster to block me or somehow get rid of my monster  Knowing that the only card that has a hope of achieving that is his Precious Rare safely at the bottom of his deck I was inwardly confident but acted nervous to lead him on that he actually had a chance of pulling one outEvery subsequent round I would attack him with the monster pinging his life down  Of course during this time nothing good came out of his deck  Slowly his chances for winning dwindled and his fury grewThen it was over  I celebrated and other people in the room marveled at my amazing play style  David was so mad he was shaking  Whenever he spoke he was petulant and angryWhile I was making a big show of celebrating my good fortune David had already planned and executed his next cheat  He took both his active pile and his reject pile and mixed them together as soon as the game ended  If you recall these piles are supposed to be separate so that I could choose which pile to pilfer from  By mixing them up he reduces the chance that Ill randomly take any of his good cards including his Precious RareI immediately called him out on it as hes mixing them together  He starts arguing about the tournament rules and his interpretation of them  I make a big show of arguing and acting like I was cheated  Honestly it didnt matter that he did this since I could still see where his Precious Rare was  This final act of cheating showed his petulance and completely ruined any reputation he had in the roomI called over Alex the organizer to adjudicate and demand restitution    Clearly there was no way to unmix the decks unless you have an entropy reversal device so the damage was done  Alex called David an asshole for what he did and Alex tried to placate my hurt feelingsActing hurt and angry I told him Fine  Lets get this over with  David had a smirk under his face thinking hed finally pulled one over on me  Oh how wrong he wasWhile making a show of concentration and trepidation I spread his deck out and made a show of going after a card but changing my mind a couple times  Finally at random I pulled out the card with the tiny folded corner and with drama turned it around to show everyone at the same time that it was the Precious RareImmediately David let out a scream of anger that made the whole room silent   He quickly packed up all his crap and stomped out of the room  But I had his Precious RareEveryone was overjoyed that I had completely and totally demolished David and dealt a slice of righteous karmic justice at the same time  We all agreed how much of an asshole he was and that he got what he deserved  Honestly it was the highlight of the tournamentDavid dropped out of the tournament after that and no one was sad to see him goI never told anyone about my deception  I think people are happier thinking the universe conspired against David to deliver justicetldr  I outcheated the cheater by knowing the future,How I got revenge against a compulsive

kilcunda,85,115,14dtol,679,WARNING WALL OF TEXT AHEAD Also this was a long time ago for me names are replaced and whatnotI was on a piece of playground equipment known as the Jetty at my local primary elementary school in grade  enjoying some time to myself during lunch This kid entitled little shit from the year below me  Well call him Trent  decides that he wants to play on the Jetty instead He strides up to me and tells me to leave to which I tell him that I was here first but Id be happy to share it with him Trent didnt seem to like the sound of that idea Instead he chucks an absolute tantrum and wails at me with language no five or six year old should even know let alone repeat in public I try my best to ignore him at first but then he started pushing me I made the fatal mistake of pushing him back just as a teacher walked around the corner  Were both dragged of to the principals office The whole walk there he keeps leaning over and whispering to me Oh youre in so much trouble nowThe principal sits us both down and calmly asks us one at a time to tell our stories He starts with me I calmly tell him the abridged version Trent wanted the playground to himself I offered to share but he hit me When its Trents turn the little fucker breaks down and cries like a baby seal getting clubbed while watching the Arctic equivalent of Bambis mums death scene in slow motion He tells the principal about how I threw him off the Jetty called him names and swore at him I I dont want to say what he said It was the Fword but I dont want to say it because I know its a bad word Mr H he was just so mean I sat there widejawed and absolutely gobsmacked at this lying little turd watching the principal hug him and tell him everythings going to be alight Mr H kept glancing at me like I was some sort of devilspawn sent from hell with the soul purpose of making poor little Trents life utterly miserable I try telling him that hes lying but its just no use After all I was the older kid in the situation  I should have known better rightThe principal asks me to step outside his office to have a chat with him in person He tells me how disappointed he is and how ashamed I should feel for hurting poor innocent Trent I was given a punishment I wouldnt have at the time wished on my worst enemy  Garbage duty with Ms Hanzel Ms Hanzel was a rotten old lady that seemed to absolutely despise students She was about sixty years of age and physically looked like a female version of Jabba the Hutt with glasses EDIT Anodesu suggested Roz from Monsters InchttpimageswikianocookienetcbpixarimagesRozpng  Much better example  I could constantly hear her shouting at her pupils from outside the halls she would scream like a damn banshee and wouldnt stop until someone started crying One time she apparently grabbed my younger cousin by the wrist and yanked her outside when she tried to ask a question during silent time leaving a large red mark all down her arm But thats a story for another time The point was Ms Hanzel was an absolute witch and I was going to spend the next few hours picking up rubbish in front of all my peers with herThe principal walked me outside her office and made sure I knocked on the door before heading back to check on poor little Trent I slicked inside dreading talking to the wicked shebeast inside I had a little note with me asking her to give me rubbish duty until the end of the day then to send me back to the principals office after school She looks at it briefly hands me a plastic bag and stares at me for a good thirty seconds What did you do she asked me Frustrated and scared I broke down crying Between sobs I managed to tell her about how Trent lied to get me in trouble She sat down and Ill never forget the story she told meShe explained that back when she was my age many teachers would spank students for misbehaving She told me how the boys would usually get a paddle across the butt but the girls would get a smaller but still painful ruler across the back of the hand One day when she was at school another girl accidently knocked over the teachers inkwell and blamed it on her She got  hard spanks to the back of the hand Demonstrating the first three with her ruler in mid air one after another She told me how much she despised this disgusting little girl and how badly she was treated for the rest of her time thereThen she went to the bin in the corner and poured its contents in to my plastic bag I believe you Go back to class Ill tell Mr H that you picked up all the rubbish you could find okay I couldnt believe it I was standing right in front of the nastiest teacher in the whole school and here she was giving me the equivalent of a royal pardonTo make an already long story short I did go back to class At the end of the day I got another yelling from the principal and a call home to my parents but it wasnt until the next day that everything fell in to place I was on a different part of the playground when Ms Hanzel came storming by with a little boy at her side  Trent I was overcome with an emotion I didnt recognize then but one I now associate with sweet sweet revenge I strode up to the Jetty and played on that damn thing all lunch while Ms Hanzel made the little shit pick up all the rubbish down below me I dont know what she got him for but she made sure I could see the brat at all times and more importantly the little brat could see me playing on the playground he so desperately wanted to himself I like to think that she helped me achieve the revenge she never gotTLDR Feral kid wanted playground to himself tried to fight me then told principal that I punched and swore at him to get me in trouble when I wouldnt give him what he wanted The schools most evil teacher doesnt fall for his lies shares a touching story with me and makes the little shit watch me play on the playground while he picks up rubbish enacting her own longoverdue childhood revenge in the process No one asks for tree fiddyEDIT I should also note its am here at the time of writing and I was so inspired by the other fistpounding tales of rpettyrevenge that I just couldnt wait until the morning to share mine Please forgive me for any bad formatting poor grammar etc ,In my second year of primary school a kid lied to a teacher to get me in trouble The lie

ditchtwicker,58,90,14jsoi,669,Some years ago a local internet provider kept giving out my phone number by mistake My number was X their number was Y At first I thought people were simply misdialing but then I would ask them to confirm the number they were calling They would read back to me the number that the installers had left for them to call to complete the installation and it was always my number The odd time this happened would have been fine but living in a university city you would get hundreds of installations and thus calls when classes started    This actually went on for a few years and every time I called them to fix it they would either say that it had already been fixed or that there was nothing they could do about it even though they were the people giving the installers the number    After a particularly busy fall installation season I had had enough and called the IP one last time to resolve it When they once again said it was beyond their control I told them what I was going to do I was going to tell their customers that I was no longer an internet service provider and that I would be unable to complete their installation That they would need to get a hold of competing company B that was authorized to finish the installation and thus get the contract at the following correct phone number The customer was never to call this number again and that I thought the customer was stupid for even using company A to begin with    The IP flipped and said I couldnt tell their customers that I replied that Im not really saying anything untrue and that if they really dont want their customers to hear that then they can get their customers to stop calling me    Over the next few weeks I had about  calls that I gave this reply to And then after years of annoyance the IP was somehow able to figure out how to fix the phone numbers and I was never bothered again    Edit Just adding a few things     I didnt want to change my phone number as I had had it for years and was worried about losing touch with friends    What worked with the customers that I told this was that while I never claimed to be the company they were calling I did not deny that I was the IP and the little script I used could certainly have sounded like I was the IP In no way did I lie though or cross a legal line  Edit  Wow My first front page Thanks for the comments and upvotes,IP Company kept giving out my phone number,759,pettyrevenge,top_all

SGTRmadillo,112,127,17cvo8,660,I have been working at Ralphs Grocery Store for  months now and this story starts  month into my employment It was raining outside and I was braving the elements to bring in carts for customers and a lady I will call her Mrs Wonderful decides it is my fault that none of the available carts are dry directing her very loud and aggressive voice past the stand with paper towels to dry the carts right at me I begin fuming inside at this entitled bitch who is too good for the elements but I smile and wipe down her cart for her I tell her that if customers brought their carts up to the front after unloading their groceries none of them would be wet but she disregarded my statements and later left her cart in the middle of one of the handicapped spots for it to get rained on The gears have begun to turn in my head Months go by with her coming in about twice a week to buy  dollars worth of expensive wine and vegan groceries for her very wealthy husband I assume based on her massive ring and Porsche Carrera GT And then I became a cashier and I saw my opportunity Whenever I worked I would watch for her and when she got in line I would hop on a register and call her over to my line to checkout Everything was ready for my revenge At our first encounter behind the register I slipped her salt off the belt to the side because the only reason people buy salt is because they are out and basically everything needs salt I dont ring it up its not on the receipt its not in her bags and its not hers Perfect She comes in the next day only for salt and with a very unhappy look on her face I smirk I do this a couple more times not every time because this is a long play and I cannot get caught but about every third time But I think she is about to put  and  together so I move to phase two of the plan I start to take items off her belt at other cashiers register She comes in screaming at my manager because her items keep going missing On the day before I had taken the Cumin from her belt on another cashiers register Mrs Fantastic speed walks in arms aswinging and walks up to the  year old gentlemen who had rung her up the day before and yells WHERE IS MY FUCKING CUMIN and he started laughing Made this all worth it and made me want to continue this to the next level Mrs Compassionate then storms over to my manager who says she will look into it but never does because she thinks Mrs Forgiving is just looking for free groceries Then Mrs Giving begins to stare intently at the belt when she is checking out Fuck what am I going to do now So whenever I am sweeping the floors and I see her I steal an item from Mrs Sharings basket Even watching the belt she sees nothing happening yet her butter an egg yes only a single egg from the carton some spices the occasional meat and when Im feeling really ballsy a bottle of wine gets put swiftly back on the shelf I can visibly see her breaking down week after week Looking in her cart to make sure everything is there every minute watching the belt being aggressive and hateful to the cashiersI step it up another notch I start to not steal her groceries but swap them with the competitors brands I have no idea if she notices but it makes me feel good inside to think that she is confused when she gets home One particular night I replaced her  dollar bottle of wine with a  dollar bottle which I had stored under the register one that looks eerily similar to the one she bought and I think I saw her start to tear up when I rang the correct one up for the next day At least I hope thats what I saw  month ago I decided to lay off this woman because I think I broke her enough to say Ive gotten my revenge That didnt stop her from still checking over her shoulder watching the belt staring at the screen that tallies up the order every time she is in the store BUT she still leaves her cart in the lot and doesnt put it away so I am still taking items out of her cart every once in a while just to keep her on edge anxious and fearful and will continue to haunt her shopping experience Forever So Mrs Delightfull thank you for shopping at Ralphs where you get Real Low Prices and a Fast CheckoutTLDR  I ruined a bitchy womans life by messing with her at Ralphs,Where is my fucking Cumin,787,pettyrevenge,top_all

cmh,59,90,1kyuop,649,I was driving home when I arrived at a fourway intersectionThese have become fairly common around where I live so learning to drive with them and avoid tickets has become routineI was getting ready to turn left when I noticed that the light had turned yellow and I would not have had time to enter the intersection without the ticket camera flashingSo I going at a normal speed come to a smooth stop when the person behind me started freaking out Without describing her word for word Ill just say the girl in the car behind me looked like an uptight mom in an expensive Escalade with expensive glasses and an obnoxious facial expressionShe honked unnecessarily and I was willing to let that go try to take the high roadThen the light turns green again and before I even had a chance to step off the brakes she starts honking at me I mean really holding down the horn yelling from inside her car I finally had enoughI checked to make sure there was nobody behind her as I didnt want to put a burden on anybody else and then I waitedShe didnt let off the horn which she shouldnt have been doing in the first place so I kept waitingI knew she was going to go through the light anyway so this wasnt a game of making her wait a little bit longer I knew what I was doing and waited until the light turned yellow waited another second then gunned it through the intersectionShe like I expected ran the red light as I turned back to see the camera flash She sped by me with her window open and a few choice wordsShe had just earned an  dollar ticket and I was in no hurry so as she drove by I turned and gave her my most sincere smile,Red Light Camera,739,pettyrevenge,top_all

bedoran,110,113,1528y3,643,This is my first post so have at any grammar mistakes and idiocy I will have displayed  I think this fits well here but I guess thats up to you  To the petty revengeI was driving over to my parents house to help my little brother with some Spanish studying  It was raining and I have a personal rule to never drive over the speed limit during any type of weather that could affect my cars ability to operate safely  Also when I say raining I mean getting out of your car and closing the door will get you just as wet as jumping into a pool with all of your clothes on  Im minding my own business and this dbag driving a Lexus LetterLetter came speeding up behind me and chose to stay behind me on our four lane road  in each direction  I dont know the model and since car companies dont like to give their cars names anymore I know it has to be some letters but I digress  This jerk is seriously riding my bumper  Its a major pet peeve of mine on the road and even more so when theres bad weather  If I have to slam on my breaks I know hell just end up crushing the back of my car causing all sorts of inconvenience and possibly injuring me in the process  So I slow down well in advance of the next light to prevent this ahole from wrecking my car or myselfAs I sit at the light I happen to notice hes got his blinker on turning indicator to some of you also known as the thing never used to even more of you  Im the only car in front of him at this point too  Normally I would inch out a little into the cross walk to let people turn but at this intersection there isnt one for me to inch into and I refuse to inch into the freaking intersection  So I sit there like any other car would  I wasnt even going to try to fuck with this guys day  Hes obviously got somewhere to be and so do I  Then the fucker honks his horn the second the light turns green  He hadnt honked at all while tailing me nor when we pulled up to the intersection nor while I sat there not inching out  He did it so that he could be driving off so that he wouldnt have to deal with me retaliating but unfortunately for him I drive a manual  So instead of driving away I just let my car die  I start it up and let it die again just to act like ive got a problem  I roll down my window and do the wave to get people to pass me up  Theres no reason everyone elses day should be slowed down too much due to one dbagWhile doing this I see the guy behind me is super unhappy and yelling and flipping me off because he cant get around me because he pulled up so close to my car  I would have just sat here for a second light change to make him even later to where ever he was going but I noticed he had no jacket on  At this point I dont mind getting a little wet  I open my door and while my awesome rain jacket keeps most of me dry I try to push my car  Apparently this guys lady friend in the car told him to get out and help me move my car  So this bastard gets out of his car in flip flops shorts and a t shirt screaming and yelling  I just smile and continue to try pushing my car and as soon as he touches the back of my car i jump in start it up and leave him standing there like an idiotI hope you enjoyed your day asshatEdit   I guess I should clarify some things  First off I was driving in the right lane and he came up behind me  I know some people disregard weather and will speed so I was keeping my ass in the travelling lane I guess  Never heard it called that round these here parts its the slow lane  Secondly I wasnt turning right at the light this whole thing went down at  I was going to be turning right in a couple of lights  So no I wasnt being THAT guy in the passing lane going slower than other traffic  Hopefully I addressed your questions  Holler if I didnt,Road rage in the rain,756,pettyrevenge,top_all
Redsnork,61,141,1r3jsq,644,Im sure all of you know about the Boy Scouts of Americas recent decision to allow gay scouts into their programs But back when I was in the scouts the policy was still in full effect For the most part at least in my troop everyone seemed to be in full support of itOne time on a campout I was sitting with my friends talking about the BSAs policy on gay scouts An assistant scoutmaster overheard and joined the conversation He went on a long rant on how homosexuals are going against Gods wishes and that the policy is to protect boys who wouldnt last in scouting anyways He said something about them not being able to handle manual labor and that camping would be too dirty for themAt the time I was on my way to becoming an Eagle Scout and was the senior patrol leader in my scout troop I was a closeted bisexual and I was one of the highest ranked scouts in the troopAs the assistant scoutmaster kept ranting I grew more and more pissed off but didnt do anything at the time The final straw came when he told me that a fag could never make it to Eagle Scout rank That day I began thinking on how I could screw with him when I got my Eagle Scout awardAbout three months later I got my Eagle Scout award The scoutmaster who had been spewing hate earlier actually was one of the scoutmasters chosen to participate in my ceremonyAt the reception I ran into one of my good friends who also happened to be bicurious We had a slight history but thats another story After the reception as everyone was walking out I started to hold my friends hand I had explained everything to him earlier Mr Homophobic asshole saw me and his jaw dropped Feeling ballsy I gave my friend a light peck on the lips I almost could feel his shocked stareI had to walk past him on the way out As I walked past I said this fag made it farther in scouts than you ever did He had quit after first classThey say success is the best form of revenge I agree wholeheartedly,Proving a homophobe wrong,785,pettyrevenge,top_all

vondahl,59,125,17qeiz,623,Hi all I have a story I thought you might enjoy but its a little more justicey than revengebased so let me know if I should post it elsewhereAbout tenish years ago I was in th grade In my math class our teacher had assigned seats at random Of course with my luck I was seated between the two most obnoxious kids in my entire graduating class Ill call them Justin and CoreyThey were those kids the ones everyone hated We all knew one growing up They were beyond annoying and they just didnt know when to stop They were a lovely combination of socially inept and attentionstarved To add to my misery Corey and Justin hated each other They would constantly bicker and fight sometimes trying to swat at each other and usually hitting me as well since I was the only thing separating them It was hard to pay attention with this going on around me and one of my favorite classes was quickly turning into a nightmareMy math teacher was a good guy and a good teacher After he would give the lesson hed sit down at his desk If you had any questions about the work we were doing you could form a line at his desk and hed give each student oneonone help On this one fateful afternoon of class Justin was being particularly obnoxious and decided to focus all of his energy towards making my day awful since Corey was absent from school The whole class period he was hitting me saying mean things taking my pen etc but back then I was too nice read doormat of a girl to do anything in retaliation and I didnt want to get in trouble for disrupting class I had just about had it up to here and I was thankful that I didnt understand one of the math problems we were supposed to complete in class I practically skipped up to my teachers desk to get some help and take a little break from Justin but lo and behold guess who also needs help on the inclass workThere was another kid getting help in front of me so I patiently waited my turn and tried to ignore the fact that Justin was in line behind me elbowing me in the ribs and trying to drive me up the fucking wall At that moment I had finally had enough of it Weeks of pent up rage and frustration boiled to the surface Just as that other student walked back to his desk and my teacher was waiting for me to ask for help I swung around to face Justin and with all of my  year old strength I bitch slapped him as hard as I could and told him to go to hell consequences be damnedMy teacher saw the entire thing I was expecting him to drag me straight to the principals office but his reaction was quite the opposite He was failing miserably at concealing one of the biggest smiles Ive ever seen Of course Justin yells out Mr Teacher vondahl just hit me Make her get in trouble The teacher trying to look serious says Well Justin you kind of deserved it As you can see your behavior towards others has consequencesThe look of utter disbelief on Justins face was priceless As he sulked back to his desk cradling his freshly slapped face my teacher gave me a little smile as if to thank me for slapping a kid he found just as irritating as I did I got a new seat that day and Justin never bothered me againTLDR  Finally had enough of my antagonizer making my life miserable in th grade math class so I bitch slapped him right in front of my teacher and my teacher told the kid he deserved it,Well you kind of deserved it,748,pettyrevenge,top_all

tmtreat,78,112,1lap64,623,So my first time on my own after college I got an apartment with a buddy in Austin TX  When signing the lease we found it odd that they made us sign an intent to move out form but the property management agency said it was standard and we were naïve so whatever we signedNot even two months into our  year lease realtors start showing up at our apartment trying to get it preleased for the following year  This is odd I think so I consult my lease  Sure enough if written intent to move out has been submitted the apartment can be shown to prospective renters as long as a reasonable time and date has been agreed upon with the tenants Problem is these realtors would just show up unannounced at all hours of the day to walk around our place with complete strangers  I called the owner of the unit who was the other party to the lease and she was in  agreement of my interpretation realtors MUST call at least  hours in advance and only after we reach a mutual agreement on the date and time can they stop by to show the placeYet it continued  am on a Saturday morning a knock at the door from some realtor  After explaining to him that he cannot do this he replies  read your lease man I can come by whenever I want   Actually the contract is between me and the owner and youve never seen my lease  We need to schedule a time first  Whatever Im already here and youre already awake so you might as well let me inThe last straw was when one afternoon I went for a quick run I was out of shape so it would be  min max and left the door unlocked so I wouldnt have to carry keys  I get back to the apartment and the door is locked  After  hours of waiting for my roommate to get home from work we go inside to find the business card of the fucker who had shown the place while I was gone and proceeded to lock me out  That was it  No more of this shit  I call the guy up to explain that he had just locked me out of my own home  His reaction  Well I guess youve learned to never leave the door unlockedWow  I was ready for some revenge but had no way to go about it  Random unscheduled visits from random people  What could I do  Would this actually continue for the next  months of my leaseUntil one day an opportunity fell right into my lap  I see a voicemail left at  on a Saturday morning from a guy saying hell be by to show my apartment at am  Great I think  Thanks for the heads up But I had recognized the voice  It was the same guy who locked me out and told me off I still had his card and confirmed it with the phone numberI knew he was coming but he didnt know I had gotten the message A few minutes before he was set to arrive I go into the kitchen the kitchen island is right in front of the entryway completely naked and start doing prep work for dinner  Big knife chopping onions and the like earphones in as if I were listening to music  Right on cue I hear a knock on the door at   Gametime  This guys gonna see my hairy ass  After a couple of knocks a key goes in the door  Deadbolt unlocks  The door opens behind me and quickly closes  Hah  Thatll be an image hell never forget  But this guys persistent  Knock knock knock  Knock knock knock  Door opens again and promptly closes  More knocking  Take the hint Im thinking to myself  The door opens again and I hear footsteps approaching me  No fucking way  The nerve on this jerk I feel a tap on my shoulder and I whirl around giant kitchen knife in the air and I scream WHAT THE FUUUUCCKKKKThe guys terrified face turns to desperate placation  Its ok Im a realtorhttpwwwgifsforumcomimagesgifothergrandecaaceegif Entirely pissed off I yell GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE and literally chase him out the door  Standing in front of the door are  little Asian girls who were just trying to find a nice apartment  Sorry I stated firmly my entire front exposed holding a knife  I closed the doorI dont know if Austin realtors have some kind of communication network but from then on none of them stopped by without scheduling an appointment first at least  hours in advance,Realtor Revenge,735,pettyrevenge,top_all

Dieselnuts,28,113,1fnt6c,616,Earlier this year one of my best friends and roommates Kyle was dating a gorgeous girl with a reputation for screwing guys over He had really fallen for her and she genuinely seemed to feel the same way talking about how she had changed and never felt this way about other guys before Since he is one of my best friends I tried to be unbiased and not have any assumptions about her just because of what other people had said Our group of friends accepted her and defended her since she our friends girl until we found out that she had definitely been cheating on him Multiple times Our friend was crushed and the rest of us were understandably pissed That weekend our crew of friends headed off to a house party minus a somewhat heartbroken Kyle And after we got there who should appear there but the girl who had been cheating on him We ignored her and continued to have a usual fun night until several hours later we see her in a corner with our seemingly hammered friend Nick flirting with him and getting really touchyfeely Just as were starting to worry about what he might do she leans in to kiss him and Nick does what has come to be known only as The Dementors Kiss He tilted sideways opened his mouth as wide as possible put as much of his mouth over hers as possible from above her lips almost down to her chin and just starts sucking inwards while making a noise like a clogged vacuum sucking up a large slushy After a few shocked seconds that felt like an eternity she screamed like a dying bat and ran out of the room while we alternated between cheering and laughing hysterically The story made its way around our college and several people had captured the beautiful moment with pictures Petty and she had a new boy toy within a week but still hilarious at the time it happened                                                                                                                                                                    TLDR My buddy publicly embarrassed our friends cheating ex with the most awkward and uncomfortable kiss Iv seen in my life,The Weirdest Revenge Kiss of Her Life,729,pettyrevenge,top_all
ShaneL,41,110,1axtty,609,One evening a few years ago I was driving down a main road in my city This road was normally two lanes in either direction but because of construction it went down to one lane  for several blocks in the direction I was traveling I am driving in the right lane at first then switch lanes just prior to the lane cutting off for construction Ive seen it a lot but cant explain what is running through these peoples heads but prior to moving over there was a truck about  meters back in the lane I was moving into They were the only vehicle around and had been traveling at that distance for a long distance which leads me to believe we were traveling roughly the same speed Once I moved over this truck accelerated and moved right in on my bumper Then unlike most idiots Ive seen do that she took it a step further and began honking incessantly Through the construction the road went from its normal kmh to kmh I let off the gas until I got down to just above kmh This woman didnt back off even a little I tried barely touching my brakes so they would flash without actually braking in hopes that she would get the message and back off  she didnt A little ways into the construction zone there was a large metal grate on the road It was about  inches thick and did not have a lip to help ease onto it I was in a little and low sports car so I had to slow down As I approached this thing I had to brake regardless of how close this idiot was to me As expected when I braked she had to lock up her tires to avoid rear ending me The thing was I didnt brake hard  just gradual but she was so close it didnt matterThere were four of these grates in total and at each one I braked and she came within millimeters of hitting me Each time the frequency of her honking increased Once construction ended I moved back into the right lane This woman passed me then swerved into my lane and slammed on her brakes Seeing her previous stupidity I was expecting it and was able to brake without there being any problem whatsoever Once her road rage attempt failed she floored it ahead and out of sight That was the end of that  or so I thoughtLate that evening I received a call from the police Apparently someone reported me for dangerous and reckless driving The police asked me to go down and give a statement which I did When I arrived the cop explained that some woman told them I was not letting them pass by swerving from lane to lane blocking them in They also claimed I was slamming on my brakes to try to cause an accident I was pissed that this bitch was lying and tried telling the cop my side of the story but she didnt seem to care at all She handed me a few tickets totaling about  I dont remember exactly what they were for but I believe stunting and dangerous driving were two of them The next morning I woke up still pissed and decided to go back to the police station and get more information I spoke to a different cop that explained the womans report claimed it all happened between such and such a street Immediately I knew I could proof she was lying about the swerving from lane to lane to not let her pass part There was construction through the entire area she mentioned and one lane was a giant open pit because of it I explained this to the cop and he was slightly more receptive but still told me that if I wanted to fight it I would need to go to court on a specific date He also mentioned that since she was the only witness she would need to be there to testify or else I would likely have the fines dismissed I figured she was aware of that law and this was just a bitches attempt to make me lose a day of pay from work andor my time But I was definitely fighting thisI went to court about  weeks later to fight the ticket and step one is going to the counter to speak to a court clerk This is the person that weeds out the people who either want to just pay their fine or have absolutely no chance of winning their fight As I was standing at the front of the line I was close enough to hear the people in each of the three windows talking to the court clerk These two large women directly in front of me began yelling at the clerk and saying this is bullshit before storming out I figured oh great Im going to have the bitchy court clerk who hates the world On the contrary I made a joke as I got to her window about those angry girls in hopes that it would score me some points I gave her my fine numbers and she began laughing I was confused and a little worried She then proceeds to tell me there is good news and bad news The good news was the second cop I spoke to hand apparently been on patrol shortly after we spoke and was in the area this all went down He confirmed my story and dismissed my tickets The bad news  well one of those two large women who were angrily berating the court clerk was actually the one who filed the complaint The police now believed my story and gave her the same fines I just had dismissed in addition to another fine which was in regards to filing a false police report Total of which was slightly over  The bad news part of that was that I needed to stick around and testify I did so  happilyWe sat in the traffic court waiting area for about an hour The entire time those women had absolutely no idea I was the guy who was going to testify against one of them When the time came the crown prosecutor called us into court She explained her story then I explained mine Then to top it off the cop who issued her the tickets and dismissed mine made an appearance and explained his portion of the story She was guilty on all counts and out a couple grand The judge even gave her a lecture on lying to police and how she could have been sentenced to jail time for it and told her she got off luckyWalking out to my car afterwards I made sure to smile from ear to ear and walk as close to them as possible It was a great day TLDR  Cunt road rages then tells police it was all me

loungemouse,54,91,18c11i,593,A few years ago I was at a crowded club for a social for my university cheer leading squad The fun bit of the evening was for all of us to wear plain white tshirts and allow others on the squad write cheeky things on things on them I was patiently waiting about ten minutes in the long line for a drink when some douchebag decides to elbow me in the ribs and push past me when it was nearly my turn I tapped him on the shoulder and nicely informed him myself and many others had been waiting and that I would appreciate it if he waited like everyone else He stepped on my foot called me a few unsavory things and turned around to order his drink I of course had a few sharpies on me from the social and he was wearing a rather expensive looking collared shirt I spent the rest of the time in line making large swipes with the marker across his back when he wasnt paying attention The individual beside me bought me a drink for it Petty revenge servedEdit Damn you autocorrect,Being an asshole doesnt mean youre entitled to get your drink before me,684,pettyrevenge,top_all
yotsubakoiwai,103,85,1igc91,595,Im going to share this experience in my boyfriends perspective which he had while working as a waiter Not sure whether it counts as a revenge but I guess its worth the shareI used to work in this small cafe as a parttime job when I was a teenager So one day this middleaged lady came in with her kid about  or ish years old I knew she would be a demanding customer by the looks when she stepped into the cafe had a fairshare of experience of it Since it was lunch hour at that point in time it was already quite busy and the cafe was understaffed I tried to get all the orders as quickly as possible The lady who I assumed was a strict vegetarian kept asking whether are there any vegetarian dishes available and constantly clarifying whether each dish that she pointed out on the menu had meat in it even corn soup She finally settled for this assorted veggie sub that she ordered for the kid minutes in Mrs Vegetarian was getting super impatient at having to wait for the food to arrive constantly asking about how long is it taking every time I passed her table Next to her table there was this little window where the kitchen staff places the finished orders ready for the waitstaff to take them to the customers table Her order is finally done and I took it to herTo my surprise her kid was already happily eating a sub I asked her how did she get her order as I was the only one manning the tables at that time she said that she saw a wrapped sub placed in the window assumed it was hers and took it behind my back I immediately told her that it was another customers order I think she didnt realise that her kid was happily chomping down a chicken sub as she screamed slapped off the sub from the kids hands made him spit whatever he was chewing and started to pick out the bits of chicken on his tongueI went to the kitchen told the rest about it and laughed As for her my manager decided that due to the circumstances she does not qualify for a replacement sub had to pay for the chicken sub and took a bit of reasoning before she paid up and left the cafe angrily,Please dont selfserve,680,pettyrevenge,top_all
CitySecrets,63,147,1hwbj2,589,First time poster This is a long one so sorry for the absolute wall of text If you really dont feel like reading a lot please skip to the TLDR I Hope you enjoy my first crack at this Just a little relevant informationWhen I was in elementary school I was a decent student I wasnt the star pupil or anything close to it I was always in the B to A range Our school had a rewards program very similar to Mrs Puffs Good Noodle star program where if you got good grades you got stars and little candies at the end of the month So everyone in the class knew if you were doing well or not There was also permanent seating plans that were set for the whole year so you never changed seatsInto the story nowI was seated next to a loud mouth boy hereby dubbed SH Short for Shit Head SH was one of those kids that would take your pencil crayons without asking steal your snacks from your backpack blatantly ridicule you and just make your life an all around hell However as soon as he was confronted by a teacher he was the perfect angel therefore he was never caught doing anything wrong He also didnt give two shits about school so he never even bothered to look at his marks this ends up being in my favorAbout a month into the school year I started noticing that my work was going missing Now I was a forgetful kid so I just assumed that I had put it down somewhere and forgotten it This went on for about two weeks before I started to get kind of suspiciousThen one day I was called to the principals office and I was scolded for copying SHs work I was outraged I broke into a crying fit and screamed about them being wrong I got my first ever detention and a stern warningWhen I went back to my class and sat down SH was watching me with the smuggest face I have ever seen Thats when I pieced together where my work had been going SH would wait until I went out for recess or he would ask to go to the bathroom then when no one was looking he would steal my work from my homework folderBeing a shy kid I didnt want to tell a teacher Instead I sat down at my desk that night and devised my master plan Sure it would mean extra work but who cares if I got my revenge I decided that every time I did my homework I would make two copies One of the copies would have my actual work and the other would be complete bullshit I would put the fake copy in my homework folder and simply move my real work to a different binderSH continued to take my homework from my knapsack and I continued to cackle to myself when he was out of earshot Every time he got it back he threw it in his desk without even looking He assumed he did well because he was stealing a smart kids workSkip forward to the end of the year when he received an envelope that had his parents name on it This usually means that the principle wants to get a message to the parents directly It also read OPEN ONLY WITH YOUR PARENTS in big red letters on the back He of course dismissed this warning and tore into the envelope As he read the letter his face fell a little and began to tremble a bit I overheard him whisper to his friend that he failed the grade and had to stay back a yearThe feelings that filled me were glorious I felt terrible of course because I caused someone else pain but man did I feel good The thing is he couldnt tell anyone why he had failed The kicker is he confronted me after the last bell Our confrontation was short and sweetgtSH HEY CitySecrets what the fuck happenedgtMe I dont know what you mean I knew exactly what he meantgtSH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN he shook the envelope grasped in his sweaty handgtMe Oh you failed the grade and now you have to stay back thats what happenedgtSH YEAH I KNOW HOW COME YOU DIDNT FAIL TOOgtMe Because im smarter than yougtSH Fuck you Im gonnagtMe I cut him off Gonna what Gonna tell the teacher that you were stealing my workgtSH Fuck off A man of many wordsgtMe Have fun repeating this yearBefore he could say anything I left Yes I felt bad but I also felt good because I stood up for myself to the biggest bully I have ever faced I graduated before him and ever since I havent seen himMind you this also happened quite a long time ago so the confrontation is obviously a very vague explanation of what I may have actually saidThanks for reading Im glad I could put this somewhere because to this day I have kept this secretTLDR Snot nosed kid would steal my work and copy it never got caught So I started making two copies of my work so he would always take the wrong copy He failed the grade and had to stay back a yearEDIT Broke it up more for easier reasoning readingEDIT  Please feel free to reformat or edit my grammar Im new at this and typing a lot tends to make me lose track of my grammar skills EDIT  I have gotten a few skeptical messages and comments about how this wouldnt have caused someone to fail a grade and how there would have been more warnings and stuff Thats totally okay that you are skeptical Like I said in the comments I wouldnt know if there had been conferences with parents or if there was any other follow up Considering that a school really doesnt publicize a failing student and me and him werent exactly buddies Just wanted to clarify this Fact of the matter is my homework stunt could have had  to do with why he failed,Steal my Work Good luck failing,736,pettyrevenge,top_all
Rubychan,84,135,1mh249,590,rantSo I just recently ceased working for a overpriced childrens boutique and Im ever so glad I had been job searching previously but was biding in my time to quit until I had another job in the wings Why was I trying to quit you may ask Well it would seem that I have the worst luck with jobs Or maybe I just hadnt learned my lesson This was the fifth familyrun store Id worked for and so far they had all been clusterfucks of owners thinking they can break the rules and get away with it Why oh why did I think this one would be any differentSo the business hours were  but they asked us to get there  minutes early to get the store ready vacuuming watering plants straightening everything out reasonable stuff and no one really left until  because of endofday cleaning and straightening and such We also had to wait for the manager or the owners to come close us out and they were NEVER there at Now aside from the pretentious customers we got and just the fact that I really didnt fit in since Im not a prissy girly girl I prefer to wear jeans and sneakers over leggings and uggs any day they were truly breaking the law They didnt give us lunches on  or even  hour shifts if they deemed it was too busy we didnt get a mandatory  or  minute break every  hours and to top it off we didnt get time and a half for overtimeI even asked the manager AND the owner why Their response We just dont They proceeded to tell me that there was paperwork I was supposed to sign Oh I hadnt signed it Well they would bring it in tomorrow I knew for a fact it wouldnt even matter because in the great state of California an employee is still entitled to overtime and lunches and no signature on a document can change thatThey never did and I was fine with that because I was planning on suing their asses as soon as I quit Well right after I brought this up they conveniently didnt need me to come in  minutes early anymore Oh and I should leave right on the hour Even if theres still customers in the store They claimed they just dont need that many people to close if I left there were two people but I knew their game Unfortunately for them I already had the proof I needed I made them print out a record of my hours and took that and my paystubs to the labor board They are now going to be cited for not adequately compensating their employees for overtime AND for not providing lunches if they didnt feel like itrantEDIT Wow guys I did not expect all the positive comments Thank you And for those of you who wanted a follow up Ill be texting the one girl whose number I have to tell her what I did we were sorta friends in that I gave her all my Jason Mraz music yeah and Ill see If shes mad at me I might never find out If not Ill let you guys know,Hoping this is considered petty heres another I got back at my evil exboss story,725,pettyrevenge,top_all
thebornotaku,82,123,17wekr,595,I went to a local car AV shop to purchase a new subwoofer box and after a couple of minutes inside the shop the owner and an employee from the business next door a window tinting shop came in and started accusing me of stealing one of their tools I had brought a minidrill from home so I could install my subwoofer in to my new box when I bought it and it just so happened to be the same model of drill they usedAfter trying to reason with the employee and telling them that I could show them proof of purchase from Amazon the employee threatened me Its a small town I have your plate number Youre lucky Im at work right now etc They called the police and stayed very near my car I called the police as well because the owner and his employee had made me feel threatened I got the manager of the business that I was in to print out my order form from Amazon When the police arrived they took the owners story then came inside to talk to me I showed him proof of purchase as well as my ID and the card I used to order it The officer took that and showed it to the owner of the other business and when the officer came back in he claimed that the owner would apologizeWhen I went outside the owner apologized in probably the most begrudging and accusatory way He again accused me of stealing from him claiming that he knew i stole it from him and that it was some sneaky s you pulled having your friend list it on Amazon so you could buy it Continuing to feel like I was in a hostile atmosphere I got in my car and drove offWell thats where the story used to end It gets betterYou see that chunk of text along with the actual business names which have been redacted and a small summary are what I posted to Yelp And Google Reviews And YahooFast forward a few months from that point and I see the employee who was being the most threatening at my work Hes hard to miss Hes a big bulky dude with a huge beard He came through my line at the grocery store and I bagged his order He looked me dead in the eyes and we obviously recognized each otherA few days later I get a call at work This is pretty rare and usually its my parents if anybody and its only if theres a family emergencySo imagine my surprise when I answer the phone and its the business owner from the window tinting place He wants to talk things over and rectify the situation I get his number and after a few days call himApparently my reviews did some damage The business is pretty prominent in a big purple building on the main street in town Everybody drives by it so chances are if youre thinking of getting your windows tinted youre gonna think of that placeWell he tells me that my star review on Yelp knocked them down from  stars to  He tells me hes lost some of his old customers and he hasnt been getting new customers as often He even told me that I cost him an estimated k in profit over the four months the review was up I checked the Yelp review every now and then and at last count well over  people found it useful who knows how many other people had seen it and decided against going to his shopSo anyway I took the opportunity to lay in to him a little bit I told him that if he treats people like he treated me he deserves to lose business I tell him its a shitty way to be and basically just tear him a new one Even after my verbal beatdown hes still really apologetic though I knew he really just wanted that review down but after hearing that he lost around k in profit over what is a  tool I got the warm fuzzies inside and decided Id done enough damage and took the reviews downtldrdouchebag business owner accuses me of stealing his tool even when provided with evidence to the contrary I post a factual account of our interaction to multiple review sites he loses a bunch of business I cost him around k in profit over his accusations of me stealing a  tooleditTo everyone saying I should have left the review upI felt like I made my point I put a measurable dent in his business and I taught him a lesson Even if his apology may not have been authentic perhaps he would consider his actions a little more carefully before accusing somebody else like he did to me Or perhaps not and then they go and do the same thing that I did but decide to leave it up Either way I felt like I got my payback and Im all for letting bygones be bygones If he continues to be a dick itll come back to him so Im not really that worried about it Myself and everybody I know have all pretty much agreed that hes a dick and would all rather take our business elsewhere because of itI dont feel like Im censoring myself I feel like I let him squirm long enough and now Im letting up Maybe Im a more forgiving person than some of you in this instance but thats my choice He took the time to talk to me calmly and politely like an adult and we worked it out together I still think hes a douchebag and I wont associate with him but like I said I let him squirm and got my point across and thats all I was trying to do,You obviously dont understand how Amazoncom works Alternatively Enjoy losing business,718,pettyrevenge,top_all
Synthetika,74,84,14sbix,593,This happened to me about a year ago when I still thought roommates were good ideas I was in need of a roommate after my boyfriend and I split so my friend decided to take on the spare room Since the gas bill was the ex boyfriends I asked if she would transfer her already existing account to the house to which she agreed So we decided that I would pay the electric and she the gas Any difference between the bills would be splitWell one month in and we receive the gas bill claiming there is a  balance so I ask her why she has such a high balance and she says its just the deposit and that she would have them waive it after she set up direct deposit and they would send us our normal bill next monthAnother month goes by and they come by and shut off our gas and stick a nonpayment flyer on the door Understand that this is the start of winter the temperatures are getting colder day by day at this point it was between  degrees Fahrenheit each night Thankfully it wasnt mid winter and we hadnt gotten into the negatives yet Still was cold and I worried about the pipes freezingI give her a call and let her know what happened She puts on the whole fake sorry act and says she will call them right away and fix it I once again believe that shes going to take initiative but of course she doesnt I know that she is not doing anything about it and that she is just going out partying everyday I had known from the beginning that she was not very responsible but didnt think she would let it go on that long I tried calling the gas company myself but they would not do anything since it was under her name and I did not know her SSN I had resorted to taking showers at my friends houses making microwave meals for dinner and having to buy an electric heater and be secluded to my room for any kind of warmthThis goes on for three weeks that I am asking her constantly if she has gotten it fixed and all she continues to do is give me ridiculous excuses Always blaming the problem on the gas company or the bankI decided enough was enough One night while she was staying out at a friends house I went into her room Just for a minute I stared at her electric heater thinking of how badly I just wanted to start kicking it but then decided that might be a bit much and she would know I did it I grab some tools and start to take the thing apart I clipped one of the wires inside and then put the whole thing back together set it back in the same spot and casually left the room snuggling into my bed with a smirkThe next morning I hear her walk into her room and just seconds later a loud whine comes from her about how her heater wont turn on Its easy for me to hear since her room was right next to mine I get up and walk to her room and with a look of concern say Whats going on You ok she just replies with the same whine about how her heaters broken and her room is freezing I shrug and say Oh sorry that sucks Im going to get ready for work And not but five minutes later I hear her on the phone with the gas company working on getting the gas turned back on They make it out a week later and get everything turned back on Yes the satisfaction really was that she had to freeze for a week While I still had my heater in perfect working orderTLDR  Roommate doesnt take care of gas bill Heat gets turned off for a month I get pissed and inconspicuously break her electric heater She finally gets the gas turned back on,Roommate didnt pay gas bill and continually lied,677,pettyrevenge,top_all

Cthonic,98,147,1m45ch,579,I used to study Tae Kwon Do at a school not far from me  It wasnt exactly a McDojo but the regular classes were super relaxed and feelgood  There was no fullcontact without pads at the noob classes only at the advanced classes  And even then we all knew each other and would avoid cheap shots  For this reason perhaps stupidly I never bothered with a cup  Now one day Im helping instruct at one of the noob classes  There was an odd number of people so they put the least senior of the assistant instructors into the rotation to even things out  There was one kid at the class who we all knew had a severe attitude problem  He would always forget some of his pads and wail on people below his level hurting some of them sometimes  So it comes my turn to spar with him  Usually he would go pathetically easy if he was sparring a better student  However that day he had a problem with me  Id corrected him during a grappling exercise wed done earlier because he was a doing it incorrectly and b being a dick to his partner  Regardless almost as soon as we start he winds his foot back and I think He cant be that stupid to try and hit an instructor in the balls right  I was wrong  Full on dick shot  Id have complimented his form if I hadnt been enraged beyond words  Regardless I guess the kid hadnt been in many real fights or been hit in the crotch many times  While it hurts like hell you usually get about  or so seconds before you feel anything  Id used  of those deciding to teach the fucker a lesson  He dropped his guard after kicking me in the nuts I guess figuring that hed already won  The smug look on his face changed rapidly when my heel connected with his solar plexus  I hit him with a crossup side kick that sent him sprawling and much to my pleasure slammed his head into the wall  I had about one second left at this point and got out a Ha dumbass  For a moment the head instructor was going to tear my head off for treating a noob class spar like a real fight  Then when I doubled over I guess he put two and two together  The class had at this point stopped to watch the scene  The little shit had to pick himself up off the ground  Once they determined that his head was fine he was ejected from the class and had to go change and take the walk of shame out  At this point I found out that he was  and therefore did not have a drivers license  He had to sit out on the curb for his mom to pick him up while the class resumed as normalAfter class the instructor asked if I was ok  After determining whether or not Id be able to have kids he went I dont blame you but try not to do it again  The little shit stayed at the school but he definitely showed a bit more respect after that to both his instructors and his fellow studentsEDIT Also its worth noting that this guy was one of those black belts that likes to think theyre hot shit and pick on the color belts while actually being objectively bad,Kick my balls Youve still got a good  seconds to regret your decision,726,pettyrevenge,top_all

SamNextDoor,223,185,1djelk,573,Warning Wall of text aheadBackgroundI work in a coffee shop inside a family owned grocery store I usually work the eveningnight shift because I also attend school in the morning meaning I have to close a lot rather than work mid day shifts I have a lot of cleaning and chores to do before I can leave at the end of the day when we close at  and when I say we close at  I mean Im walking out the door and punched out at  I have worked there for about a year and a half and Ive never really had a problem with customers and I generally like helping people always giving great service to people who deserve it But sometimes once in a blue moon Ill get someone coming in right before closing who really gets under my skinSituationIm rushing to close on time because my inconsiderate coworker didnt do anything she was supposed to do Its around  and Im mopping the floor relieved to finally be finished in a matter of minutes I was just about to lock my door when out of the darkness on the other side this woman who will know henceforth as bitch reached for the door handle and yanked it open as if she was suffering from withdrawal from coffee She practically knocked me over with her boobs which could only be fake and her minime of a daughter in tow Both were dressed as if they were about to go clubbing I was fuming at their lack of apologizes and behavior never was treated so poorly and I have been treated terribly but thats another time They stood at the counter obviously wanting a drink I put on my best customer service smile and forced myself to wait on them Since its a family owned business quality service was mandatory and Im expected to smile and bend overbackwards while juggling  whales on a unicycle atop Big Ben and swallow swords if the customer asked me to I start out asking What can I when I was cut off I need  large mocha shakes now I was less than pleased I had everything cleaned and she orders the most complicated drinks requiring I dirty almost everything Fortunately were about to close and I couldnt do it right Im sorry maam but everything is in the dishwasher and soapy I have a huge sincere smile on my face that I get to tell this bitch shes not getting her damn shakes We close at  and its  She completely loses her mind yelling WHAT DO YOU MEAN Are you saying that I cant get  drinks You close at  its not  My smile faulters as I see my manager charging over Can I help you mamam My manger asks her Bitch whines Yeah SHE Pointing at me Said that its too late for drinks but its not  yet Suddenly minibitch pipes up and says I want a shake now My manager turns to me and tells me to go make the drinks I cant really argue with him so I just frown and say Fine He leaves My smile has almost completely disappeared you can tell Im annoyed I ring them up and the total comes to  nothing special She digs out her wallet from her purse and starts counting out quarters dimes and pennies Really After she finished bitch was short a good  then thats when she did the unimaginable she REACHED INSIDE MY TIP JAR AND TOOK A DOLLAR AS MINIBITCH HANDED HER  CENTS I was so appalled that I just stared at her mouth open when she tried to hand me the money I protested Maam that dollar is mine you cant have it She looked shocked I told her no Yes I can NO you cant thats MY tip jar MY property MY money you just basically stole my dollar She let out a frustrated sigh as she shoved my dollar back in the jar and asked minibitch for a dollar to which she pulled out a  I had an angry frown on my face as I cashed them out I was FUMING Thats when I knew I had to get revengeThe RevengeI grabbed the blender out of the dishwasher and kinda washed off the soap I poured the ice in and added significantly less chocolate vanilla and cream so it would be too thick to suck up through a straw they would have to use a spoon Then I used coffee instead of espresso same flavor just not good quality I blend it for half the time leaving huge ice chunks in the bottom which is unpleasant to get around and is useless When I poured it into their cups I forgot to add the chocolate around the outside this doesnt change flavor its just not as cosmetically pleasing And finally I ran out of whipped cream so I used flat lids instead of the nice dome lids that hold the whip cream I felt satisfied in my work and I decided to take an extra minute to clean up my mess stealing another precious minute from them I gave them my biggest smile as I handed them the drinks I ran to the back and punched out meaning I no longer work or do anything or else I get into trouble I walked out as bitch approached me You need to remake these I played dumb What do you mean These are awful Its too thick and doesnt have the chocolate or whip cream I smile and politely tell her Im sorry but its currently  were closed and I punched out I cant help you She stares me down but I keep my smile firm Bitch gives up and sits down with minibitch who tries to eat her shake with a spoon I walk over very slowly and lean down to their level and calmly tell them Ever hear that you shouldnt mess with or be rude to people who handle your fooddrink And give her a smile as her face gets pale as if she saw a ghost Have a nice night I yell as I walk out the door I laughed all the way homeTLDR Bitch and Minibitch come in before closing rude and tries to steal my money I mess up their order and give them a life lessonEDIT I have to be punched out at  or else I get in trouble the next day for staying late I dont get paid extra for staying late I dont get an extra half hour like most places to clean so I have to close and punch out simultaneously ,You want coffee Ill give you coffee,758,pettyrevenge,top_all

itsrainingscotch,98,127,1e6fss,572,This story happened in  so it is a little far back now but Oh do we remember it like yesterdayoh yes Anyway a bunch of my buddies and our girlfriends all decided to move out of our old college apartment and upgrade to a shitty house since most of us had jobs now and it was time So let me start with the place itself pretty big  bedroom lot front and back yard some fruit trees single story big driveway It also had a dark side though  foot tall pile of trash in the middle of the driveway A garage FILLED with junk and refuse Broken windows everywhere Black widow spider infestation in the house yes youd come how from work and find them hanging in the middle of your room The heating system was not hooked up to any pipes in the attic so when it turned on the attack got nice and toasty and we froze The yards hadnt been tended to in probably a decade There was a rotten homemade jacuzzi which we hated due to its ability to spawn black widow spiders and other woolybubs In short this place was a dump and we got it because it was cheap We knew a slumlord situation could be sucky but we hoped that our slumlord would be one of those who takes your money and disappears allowing us to do whatever we want But nooh no nono nonothis was not the case AT ALL The first thing she said was ooo you have girls around I know how that goes first they stay a day then a week then they move in I dont want them here They cant come here Next thing she noticed was my friends drum set  oooo noooooo you dont play that here Its somewhere in the contract The neighbors dont like me so they will be mad if you play music we are all completely taken aback by this psychos audacious attitude Then she sees the same roomates truck an old international scout that he like to work on sometimes she didnt like this one bit ohh NOOOOO you dont work on cars in my garage I know what you wanna do you wanna mess my garage up it was a horrid pigsty already she never clean her junk out it even though the contract said it would be clean and useable for us Next tragedy occurs when we try and make the landscape look nice it was only long dead plants and huge stick bundles prior Us roomates and ladyfolk get to it and pull out the decades old overgrowth hidden junk and weeds We pile them all conveniently in the front driveway so the landlord can come pick it up Now we have room to do nice things like grow veggies and fruits like weve always talked about Wrong NNNNOooooooo is my HOUSE You no change it Put it back But psycho we just want to plant vegetables and stuff We want to tend your fruit trees that have been ignored for a decade Dont worry we are good at this kind of stuff Angry psycho NNOOOOOOOOOOO its my house and you cant do that you dont like it you dont leave she always pronounced Live as leave here Look we pay a lease which states that this house and property are basically ours to do with as we please without you coming around all the time and arguing with us I mean we just want to plant vegetables we dont want your flowers or whatever you think youre going to plant instead  months too late And then came those fatefull words the crossing of the Rubicon FINE then you get out I wont renew your leaseSo heres where the serious revengeporn section begins Keep in mind that this lady is a bitchpsychoslumlord who would park her car in OUR driveway for weeks show up unannounced and decide to grind tiles for the walkway at am on saturday next to our windows never clean up anything she made like the pile of junk that filled our garage or the full fridge we inherited with rotting food Anyway now shit got serious I told her she doesnt have the right to do all of this stuff she said get out And so I began my battle plan First I documented the place by video and stills because I knew those would come in handy later for the inevitable court case And just as expected she charged us for most of our deposit based on all the damages she left What a scumbag So I plan a three pronged approach small claims  City Housing Dept  IRS All of which worked beautifully Small claims was funny she showed up with her ancient mom as herlawyer who actually fell asleep the whole case lol She didnt prepare at all and was unfamiliar with the whole process We stated our case and showed our media evidence to the judge Landlordscum tried to interject and say it was all made up He didnt buy her game though Ill always remember this part of the court hearing Judge Mrs LandlordScumIm looking at these pictures these boys hove given me and I must say that your property looks like a terrible dump I am in no way surprised that they are fighting you on this Of course she just started stammering about us being liars and shes the victim etc We got the whole deposit back On then to the housing authorities at the city I brought them a VERY detailed report we made indicating every illegalnoncode issue we could find on the property there were sooooo many We had pics and everything That place was janky and McGeyvered together like only a cheap psycho lady could do On top of that I reported her to the IRS Her neighbors HATED her and would tell us about all the problems she causes everywhere she goes She also had a big mouth and admitted that she used our house as a tax shield claiming she lived there and actually living somewhere else I dont remember all of the details about the tax stuff but I wrote down everything they told me and headed on down to the IRS office in my town I filled out a form anonymous of course which basically allows you to rat on someone you know and suspect of committing tax fraud I filled the form front to back and handed it in Shortly thereafter our deposit check arrived Then a few weeks later I heard from the neighbors that her house had a lien against it I never found out more than that but I think I pretty much fucked her I hope she saw that the power tripping and attempts to cut corners with us just ended up costing her  or maybe  times more time energy and money She may have even lost a property because of her behavior Im getting a justice boner just thinking about this all againTLDRTerrible slumlord tries to screw me so I bring the divine hand of justice upon her sorry ass   ,An oldy but a goody Landlord of doom tried to take us on and FAILED,699,pettyrevenge,top_all
AssExplosion,85,69,12mk6z,569,Im a service plumber and I have a ton of stories of petty revenge for people that have screwed me but this one is my favorite About  years ago the company I was working for was called by a realtor we had dealt with in the past to winterize a home she had listed because the owner had already moved into their new home  Now I have to explain something to everyone that reads this realtors are the single worst group of people for a service plumber to deal with  As a contractor they tend to hold no value for your time as a commodity usually want to be billed and almost always want a discount because they bring you a lot of work which is bullshit this particular realtor was the worst of the worst she also happened to be a major bitch  I was sent to the job and arrived with everything I needed exactly when my dispatcher said I would I waited in my truck another  minutes for the realtor to show up and then she bitched because she wanted the spot where I parked I moved my truck for her to make her happy   Once I got inside I started my work which was pretty easywhen you winterize a home you shut off and drain the water from the water lines water heater and fixtures after the water is removed from the fixtures you pour RV antifreeze into the ptraps and toilets  Homes are winterized to make sure water in the plumbing doesnt freeze and get damaged in case the furnace fails or the power goes out realtors and banks usually do it to protect a property that isnt occupied  I was just about done and I noticed that the main water valve into the home had a very slight drip the valve was at least  years old and was showing its age  To be honest this didnt matter much because when I was done in the house I was going to shut the water off at the street anyway and I could easily replace the leaky valve at that time if they wanted to it would have taken  minutes or just leave it alone it really was no big deal until I mentioned it to the realtor  Upon hearing that the main valve had a slight drip the realtor just flipped out she started yelling about how this was going to ruin her day and then she called the homeowner the homeowner left his work  minutes away to personally examine the situation  By the time the homeowner was called I had been on the job for about  hours including waiting for the realtor  The homeowner shows up about  minutes later with a very arrogant attitude and accuses me of purposely damaging his valve I explain that the valve is  years old and that replacing it was no big deal Because he was being a pain I offered to replace the valve for free  Replacing the valve for free wouldnt work for him so he and the realtor decided I should just fill the plumbing back up this made absolutely no sense and bitched about wasting their time with winterizing  When I was done I wrote up an invoice and presented it to the realtor while she was going over the invoice with the homeowner I went into the basement to make sure I didnt leave anything behind  The basement was clean so I began heading back up when I heard them deciding not to pay me because I didnt do anything   I was very pissed off as a rule a service plumber is only paid for the time he bills out and collects on I was out more than  days worth of pay  At that time I walked over to the furnace and shut the gas off to it long enough to extinguish the pilot light which will prevent it from working and turned the main water valve about  way on   After a curt yet polite exchange with my two newest enemies I decided to let the office handle them  About  weeks later we had a really bad cold spell and we received a lot of calls for frozenburst water lines one was from the realtor for the property I wasted her time at  Because the realtor didnt pay us for our last encounter we turned her work down  I ended up working down the street from the house I winterized a few months later it was off the market  It turns out the water piping froze and then thawed flooding out the entire home and because nobody was living in the house at the time insurance wouldnt cover the damages because they were foreseeable  Edit TLDR I am a plumber that was sent to winterize an empty home I did the work and mentioned a leaky valve to the customers the customers flip out for reasons I couldnt comprehend I was told to just put things the way they were before and I do I overheard the customers saying they wouldnt pay me so I shut off the pilot light on the furnace  weeks later the plumbing in the home burst and flooded the home good times had by all,How a plumber deals with a bad customer,638,pettyrevenge,top_all

TerrytheMerry,46,121,1nwsvb,562,So a friend and I went to a concert last Friday and got some awesome spots in the middle right near the barricade separating the crowd from the stage Unfortunately next to me was a trio of late  something or  year old drunks two men and a slutty woman who was wearing a strapless corset top that was way too small for her The first opener comes on stage a few awkward older locals who were obviously very nervous After their first song the woman starts yelling loudly about how shitty their sound is and how she cant hear shit because an amp is directly in front of her Annoying but not my problem Then the second opener comes out and the slut is obviously much more excited by them as they are more young attractive than the first and about half way through their set she begins jumping against me whenever the singer gets near while sloshing her beers all down my back Im pretty pissed now and thinking about how I hope there isnt a police checkpoint on my way home but Im still in a forgiving mood since the woman is horribly drunk and I know shes probably not all that self aware Then the second group wraps up and were all waiting on main band who everyone really showed up for to set up Im talking with my friend when we hear the other drunks trying to calm slutty down about something I start listening in and I hear this woman threatening to punch that skank in the face Curious I listen more and find shes telling the other two that I was roughly slamming into her since the first set and about how she was going to break my teeth Shocked I turned about and as politely as I could apologized but said that she must have me confused with someone else to which she replied fuck you fat ass bitch put your fake ass tits up This perplexed me for a moment as I thought she meant fists rather than tits then I realized she was accusing me of lording about my chest for attention strange considering my top came up to my neck As her companions decided to cheer her on and throw more insults my way perhaps in hopes of a cat fight I simply nodded and turned away thinking okay its my problem now A few minutes later one of the band members walked out and she began hopping up and down saggy flesh a jiggling and I took my opportunity I took a slight step back so that she slid right in front of me and as she bounced I caught hold of the thin bit of ribbon that held her teensy corset top together and watched as she jumped up one last time pulling loose the knot in the ribbon herself and all of the flesh that had been packed so tightly burst forth as the top slid to the ground The hag let out a high pitched screech and briefly searched the ground for her cover before realizing she couldnt find it among the legs of the crowd and littered beer bottles She then grabbed on of the men and fled the establishment never to be seen again I waited for someone to point me out or a bouncer to kick me out before gleefully realizing that with the excitement of the band entering no one had seen me do it Shame the woman was such a bitch it was a spectacular concertit is rather long my apologies,Now you dont get to see the concert,683,pettyrevenge,top_all
ShaneL,73,83,17vn19,567,Every May long weekend we head into the mountains for a small town festival and baseball tournament We usually go with about  regulars and there are usually a few randoms that show up to fill the roster on our baseball team We all usually cram into a couple of campsites right in the middle of the festival groundsPrior to our first game we were having our usual pregame beers I put my halffull beer down on the table while I did something else for a brief moment When I turned around my beer was missing I look over and one of the randoms is drinking it I knew it was mine because I was the only one drinking that particular brand of beer I thought that was uncool but no big lossThat evening I made a rookie mistake and left my cooler outside of my tent thinking I would hear anyone trying to get into it I woke up that morning and every beer in my cooler was gone I look over and sure enough there is a pile of empties beside the chair of the random who took my beer the day before I cant blame him but I am pretty sure A few people we were with were pretty certain it was him but were pretty drunkI was a little more pissed considering I had two flats of beer in my cooler  That evening I paid attention to this guy He arrived with a backpack containing only a couple beer which happened to be the same brand I had stolen from me the night before After about an hour he was drinking a different kind of beer Then one of our friends open drinks went missing and he had the same drink It became a bit of a game and we started drawing on our drinks so there would be no doubt about whose it was Still he kept stealing them No one was being confrontational since we were all drinkingThe petty revenge came in two formsPetty Revenge We all quietly hid the rest of our beer or locked it in a vehicle so he couldnt steal it Then whenever he would put his drink down for a second or two the group of us made an effort to grab it and hide it or pour it out We are pretty certain he started stealing from other campsites at that point so we kept pouring it out I hate seeing beer go to waste as much as anyone but it was a sacrifice we had to makePetty Revenge Our friends were playing a show at the local pub and we all went there to support them This thief became such a sideshow for the rest of us that during the show we were watching him walk around and steal drinks from people who were dancing or even collecting multiple drinks and pouring the bottoms into one glass One of the girls we were with had the brilliant idea to put some salt in it She put a dash to start and he didnt notice She put more still he didnt notice Then finally she dumped the majority of the bottle into his drink He took a swig and his face reacted like it was horrible but he continued to drink it So for the rest of the weekend this guy was either drinking salt or nothing at all ,Beer Thief,650,pettyrevenge,top_all
panicbread,67,194,1ns4oz,560,This happened many many years ago when I was a senior in high school One fine noontime I finished up with photography class and headed to the cafeteria to get some lunch The kitchen line was in a little nook separated by a wall from the cafeteria tables It was kind of dark in there I was waiting my turn when two princessy sophomores cut in front of me I asked them to get back to the end of the line They ignored me So I put one hand into my bag and switched on my Vivitar I waited a few seconds to let it get up to maximum power and stepped in front of them Hey I said When they looked at me I pulled the equipment out of my bag pointed it right in their faces and flash They both squealed in horror as they found themselves utterly blinded I quickly bought my lunch and left them both still standing in the kitchen swearing and whining and waiting to recover their sight,Have fun picking out your lunch now,754,pettyrevenge,top_all

mybossisadick,93,106,1hj66u,552,Sorry guys this is a long one feel free to skip to the TLDR Enjoy And Im so sorry for the language I never swear in real life but it feels great to finally get this off my chestAbout  years ago I left my hometown for university in the big city I was a wide eyed fresh faced  year old from out in the sticks wouldnt say boo to a goose and very innocent and shy Because of this I didnt have many friendsI soon got a job at a local restaurant as a waitress which was very upfront with their customers we were encouraged to be chatty at all times This restaurant was extremely close knit and the staff accepted me straight away we always went out after work for drinks and I eventually moved in with the ones I was closest tooThe only thing bringing me downwas my bossHe was an utter shit head but he seemed to have something in it for me in particular He would rota me down for the deep clean shifts every week out of around  staffs Mon Wed Sat Thats a am pm shift of having your head inside the grill hoods dishwashers ovens bathroom sinks customer toilets and on top of that a pmpm shift Bearing in mind I still had college to study forHe would berate me make snide remarksopenly make fun of me in staff meetings make me go get his coffee ask me to make his food and always made fun of my appearance and financial situation He knew I was desperate for money and I think he did all these things thinking I would never hand in my noticeand the fact I was an utter mouse and would never speak upOver time I became more and more confident even rising through the ranks Became head waitress staff trainer shift co ordinator and eventually a supervisor Of course this also meant I would be working closer to my boss who became even more unpleasantI graduated from college with the highest honors and received an offer from a hospital about  miles away I was training to be a nurse so the time came to hand in my notice It was very emotional as my boss said goodbye he said I wish I could say I would miss you but I wont have fun wiping peoples butts for a living He even went so far as to rota me in for my leaving partyand then proceeded to attend it himself Its fine as I powered through and shut up shop super early so I could goSo I bid everyone farewell pack up and move away to start my career and Im having a great time I pop back home every other month to see everyone and we have a good catch up although my boss would deny me the obligatory  company discount and eventually banned me outright from setting foot in the store  good

culminated in a perfect opportunityI remember being a child going to grade school and high school Sometimes you just really did not want to go So yes Ive pulled the faking that Im sick card in order to stay home but I usually felt guilty about it and would only do it  times a year at most My younger brother by  years however was less motivated in school than I was and throughout his time at school would try to pull it a few times PER MONTH Of course by the time early afternoon comes around hes playing video games and watching movies while eating ice cream Now bless my parents but after a while they just kind of let my brother get away with it all the time It was frustrating to me because I put a lot of effort into school and they were a little harder on me than they were with him I would have multiple talks with my parents on these mornings where hed be bellyaching and moaning and UUUMMMFFGHH I feel awwwfuling but they would just say I dont have the energy to deal with him today It got to the point where it was laughable I didnt think someone could have that many fevers that many colds or that many migraines that oftenAnyways by the time I was in university and still living at home my brothers frequent ailments were just a part of life That does not mean I grew placated by it quite the opposite The longer it went on the more incensed by it I became The main frustration for me was that my brother was completely taking advantage of my parents and my parents were LETTING him take advantage of them I would see their looks of exasperation often during these sick mornings and it would irk me to no endBy the time the petty revenge justice gets into play My brother is in grade  and is  years old and still faking sick several times a month My parents were going away on a huge anniversary vacation to Europe and being that I was the oldest child still living at my parents house I was put in charge of getting my younger brother to school and watching over him I was his legal guardian for the three weeks my parents were away And as his legal guardian I was going to make sure that he went to school every single day unless one of his limbs were cut offSo its early September the start of the school year and my parents leave for Europe My younger brother starts his senior year of high school everything is fine UntilThe SECOND DAY OF SCHOOL I go down to his room to wake him up and up starts the moaning Ohhhummpphhh OlderBrotherRevenge Im so sick I have such a bad cold fakeasshitcough I need to stay home Are you kidding me The second day of school you are going to pull that shit with me I was enraged but this was also my chance to finally be able to directly address this issue as I couldnt address it before My rage was building up for  years for this moment Never did I realize that it would work out so perfectlyI calmly let him know that he was in fact going to be attending school that day whether he was sick or not He IMMEDIATELY became indignant arguing with me about his bodys failings and the recuperative measures that needed to take place After about  minutes of debates I gave him an ultimatum either go to school or were going to the hospitalFine lets go to the hospital he said trying to call my bluff in a move of desperationMy nostrils flared with excitement I had nothing to do that morning Get your coatWith glee I drove him the  minute drive to the hospital and checked him into the ER the entire time with him bitching to me about how unnecessary this was and how he just needed to rest I said that since he was sick quite often we needed a doctor to check him out as I was worried about his overall health Fuming he waited with me in the waiting room for about an hour and a half before being called into triage where he gave a laughable account of his state of health The nurse looked at me with a smirk as though she knew what I was up to and I was reveling in the momentAfter another  minutes of waiting we finally get into the ER My younger brother is still complaining up a storm The nurse comes by and does the precheck asking him to cough pressing down on pressure points on his body By the end of the assessment the nurse is pretty confused as hes found nothing wrong with my brother yet How surprising I thought so he goes to get the doctor When the doctor comes hes as well perplexed by the lack of noticeable signs of concern Since theres nothing noticeable that the doctor can see he decides that everything is necessary He orders a blood test a urine sample and a CATscan for my brother My brother hates needles He turned white when the doctor said that I was over the moonThe nurse returns with the syringe for the blood test and my brother squirms back on the hospital bed in a feeble attempt to get away The nurse scolds him and tells him to manup My brothers face was still completely white and he had to look away so I was giving him small encouraging remarks that would get him through this My brother is not impressed and I can see in his eyes and his body language that hes regretting the decision he made to go to the hospital and to pretend to be sick that dayNext the nurse leaves and returns to give my brother a cup to pee into and instructs him to the bathroom With a smirk my brother says that he doesnt need to pee so he wont be able to do the urine test He thinks he won that round The nurse looks at him and says Well okay but if you dont pee into this cup Im going to have to insert a catheter into your urethra It took me every fibre in my being to not burst out laughing at my brothers expense at that little quip I am pretty sure I was visibly shaking with internal laughter My brothers face dropped faster than a boulder rolling down a hill and he grumpily asked where the damn bathroom wasWhen he returns he gets set up for his CATscan I couldnt believe they gave him a CATscan it was like icing on the cake so I just chill out with my book and read while he takes the  minute journey to the underbelly of the hospital When he returns we wait another  or so minutes with his impatient still pretending to be sick moaning at all times until the doctor comes up to us and basically says that my brother is fine and hes not sure why hes there Smiling I thank him for his time exclaim how happy I was that my brother was not in any mortal and lead my brother out of the hospital Weve been there for roughly  hours and on the way home my brother makes a comment saying Ooooh Im going to take a nice bath and then a good nap when we get home This boy thought he was in the clearOh what Didnt you hear the doctor Youre fine By my reckon its your lunchtime now Youre going home putting on your uniform and going to school for your final two periodsHe was LIVID Swore up a storm gave me as many insults as he could muster and said my parents wouldnt approve of this to try and get me to change my mind I replied They may not approve but they arent home for another  weeks I am After that he sullenly sank into his seat and didnt talk unless it was to insult meWe went home he got dressed and I drove him to school And because Im a nice brother I went into the attendance office to let them know that he was in the hospital all morning and that if he got a detention because of it they would be hearing from me Told him I love him he discretely shot me the finger and I went homeOne of the most satisfying mornings of my lifeNote We live in Canada so we have universal healthcare and didnt pay for the hospital trip Was it a waste of taxpayers money Yes Will there be people who chew me out on this Yes but sorry I needed to teach my brother a lessonNote  My parents and my extended family thought it was hilarious and approved of my actions as they were just as frustrated with himTLDR Younger brother pretended to be sick way too many times in life parents went on a vacation and put me in charge when he tried pulling that shit with me  I took him to hospital where he got a bloodurine test and a CATscan after being checked out and being given the allclear I dropped him off at school,Cry wolf long enough and youre going to get bit,648,pettyrevenge,top_all

and well known restaurant were known for a relaxed family atmosphere but mostly entertained young couples and partiesThis particular day was manic There was a music festival in town hot day a lot of punters out enjoying the atmosphere Shift running nice and smooth we got plenty of staff and were having a good bit of banter with the customers All goodEnter a gypsy family very well known in the community for being trouble makers and extremely well known in our restaurant for trying to get away with petty things such as not paying for side dishes desserts drinks complaining to get vouchers and generally being rude to our staff and a nuisance to our customersThe father is ft tall built like a brick shit house tattooed to the eyeballs and quite literally decked in gold he usually leaves all the talking to the mother a short and snappy cow with cartoon eyebrows and the nastiest false nails and hair extensions Ive ever seen On this particular occasion they bring a selection of their brood  of their bratlings The youngest is around  years old middle is  years old and eldest is early teen and all of them dirty disrespectful and snot nosedWere busy upstairs downstairs and outside seating is packed Theres a  minute waiting time for tables These guys walk in ignoring our host and find a table for themselves Host goes over and tells them theres a queue and is told to fuck off as their hungry NOW and dont want to waitWell alrighty then I apologise to those who are waiting and saw it happen but they can see there would be no reasoning with these guys and the moment passesMother comes up and barks her order at me Throws a  note on the counter and walks off Not a please or thank you in sight I call over Excuse me miss you forgot your change and your drink glasses Bring them she says without looking back to me So I doAbout  minutes later and the youngest brat is getting bored He entertains himself by spitting on the table and writing his name with his gob SCREAMING that hes starving fighting with his brothers swearing and the ultimate peeve of any waiter or waitress that has ever lived RUNNING AROUND UNSUPERVISEDHes going to go one better Hes going up to other customers tables and is TAKING food from their plates Chips garlic breads tomatoes anything he can get his hands on These guys look around for the terribly embarrassed mother who is sure to be straight behind him to apologise profusely and yank him back to their table yet nasty chav momma hasnt even looked upBrat then runs behind the counter to the cooking area we got a c grill a c griddle a chip fryer and a bain marie back there and all at a lovely head height for a  year old He pushes staff members out the way to go into the kitchen where we have the ovens and raw meat being prepared he starts pressing buttons on the oven dishwasher glasswash putting his dirty hands on our lovely clean work topsHe then runs back into the cooking area where staff have now actually noticed him and are trying to block him away from dangerous areas Hes trying to push past them starts kicking them and wants to have his own way Brat turns away and is now pawing at the cooked food being prepared on the counter top Topples a chicken salad dish onto himself and then begins eating it off himself in tears because hes so hungryIve had enough I take his wrist and take him back to his mother She glares at me then at her son snatches him up and turns back to her trough Whatever I think to myself I know theres nothing I can say to the mother about her sons behaviour She clearly doesnt care or has the power to stop him Maybe hell stay there now since the food has arrived Shift goes back to normalA few minutes later Im behind the till and feel something kicking my legs Yup its the brat I look over to his parents table theyre still engorging themselves I couldnt believe it Kid starts running around again this time instead of heading to the kitchen at the left he heads off to the disabled toilet on the right I know it has a clunky door that has the tendency to lock itself so I follow him to make sure hes okayWhen I catch up to him hes unrolled all the toilet paper and turned the sink on full blast to splash water around the floorA scolding is on the tip of my tongue but when I look into his shit brown eyes and his I dare you to tell me off smug little face I realise Im leaning on the door that has a tendency to lock itself and with a triumphant look I accidentally shut it and accidentally turn the light off I can already hear the turd screaming but the toilet is right by the music speaker and its hardly noticeableParents are about to leave  minutes later nasty momma looks around for her youngest spawn She doesnt seem panicked she glances back to the restaurant floor and over to the staff Have you seen my son she snaps They truthfully reply that they havent for I have not told them A few of them go to check upstairs in the kitchen in the fridge and freezer when one of them walks past the disabled toilet and hears a wailing Quickly they get a butterknife to turn the lock from the outside Im only watching from afar but I hear the staff member gasp and the hicupping of a child that has spent itself on screeching He has also pissed himself with terror of being locked in the dark for  minutesThe mother walks over to him smacks his bottom and turns to leave without another word And so triumphant was my glee I began to cry with held back laughterTLDR Brat child causing terror at a busy restaurant taking customers food and running through the kitchens I accidentally lock him in the disabled toilet switch off the light and he pisses himself in panicI should also mention that next time he came in he was good as gold Lesson learnt you little bastard

evlone,92,80,14acvn,511,So about  years ago I used to work for Walgreens in the photo lab I really enjoyed working there especially since the store I worked at was located in a college town with many drunk women taking pictures of things they would or would not regret the next day One day a sorority chick came in while talking on her phone and slammed a roll of film onto the counter She continued with her conversation and would not stop to tell me what she wanted That got her irritated and began to gave me looks that seemed to say well arent you going to do your job I just continued to stand there until she was done with her phone call She finally hung up and at that point I asked her how I could help her She was already irritated with me for not being able to read her mind and know what she wanted so because of that she felt the need to be rude with me She would talk down to me as if I did not know how to do my job Although she had pissed me off enough to make me want to say something I kept my composure and continued to remain professional I began to process her roll of film and printed them all out Now at that time Walgreens had not switched over from the Kodak machine to the newer digital Fuji machines so we would have to review the pictures to make sure that all the prints were fine I began to look through the pictures and the first half of the roll was nothing but sorority party pictures Nothing out of the ordinary Until I got to the second half of the roll In that half of the roll I see this sorority chick doing some things that would go on the NSFWgif subreddit So I decide to put those pictures in the very front so when she would open the envelope they would be the first prints she sees My plan was nice and simple but got even better when Ms Sorority chick arrived with a friend to pick up the pictures I hand her the envelope and she then hands them over to her friend while she paid for the pictures As soon as the pictures were paid the friend opened up the envelope pulled out the pictures and let out a gasp which made Ms Sorority chick turn to look at her friend The friend then showed Ms Sorority chick the pictures of her extracurricular activities and the face that Ms Sorority chick made was priceless She grabbed the pictures stuck them back into the envelope and practically ran out of the store with the friend right behind her Needless to say I never saw her at my store again,Dont mess with the photo guy,591,pettyrevenge,top_all

monkeywrench,73,86,189r6y,491,My ex girlfriend broke up with me the day before my birthday about  months ago we were together for over  years shared a Verizon account unlimited text and talk with gig data plan and had just activated our new iPhone s its relevant but the account is in my name I thought because she broke up with me if anything I would be the bitter one so I figured we could keep the phone plan as long as we each paid our share The initial break up was not bad so it was feasible however because she is an alcoholic and started abusing drugs after we broke up she began acting like I was ruining her life thats a story for another time When she started acting like a bitch I began looking into splitting the account getting her off mine and having her start her own in her own name I called Verizon and they said that all she needed to do was assume liability for her line no fee for splitting the account Awesome I get a hold of my ex and let her know this information I call Verizon back after texting my ex and they say that they can call her and start the process immediately Perfect do itI call Verizon the next day they said that they contacted my ex and the paperwork had been started all she had to do was call back and it would be over with She would be off my account and have her own I was very happy about this because I really wanted to lower the data on my plan for one month I use a little bit less than gig and she eats up about gig So the sooner she assumes liability for her line the better I wait a few days before calling Verizon back they say she hasnt contacted them and her line is still active on my account So I text my ex and ask her what the hold up is she says that she DID call back they were supposed to contact her and they never did but that she got a text saying that it was taken care of Ok fine I call Verizon back later that day and they said yes they were supposed to call her back but they didnt They said that the customer service representative that was dealing with her had put in an application for her to lower the deposit amount for her to start her own line I guess because her credit is so bad she was initially going to have to pay  After the application went through it was lowered to From that day on I call Verizon at least once a week to see if her line is still active on my account Every time they say yes I follow up my calls to Verizon with a text to my ex politely asking her to call Verizon so we can get this done and over with She tells me each time that she plans on doing it later that dayThis goes on for about  weeks and I am getting fed up with the bullshit I call Verizon again and ask if there is anything I can do to speed up the process They tell me that all she has to do is pay the  and she will be off my account They suggest suspending the line because that usually makes the process go faster scare her into paying and ending this whole ordeal I decline I want to give her a chance to pay the deposit without having to do something like thatI text my ex ONCE AGAIN and ask her to PLEASE call Verizon and finish the assumption of liability for her line so she can be taken off my account To summarize the conversation she basically told me that if I want her off my account then I can pay the deposit for her she has no intention on paying the  I fume for a day or two and try to think of a plan I call Verizon for the second to last time and I ask to suspend her line I guess it is uncommon knowledge that you can suspend a line on your account without billing The monthly access charge is  for each phone on the account The gig data plan is  What happens is this I suspend her phone without billing leaving her line on my account that is attached to her brand new iPhone I am no longer being charged for her monthly access  off my bill right there I lowered my data to gig just in case and thats another  or  off my bill Also once the assumption of liability process starts you only have  days to complete it After that  days the process starts over and not only does the deposit go back up to  its harder to lower it the second time around I hang up with Verizon extremely happy Not only did I suspend her line I dont have to pay for her monthly access AND since the phone number is attached to her brand new iPhone its not like she can use it anywhere elseShe texts me furiously using the wifi at the bar she spends all her time at because she doesnt have internet at her houseText OnehttpiimgurcomHbgFQjpgText TwohttpiimgurcomwvUaDVTjpgText ThreehttpiimgurcombDBFLjpgText FourhttpiimgurcomlGVmbpFjpgSo today for the last time I call Verizon and I verify that I do not have to pay for her monthly access So now instead of just paying the  and being able to use her brand new iPhone she is going to buy a new phone and start a new account because she thinks she is screwing me over Little does she know that she is actually screwing herself overIt feels good to win this fucking wartldr ex tries screwing with my phone bill suspend her line and let her fuck herself overedit some words,Get off my account,577,pettyrevenge,top_all

chocozuna,36,73,1advtq,480,Im an IT administrator at a midsized company  While my job responsibilities are primarily infrastructure and server maintenance I will assist with lower level tickets when the help desk is overloaded  Not because I have to but because I want the department to look good and to help out my coworkers  So one day I picked up an older ticket that was stagnating in the queue  I thought the delay in resolution was due to a difficult issue but instead it was due to a difficult user  The whole time Im fixing her problem shes complaining about how our department is so slow and that we are all incompetent  She is inches from my ear saying this but I do my best to ignore her and just focus on her screen  She doesnt take kindly to being ignored so she ups the volume and specks of spittle start to fly past my face  People in nearby cubes are looking at me although most seemed to be sympathetic as they were accustomed to this ladys behavior  I later find out this is why the help desk is reluctant to assist her though the tickets have target dates and we look bad when they are not metI fix her computer and leave slightly damper than when I arrived  Back at my desk I think of what I can do to avenge myself and my compatriots  I want to mess with her somehow but not in a way that would cause a lot more work for the IT department  In the end I settled on a threepronged revenge Looked up her favorites and added all nonwork related sites to the blocked list on our filter  When she asked for me to unblock some I said that sadly they were blocked for the entire company and there is nothing I could do  Then I went ahead and gave override privileges to people I liked Im one of the last to leave the office so every now and then I will power off her computer by holding the button down  I do it locally to ensure no logs are left of the shutdown  This makes it so that she has to power her machine up the next morning having to wait  minutes before she can clock in for the day  I take great pleasure in knowing I am denying her several cents each time once every  weeks  I would do it more often but then wed have to replace the computer and I wouldnt be able to blame it on power spikes The final piece involves changing her password once every month or two to something completely random  I then tell her I reset it to something like Password whereas I really make it Password  Shell type it a bunch of times unsuccessfully after which I ask her to step aside  I then proceed to type it slowly so she can see my fingers but she never sees me hold shift down for the last character  The end goal of this is to convince her that shes either really bad at typing or that shes slowly going insaneThe moral of the story  Dont treat your IT department like crap,Dont treat your IT department like crap,553,pettyrevenge,top_all

CooterSquirrel,41,58,16n7g7,453,First off I want to say that after typing all of this out I realized that it doesnt exactly fit the definition of petty revenge  For that I apologize  Given Ive already typed it out and because the ending was incredibly satisfying I figured Id go ahead amp post it anyway  This is a tale of a rude woman an awkward parking lot a firespitting amp cussfilled stranger who came to my aid and hopefully a long roadside hike for the offender  I hope you guys amp gals like it    I live in a very small town in leftern Mass where the downtown consists of about  buildings  Amongst other necessities such as the liquor store we have an independently owned fullservice gas station  Its a small but well run operation and I get gas there at every opportunity  Its located right near a highway that leads up into Vermont and because of that it gets a decent amount of business from outoftowners driving up north for vacation  The parking lotpump area is a bit narrow theres four pumps room for two cars on either side with a small entranceexit on either end for people to come amp go  Its difficult to explain the layout but theres a few carlengths of space on either side of the pump area between the pumps amp the entrancesexits for waiting cars to line upLast summer I pulled into the station to gas up my car  Im friendly with all the kids that work there  we always shoot the breeze when theyre filling my tank and I always tip them a few dollars for their effort they have a sign saying not to tip but fuck that  On this particular day this kid Alex happened to be working  hes a nice guy who I know fairly well and weve always had a good rapportA few minutes earlier on my way to the station Id stopped to help a guy stuck on the side of the road  just a simple jump to his car then we shook hands amp left  Purely coincidentally when I got to the station the same guy happened to pull into the spot across the pump from me  Well call him Tim because Im pretty sure thats what he said his name isAnyway the story unfolds like thisI was sitting in my car while the pump was running bullshitting with Alex about who knows what  Tim pulled in recognized me then got out to thank me again chit chat while Alex filled his car  The three of us were standing there pumps running for both cars just shooting the shit and making small talk  Two other cars then pulled in filling all of the pumps and causing a situation where Id probably have to back out of my spot in order to leave  On an ordinary day thats no big deal and I didnt think anything of it at the timeThen a shiny new Subaru with New Jersey plates pulled up behind me right behind me  I didnt even notice it until the woman behind the wheel honked her horn  She yelled out the window Hey Stop talking Youre in the way and Im in a hurry and honked again  We all gave her dirty looks Alex pointed to the pump sticking out of my car waved her off and we went back to our conversationThirty or so seconds later the pump did that THUNK noise indicating my tank was full  I got in my car and Alex put the nozzle away and then stood there waiting for the machine to print out my receipt  The Subaru woman honked again and then said once more through her open window Excuse me Im in a HURRY in that annoying upwardinflection amp bitchy tone of voiceAt this point I was fairly irritated but not enough for a confrontation  I had my gas and this woman wasnt worth getting mad over  So I went to back out of my spot the car in front of mine was still there actively being filled so it obviously wasnt going anywhere for a few minutes and I realized that this Subaru had totally boxed me in  I couldnt go anywhere and that was that  So I put my reverse lights on amp sat there waiting for her to get the message and back up  I figured that she would immediately let me out if she was in such a hurry to get gas and be on her notsomerry way   or so seconds passed and the woman honked again then fucking pulled forward another foot until her bumper was  inches from mine  At this point it was obvious to everyone else who was present that moving my car was out of the question  there were the gas pumps to my left and the brickfuckingwall of the gas station building immediately to my right  I was about to get out of my car and ask her to move when she honked one final timeAll of a sudden it was like a switch turned on and this guy Tim absolutely lost his shit  He was still out of his car leaning up against the pump amp trying to maintain a conversation with Alex and after the final honk he turned and started ripping this woman a new asshole  Fullforce topofhisvoice yelling waving of the arms flipping her off etc  It hadnt noticed this until he started yelling but he was a pretty muscular guy amp cut quite an intimidating figure as he walked towards her car yelling his fucking face offARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME LADY  YOU JUST FUCKING BOXED HIM IN ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED  ARE YOU A STUPID PERSON  HE WANTS TO MOVE BUT YOUR FUCKING CAR IS IN THE WAY  HE CANT FUCKING GO ANYWHERE OPEN YOUR FUCKING DAMN EYES  HONKING ISNT GOING TO SOLVE A GODDAMN THING IF HE CANT MOVE HIS FUCKING CAR YOU BITCHThroughout his tirade I was standing there awkwardly half in amp half out of my car mouth completely open and shocked at the beauty of what I was hearing  I am not a confrontational person so this exchange was wholly unexpected but was massively appreciated  he said everything Id wanted to but would never say The woman immediately put her car in reverse and sped out of the lot flipping us all off as she went  The three of us stood there and watched her drive the few hundred yards to the northbound highway on ramp and then onto the highway And then Alex started to crack up laughing and said the next exit with a gas station isnt for another  miles so if she runs out of gas shes fucked,Btch boxes me in at gas station and gets verbally assaulted by a guy who Id just helped,511,pettyrevenge,top_all

boomsc,305,327,17mlfe,449,Riiiight Im done now its late and Im bored with you all Thanks for the Karma and some interesting discussion What honestly stuns me is quite how many of you are scummy and douchey enough to think its appropriate to steal from someone I a hope you have others steal from you for the rest of your life and b hope when youre finally old enough to drink and attend university you live with some enormous angry people who have no qualms about beating you senseless after you try and steal their stuffI post in BadRoomates quite oftensince I have six of em and four are awful One in particular is terrible he lives on the bottom floor seperate form the rest of us and spends his days getting wasted high smoking cigars and repeating the process recently baked a load of Space cake the entire lower floor stinks of weed nowAnyway we had a party got drunk and my alcohol got left downstairs on the side in the kitchena few months in I finally go down to fetch it and discover a shot glass in front of my Rum and the bottle over half gone It was an expensive bottle and he was the only one who was down there to pinch it hed been enjoying a shot or two whenever he felt like it I rescued my bottles and a few weeks later finished off what was leftbut kept the bottleI bought another cheap bottle of rum poured about a quarter back into the empty expensive bottleand filled it the rest of the way upwith laxatives this thick dark syrupy type stuff that looked designed to taste pleasant and was cheap Then I put it in the downstairs kitchenNow my petty revenge is fairly obvioushowever petty revenge kind of turned into epic justiceporn worthyness or perhaps simply cruel Less than a week later he held a party with a bunch of friends loud music getting absolutely wasted At some point during the night he got high enoughor ran out of alcohol to simply grab the new bottle of his friends rum from the kitchen and shared it out amongst his friendsGod I cant tell you how wonderful it was to be woken up at am by a dozen stoned or drunk people downstairs all desperate to use the one bathroom in the house and unable to leave and go home for fear of shitting themselves if they stood for longer than a few secondsEDIT  lets see if I cant respond to a few of you en masseApparently important Someone mentioned this is important The Rum is left in the pile of bottles we all leave in the kitchen Bottles of Wine spirits and cans of beer and whatnot this is the unofficial housemate booze pile its where we leave stuff to drink so that we dont have to keep it in our rooms someone below said that makes it the equivalent of a storage cabinet that doesnt make it for public consumption He didnt touch the wine or cans or others spirits it seems just the nice looking rum It was left in my house not someone elses my home the place I pay rent to live in It was left in a communal area which is part of what I pay rent for At no point or no length of time does it become okay for someone to steal from you There is a Nintendo Wii in the communal living room its been there for five months now it doesnt mean its okay to steal it and sell it elsewhere Its not your property dont steal it Two months wasnt a casual Lol itll be fine Im not a heavy drinker I drank it at the party it got left down there I assumed in a communal space it would be fine two months later I need it to drink fetch it and realise its almost all gone And it could be there for nine months its a communal space not someones private room I dumped it in and its mine at no point can someone else steal it there isnt a five minute rule or something Some people seem to have got the wrong impression about the house layout Hes not my roommate hes my housemate there are seven of us each with our own separate rooms inside a large house The large house includes two kitchens one bathroom and one living room that are communal spaces Its three floored three bedrooms on the top floor three bedrooms and a kitchen on the middle floor and one bedroom one kitchen the bathroom and living room on the bottom floor Rumthief lives in the bottom floor bedroom and the rum was left in the bottom floor kitchen on the side out of the way When I refer to weed and the floor stinking again its not his personal floor its the communal floor the living room hallways kitchen bathroom and presumably his bedroom that stinks There are three asthmatics in the house one of which is severe enough to warrant regular checkups He knows this we all do the other smokers stand by an open window or go outside to smoke he smokes baccy and weed in the communal spaces indoors which isnt appropriate considerate and in fact is banned on the tenancy lease we all signed The other unfortunate victims of my revenge are just unfortunate victims but hardly my fault I never offered him the rum he simply took it when he was high and drunk and shared it amongst his friends its entirely his fault they suffered as well not mine in exactly the same way leaving a car unlocked so that it can be stolen doesnt make you liable for the people the thief runs over I expected him to take a few shots of it and suffer the consequences not down the entire thing along with a dozen other friends the first port of call if you decide to assume something is communal especially something expensive is to ask if it belongs to anyone Any of the other five people living in the house could have told him without any hesitation the bottle belonged to me and wasnt for sharing And for the record

banana,27,83,1blvwy,434,I have two pretty terrible roommates that share a filthy room  They never clean and then they get mad when I ask them to help out  They also broke my vacuum cleaner the one time that they did actually clean by sucking up too many pop tart wrappers  Rather than fix it they put it away still broken and then bought themselves a new vacuum which they hide in their room and never actually useI have a cat and they ADORE her  She is pretty fat and lazy and the only time she moves quickly is when she hears the tinkling sound of her food being poured into her bowl  When she hears that sound she sprints to her dishNow for the pettiness I have decided that my terrible roommates do not deserve the love and attention of my precious cat  Whenever I see my roommates let the cat into their room I wait a few minutes for her to settle down and get comfortable  At this point my roommates always close their bedroom door because they are so embarrassed by how filthy their room is  I then drop just a few pieces of food into my cats bowl  She hears the tinkle of the food hitting the dish and then meows like crazy until my roommates get up off of their lazy asses to let her out of their roomtldr  I have filthy slobs as roommates and they love my cat  I distract my cat with food so that she wont pay attention to them,Terrible roommates dont deserve to play with my cat,517,pettyrevenge,top_all

DevilWorshipper,31,82,1egmib,425,About  years ago my wife now ex and I were active members on an amateur poetry site where folks would submit their poetry and get feedback and friendly criticism from other members of the forum At the time there were approximately  members and maybe  who contributed and commented on a neardaily basis The community was overall a nonpretentious bunch with the glaring exception of two members who thought their shit didnt stink and took it upon themselves to shit on everybody elses work at every turn Typical internet knowitalls with a nasty penchant for putting people down and making them feel bad for sharing their poetry with others Over time we noticed members were not returning particularly after being on the receiving end of one of these assholes criticismsWe got tired of the community being tornapart by these guys and hatched a plan we created  new user accounts One contributed nothing but lesserknown poems by Sylvia Plath Another nothing but obscure William Carlos Williams You get the idea The others were ee Cummings Ralph Waldo Emerson and TS EliotOver the course of three months or so these users regularly contributed their poetry to the site As usual most of the community was positive in their feedback and a few were genuinely impressed We even had to PM a few users who were hinting at being suspicious and let them in on the joke However the two aforementioned almighty warrior neckbeard poets just as we knew they would shit all over the work at every turn even offering their own improvements every now and then It was hilarious to see these guys offering their critiques of poets like TS Eliot and Sylvia Plath as if the authors of these poems were just anonymous unenlightened and angsty teenagers on the internetAfter three months of this we finally unveiled the truth in a lengthy post that referenced every single poem and its true author There was a day or so of futile and desperate justifications by the two overlords of allthingspoetic They tried to make the distinction that there was a reason these particular poems were notwellknown by the general public but the laughter shared by the rest of the community became too much for them and they eventually gave up and never returned The site went on for another couple of years until it was inexplicably shut down by its creators Every once and a while an asshole or two would showup and try to belittle people and if it got too bad we would pull the same stunt EDIT I should clarify these two guys werent assholes so much as they were pretentious assholes This was a site for amateur poets and these two guys treated every submission as if it was meant to be ready to join the ranks of the immortalsIts possible that at least one of them was a literature professor at a community college Nevertheless they were both extremely confident in their breadth of knowledge and expertise and in a few rare cases they did manage to offer something constructive but that was not the norm They were arrogant fucks who gotoff on taking advantage of the fact that maybe they did have more knowledge and expertise on the subject of poetry than the rest of us who never made such claimsSo the beauty of this revenge is that we turned the tables on these guys and they couldnt see the in their world obvious fact that this amateur poetry was really written by professionals,My poetry lacks depth and clarity you say,507,pettyrevenge,top_all

TokkiGoesRawr,54,91,15xuyq,430,Ehhhhh I think its pettySo I am currently employed at Chuck E Cheese working as a cashier that bounces back and forth between registers and the merch counter you know where kids get to pick their prizes and such  It is rather ironic because truth be told I really do not like children at all  Oh well it is just what you make of it that and it is a job for the mean timeOne day we are just beyond busy with only two registers and only one person alone at merch  I decide to jump in and help my fellow coworker because it was just obvious she needed someone to help her  This one dad wanted to get a prize that his daughter wanted but was just a wee bit short but I mentioned that he could pay the rest of it with cash  I had told him I could help him at my register  As I he was following me I noticed that this older lady had got out of line to follow him to my register  When his transaction was completed I had every intention of going back to the merch counter to help my coworker since the line was still long  As I was about to step away the older lady that was behind the guy slammed her purse down on the counter and just scowled at me as if she knew I was going to walk away  Okay I thought this is no big deal  Ill just help her and be done with itWhen I was hired I was told that I had to suggestive sell because it helps bring in more money so that is what I did even though I honestly do not like to do it  There is this promotional deal going on that prints out this long receipt and I have to explain what it is to every guest that completes a transaction no matter how big or small the purchase no big deal even though it is a mouth full  I guess she felt like I was trying to dismiss her or something and when I read her back what she ordered she said in the most snottiest tone And I want a coffee FRESH  And while you bring me my FRESH coffee I will be speaking with you manager takes a look at my nametag lanyard TokkiGoesRawr  Now mind you since coffee is not exactly a highly ordered item the coffee is just in one of those hot water dispensers so it stays warmhot all day and it is made as soon as we open so at  AM  This all happened around  PMHonestly I did not think I did anything wrong so I was not upset or even remotely phased  I bring her out her fresh coffee and as she had said she was talking to my manager  I hand her the coffee and she scowls at me once more and says see I am talking to your manager like I said I would  With a stoic face I reply Im sorry obviously not sincere  She retorts with thats not sincere enough  Once again with stoic face unwavering I reply with Im sorry  Her scowl just intensifies and she goes back to talking to my manager and says to him shes only apologizing because youre here  I come here all the time and I have NEVER had anyone treat me with such disrespect and carry such a bad attitude  My manager turns to me and just tells me to take  in the break room  No big deal  I am STILL not even remotely phased or upset  Later he pulls me aside and tells me she has complained about EVERYONE here so to be honest with you I just wanted you off the floor so it looks like I am doing something about it  Im not even mad or upset with you  I just smile at him and tell him Im going back to merch  SIDE NOTENow I am usually generous enough to round up on a receipt that has like  ticket on it to  because the lowest prize you can get is in the  ticket bin  Besides I think it is so disheartening to tell a kid that they can not get a prize because they only have like  tickets  Also the managers do not really mind when we do thatTwo hours pass by and as I am stocking the merch counter I see that the old crotchety lady is back with her grandson to pick out a prize  However they were looking at the other case and did not even acknowledge that they needed help  I was done filling one bin I turn around and this once kid who was barely tall enough to see over the counter hands me his receipt and he has  tickets which he then tells me that he wants stickers and he even threw in a please  Honestly it is such a rarity for kids nowadays to have and know manners that it just always makes me smile whenever a kid can use it  Just as I was about to hand him his stickers and send him on his merry little way the old lady was like I know you saw me standing here  That little boy was behind meI gave her this flabbergasted look because honestly I did not know what to say or do because it was just a super quick transaction  I gave the kid my most apologetic look and told him that I would be with him in just one second  As I was walking toward her and he grandson she yells Do you want me to talk to your manager AGAIN  I just sigh and ask the little boy what he wanted and he insisted that he  gets a lollipop which can be bought using tickets  She just throws his receipts at me and I look at them and instead of rounding up I just add them just the way they are  OH WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT  He is JUST  tickets shy of getting his coveted lollipop  Sorry kid you do not have enough for you lollipopCant you just give it to him she screams at meSorry I cant do that  Its against company policy  Maybe next time he will win enough to get it  I reply with my biggest smileShe is fuming as her kid flops on his back on the floor and throws a huge temper tantrum  She snatches the receipts out of my hand and literally drags he grandson out of the store but before she leaves I yell Have a MAGICAL dayI go back to the sad little forgotten kid and I give him his stickers and throw in a couple pieces of candy on the house  He smiles an adorable smile and repeats thank you thank you thank you as he runs to find his parentsTLDROld crotchety bitch is rude  I do not round up her kids receipts like I usually would with other guests  ,Just  short Aww too bad Maybe if your grandmother was nice I would have been too,521,pettyrevenge,top_all

ShaneL,65,86,16vduq,420,One afternoon a few years ago I was at my apartment for lunch When I was leaving I found a note on my windshield that readHi ShaneLThis is neighbors name I just witnessed a grey honda civic with license plate  hit your car as it was parking They moved to the other side after hitting your car probably to make it look like it wasnt them If you have any questions my number is  This neighbor was a nice older woman I had met a few times in the parkade of our building On this day I was parking in the visitor parking because it was a better spot and empty during the day After doing some investigating and evidence gathering I was able to determine that the honda civic next to me had a fresh scratch that started and stopped at the exact same height as the one on my car I knew it was fresh because there was a loose black chip of paint the color of my car hanging from it My car had grey paint in the scratch The scratch itself was about  tall by about  long There was also a unique deeper impression about a  of the way up the scratch that lined up perfectly with a protruding piece of the civics bumper Took photos with measuring tape on each partAs I was doing my investigation the owner came out A girl in her s along with her boyfriend I confronted them but as expected they denied it despite the mounting evidence to the contraryI explained my situation to the building manager and then went to the police The police were impressed with my evidence and said they would send someone out When I got back to my apartment the building manager explained that she had the car towed for parking in the visitor parking spot They normally dont care but because of the situation she wasnt giving letting this girl offThe cop showed up shortly after and looked through my evidence and spoke to my witness She said she was going to press charges for hit and run but it would be a few days since she was on days off as soon as she left my placeA couple days later I get a call from another cop telling me they are no longer pressing charges because there wasnt enough evidence I was shocked and asked what type of evidence he needed is a witness and scaled photos didnt work He told me he never seen the photos and my witness told me she didnt talk to anyone elseThat night I got a call from the cars owner demanding I repay her the  it cost her for towing and impound charges Claiming it was all my fault and the police told her she was innocentAnother couple days later and I called the original cop I dealt with who was now back on duty She explained her partner screwed up and confused the files for two similar cases she had She explained they were still pressing charges but were having trouble getting a hold of the girlKnowing that the girl wanted money I came up with a plan to meet her at a specific time so the cop could charge her When I showed up the girl did as well with two guys who I assume were there to intimidate me Once I confirmed it was the girl the cop came out from around the corner She became very difficult towards the cop so the cop actually arrested her and then had her car towed and impounded  AGAINA few weeks later I realized that this girl was parking in the visitor parking overnight on a weekend It was a holiday weekend so the building manager office was closed so there was no fear of parking in those spots The best part was I was on the th floor of our building and had a balcony looking straight down on visitor parking I purchased a lb bag of potatoes and had target practice all night ,Hit and Run,506,pettyrevenge,top_all

DutchessSFO,34,92,1lrltt,409,This is from a few years ago but I still love telling this story Sorry its kind of long So I owned a townhouse in Chicago and as it is when you live in the city we had very limited parking We each had a garage and in addition there were two guest parking spaces shared with  townhouses I lived there for a year and all was fine when my BF came over he had a place to park and it made things very easy That is until a new neighbor moved in New neighbor moved in and proceeded to park his junker car in the guest space and never moved it Now the bylaws of the homeowners association state that the guest spots are for guests and absolutely no nonoperational vehicles or vehicles with expired tags could be parked there New neighbors car sat there for weeks and never moved I left a note for him because I never saw him and asked him to move his car It never moved So getting tired of this ugly junker parked in front of our house taking up a precious parking space I called the property manager and complained It worked initially the car was parked on the street for a few days but because it didnt move the city tagged it for towing and it was immediately back in the guest parking spot I gave the guy a chance but a week later car was still in the guest parking space collecting dust I called the property manager and complained and car moved This went on a couple times and then nothing happened Car just stayed there no matter how much I complained the property manager would ignore it She was ignoring my calls and wouldnt talk to me I finally got her on the phone and said I needed to stop complaining because the owner of the car Needed more Time to figure out what to do with his car I asked her how much time is More time and she just kept saying he Needed more time I was pissed because he was tying up a hard to find parking space with a car that doesnt run and it was obviously breaking the rules and he had been given plenty of time All I could get was He needs more time Fuck it I give up Fast forward three months and Im doing some remodeling on my house and I drag a bunch of garbage to the curb on a Saturday Carpet tile wood flooring scraps etc all building materials from my remodel I know the city wont be there till Thursday but I have a business trip and figure it sitting outside for a couple days wont hurt anything I leave on Monday and I get a call in the evening from the Property Manager basically yelling at me saying I cant leave that stuff on the curb and I need to bring it in my garage immediately until thursday when the city picks up the garbage I explain that Im out of town and I cant get there to move it etc and she blows up on me about this and that and rules Finally I pause and say I need more time She says what did you say I said In the past when rules have been broken a I need more time is a good excuse So thats it I need more time She stuttered and I just kept repeating I need more time You should have heard her rage on the phone It was absolutely glorious the frustration and anger in her voice as I just kept repeating I need more time She hung up on me she was so pissed Now like a good neighbor I called the city immediately and asked them to send a special pickup the next day but god did I like throwing her own words back in her face TLDR  Property manager wont enforce the rules and says neighbor Needs more time to fix their violation When property manager calls me and demands immediate resolution I respond with I need more time to her rage and frustration ,Revenge on Property Manager,501,pettyrevenge,top_all

CFO,23,94,1ihcet,409,This was about three and a half year a go I was working in a supermarket specifically in the candy and crisps aisle A huge obese woman enters the aisle with her ish year old son Ive seen them before they are regulars The kid is obese too Its not hard to imagine why as they usually fill up the shopping cart with so much food that its literally filled to the brim Now this kid is always annoying running around screaming and being a general waste of space But this time he was accompanied by two of his friends which made it even worse To demonstrate how cool he was he kicked over a stack of boxes Id put in my aisle when his mom was in the next aisle There were glass pots with Doritos dip in there and I saw that one broke because  dip started pouring out of the cardboard box He obviously ran away with his friends before I could say anything to him I was too busy to give a shit The really annoying thing is that the mother returned to my aisle I was expecting an apology because she obviously heard boxes fall and products break as her kids ran away laughing and screaming But no apology she just came back for more candy She leaves her shopping cart in my aisle and walks away probably to grab even more foodIm still stocking shelves by this point when I have a brilliant idea I put at least  of candy in her shopping cart It was so full I figured she wouldnt notice I chucked some expensive chocolates and whatnot in there She comes back and takes her cart she does not notice the extra stuff and leaves She arrives at the registers and screams for her son to join her I heard this and went into the managers office for a good view She starts putting her items on the belt when she notices the expensive chocolate She proceeded to scream at her son do you know how much these are etc and the kid obviously claims he didnt put the items in the cart His mom doesnt believe him and makes him put the stuff back which amuses his two friendsI wish he could see my smug grin from the office I hope he realized who actually did it and learned a lessonWhew that turned out to be a longer story than I intended,Annoying obese kid learned not to mess with staff,503,pettyrevenge,top_all
AggieChick,58,71,178qak,405,So my Junior year of college I transferred Universities to a school where I did not know a single person As a poor student in a new city I had not choice but to go potluck on a rooming situation at a student housing complex near the school I did not know the name of my new roommate until a week before I was due to move in and sent her a friend request on facebook to introduce myself She never accepted the request Although my school is  hours away from home my mom drove down with me to help me set up my apartment Walking in she saw my new room mate setting up the living area and greeted her with a pleasant Howdy This bleach blond talon manicured raccoon makeuped princess brat glanced up from her Iphone looked my mother up and down with a disdainful look and turned her back to walk to her room without saying a word I was shocked at her appalling rudeness but figured we could talk it through later when it was just the two of us in the apartment  I opened the fridge we were meant to share and found that she had packed it to the point where I could hardly fit a couple of water bottles in with cheap light beers and diet food I stacked some of the stuff that was not too fragile so that I could make some room for my own groceries Later when I went to go buy some apartment supplies I found she took out some of my stuff she deemed as able to survive outside the fridge on the counter my water bottles apples etc  Upon viewing our bathroom I found that she had moved my stuff around so she got all the prime space in the cabinets and the best towel rack dont act like you dont know there is a better towel rack in your shared bathroom lol I was upset about all this mainly the issue with my mother so I text her asking if we could have a little chatWe met later that night and she listened to what I had to say but failed to apologize Never one to raise my voice or express the depths of my frustration I took her sorry did not hear your mom and yeah I did not realize that would bother you you can have some fridge space and decided not to pursue things over for the sake of peace in our apartment   What I did not know is that there was a different reason other than she is just a brat that she was treating me like this I heard her speaking on the phone to someone that she did not understand why she had to live with someone like herme and that she did not want to live here anymore I did not get the big deal until later that week when her friends came over and I heard one of them inquire about my Dos Equis beer in the fridge Oh Its like from the motherland for her lol she replied She did not know I was home so I heard her continue with some jokes about my being Mexican and a loner not that it makes a difference but Im a third generation American Im proud of my roots but also where I am now She got really drunk with her girls that night and went out on the town She began the weekly tradition of bringing home a guy from the bars sleeping with him and leaving him face down and buck naked on our shared living room couch never understood why he did not just sleep in her room I was hurt Im a proud Latina and never really thought hard that an educated individual would be so ignorant as to judge me solely by my race I stewed about it and being timid and not the arguing kind chose to fall into the most awkward living situation ever with us living side by side completely ignoring the others presence   I got sick and tired real quickly of her sexual escapades and drunken messes Did I mention she faked orgasms so loudly that even turning up my Ipod all the way could not cover the squealing sound I got sick of hearing her tell her mother about the Mexican and how unfair it all was I spent a lot of time away from the apartment largely to avoid her which helped out in the long run because I made a solid and fun group of friends pretty quickly   Towards the end of our time together I thought you know what I have put up with this long enough Time for some payback I thought of all the things that might annoy her and remembered the Dos Equis incident at the very beginning If she was going to ignorantly judge me on stereotypes then stereotypes were what I was going to force feed her I decided that if she was going to complain about a Mexican roommate she was going to get the full Mexican experience  I called up a bunch of my Latino friends and asked if they would like to spend  the night at my apartment and get uproariously drunk While she hid from us in her room she always disappeared whenever I had company They set up their sleeping bags all over the apartment and we proceeded to get wasted on Tequila I provided while listening to ranchero music as loud as possible We talked about her in Spanish loud enough for her to hear making sure we threw in her name ever so often so that she could know she was the topic we were laughing about She came out of her room around am when everybody was snug in our little Tijuana of sleeping bags and I could nearly feel the intensity of the disgust rolling off of her It was quiet enough for me to listen as I heard her sobbing in her room on the phone telling someone that They were here and were so loud earlier she could hardly hear herself think Gee I wonder how that feelsThe rest of the semester I hardly saw her I think she stayed at a friends houseTldr Roommate chose to judge me based on unjust racial stereotypes stereotypes were what I gave her EDIT Spacing Tried to make the wall of text more readable lol,Gloriously petty revenge on a

VigilantInfidel,69,131,1m2nrp,404,This happened a couple hours ago Im a manager at a retail store and its policy to welcome everyone as they come through our doors as well as followingup with them often as they shop in case they need assistance Some people perceive this level of attention as annoying but customer surveys tell us this is the thing that makes us stand out against our competitors Apparently corporate thinks its worth aggravating the few customers a week who hate social interaction to make sure all our customers are attended to promptlyI greeted one particular gentleman at the door and we made eye contact but he immediately broke it off and he ignored me when I asked if I could help him find anything today This reaction isnt unusual and I moved along to greeting the next person I eventually moved to another part of the store for my rounds and kept running into the same gentleman Id ask him each time if he was still doing alright or if he wanted any help and he started going out of his way to avoid me if he saw me at the end of whatever aisle he was onNote I wasnt constantly badgering him He was a slow shopper and I was doing laps in the store keeping an eye on everything I actually broke policy and stopped asking him if he needed anything because I didnt want to be annoying but hed still go out of his way to turn his back to me every time he saw me Oh well I hate bothering people but his reaction was a bit overdramatic I carried onAt one point a customer waved me down from the other end of an aisle where I was and I had to walk past the gentleman to get to the other customer He turned away from me to walk away realized a very large woman was blocking his exit and turned back As I neared him he gave me this look ofoh I want to say smug annoyance and condescendingly said Nothings changed since the last twenty times you asked I raised an eyebrow at him and said Okay and continued by to go help the lady who called me overThe lady took quite a bit of my time and since we were understaffed today no one else was on the sales floor for general customer assistance Well guess who started reluctantly standing around waiting for me to help him when he suddenly couldnt find the last item on his shopping list Hed try to be in my peripheral and look impatient but would randomly walk off to presumably see if anyone else could help him coming back more annoyed and impatient each time Finally when I broke free from the pleasant lady it happened to be in the middle of a spell where the guy had wandered off I caught him in my peripheral in the distance trying to get back to where I was but I had already achieved escape velocity and was heading toward the Employees Only backroom Petty Yup Bad customer service Admittedly so but letting him see what that felt like was pretty catharticTLDR I work  hours a week and my willingness to tolerate entitled pricks is not an infinite supplyEdit Apparently some people think greeting a customer and then politely checking up on them twice in a span of  minutes constitutes harassing them Thanks to those of you who provided legitimate tips on how to deal with the socially awkward instead of implying that I brought it on myself by following my own stores policy,Customer learns that employees can play his game too,535,pettyrevenge,top_all

Rocknocker,51,104,18kiiz,402,Harkening back to the heady and lawless days of grad school several protogeo types found themselves not only taking all the same classes but living in and generally laying waste to the same floor in the dormsSince we were all more or less headed in the same direction careerwise that is into the Oil Patch and since all were geology majors we were required to take rather a lot of chemistry Inorganic was fun organic was even a larger bales of cheers but detonic chemistry was were all the really inspired stuff transpired Now there has to be a certain fly in this scholastic ointment and there was one student was thought oil companies to be evil incarnate and wanted absolutely nothing to do with those sell outs that would gladly trade their souls for an overriding royalty interest and opportunity to get filthy rich Also he whom we shall dub Mark was an avid environmentalist No screw that He was a rabid environmentalist He hated with the burning passion of a thousand blazing supernovae any of the extractive industries coal and metals mining oil and gas hell even dimension stone quarries and gravel pits were objects of his notinfrequent vociferous denunciations and let us all know full well he was studying not only geology but the softer kinder geology that is hydrogeology Bleedin waterheads However in order to obtain his degree he still had to take most all the same courses as we regular landraping cigarchomping boozeswilling smallfurryanimalabusing petroleum types Two key points he didnt take the same amount of chemistry as we foregoing detonic chemistry for aqueous chemistry and he loathed just being in the same classroom with us evil more practical types The upshot being is that he never learned what are and what makes hell for that matter how to make certain contact explosives and he eschewed going to class Rather hed learned that if you give a dorm rooms door a good short sharp shock ie bashing the door just above the lock with the palm of your hand the door would flex and pop open hell the doors were so flimsy you could just about knock one down with a blunt remark Hed then secret himself inside swipe our class notes we took the best notes run down the hall to the copier and Xerox the living hell out of them Hed hit everyone but give the devil his due he was one sneaky bastard Never the same room twice for the same courses notes and he never left any form of incriminating evidence behind reminding everyone the time frame of this particular sneakery before CSI and DNA analysis But more than once he was discovered with Xeroxed notes obviously not in his handwriting We never confronted him I mean wheres the fun in that but did concoct a plan so devious to extract our little slice of payback Remember detonic chemistry the science of what makes things go BOOM Well we all had fully two semesters of this under our collective belts and had practically memorized the chapters on contact explosives Contact explosives are truly wonderful compounds Simplicity itself to whip up a batch cheap as well as they all used common offtheshelf chemicals and lie in wait to plan our next move I wont list the identities of  all the compounds we were creating for fear of some less chemicallyminded person trying to create a batch and end up blowing their eyebrows off but there is one that I simply must mention Nitrogen triiodide good ol NI Very stable stuff when wet which allows for easy transfer as soon will be seen and fiendishly easy to detonate with a satisfying flash boom and puff of purple with the lightest touch when dry So while Mark was in his water class and none of us were we entered ahem his dorm room and began to paint everything he owned with NI It doesnt take much and when dry it really doesnt show up well at all especially against darker surfaces Safety note we only used the smallest amounts though everywhere more to pixilate rather than annihilate First was the door lock a little NI on a Qtip and deposit it right in the very bowels of the lock then onwards to escalationon the handle of his toaster on each and every knob of his little black and white TV more on the stereo controls on all his loose change which he kept in a shallow bowl much of his silverware under his coffee mugs we went nuts but restraint stayed our hands as we did not paint the interior of his Koss headphones as much as we wanted to We all retreated to the commons for a cold brew and fine cigars thought I was kidding earlier and await Marks return I recall that a spontaneous poker game broke out as well so much the better for our cover story About halfway through a fine maduro handrolled Mark shows up gives us all a collective grimace think Kent in Real Genius but without the charm and harrumphs himself off to his sanctum sanctorum Down the end of the hall we all sat in the commons and had a pretty good view of his room and awaited the inevitable POW There was the first one the old key in the lock full of NI Beyond a look of surprise and a muffled bastards he shrugged it off like the harmless little prank that it was Keys tossed into the change bowl BLAM Stereo switched on KERPOWFridge opened FAGROONMark realized he was well and truly boned He began to get a bit manic and ran around his room slapping everything and recoiling every time some heretofore inanimate object started lusting for his giblets  BLAM POW KERFOON KERBLOOIE and other associated noises of really really rapid chemical decomposition So much so in fact that his room was actually leaking purple smog which started drifting down the hall in small cloudlets After  minutes or so of this Mark thinks hes finally found all the spots we sabotaged walks out of his dorm room door and gives us a joint sneer that if fatal would have sent us all home in buckets After all this brouhaha and communal buffoonery it goes quiet and things as are their wont lapsed back into a state of scholastic serenity I wonder if he found the spot where I painted the NI under the toilet seatA sudden flash a muted boom and Mark screeching at us with his pants around his ankles told us that yep he just didTL DR Dont swipe course notes from people who have easy access to a chemistry lab,Better Living Through Chemistry OR Notes to You,506,pettyrevenge,top_all

I wanted to be hired at this temp agencyI told my friend about this girl and the experiences I kept having with hertheir office she said to call the office back and ask for this other guy Lets call him Jim because he has a soul unlike this girl So I do but instead of getting put through to him the operator routes me to the same girl She gets on the line and without even saying Hi she just goes Why did you ask to talk to Jim I say Oh Friend mentioned shed worked with him and I was still having trouble receiving the emails you sent me so I just figured Id try someone elseI kid you not she says Okay I dont think they ever worked together number one and number two I have sent you that email like four times already so maybe somebody can help you use a computer JesusI say that I am really sorry but I havent received any emails Without hiding any annoyance she says shell try to send it to me one last time and to hold TWENTY MINUTES LATER she comes back on the line and says OK I sent it did you get it Wow it showed up in my email I politely thank her and casually say something like  Okay so just take these tests and you can show them to potential employers just trying to politely end the phone callAnd she says Well I already told you that after our interview but I GUESS I COULD TELL YOU AGAIN YES BLAH BLAH BLAH I thank her again and hang upMaybe I am too sensitive but this girl was a total asshole to me and the entire time I had to be polite to her I continue my job search and move on I actually land a new job pretty quickly and it ends up being a GREAT fit and I love it and have been there for about three weeks nowAbout a week following that exchange she calls me again and tries to schmooze me into accepting this temp job that is one month long and  minutes away She WILL NOT STOP TALKING and I can barely get a word in to tell her Ive found a permanent job and am not interested I had time to process our interactions and decided that I really dont want to work with that temp agency if she is my assigned recruiter and Id have to constantly be in communication with her Just as temp workers are disposable to them there are more temp agencies in this area if I am ever in need again When she finally stops talking I tell her I actually found a permanent position and that I am no longer available for temp work with her office She asks me where I work I say Id rather not say She asks me why not I say because Im not interested in having further ties with their office and to please remove me from their records as an available temp She sounds completely indignant and says Oh okay then well goodbyeI guess Goodbye yourself wenchFlash forward to today when I am working Someone comes into the office and I hear them talking to someone on my team I head over to the copy machine and see that its her She greets me with this HUGE smile like were old friends or something extends her hand to shake mine and shoves her business cards in my hand saying if our office ever needs any temps her company would be happy to provide them to us She goes on and on listing various stats from her company and saying that I was indeed a temp at her office My supervisor looks at me and I just say Yes it was a very interesting experience I should probably get back to work Nice seeing you After she left my supervisor comes over and asked me why I reacted like that I tell her I had been hired on at that temp agency and that girl was my recruiter and she had absolutely no people skills whatsoever I quoted some of the things she said to me as it only happened less than a month ago and I just had a really bad experience with the agency in general She was still holding the business cards and after hearing that she ripped them in half and put them in the trash and said Wow thanks for letting me know Weve been thinking about hiring a temp agency before next summerProbably doesnt mean anything but I know recruiters focus heavily on their business clients and obviously treat their temps like shit Funny how if youre working with a bunch of people who are trying to find permanent work its likely that one day youll run into them in a business youre wanting to to business with your company This probably isnt the greatest Petty Revenge but it sure made my day,Temp agency recruiter treats me like shit as a temp employee for her firm awkwardness ensues when she later tries to schmooze me and my boss at my new permanent job,468,pettyrevenge,top_all

FierceFox,68,84,1npqx0,394,The other week I got some new neighbors in my apartment complex A nice elderly couple and their douchey manchild son I like the parents theyre the sweetest folks Ive met in KC yet but their son their terminally unemployed douchebag son is a different story This guy loves his Edd Hardy bullshit shirts cologne  and spiked hair like its cheap liquor which he also loves judging by the bottles left on the porch He also has a penchant for playing shitty rap as loud as possible once everyone else goes to work for the day This isnt a problem for the other two units because theyre at work but Im home during the day and usually asleep since I work nights The first day I ignored the loud music because I was tired from a crappy night at work and not in the mood to deal with his shit I turned on my own ambiance white noise stuff and tried to get some sleep His music kept going until about pm when folks start coming home after which he turned it off I got some real sleep after that which was nice When I woke up that evening and went outside to have a smoke and let my dog run around and potty I caught the douchey son having a smoke too We made a bit of chitchat and learned this guys parents paid for all his shit so he didnt have to He was recently divourced so his parents had taken pitty on him and taken him in He bragged about the shiny blue hatchback with the bitchin rims that belonged to him which was double parked at the bottom of the lot and shity stereo system he liked to bump in the day This was great a perfect segway into what we needed to talk about so I asked him to maybe turn it down during the day sighting the fact that hes not the only one here during the day that I live next door and sleep in the day and common fucking decency His response was for me to go fuck myself and my shitty rat dog shes a Belgian ShepherdGrey Hound mix so she isnt rat sized but she is shit colored He said he had a right to play his music as loud as he wanted to during the day and to mind my own businessInstalling youdunfuckedupassholeexeInstallation completeOkay chief Ill play your game I then spent my night at work trying to figure out how to get back at him My first idea was to burn the building down whith him in it because I hadnt leveled a building in a while but I like my place so that was out the window His car was next on the list and I thought about torching that too which would have been fun just too over the top With fire still on my mind I decided to fight fire with fire and shitty music with one the greatest pieces of music ever written Beethovens th Symphony on repeatWhen I got home that morning I unpacked my surround sound system and placed all my speakers right up against the wall These arent tiny little things either These are four foot tall speakers and I have six of them When their volumes are maxed out these things will leave your ears ringing for day and a half For whatever reason Douchey McGee didnt bump his beats for a few days and I started to think that maybe he had just had a bad day when I first talked to him When Im in a bad mood I can be a pretty gaping asshole so it wasnt too far fetched to me And then Friday rolled around and at about noon he started his shit againI roll out of bed put my robe and moccasins on and went next door to try and resolve this shit I knocked on the door a few times and then pounded on it before he answered smelling of liquor and bullshit I asked him to turn the music down once and was called a faggot for the pink robe I was wearing I then demanded he turn the music down before this gets serious He took that as the threat it was and got all up in my face like we where back on the block and chest bumpedme in an attempt to intimidate meLolgoodluckgifSix years in the Army and Afghanistan have made me immune to this kind of shit so I just shrugged it off and put my plan onto motion I put my CD in the player cranked the volume and brewed some coffee I listend to my music for a couple of repetitons before grabbing my ear muffs out of a tough box Now these things are awesome theyre basically military grade noise cancelers so once they go on I cant hear anything After about an hour of the Beethoven barage the Douchemaster came and pounded on my sliding glass door with the most pissed off expression he could he could muster Expecting a surrender I turned the music off and opened the door I was immediately assaulted with a torrent of profanity and threats because he couldnt hear his shit music He went on for a few minutes before losing steam once he realized I was more interested in my coffee than his tyrade Once he stopped I let him know in no uncertain terms that I can do this longer than him and that it will continue until he starts acting like a reasonable neighbor He swore at me a bit longer before storming away He turned his crap down so I turned mine off and minus two other times his music got too loud in the day things have gone swimingly Tl DRDouchlord bumps his beats at an unreasonable volume during the day so I bump back with Beethoven,Mess with my sleep I hope you like the

ShaneL,28,89,1agit9,396,One of my first serving jobs was at a large  seat restaurant This place was horribly managed and because of that it was empty most of the time especially weekend afternoonsWe had a manager who was a server for only a couple of months before that and didnt know shit about the business When I say manager I am referring to the no power type of manager that cant hire or fire anyone He was basically there to correct problems and help out wherever he was needed For a couple of weeks prior to this incident this manager was being verbally abusive to staff Whenever he got stressed out it was like he would explode and say the worst possible thing imaginable Finally he did this to one of our well liked and pregnant waitresses calling her a whore and her husband a piece of shit Being highly emotional she cried and everyone was pissedA couple of days after he insulted the pregnant waitress just so happened to be April Fools Day There were three of us scheduled to work that afternoon He just so happened to be kind of rude to us while we did the typical restaurant setup I convinced the other two servers to play along I called my girlfriend at the time and had her call in a reservation for  people I then had the hostess do the same I had a couple more people do the same The kitchen staff were in on it we didnt want them prepping for massive amounts of people and wasting good food So we have multiple large party reservations all scheduled for the same time which was right away He comes running over to us and told us to setup the tables for these large parties We told him it was too many for just us and that he would have to help out which was his job He refused and went and sat at the bar and watched TV while we were supposed to be setting upWe went to him and said fuck this we quit We walked outside and into a little storage area we had out back The other server had a smoke while we let the manager stew in this dilemma We were outside for about  minutes and had the kitchen staff watching in case a real customer arrivedFinally the kitchen manager came out and said the owners were there I knew the owners pretty well so they came directly to me and asked what happened I told them about the fake reservations but not the fake quitting They didnt seem upset or bothered by our prank which was a relief At that moment I looked at the manager and his face was red and he was sweating badly He did not look well Then it happened a full blown breakdown He began screaming at us the owners the chairs everything his eyes could focus on long enough to yell at His yelling wasnt making sense He began knocking over chairs and tables Then just like it began it ended He walked out I was promoted to this manager position He was not allowed back in the building I later found out that when he left the restaurant he checked himself into a hospital Apparently he had serious mental issues and our little prank triggered them worse than he had seen before I really did feel horrible about that but it was never our intention to break his brain Piss him off a little Sure But nothing moreTLDR  We played prank on abusive manager Abusive manager snapped and checked himself into hospital ,Aaaaaaannndddd SNAP,485,pettyrevenge,top_all

fostok,32,77,1jkac1,388,BG This past week Ive had tonsillitis It wasnt severe enough that I needed my tonsils removed but I was told by the doc that had I waited any longer to see him then Id have likely had to go to the hospital  so it was pretty bad Scenario My friends birthday was this past Tuesday and he was having a small little get together at his place before we went to the clubs later Everything was going well and we eventually got to a club that nightI ordered myself a drink at the venue and was enjoying it when our group decided to go for a small bit of dancing Being the naive person I am I put my drink down on a railing right next to where Id be dancing and hoped it would be safe I was wrong As soon as I stepped away from the drink I saw out of the corner of my eye a girl scurry by and pick up my drink on her way Naturally I wasnt going to let her get away with it so easily so I caught up to her and explained that she had my drink but she was having none of it I placed my hand on the drink and tried to explain some more that she may have taken mine by accident because it was definitely my drink She then jerked the drink away from me and spilled half of it on the floor and over me At this point I didnt care for the drink any more and just said Fuck it take my drink and walked away Revenge Remember that tonsillitis Tonsillitis is rather contagious or at least the case I had of it was according to the doc It could get passed onto somebody else by kissing them coughing on them or quite delightfully drinking from the same container as an infected person Yes I had warned my friends of this earlier as a just in case measure but I didnt warn this girl who stole my drink I did think of it but by this point most of the drink was either on the floor or on me so I simply didnt feel like it I had slobbered all over my glass before she stole it and now she was slobbering all over it too Enjoy your tonsillitis girl maybe next time youll think twice before stealing somebodys drink because youve no idea what they may be infected with It should also be noted that visits to a doctor here normally go for about  and the anitibiotics for tonsillitis I got were about another  Hows that for an expensive drinkTLDR Girl steals the most expensive drink in the club and pays for it later,Hows that for an expensive drink,465,pettyrevenge,top_all

shehulk,25,50,1bmx06,382,Back when I was in my first semester of college I had my very first ever group project It was a fairly large presentation that would take up the last  weeks of class for presenters It was an Aboriginal History class and we were assigned a subject to do a multimedia presentation on I had partnered with a friend and  girls lets call them Blonde Barbie and Brunette Barbie or B and B for short asked to join our group I knew why they wanted to join our group we both did really well in this class but we accepted anyway We had a month to complete the project but we also had final projects in every other class and final exams due the week after we were scheduled to present so we agreed that we should focus on this project first and get it out of the way These girls clearly were not as concerned with their marks as my friend and I were so we took on the bulk of the project leaving them only  section each to complete The subject was Aboriginal People in the Media and their sections consisted of  questions each It should have only taken them about an hour to complete My friend and I worked hard putting lots of images of examples of media campaigns cartoons mascots etc and glued them to a big poster board to hang on the wall behind us while we gave our presentation We found videos the why is the red man red song from Peter Pan news reports etc we even prepared a reading where we changed some of the language in a news report and talked about how a simple change in language painted a totally different picture of the storyAbout a week before it was all due I emailed the girls about sending me their part so I could add it into the cards Of course they hadnt completed it yet BB promised to have it to me by the next morning I emailed again the next afternoon this time the response I got from BB was if you stop nagging me Ill be able to get it done Naturally I was pissed I told them to get off their ass and get it done or they were out of the group BB called me a bitch and a tight ass Naturally I went to my prof and explained the situation to her complete with emails and they were removed from my group and given big fat zeros Apparently they decided to go to the program coordinator and claim that they sent me their work and I claimed it as my own The decision was made without hearing from me my friend or the teacher that BB and BB would present in another seminar the next week and I would hand over a copy of the project I handed it over but I changed the language in the presentation so that it had a very different point But BB and BB didnt know the material and were fairly stupid so they had no idea that when they got up to give the presentation that they would say things like and here is a great example of how there was an Aboriginal Presence in childrens movies even back in  and their whole presentation was about  the positive depiction of Aboriginal People in the media using obviously racist examples They received the material with more than enough time to review it and notice the changes I made if they had been involved in the creation of the presentation and if they understood the material Apparently their presentation was cut short because it was so offensive to the teacher and the class that he wouldnt allow them to continue with it My seminar professor thought my changes were hilarious and neither teacher felt that I deserved any kind of punishment for changing the material because it was their responsibility to review and edit it ,Next time do your own homework,432,pettyrevenge,top_all

signu,37,61,1jpb0a,392,Background  I work in the Audiovisual section of a library so I handle all music and movie questionsOne time I noticed a lot of the same historical movies were being checked out over and over  I later found out one of the History classes at the high school was doing a project where students had to select a film from a list of several options watch it and write a report about it  People would come in and ask about the movies Id look them up in the computer and tell them if any copies were available  More often than not all copies would be checked out because someone else got there first  If the patron wanted I would put a reserve on their library card so they would be in line in case a movie was returned  Generally people were pretty understandingNot so with one woman  One Sunday night I noticed a LOT more parents were asking for the movies  I realized it was the Sunday before the assignment was due and these were all the parents of the kids who put it off until the last minute  A woman with her son walked up to me and presented me with the the list of movies  I looked each movie up in the computer  Every one of them was checked out and had been for daysAt first I had to explain to this woman what checked out meant  There was no language barrier  She spoke perfect English she just apparently didnt understand how a library works  She demanded to know why I wasnt getting a copy for her until it finally sunk in that SOMEONE ELSE had the movies she wanted  A side note  the son was texting on his phone the entire time not helping out or contributing in any way even though this assignment was his responsibilityUnfortunately none of the movies were going to be returned in time for her son to complete the assignment  I relayed this information to her and I was actually genuinely sorry because I knew she was dealing with something that wasnt her faultThe Offense  I told the woman none of the movies were available but I also suggested she try her resources at home the library is in an upper middleclass suburb where everyone has something like Netflix or OnDemand and these movies are popular or recent enough where they might be available electronicallyThe woman stared at me for about thirty seconds without saying anything  And then she said in the snippiest tone Ive ever heard So what are you going to do about it nowBoom  Any sympathy I had for her evaporated instantly  I wanted to tell her its not my fault her son cant prioritize  Its not my fault her child put this off until the night before the assignment is due  Its not my fault other parents and students were on top of this before herThe Revenge  I came up with an idea  Through some very fastpaced searching through a secondary database I looked to see if any other libraries had available copies of the movies  Several didNew tab  Google Maps  I put in the addresses of the libraries and did some calculating  I made a phone call and gave the woman the address of a library that  would hold one of the movies for herI picked the library that was the furthest away even though there were closer options  From our library the drive was over an hour long  Thats at least two hours she spent driving back and forth to get the movieKarmas a bitch and when its not I am,Treat me like a servant Enjoy your long car ride,453,pettyrevenge,top_all

rumplesplitskin,62,79,1m0sm4,385,Back story Im a team leader in charge of the morningday shift at a petrol station in the UK Weve just had a new transfer from a other location join the late shift a month ago and hes bitching about my team to anyone that will listen to himWe operate a three shift rotation for our cashiersassistants amam pmpm and pmpm This works out rather well for our staff and some are students and some are single parents who enjoy the flexibility of a three shift rotation However we recently had a guylets call him Dave transfer from a other store that closed due to cutbacksNow Dave is a bit of a prick Well not an entire prick hes more the tip of the prick than anything He makes mistakes like everyone else but he always and i do mean always tries to blame someone else or simply lie and say it was not him He worked in his old location for a number of years and due to it being a company that our company took over they had slightly different procedures and i guess hes just stuck in his waysBut i digress the reason for the revenge is that he is going around saying that my team is slacking off during the day leaving him more work on the late shifts that he asked to be put on Now i take pride in making sure when my shift is over the shop is stocked up and clean Its not unknown for myself and my team to stay behind until is doneBut Dave is finding fault well hes going around looking for faults He will write anything he finds in the store log book and i do mean anything last week we found entries in there of really insignificant events like out of stock tickets being placed at the wrong angle and he found a packet of chewing gum the wrong way round on the shelf  I had a little chat about this to my boss and it turns out Dave was a supervisor in his old job and is not happy to now be a cashier here at this store My boss also let is slip that he is being paid at the same supervisor level due to no positions for a supervisor when he was relocated So im thinking that hes trying to get me and the other supervisors canned so can jump in Well while i cant be certain if this is why hes doing these things or not im certainly not going to allow it to continue without a little petty revengeI found out that the reason Dave asked to be put on the back shifts is that he is a gamer Not just a regular gamer but a WOW addict  Can you see where this is going Dave likes the back shift so he can play with his buddies in America So when he gets home at night his friends are just starting to get online due to the time difference Well when i found out about this i never gave it much thought that is until the next day i was asked to help sort out a schedule change by a fellow team leaderIt turns out due to three of our staff being students they have requested to be on nights for the next few weeks so they can attend classes during the day But that leaves the problem whos going to have to switch to working days   Mmm i wonder   ,Bitch about the day shift  join them,464,pettyrevenge,top_all

Catticus,43,84,168ndv,380,Several years ago when I was studying abroad in Korea I would often go shopping in boutiques and other outside night markets Now in Korea places like this would have often dirtcheap clothing quality akin to that of Forever  so it was fun to peruse the wares and occasionally buy a cute skirt or scarf that would fall apart in a month But more often than not I would go with a friend or two  mostly my American friends who were studying the Korean languageworking as English teachers because at the time I was incredibly homesick despite being  Korean and fluent in the language One particular afternoon a friend suggested that we go to a department storemall because she was going home for the holidays and wanted to bring back some nice gifts In Korea its very common for department storenicer boutique employees to follow around the customer and ask questions because most department store employees worked on commission Both of us had shopped in relatively fancy places  considering the fact that anywhere that wasnt an outdoor market is considered rather upscale so we knew that the sales ladies tended to hover so we werent bothered by it So as we were enjoying ourselves drinking coffee window shopping and speaking in Korean  me fluently and my friend practicing hers  we entered this adorably cute store We both were looking at different things when from behind me I heard a rude saleslady tell a customer that she was too chubby to fit into their clothes and would the foreigner please get out I turned around  and there was my friend getting picked on by this this bitch of a sales lady trying to explain that the item she wanted to buy wasnt even for her and she was buying it for someone else all the while nervously stuttering in what was obviously not her first language And the whole time the salesbitch had the nerve to look smug about having the upper hand because the other person couldnt even comeback to what she was saying nevertheless apologize  Meanwhile I was shocked and didnt even realize that when the entire ordeal was over we sort of stumbled out of the store me overwhelmed frustrated and totally blind sighted and my friend in tearsLater that week even after my friend had calmed down and probably brushed off the incident as a onetime bad experience she was incredibly sweet but meek like that I was still upset Furious even I decided that I would get my petty revenge So I stalked the saleslady I would go back to the store every once in a while in hopes of seeing her there It wasnt until about a month later that I managed to catch her and by then my anger had cooled  but my desire for revenge hadnt I wanted to get even I walked into the store pretending to talk to an imaginary person my cell phone  but in English Now in Korea all students are expected to learn English until they graduate high school  from as early as kindergarten Koreans also pride themselves on being able to speak it well mostly conversational stuff only and most department stores around the more popularized areas like Hongdae or Apgujung where there are lots of tourists management tends to hire people who can speak English relatively speaking So Im browsing around in the store the salesbitch hovering at my shoulder until I pretend to turn around and catch her eye Having overheard my conversation she comes over with a toothy grin and asks me  in English  if she can help me with anything She was clearly proud of her ability to speak fluently Well I wasnt about to take that from her I proceeded to grill her about every article of clothing in the store and then some purposely using longer words than necessary and asking if items could be shipped to different places and if they had different colors and if the sky was blue and the grass was green and whether the cow jumped over the moon  all in English By the end she was visibly sweating and struggling to please my uppitiness in hopes of getting a sale Finally another coworker boss maybe came out from the backhelping another customer and saw my impatience and the salesbitch struggling to close a sale and unknowingly asked me in Korean if there was anything that she could do to help  I just looked at the terrible saleslady in the eye and in fluent Korean responded with a Nope I dont think that there is anything you could help me with Thank you though and have a nice day and then walked out after having wasted her timetldr While in Korea I pretend to not speak the language despite being Korean to get gloriously petty revenge on a bitchy sales lady who was rude to my friendedit a letter sorry for the wall of text ,I pretend not to speak the language to get gloriously petty revenge on a salesbitch,464,pettyrevenge,top_all
