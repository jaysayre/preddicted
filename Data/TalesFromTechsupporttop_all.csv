phlogiston,489,2176,trffn,3895,I thought Id share one of my proudest moments as a bench tech  I suspect most of us who are interested in this type of work frequently encounter customers with lost data  Usually the issue is resolved with a simple undelete application of which there are many  Sometimes we have to roll up our sleeves and image the disk and attempt to recover readable files  No matter the method its the best feeling in the world to be able to call the customer and tell then you did recover their wedding pictures or important school work  The look on their faces when they come in to pick up the freshly burned DVD with their critical data makes you forget all the mouthbreathers with their insect ridden emachines almost  But then theres that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customers PC and hear the click BANG or BOING whirllllll of a failed HDD while the BIOS reports no bootable drive  You have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already  sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it  You hand them the little card with the number to DriveSavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them its going to cost a lot of money  You are kind enough not to scold them about their lack of a backup that would only cause pain now  They already know  Flash back to   One morning I get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those ubiquitous claimshell Dell PCs under an arm  The look in his eyes alone tells me all I really need to know about the situation  I tell him to come in and put the PC on the counter  We exchange niceties as I plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on  We encounter the message he told me to expect the PC cant find a bootable drive  I open it up to make sure everything is plugged in and notice the drive is not spinning  Not good but there could be an innocent answer  I pull the drive and try it out with a known good power supply  Unfortunately with the same result  I tell him Customer it seems you have a failed hard drive  Since it wont spin up I cant really help you  His exact words It doesnt matter what it costs please get my data back  It turns out this guy is an office manager at a local veterinary practice  It must be a fairly big organization as they employ about  vets and about  other folks including cleaning staff etc  This PC under his arm contains the entirety of their accounting everything  Payroll tax stuff accounts receivable everything  He explains that they will go out of business if they cant get the data on that drive  I let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources neither of which we have in this mom n pop computer repair outfit  I give him the DriveSavers card and tell him to be prepared for a bill in the s if they are successful at all  Considering the importance of his data I thought it was a nobrainer to go this route   is nothing to a medical office likely billing out over a million dollars each year Well I would not be writing this if the dude had any sense  Hes like  for data recovery  And it might take weeks  I dont know Cant you do it  I tell him the truth  If I try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance Ill make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it  He really needs to go to the specialist  Yet despite this he continues to talk me into it telling me they cant possibly go weeks without this PC  They need their data by tomorrow for tax reasons  So I told him to give me his number and Id do some research and get back to him  I call in my fellow nerds and we research our GoogleFu was strong that day  We end up with a list of about  or so things to try to order them by risk  We even manage to find two of the same model drives from the junkyard downstairs to look at  By early afternoon I think weve learned what we can and I call the customer  I tell him Ill try it but its foolish  He describes an office in pure chaos and says they are willing to take the risk  I tell him Im going to charge   hour for my time successful or not to which he agrees  I also tell him to bring in any other Dells they purchased as the same time as the broken one as I want more drives from the same batch if possible  My boss prints out a unique addendum to our usual waver all customers sign something to protect us from the consequences of potentially likely destroying this data and the other PC drives as well  Guy shows up  minutes later with sweat on his brow and three more clamshell Dells  Were lucky the serial numbers on these drives are close enough be the same batch as the broken one  These are a better match than the drives we already found  So we now have the one failed drive and three good ones   I go shopping to pick up items needed for the potential data recovery methods  I purchase some dry ice a couple of torque bits and eyeglass screwdriver to fit ziplock bags and microfiber gloves from a photography shop  I try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed  That was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face masks  Unfortunately they were pink  But this was war so I did not complain  The first thing I try is swapping the PCB between a good drive and the failed one  The good drive works fine with the failed drives PCB but the opposite is not true  Next we tried putting the drive in a USB enclosure and plastic bags and cooling the drive with the dry ice  After  hour we tried again again without success  I then tried powering the drive and kinda spinning it back and forth hoping to jump start the motor or something  Needless to say that was not working  We needed to open the drive up and see what secrets might be inside  We took apart one of the three good drives to see if it was even possible to do a platter swap  Ive taken apart many drives and knew the most difficult part would be not damaging the heads  Sometimes you have to remove the arms holding the heads to even get the platter out  But luck was on our side  The arm in these particular drives could be pushed down and would not get in the way when we pulled the platters  Even better they smoothly went back onto the platters without hanging when you carefully pushed it back I dawned the bunny suit much to the delight of the other nerds and took the drive and tools into the bathroom  I set an audiobook playing and started scrubbing wall to ceiling with wet rags to collect all the dust I could  I taped over the air vent and along the door frame  Then I collected hot water into a trash can and added the dry ice  That much dry ice in that small room made quite a bit of fog which supposedly helps bring any dust out of the air  I dont know if this actually works but I was concerned about adding that much CO into a small sealed room  I made it a point to hold my breath if I was reaching down to the floor  After the fog was gone I noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase   The actual platter swap went without incident and hardly warrants description in this story  Just a few screws and aluminum spacer rings  I just tried to line up the two platters so they were aligned the same way relative to each other in the new case  Obviously I could not get nearly the same level of precision at the physical scale of the data on the drive but I did the best I could  We held our breath while we booted up the bench PC with a Linux data recovery live CD  It found the drive  I started to read an image from the drive which seemed to work fine  I did a typical data recovery on the image and I FOUND FILES  I actually recovered that data  The customer was thrilled and didnt blink an eye at the bill something like  or the fact we destroyed the other drives in the other PCs  I even got a  tip for risking O deprivation and the ridicule of my peers That evening we had pizza and Mountain Dew paid for out of the register  I kicked butt at Counter Strike  My wife called to say my Mother in Law was not able to visit after all  It was the perfect day,It doesnt matter what it costs please get my data back,6071,TalesFromTechsupport

tlddotnet,552,2249,17d1dw,3365,This is a tale about bravery Bravery in the face of execution Bravery of those small few holdouts that serve their caustic masters so that they can feed themselves their wives and their children Those men and women who listened understood and resolved an issue of monstrous proportions    I am a computer scientist I am a software engineer I am an electrical engineer    I have designed CPUs written OSs implemented network stacks and developed system libraries    I am a guru My disciples think I am some kind of motherfucking magician    In this story I am user    For a year I had Comcast and lived in a run down apartment in Oakland For six months I had an unusable connection between the hours of pm and pm        Circa         Week  Saturday calling regarding

actually had restarted my computer but I did it again anyways  Tech  I understand but we need to make sure that this doesnt fix it  Me Well I get these high pings from all five of my computers not just the one I am working on right now  Tech  Um how do you have five computers using the internet  Me With my router  Tech  Uh A what  Me A router  Tech  Sir we dont support nonstandard equipment  Me Excuse me     more minutes goes by as I disconnect my router directly connect my computer to the router and power cycle the modem twice such that my PCs mac address would get registered with their systemrelevant The high ping remains and I eventually get the tech to say the magic words    Tech  It looks like we are going to have to send out somebody  Me Thank You        Next Monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop I had not been present for the installation The drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet both of which will be relevant later The rCableFail was truly astonishing The single RG line that came in from the street was split  times None of the lines were labeled There were  splitters involved We spent the first  minutes yelling at eachother th floor window to exterior basement door to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time Mine ended up being the forth split down RJgtWaygtWaygtWaygtWaygt Me which I had split again with a Way One for cable one for internet    Me Well what can we do about it  OnSite Tech  I dont know  Me It works in the morning and late at night  OnSite Tech  It is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their tvinternet and you are getting interference  Me So what can we do about it    The OnSite Tech closes and locks the cabinet    OnSite Tech  Nothing It is a wiring issue on the premises We are not responsible Talk to your landlord        My landlord was more or less a slum lord Oakland The building was falling apart and was in serious need of repair The landlord to put it mildly didnt care I was frustrated By the time I got done playing phone tag with my worthless piece of shit of a landlord I had decided that I needed to talk to Comcast again    Week  Thursday Still have a ping of ms After  Minutes of elevator music pm  Tech  ltIntrogt What can I help you with  Me I have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of pm till pm rendering my Internet unusable I am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time  Tech  I am sorry to hear that sir Would you please reboot your computer  Me This is not an issue with my computer Comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building I am in  Tech  I am sorry to hear that sir We need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can alleviate the issue    For the next twenty minutes I play repair man Eventually the tech once again says the magic words    Me Can I schedule the tech to come between pm and pm  Tech  Very well sir You will have to wait until next Thursday if that is the time slot you want        Week  Thursday OnSite Tech  arrives around pm Perfect After explaining the issue and what the last tech had said he checked the signal in my apartment  OnSite Tech  Lets go look at the box downstairs  After unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle  OnSite Tech  Which one is yours  Me This one   I point at the line that goes to my apartment  OnSite Tech  Alright so here is the issue You have way too many splitters between your line and the drop coming in I am going to replace the ends on your line to ensure we can get the best possible connection and then I am going to check the pole We can run a new drop but that could take up to six months    At this point the tech looks at me    OnSite Tech  I am not allowed to reorder these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines    And now I realize he is staring deep into my soul    OnSite Tech  The customers with these thingshttpwwwcabletechtalkcomwpcontentuploadstrapfilterxjpg Do not have internet and only subscribe to basic TV    Here he gestures to several of the lines He lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line I blink It is connected directly to the first splitter    OnSite Tech  They require much less signal It is going to take me  minutes with my  wrench and crimps to replace this tip Then I will be on the pole for twenty minutes Then I will come back to your apartment to check your signal again I am sorry but I am NOT fixing this for you I simply cant    I blink again Twice actually The tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip I back out the basement door and bolt upstairs I pull out my wrench set and grab my  I run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement He doesnt close the door I wait until he walks out the front gate Inside the basement I find the cabinet is closed but unlocked Quick quick quick I am taking my line and switching it with the filtered line on the first splitter After everything is tight I close the cabinet and run back upstairs The tech true to his word showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started I had already reset my modem and had a ms ping to Google Success After testing my line ran with acceptable numbers    OnSite Tech  I am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent I am going to go lock up the cabinet now      And he was gone into the night I really honestly truly wish that this was the last I would have to see him But it wasnt No It can never be simple with Comcast My connection had improved considerably A vast majority of the time I was receiving my advertised speed I could downloaduploadtorrent to my hearts content The only problem I had was when I would attempt to connect to a server in Southern California You see anytime between roughly pm and pm I would have a ping of ms to any server south of San Jose This wouldnt normally be a problem for average web browsing but I also happen to be a gamer And for online gamers latency can be the difference between life and death How did I know that the problem was in San Jose Traceroutes Tons of them Automatically generated every minute every hour every day The issue appeared to be that the peering between Comcast and Level  in San Jose consisted of two k modems and smoke signals Graphs of average latency times over the course of the day showed two bumps A small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good wanking I decided to do comparisons with some friends from around the bay area Apparently Comcast routed everything from the entire Bay Area through that L peering arrangement in San Jose This was confirmed by OnSite Tech  the third time I met him        Week  Friday pm Cannot play win enjoy any matches due to higher than average pings  Minutes of music  Tech  ltIntrogt How can I help you  Me I have an issue where when I connect to some servers south of San Jose I get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings It is only during high traffic times and I have the traceroutes that describe the issue  Tech  Will you please restart your computer  Me Look I know what the issue is It is not with my computer I can demonstrate that it is a problem with Comcasts network  Tech  I am sorry sir but we must go through these steps to ensure that it is not your equipment Often times restarting your computer will fix many problems  Me I know I have restarted my computer many times Trust me I have traceroutes that identify the issue  Tech  You have what  Me Traceroutes  Tech  Uhh I am going to elevate you to Tier    Minutes of music  Tech  ltintrogt How can I help you  Me ltExplains the situationgt  Tech  Can you please restart your computer  Me No Look I have traceroutes that identify the issue ltExplains about San Josegt  Tech  Sir after reviewing the network status board it does not appear that there are any issues on our network This is most likely an issue on your end  Me Look can I send you the traceroutes  Tech  The what  Me ltGrowlinggt Traceroutes They show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach  Tech   I am going to transfer you to another tech Please hold   Seconds of music  Tech  ltIntrogt How can I help you  Me I have traceroutes that identify a connection between the Comcast network and Level  in San Jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online  Tech  Interesting I am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets  Me  I can plainly see that I get a sub ms ping to everywhere else in your network before the San Jose hop  Tech  How about Monday at am  Me  Really  Tech  Yes        Week  Monday am OnSite Tech  shows up and smiles at me I try to tell him everything that is going on  OnSite Tech  Lets go down and look at your line again  I am worried he is going to say something about the fact that I moved my line He opens up the cabinet and smirks  OnSite Tech  I forgot which one was your line Which one is it  I identify my moved line He comments on the fact that it seems to be in an advantageous position and shouldnt be the issue At this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring For the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex He comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he cannot identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced He said that might happen within the next two to ten years As he leaves  OnSite Tech  Keep calling        For the next two weeks I call every other day and get the run around They are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues I am not willing to pay the eighty dollars to have a tech come out if I request it Every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues Finally in the middle of week  I get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine  Me THE FUCK IT IS I CAN PROVE IT ISNT  Tech  something I am going to transfer you  Me To WHO Nobody you transfer me to listens to what I have to say or understands what I am telling    ltImmediately music cuts me offgt   minutes of music later Tech  answers the phone  Tech  ltIntrogt How can I help you  Me ltI attempt to explain everything againgt  Tech  We are going to send out the field tech again  Me Again This isnt going to fix it  Tech  I know  Me What  Tech  After he is done call this number         Week  Monday pm OnSite Tech  shows up We talk He goes up on the pole He sits in his van He wanders around the neighborhood and checks various other drops Eventually he comes back to my door  OnSite Tech  Were oversold  Me How much  OnSite Tech  All of it  Me What  OnSite Tech  Bay Area All of it Six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth  Me Six months  OnSite Tech  Yup  Me Why when it impacts everyone  OnSite Tech  Most people never notice Most people dont care  Me What can I do about it  OnSite Tech  Keep calling  Me Why  OnSite Tech  They only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue      The number Tech  gave to me turned out to be the number to his line For the next two months I would call him every week and OnSite Tech  would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours Then one day the call went a little differently    Tech  ltIntrogt How may I help you  Me I am still having the same problem with the high latency out of San Jose  Tech  I am not going to help you with this  Me Excuse

staticfactory,355,2723,w1o0s,3320,Back in  I worked the phones for a callcentre that provided outsourced techsupport services for an industry giant in the realm of American multinational computer technology corporations My averagehandletime numbers were never very good and I was constantly being told to bring my call times down from the orso minute mark to under  as per the service agreement with said corporation While most of my coworkers had no problem dumping their callers as soon as possible earning a big pat on the back from the floor managers I was not able to just push my clients back into the endless cycle of  minute wait times My firstcall resolution rate of  or better however was always at the top of the chart Nobody gave a rats ass about that thoughFor anyone that has been in my shoes youll agree that trying to actually fix a problem in under  minutes is pretty difficult Add the fact that most customers vent on you for about  minutes before you can start to help them and there isnt much that you can do if you are in the business of actually supporting the system So I made the decision to ignore my AHT as much as the managers would let me and just try to fix everything as quickly as I could There were times when they would just hover and stare at me if they saw that my timer was overOne particular day I end up on a call with a nice elderly woman She was  and had received her computer as a Christmas gift from her son who had put the service account in her name What her son neglected to do however was get her a warranty that included service to go along with her replacement parts In scrolling through the log of her ordeal with our technicians I find  that I am her th call to support in  days She had originally called to ask about error messages that she was receiving and had been taken through driverapp reinstallations system restore the dreaded call formatreinstall Windows ME no less and finally a motherboard replacement How she was not filled with rage and fury is still beyond meInstead of the profanitylaced tirade that I had come to expect Muriel was very pleasant I just received your parcel and I am ready to goIt took a moment for it to sink in but it wasnt long before the realization hit I had to walk this lady through a motherboard installWhile it occurred to me that most of my coworkers would have gone as far as to just dump the call by hitting the RELEASE button on their phone I felt obligated to put an end to this saga Muriel we are going to need a Phillips screwdriver for this Do you have one handy I have one right hereShe was ready to rock While she was waiting in the queue she had managed to unhook all of the external cables and get the case onto her dining room table I opened my rd extralarge tripletriple of the shift It was on She followed every instruction with precision and passion as if she had been preparing all her life for this moment I could hear her grunting and occasionally cursing under her breath as her crooked old fingers fumbled for dropped screws in the bottom of the case I could mark the end of most steps with the signature plunk of a card or cable being pried free of its slot Others she would confirm with a simple OK got it Whats next When the PCI cards went back in I would add Make sure its seated nice and securely to her refrain Its in there  minutes later the tower was back under the desk for the first of what I figured would be many attempts at getting the system to fire up The managers were circling nervously trying their best to signal me to finish the call I smiled and wavedOK Muriel lets try the power button Be sure to let me know what you see on the screen I listened closely and prepared to count the POST beeps One beepWhat do you see Muriel There was some white writing on a black screen but now it says WINDOWS METhats a great sign Is the light on the floppy drive lit In the thousands of times I had reseated a floppy cable my success rate at getting it the right side up the first time had to have been less than  It was for a second but its off now WindowsstartupmusicwavOne boot Impossible I had her look through the device manager for conflictsbangs for which there were none I had her launch her office applications and open a few of her documents without any issues Play an audio CD Check I even went as far as to have her test her internet connection AOL dialup which required I call her back No problems there eitherI was in awe We had just completed an entire motherboard replacement with  accuracy in  minutes Sometimes it would take users  minutes to find the My Computer icon Muriel this has been the single greatest call I have ever been a part of You can now tell your friends that you have assembled a computer from scratchShe cackled I had a lot of fun but I hope you dont take it the wrong way when I say that I hope to never have to speak to any of you ever again tldr I walked an old lady through a motherboard replacement in  minutesedit You guys are awesome I am truly humbled If I would have known I would have said Muriel one day I will post on reddit about this and technicians worldwide will cheer,My claim to techsupport

BBBBB for big bad badass bastard boss did not speak our language so he was useless for daytoday operations but man was he ever godsent for handling the internal troublesThe man was in his s fat short redhaired and bearded He was so cynical that he could make vestal virgins cry He was blunt honest straightforward and called bullshit when he saw and heard it Naturally the management hated him He had however saved their collective arses more than once and with his complete disregard for their opinions on him his knowledge and experience they could not get rid of him He also had the smoothest silk tounge I have ever seen from a tech guy Small ugly and fat and balding he still chatted up the most beautiful girls on account of his tounge and being the most confident bastard everI still aspire to be like him not completely but in many things and I learned a lot from himHere are some war stories from the  months I spent at that godforsaken placeTeam meetingBBBBB brings up a powerpoint presentation with lots of animations sound colours and short snippets of textBBBBB Whoops sorry That was the presentation for managementBBBBB brings up another presentation with lots of text and acronymsMe You have a different presentation on the account for managementBBBBB Yes you have to Management is retarded Consider them drooling sheep to be herded in the right direction And if they get

wanted to talk to the manager inside I knocked he told me off saying IM BUSY so I waited outside until he came out pointed at him and said Now youre not busy now we deal with this Poor guy probably just wanted to use the looMe Stealing our own equipmentWe worked nd line helpdesk and as a part of our instructions we were to have dual screens one to remote take over the customers system on one to have our own systems on this was standard on all help desks even st line in our native country but not where we were working now We got brand new flatscreens to replace our CRT screens in  with and started fighting about the graphics cards BBBBB thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one stationary ones so it was easy Asset management threatened that we would lose support We said hey we are nd line windows support we can support our own computers Asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers So that was that Instead we purchased silly expensive crappy USB graphics cards at least  times the cost of a basic graphics card capable of having two screens and stashed them in our lockable drawers waiting for our second flatscreen And waited and waitedAfter several months BBBBB went more or less ballistic New equipment was arriving every week but we did not get anything of it Instead it was used to replace old CRT screens at the sales departmentSo he went after a manager about itBBBBB So when is my team getting their second screensManager Well we have other needs to prioritise right nowBBBBB So you are saying we are not getting themManager It has worked fine for two months already has it not I dont think you really need themBBBBB We have the budget for itManager Well going under budget is a good thingBBBBB comes back furious and hatches a plan Using his silk tounge he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time theres a deliveryBBBBB Come on you vikings Time for pillage and plunder Follow meMe What What are we doingBBBBB You shame your forefathers  I would have said pillage and they would have had their axes out Were stealing our second screens of courseMe Very wellSo we went there took screens off the pile of delivered equipment and ran back with them As we are unpacking them the manager comes runningManager What are you doingBBBBB Installing our second screenManager You have not been assigned this equipmentBBBBB Oh I did not know that Well we have the budget for it so you can just order some more screens right No harm doneFighting BBBBB over this when the screens were already in place he had registered them in the asset management system they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management so we got to keep the screensTolling it tolls for theeThe country we were working in used the euro and we all got lots and lots and lots of useless  and  eurocent copper coins commonly called brownies and change everytime we bought something I managed to use most of mine when I was riding the bus You could only use  eurocent and bigger in the softdrink machine so the smaller ones were useless and lots of people assembled large amounts of them So for fun and giggles we started paying roadtolls to each other as we passed each others desks Basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed to the curses of the one sitting thereThen a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend came back and found his desk COVERED in brownies Most of the building had seen them accumulating on his desk and took the opportunity to dump their change there as well There were easily  coins on his desk He sighed and cursed a bit when he got backThen he got a really slow case  some of the users on his account wre local admins and now and then they would get a case with a computer completely filled with spyware and malware He told the user to go home after lunch connected to his computer and started the cleanup Being bored just watching the status bar millimetring its way through the cleanup he started sorting piling and pyramiding the coins on his desk After a while BBBBB passes by sees on the screen that he is working nods and keeps walking After a short while he returns and points to a small pyramid of coinsBBBBB That is one euro isnt itCollegue Yeah whyBBBBB throws a euro bill on the desks and proceeds to rake in five piles of coins with a devilish smileCollegue Nice But what are you doing with the coinsBBBBB The girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday Im going for a coffeeLearning wellMe and BBBBB are part of a documentation group Management recently changed the document standard for no real reason at all so we need to lift everything weve done to the new format Manually as they dont provide any kind of automatisation with the new formatBBBBB Management I swear to god if I could see their inbred genepoolMe They dont have a genepool They have a cesspoolBBBBB Me WhatBBBBB I have taught you well young padawanExactly what we wantA team meeting discussing the latest ideas of reorganisation from management trying to mitigate the disaster it would bringBBBBB alright then we have a good planCollegue Yeah then we get EXACTLY what we wantMe Salma Hayek covered in honeyCollegue No I he goes silent for a second thinks and then breaks up in a big smile YeahBBBBB I really like how you think vonadler Let me google that OooohWow that is WoWWe also had a software distribution team that was overstaffed due to organisational changes It also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months since they had a long notice time So there was work for  people and there were  persons doing it One of the guys at our place got bored got a new job and gave his  weeks notice Since there were so little work and the other  guys were not fully trained yet as they got too little work to do to properly train he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the  weeks notice time So he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for  weeksBBBBB who knows the situation walks by and spots the collegue playing WoWBBBBB What are you doingCollegue Playing WoWBBBBB What level are youCollegue BBBBB Haha I am better than youHe then proceeds to walk offEdit Spelling,The big bad badass bastard

jon,392,3454,1aqr2l,2573,The next couple of days seemed more irritating than usual with Angie taking any opportunity to shadow work from almost any ITS engineer For me there was a notable visit to the desk occupied by the HR Tank Angie appeared mere seconds after my arrival as I walked HR Tank how to switch off those stupid red lines under everything I write in MS Word Thinking she was just up there to see HR Tank I mostly ignored her while I explained what those stupid red lines were When I got done Angie corrected my imminent departure by with Now ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today Barely time to react the HR Tank rolled herself back in front of the monitor almost steamrolling me out of her path Actually yes there is I want to know why I cant change the text on this button here she bellows pointing at the Start MenuAfter two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the muscles in her head to stop dribbling as she spoke it was finally time for their regular Starbucks visit Never have I been subject to the most inane lines of questioning and constant corrections by Angie After taking note that HR Tank really needs a faster computer I take shelter in the canteen kept company by the sole remaining cheese and pickle sandwich they had left Did I ever mention I really do not like pickle It was either that or starveI returned to find BHIT pacing around the room His ruffled jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance the few hairs that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking windswept despite their nominal length He immediately pounced Margie from legal affairs needs her machine back Are you done with it After racking my brains and my ticket list for several minutes I found his solution That was one of the machines removed by you and the third line guys from the meeting roomAnd so begins the epic hunt We first visit the third line guys who profess innocence Our next stop is facilities who again have no idea what were on about  the Facilities manager takes great pains to point out that they want nothing to do with IT and are getting annoyed with being implicatedA two hour whistlestop tour of the building with MAFG in tow shows up nothing even the IT Cupboard is untouched On returning to BHIT Angie who is fully tanked on coffee has now just been made aware of the missing machines and is scouring the ticket systems for evidence of my failings Sometimes it pays to be an astute record keeper on several of the tickets I noted Machine in hands of third linefacilities Angie is her usual helpful self demanding to know why I informed nobody of these machines importance or even questioned where they were off to Its nice to have a policy one moment of Facilities looking after the whereabouts of IT kit yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest Support MonkeyI took great pleasure on relaying the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name After growing weary of Angies bitchy comments MAFG and I spend the final hour of the day searching out any nook and cranny we come across for either the missing machines or even the facilities guys who did the clearout It seemed my inspired plan of doing my job and gaining an ounce of vengeance was quickly backfiring as the day grew dim On our way to one network riser room we passed Margie from Legal Affairs She couldnt help but stop me to ask for progress and relay the updates shed gotten which amounted to Apparently you managed to misplace it and still cant find it Nice one Angie way to pour salt in the woundWe had given up In a purely flippant move by pure chance MAFG opened the door to a janitors cupboard Sat behind an industrialsized bottle of Domestos Bleach and providing gravitational support for a mop and bucket was our Ghost Server It stood almost majestic it had seen many an ITS engineer through the worst of conferences and the coldest of late nights We rescued the discolored HP Proliant from this murky cesspit and carried it back to ITS We relayed our voyage to BHIT as Angie stood stonyfaced glaring disapprovingly at our failure the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathyBHIT saw no alternative he commanded that Margies machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning even if we take another one from stock The other missing machines would have to be queried with the Facilities department to determine their location After clarifying a bend in the rules was OK just this one time I duly began the process of getting the Ghost server back up and running to image a brand new Optiplex from the IT Cupboard at my desk I set to workpm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence I sat illuminated by a single monitor prepping the Optiplex with all manner of legal type software domain configurations etc As I was the only soul left the auto lights had dimmed most of the office only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner almost like a searchlight dancing on the stage illuminating some actress performing against the backdrop of the hoover motor After visiting Margies desk and reconnecting her new PC I fired an email off to BHIT and Angie It read Its  and Im done replacing this machine Surely this is a testament to how ridiculous it has been for Support lately We have asked several times for a permanent outofsight build and repair area in order to perform our duties after the one we had been using  and had been in use for several years  was summarily decided to be unsatisfactory This matter needs resolution immediatelyFeeling authoritative in myself I hoped that demonstrating dedication to resolving these matters would help score points with anyone in the chain who mattered I reached for the monitor switch to sign out for the night But as if big brother were watching Outlooks new mail balloon popped up with its accompanying selfimportant boink Angies name adorned the balloon like a warning label I opened it addressed directly to me were the ominous words We will discuss this tomorrowPt A new world

ibrewbeer,321,1332,17fns6,2524,My firm uses a web based ticketing system for all of our support requests Weve been using this system for years but just like the rest of you we still have users who refuse to use it Some of them are VIPs in the company bigwigs that can do whatever they want So when they email one of us individually or use the group email instead of creating a ticket we just let it slide Others like to think theyre as important but are nowhere near the level where they can disregard long standing company policy and skirt the ticketing system This is the tale of one such userAside from not using the ticketing system my other pet peeve is users who give no description whatsoever of their problem They just say broken or again or fix it Todays email simply said help in the subject line and it was sent to two of the four of us on the support team I make eye contact with my fellow techie who was also lucky enough to receive it and said I got this Before we get too far into this story you should know that this particular user and I get along famously Shes one of our special users for sure but shes a great person and we give each other crap all the timeHer office is  floors up and normally I take the elevator I decided this time to take the stairs And I ran I ran as fast as I could By the time I got to her office I was out of breath and a little sweaty Shes sitting there filing her nails looking bored I reach deep back to my high school days and find my inner actorMe Oh my god are you okHer blank stareMe Your email only said help so I came as fast as I could Can you breathe alright Did you fall Whats going onMind you I am not being quiet about this so the commotion starts to attract some attention from her nosy coworkers Chairs swivel and necks crane She starts getting self conscious as all of her coworkers are now notsosubtly lookingHer No no Umm my Outlook icon disappeared I found it in the start menu but I need it back on my desktopMe But youre ok Its just about an icon on your desktopHer Uh yeahHer coworkers start to chuckle quietlyMe deep breath and sit down at her computer Oh well why didnt you say thatHer I didnt really know how to describe itMe Your icon is back on the desktop If youd like to avoid throwing us all into a panic next time please use the ticketing system and maybe try using your big girl words to describe whats going on I may show up with building security to make sure there isnt a hostage situation or something equally embarrassing Lunch todayHer icy daggers stabbing into my face from her eyes Yeah sounds good,How to deal with the oneword email,3856,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,282,2796,1ao78b,2366,Monday morning finally arrived I slightly congratulated myself that I managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on Angie With no letup in the weather the early shift seemed to be of little comfort with the snow beating down as hard as it could I was however brandishing a new set of gloves and a can of ice dissolving fluidSurprisingly the day went off without a hitch The snowy weather had landed most of the team off with colds and notably Angie hadnt made it in Myself and MAFG managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when Balding Head of IT came in He asked me if I could attend a meeting later which I obliged Fairly sure this was the meeting I began to mentally prepare my defenseI was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served but rather a meeting of several heads brandishing a new project It seemed that there was to be a conference in the not too distant future and the marketing sales and product reps had worked hard to secure a vendor for a new medical CRM product to replace the aging creaky FileMaker based system They also wanted to work in a complete laptop refresher programme replacing any laptop over  years old BHIT made particular mention of a desktop rollout I performed last year  it was actually my initial  months contract but as Id proven myself worthy was taken on full time My job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardwaresoftware as appropriateI set to work on the task with glee querying Active Directory for a list of machines users and specs One thing I always made sure of was to carry on my predecessors good work in maintaining a superclean active directory a place for everything and everything in its place Every audit we had although occasionally revealing some discrepancies everything was up to date and reports were reliableAfter collating my results I determined that  odd laptops would require replacement and approximately  builds would need to go on across three different hardware types  two already in use in the field and could continue and one for the new laptop specs As soon as I could get the final signed off software from the vendor I could go about getting images prepared QAd and rope in some of my friendlier reps to pilot the new builds before the big dayMy analysis done and sent to BHIT I wrapped up for the day All thoughts of that coffee swilling stick insect were thoroughly out of mindMy smile was demolished Tuesday morning Angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of undoing anything that looked like progress The instant I appeared she demanded my attention in the dungeon Sure enough this was it She now required a full explanation as to my actions the previous FridayI say explanation after my defense of our security access to the IT Cupboard had been withdrawn was thrown straight back at me for failing to understand proper protocol she just ripped into yet another Starbucks lattefueled tirade about leaving a VIP high and dry for an hour while I blithered about She then also ripped me a new one asking what I was doing taking apart a PC in the middle of the office It seemed that some of the Fat Finance wenches had ratted me out as well and claimed Id caused such a loud commotion they were prevented from working I wonder if its the same finance hag that is in her coffee group This dressing down seemed to last forever and it did this was a good  minuter Dressing down fully received I decided to retaliate once more I mailed our BHIT and CCd the rest of support questioning why we were no longer permitted access to the IT Cupboard for equipment where we should go if Angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and most importantly where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware These were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine The reply from BHIT was as usual fairly impotent and full of noncommittal statements His response that he was unaware the IT Cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the Ghost Server off the rd line team in the first place He concluded by requesting that we should seek clarification of suitable build areas from our manager Angie I could see we were going to get nowhere on this pathThe water deepened I held my breath cited  odd tickets in my queue which would require extensive dismantling and imaging time none of which could occur at my desk and none of which could even happen as the build server with all our images had been thrown in a riser room which of course none of us could now access anymore Added to that with the conference project looming exactly where were we meant to image these machines And how would I be able to access our build server for the task at hand  my nightly WhatsAlive script reporting it as the only machine missing in actionAs a demonstration of the extent of his ineptitude instead of formulating a reply he simply replied to all and inserted Angies email at the top with the words Angie can you please direct Jon appropriately ThanksYou can guess the next conversation What conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it Angie demanded As BHIT had truly dumped me in it I had to relay all about my task for the conference She would find out anyway the train was in motion Of course this was now something new she could micromanage to the nth degree but not without a scolding first She first demanded to know why she was never informed I responded BHIT had been present in the meeting too Given my handling of the XP Rollout and Desktop Replacement project last year this is why BHIT and several heads asked for me by name That said as its a major project I find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already whoa saucer of milk meeting room  could it be score  to JonIn reality I already knew that Angie was already plotting If I was a betting man Id have said the plan was already made in her mind she was too sharp to not have planned all the fine details already All she needed was the time to put it into effect What the plan was I have no idea only the future will tell But I did know at that moment that this process wont go well It will either be mired in micromanagementism or I just wont do it at allSo I managed to get my digs in that one time but I now have a fight on my hands On the one hand Ive made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward On the other hand I had the bitch manager from hell bent on thrusting her dagger of incompetence into the beating heart of anything resembling efficiencyAnd there was still no response about where hardwarebuilds should be taking place One thing I was sure of if were going to play this game let the games beginPrevioushttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsambethebmanagerfromhellptanewworldorderhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsampthebmanagerfromhellptsafetyfirsthttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsambpthebmanagerfromhellpttheitinductionfromhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsamlsrthebmanagerfromhellptundercurrentshttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsamncthebmanagerfromhellpthowtomakefriendshttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsannxlthebmanagerfromhellptmarkingterritorieshttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsanqmuthebmanagerfromhellptonefridaytorue,The

HeZlah,1027,1089,1i56z8,2268,So this just happened I am eagerly anticipating the response however i feel compelled to share what has happened so farBack story A couple weeks ago I was contacted by a friend of an acquaintance of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services prices contact information etc Now I am a th year Mechatronic Eng student so although web site design is not my forte  I do have a functional understanding of phpJavascripthtml and it is semester break so I agree to set this upI go to meet her she shows me some drawings of what she wants the site to look like and we agree on a price  pretty sure that is a good deal  to be payed now and  upon completionFast forward to last Friday Im all finished website comes online  I call the client and tell her its all up and running she checks it out loves it its exactly what she wants I give her my account number for her to transfer my payment she thanks me and the call endsNow this morning one week later  payment is still not in so I send an email to see whats going on The replygtI have not yet transferred funds And dont hold your breath I signed no written agreement and you have no proof that I aggreed to provide payment Let this be a lesson to yougt Thanks for the web siteReally Took me a couple minutes to process what I had just read I should be mad  but Im not Armed with a cheeky grin a chuckle and PuTTY I ssh in    scp r varwww hezltmy servers ipgthomehezcompanyname    rm rv varwwwOn out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it Hopefully she doesnt notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere p she seems like the kind of person that really wouldnt check You know  the mentality of once its there its there for good If she doesnt get back to me in like a week I might redirect somewhere  inappropriateTlDR PAY MEBy the way I do expect to be hit by all the reddit flak GET IT IN WRITING Well I will save you the trouble Im an idiot I know  its all that has been drilled into me for the last  years so i should know better But she seemed so nice I really wasnt expecting it  That and Im really not too bothered I have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledgeUPDATESo interesting morning am I just received a call quoting the call verbatim would mostly consist of expletive deleted for sfw reasons But the gistHer Your useless the site is down already Lucky I didnt pay you I want my deposit backMe Im sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval I took it down and it will remain down until I receive paymentI was going to say until I receive full payment of the  that we agreed upon But thats kind of extortion she can sink to the level of changing the deal but Id prefer to take the high roadHer Some horrible language that I dont have the patience to listen to Im paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back upMe Im sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the siteI used a billboard analogy where you pay for the billboard for a period of time but its up to you what you want to put on there I think she got it In hindsight most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal but most analogies fail bearing close examinationMe And even if that money was coming to me clickA short time later I receive an emailgtWhat is the login to the account that I am paying for You dont have the right to keep that from me becaus I am paying it gtmy son is doing computing at tafe and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so thereAt this point Im thinking whatever  I have had enough I am compiling a credential inclusive smartass reply about how there is no way he has the serverside scripts that give most of the functionality when I get another callThis time from her son He is so much more irate however I really cant hold that against him Im sure that he has heard a biased version of the story and I can sympathize Cross my mum and I will rip your head off and leave you in a shallow graveAgain summary of the call Too many expletive deleted be readableHim How dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account I should ing come over there and kick your ng ass you Me Wow settle down I was just replying to the email with all the credentials you need to access the server She didnt pay me so I took the site down and it will stay that wayHim I do this stuff for a living I am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well I have news for you I copied the source before you took it down so I can just put it straight back on there I win ernote I used no punctuation in that sentence because he didnt I could picture him turning blue on the other end of the line also add about  expletives in there to get an idea of how long he was talkingMe Look you do what you want I dont care I

he intends to do or thinks he can do there is no professionalism left in this deal They can call the provider and have the OS reinstalled after they figure out whats wrong They can even choose

is not really adminFor those who dont know what the commands do The two commands su and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root the highest admin The first two lines remove these from the system Yes I could have done this more elegantly by changing sudoers but mehThe third command finds all files in the bin directory aside from cd for changing directories and ls for viewing contents of a directory and mount for mounting drives and then execute the command chmod  on each file This removes all read write execute permissions  making them inaccessible maybe an expert can tell me if i chmod ed mount would that cause boot issues And the bin directory well lets just say the stuff in there is importantThe fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself Permissions are gone and arent coming back Finally passwd l root deactivates the root account Which itself is good practice in fact the only reason it was activated in the first place is so I could log into it and run these commandsADDENDUM I get so many comments saying WHY ARE YOU BUILDING WEBSITES FOR Well the answer is because its not my business I wasnt out to make a profit Someone contacted me and wanted some help building a a site I have the skills at my disposal along with some spare time so I agreed I was in it to learn and help someone out It was my intention to refresh my memory and get some experience in a skill remotely relating to my future profession because let be honest  its a very useful skill to have As a skint student I just quoted twice my weekly budget Seems fair to me we are both benefitingTurns out I learnt another valuable lesson Cant complain I got experience in what I planned to AND some bonus experience Its like when you finish a quest on some game and the reward is some experience a little money and a mystery treasure chest that when you open contains a little bit more experience crystalsreddit umadme no,Just because its up doesnt mean it will stay that way

jon,543,3315,1asyxi,2182,It was a typical Spring day in Britain unnaturally cold yet the sun shone with retinapiercing rays It was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well In fact it was on this day I pondered When people are cold they wear shirts jumpers cardigans jackets why never anything on the legs Why has nobody invented jumpers for legs This eureka moment kept me company all the way to the office that morning pondering this conundrumA week had elapsed since the Jon vs Angie showdown We were playing Angies bluff abiding her new court rules to the letter and sought permission for every single visit to the IT Cupboard Sometimes it was a stern and sharp no Other times it was a reluctant yes but only after waving a ticket number in front of her faceSuch a cupboardbound session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random The mindset was obvious we were obviously skiving shirking responsibilities and up to no good Her grand entrances into the cupboard where the handle was turned even before her security card had finished triggering was as if to catch us in some red act that she could grow fat onFor me given my near permanent residence there I devised a rather fun game trying to estimate when these visits would occur If I could time it right I would make a visit to users deskside machineontrolley just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the IT Cupboard so I could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune just going about my business I managed to pull this off a few times She would have her stinking coffee in one hand handbag poised for another session of studying me as I worked reprimanding anything she felt like only to be caught out because I was on my way out Those few times Id pass her in the corridor like this her soulless grey eyes would stare straight ahead shrouded by her forehead wrinkled after many years of just abjectly hating everything just as if I just didnt existThis eventually stopped being fun as I would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the IT Cupboard her presence just a grim spectral shadow in the background like a precariously balanced rock perched on a cliffside as in those cartoons She would come and go as she pleased seemingly annoyed in my indifference occasionally bursting into fits of sharp conceit where I couldnt do right for doing wrongThe sad reality is it wasnt all fun and games Angies frequent verbal attacks accusatory questioning tactics and consistent throwing of spanners in the works made for a very stressful working environment for everyone in the team There were many occasions where her actions and whims would cause a ticket to go wrong in some fashion leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces In one incident QBG had a traveling sales rep due to see her about a USB hard disk he was having trouble with She had correctly diagnosed most likely a failure of the actual hard disk and had requested a new USB disk to await his arrival where she would transfer any data he needed However one of my tickets was a simple request for a new USB Hard Disk which I had duly placed on the purchase order list Angie knowing that QBG had the last USB drive in stock had MAFG complete my ticket using the same USB drive QBG had waiting in her desk drawer MAFG was unaware of QBGs ticket I was aware of QBGs ticket but not that MAFG had been told to go and action mine using QBGs hard disk When QBG found out the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive Little things like that seemed all too commonplace now Even though Angie had caused it it would just look like our own incompetence orchestrated by this total bitch I was particularly reminded of the Omen soundbyte turning man against his brother until man exists no more I think what irritated Angie was that in the face of this deviousness I always stood up and appeased customers In the above case QBG was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands  this had been agreed between them for at least a week Angie sat happily clicking around TouchPaper while the rep blew up I waded straight in and simply took liability claiming an administrative oversight QBG and several others on the team were juniors they looked to me for mentoring advice who was I to leave them in the lurch I managed to appease this rep by offering to run out to the local PC World and grab one up for him Just one of the many incidents Angie seemed to orchestrateAdded to that my heldtogetherwithtape Nokia was suffering frequent call drops I missed my BlackberryTuesday came  our string epic induction session arrived fresh from Birmingham MAFG and I stood by the training room windows as hoards of lads and lasses from oop north stepped off the coach We knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a stuffy IT session It appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea coffee and bacon rolls for their arrival was a good one As the delegates stormed the sanctity of the training rooms armed with smiles and northern accents galore all lunged hungrily at our offering of breakfast There was much joy to be had I couldnt help but notice Angies indomitable presence at the back of the room as she sat piercingeyed and miserable waiting for us to start One of the new ladies quipped at me in her Birmingham accent Whos that sourpuss at the back After explaining she was my manager she instantly empathized with a cheerful laugh and Blimey ya poor sodMAFG and I split the groups into two manageable pieces I thought that this may throw Angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms closely monitoring and judging our every moves It seemed however she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session at every moment fixating her eyes on me She would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break which seemed like orders and reprimands over every minor detail Her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again one of the delegates new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session Angie motioned about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when I produced one of the three spare laptops always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened I swapped the machine over had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on AD later Angies fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup She was almost pissed that I hadnt slipped upYet again there was no hope of lunch as Angie ordered me to go and see HR Tank with her slow PC Again it turned out HRT had simply decided waiting  seconds for a newly inserted CDRom to spin up was far too slow and was causing her severe heartache  nothing to do with all that cholesterol thenAfter pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished phone contracts organised and hardware charged the whole session went off without a hitch Of course there were the usual attacks of Angies bitter comments Through it all I did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a flirtatious joviality with my inductees About pm Angie skulked out of the room She looked past me as she walked out as if she had gathered everything she needed to know and was off to put some other part of her devious plan into operation Her departure sparked a brief conversation about what a sour old woman she was and how they could never work for such a wench I resisted the temptation to spill my guts break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through I simply chose to leave it as Yes she is very difficultThe afternoon ticked by to its conclusion Eventually the last delegate left the training room armed with laptop off to make their way in the world MAFG and I sat drinking the last few drops of weak tepid coffee from the cafetiere looking out of the same window where we first saw the delegates arrive We could see their coach driver perched on one of the front seats reading a newspaper and drinking from a thermos flask looking totally relaxed in the world We sat quietly comparing observations on the delegates we had just met congratulating ourselves on a job well doneI had left the door open neither MAFG or I noticed Angies skeletal figure appear in the doorway Our discreet musings of the day were cut short with her vociferous shriek Exactly what is the meaning of this Who gave you permission to sit around what is this a playgroundWe both startled upright her voice almost shattered the glass As we began clearing up equipment powering down projectors and clearing desks of discarded wrappers Angie unleashed a full force critique of the day I dont see why this whole process had to take so long Maybe if youd had stopped chinwagging talking rubbish and making jokes this whole thing could have been a lot quickerWe knew that no comebacks would have worked with Angie She continued to berate us for another  minutes as we cleared the room down Just as we were ready to close up we couldnt help but notice that another figure had appeared in the room She was about  outfitted in a dresstoimpress suit and couldnt help but exude the fact that she was new to the company She stood with trepidation and meekly knocked on the door Excuse me she said Is MAFG in hereAfter acknowledging his presence she gingerly pirouetted up to MAFG and handed him an official looking envelope his name and address on the front She left the room just as abruptly as she had arrived making sure not to make eye contact with anyone not even to the nearapproving look from Angie MAFG and I with a box of bits and projectors in hand looked perplexed at what had just happened Angie left with the snipe I want you both back downstairs in  minutes after youve put that stuff away And I want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the dayWe made our way to the sanctuary of the IT Cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful shelving space MAFG opened the letter reading it aloud as his eyes sunk into his cheekbones There it was The letter was from HR garbed with every official looking signature and stamp that you could possibly throw onto such a document It stated he was to attend a meeting tomorrow with HR Angie and BHIT It also stated you may choose to have a representative accompany you This was it Angie had made her first move in her new game And it certainly seemed that the first casualty would be one of my closest allies MAFGThis terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates reboarding their homewardbound bus They were escaping the brutality of this situation off to their lives of freedom and futures to look forward to A clear contrast to ours mired in the darkness of some hateful hag who it seemed had only just startedMAFG didnt return to ITS that day I agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at pm to go collect his thoughts Angie had just upped the game And we felt powerless to do anything about itPreviousPt A new world

jon,249,3430,1aws5e,2180,Rolands amalgamation to nd line was arduous His physique just as pious and wretched as Angies slithered over MAFGs old desk space in exultance his mannerisms and movements unnervingly similar to his Mothers His keyboard and mouse glistened as though he would secrete some sort of mucus as he worked as if to chemically claim permanent ownership Rolands voice though weedy and undeveloped bore all the same neurosis and vile overtones which Angie would spit out on a daily basis His eyes almost serpent like as if they would pierce the skin if he stared long enoughI had just spent a glorious week on annual leave putting finishing touches to my bands album The ugly situation at work had been far from my mind as I enjoyed every minute of my creative freedoms Sunday marked the penultimate day of my freedom by bringing with it the feeling of impending doom By Monday morning my commute to work seemed ghostly as my attention was constantly attracted to the clock in my car It ticked by the minutes towards am and my arrival back in this gloomy pit where Angie stood Lord and Master My foot barely wanted to touch the accelerator pedal these thoughts did something to my subconscious which I felt forced to fightMy entrance into ITS was barely noted by the inhabitants whose faces seemed fixated on their own screens as if to break for a moment would feel the wrath of some frosty dominator Rolands bleak personality radiated throughout the small department like a bad smell only amplified by Angie who sat mere meters away Fighting through this black air I sat at my desk As Outlook churned into life the email traffic of the previous week waterfalled down my unread pane the main view providing snippets of what had transpired my absence The hard disk ticked and tocked the LED flashing in sympathy in its race to return to life after a week starved of powerThe unmistakable apprehensive walk of the Balding Head of IT came into view as he arrived at my desk desperately maintaining as dominant a pose as he could muster despite his triviality He voiced his usual brand of pleasantries as our exchange turned to the important business of the rollout project All appeared to be well in BHITs world The machines from Dell were on order to be delivered in batches the pilot group had been well informed the software vendor was communicative and the relevant sales managers seemed to enthusiastically thumbsup all round his every actionI started discussing finer details I want to get at least one of the builds done today as a first draft Its better to get it done early so theres more time to rectify issues and build machines BHITs expression altered as if to purposely show confusion Oh he mused I was under the impression the first draft build was doneI hadnt heard the shrill of Angies voice in a while but its tone was just as familiar as if I had endured it all my life Without even turning around in her chair to face us her words showered us with all the same bitterness The first build is done Someone else did it while you werent here Angies tone was mired in the suggestion that my wellearned week off had proven me negligent another spit in the face from this diseased rat Roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some psychic score Yes I did it It wasnt that hard really just install everything and domain register It His simplistic insight into my carefully honed art was if to mock all that I had worked for and write it off as if he had found it unchallenging and inconsequentialTheres far more than that I disputed You need to add the office wifi VPN antivirus etcAngies retort was sudden and venomous Its been dealt with Roland is doing the builds You would know that if you had read the revised project plan in your email You said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project He will consult you as neededIt seemed Roland had been furtively promoted again this time within the echelons of his own team I was now Rolands bitch BHIT seemed as if he would have done anything at that moment to disappear into a cloud of smoke as the rest of ITS still sat motionless with their eyes cemented into their PC screens pretending not to hear this firework going off around them My hint at checking Rolands work was again sharply rebutted Angie this time turned her chair to face me her eyes like stilettos garnished with her downturned drawnon eyebrows Her skeletal pointy chin moved in harmony with her bark as she added finality to this conversation You have other things to be getting on with Read the project plan and get back to work Roland will consult you when he needs youKnowing there was no win here I returned to my screen Outlook waiting like an obedient dog with  unread emails I looked at BHIT with a silent sigh expecting him to interject in some way Instead he just shuffled away obviously completely illequipped to properly deal with what had just happened He uttered some empty promise of catching up with me later but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it transported him away Angie had been busy in my absence An email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was emblazoned with a send date of pm Sunday evening  two days after I was last in the office  as if to prove Angies socalled dedication to the cause It was a carboncopy of my wellthoughtout and scrupulous project plan except my involvement in almost every developmental stage had been written out like a poorly written character in some novelists prose Rolands new found solecommand of the technicalities seemed all too purposeful Angie had painstakingly placed me in the backend of the entire rollout promoting our newest arrival her son into the most delicate of tasks The rat had risen to a position of powerI hated what had become of the project My considerable and enumerated planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as Angie lay claim to its proficiencies in her bid to establish herself at the top of the food chain ensuring that any credit traveling up would end with her In a last ditch attempt to fight back I emailed my concerns to BHIT The time scales of the project and Angies apparent and purposeful transference of my responsibilities meant that the rollout was now very susceptible to failure I finetuned my words for nearly an hour striking a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational Finally after much deliberation I took an all or nothing stance I added a personal addendum in which I vented about Angies disruptive nature within support her constant criticisms and micromanagement her fork tongue and angry terminal attitude BHIT needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in I couldnt help but notice Roland fawning over one of the new Dell laptops his prize that accompanied his birth right No expense had been spared on these machines attested to by the fresh sleek black appearance It was now being painted with Rolands clammy greasy hands the slimy fingerprints unnaturally obvious underneath the incandescent office lighting I felt a sense of jealousy like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this vassal creatures ignorance Silence followed as the email disappeared from my outbox The feeling I had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better Ten minutes went by still no response from BHIT I sat eagerly awaiting the Outlook balloon which would at least acknowledge BHITs reading of my plea Instead came the unmistakable sound of BHIT timidly rising from his chair the rustle of his suit seemed signatory as it served to fanfare his escape out of the office towards the main stairs I was alone in hell with Angie her spawn and several demoralized broken and burned out ITS engineersPreviousPt A new world orderhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsambethebmanagerfromhellptanewworldorder Pt Safety

QAAvenger,293,946,1i7szz,2171,This dear Reddit is is a story of justice A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments ampnbspThe Setting  Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but dont want to manage a database to sit behind it     The Heroes  I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about  Ive been working in this place for about  years now and Im frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if theres anything I want to ask about    My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics Great boss    My good friend who well call Greg works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department Gregs got my back and Ive got his If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then Ill help him out    The Villain  The clients project manager who well imaginatively call Douche was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered When paired together these things often mean that bad things will happen To make things worse this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it After all he is a paying customer    The Pledge  The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface It was a good feature and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus    gtMe Hi Douche its Derp at ltCompanygt Just calling abou    gtDouche Oh hi yeah the slacker at ltCompanygt Hows it going    It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call hence why this was obviously MY fault    gtMe biting my tongue Im Im OK thanks Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu    gtDouche Oh this again Havent you finished that yet    gtMe Well no Youll remember that weve delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which youve been infor    gtDouche Oh for the love of Why is it taking so long    gtMe Thats what I wanted to ask about Requirement  says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use The problem is that this equation doesnt actually represent that val    gtDouche Look youre supposed to follow the specification IVE written so just do it I dont want to hear about this again until its done    The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency He can read minds I then completed this piece of work ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction     The Turn  After the best part of  months and the client is about to go live with their site Theyve been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full  months before they were even able to test it and at this point they were going live in  days because thats when their marketing campaign said it would Because of these tight deadlines they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche    About pm Friday afternoon Greg from CS calls me up says hes got an issue with Douche Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system any issues they had integrating were not development issues but customer support issues    I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun    gtMe Sup Greg sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features    gtGreg Hey DerpYou ever worked on this new API that went up for ltClientNamegt    gtMe Yeah I did the verification process on it What do you want to know    gtGreg The Client seems to think it doesnt work    gtMe It was implemented to the letter Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out havent they    gtGreg Yeah thats what I thought when I read the documentation Ok leave it with me and Ill let Douche know    I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly whats coming next After not too long Steve the account manager for Douche storms into QA and straight into Boss office Theres a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually Im called in     gtSteve Would you care to explain this    Steve points at an email on Boss screen I go in for a closer inspection and its an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has obviously not been tested at all Im surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and Ive worked on various projects for him in the past    gtMe I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification    gtSteve But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense It doesnt make sense    gtBoss Derp what did the specification say about this    gtMe I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like    gtBoss I think that would be a good idea    I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me wanting to know whats going on On the way back I see Boss trying to calm Steve down    gtMe Here it is    I slide it across the desk and take a seat Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles    gtSteve But that makes no sense    gtMe I know    gtSteve Why didnt you raise this with the client    gtMe I did I then was accused of insulting the clients project manager and calling him incompetent    gtBoss Who wrote this specification    gtMe Douche over on their side did Im pretty sure you two would have been CCd on the email when it came across    gtSteve Well what are we going to do We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday its now  Friday Afternoon    gtBoss No chance We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless its a priority  issue Even then this is an API that multiple clients are now using and well have to be careful not to break their integrations    gtMe Steve You might want to look at section  on that document    Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered That and Ive made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past    gtSteve OK wait there    Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission The client wrote the requirements signed off the requirements signed off the work in Acceptance Testing and have only  hours before they launch They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight    The Prestige  Its  and I am considering what Ill spend my weekend doing Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me    gtBoss Can you just join me on a conference call    gtMe If its quick    gtBoss Thats up to you really    Intrigued I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone explaining to Steve what needs to be done    gtBoss Steve I have Derp here do you want to explain what the plan is    gtSteve Derp we really need to get this sorted You worked on the original feature so youll know the best way to test this Were still working on getting someone to develop the change but well be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients    gtDouche I really need you to help me out here mate otherwise itll really hit the fan over here    I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice    gtMe Ive already made plans for this weekend and    gtDouche Derp seriously you HAVE to help me out here    gtMe I dont really feel like it    gtDouche WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS    gtBoss Its pm on a Friday Most staff are on their way home or out the door Sorry Steve but it looks like itll have to wait until next week    Douche rages down the phone and once this torrent of abuse subsides Steve lets me go back to my deskIm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings    gtMe ltCompanygt Derp spea    gtDouche Please I need you to do this    gtMe You need to sort this out and calling me wont help you    gtDouche Please Im sorry just help me out    gtMe You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever weve spoken Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason youre here right now I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way I am not helping you    gtDouche Please    Hes actually crying You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky So I hang up and leave for my weekend    The Reveal  Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client whos organising the fix to the API    gtSteve So Derp this is Herp Another project manager for ltClientNamegt    gtMe Is Douche not working on this project    gtHerp Douche no longer works here    TlDR Douche PM for client writes Spec for API SPROC logic makes no sense PM thinks hes infallible QA Tech questions logic gets reported for being insulting Client doesnt test the API signs it off anyway It hits the fan release date is ruined PM is in DEEP and pleads for help QA tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more,The Only Acceptable Use of I dont feel like it,3117,TalesFromTechsupport

jon,334,3103,1aspaf,2142,Monday came to see the fruition of my power move Facilities were present and correct at the IT Cupboard busy fitting brand new desks and trunking On completion MAFG and I replaced the Ghost Server in its rightful setting on top of a u comms cabinet as though a rightful leader was being returned to the throne There wasnt much time for moonlighting as there was a massive backlog of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session Id ever run Our Birmingham satellite office had a recruitment drive and were busing down  delegates the following Monday for new gear and IT trainingIt felt good like we were back in business I expected some sort of a backlash from Angie Obviously I had caught her offguard and she needed time to regroup and plan her strategy All I could do was wait for the strike But for now we all reveled in our little victorySeveral laptops were busy building on the build desk as I clicked away making some new AD accounts for my incoming party of inductees Having received signoff previously from BHIT to replace the missing desktops Facilities managed to lose with brand new machines I had them all loaded on a trolley ready to roll them out MAFG was busying himself with an inventory of mini keyboards and mice taking stock for an urgent purchase order We chatted casually as he made his way up and down the isles it was a fullon powerhouse of progressOur shortlived freedoms stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street The electronic lock trigged and the door opened Angies familiar musk of coffee and old woman perfume festooned her appearance in the doorway her scowling face writing a thousand words of bitterness as she surveyed our veritable cave of tech She said nothing averting my eyes as I looked expectantly for a few seconds as I greeted her with a Good Morning expecting some request After a few seconds of uncomfortable silence I ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out Just a minute she said extending a single boney finger in my direction her tongue whipping against the top of her dry mouth What are you up to in here now A rather curious question I would wager one which I would have thought obvious After explaining the current goings on little did I know I was jumping headfirst into her trap It had been barely a morning gone when she had already planned her counteroffensive to the letter This was the scouting mission this is where she would sew the roots of her plot She came straight out with it Where are the tickets for these  laptops youre supposedly buildingSupposedly building Tickets for induction users Never heard of such a thing MAFG appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense We generally dont log them for inductions We usually get a fair number of requests for new machines so we just use an AD container to build the machine and move them to live when were rolling them outShit MAFG really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes What is AD Angie demanded I could feel the life force draining out of me as Angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement Why dont I have access to it her stern face looking like we had cheated her out of some mythical prize the lines on her forehead scrunched together Realizing his mistake MAFG kept quiet as I tried to work around it We dont generally hand out that sort of access out If someone didnt know what they were doing they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur Only MAFG and I have access to it in nd line as were the only ones who administer accounts OK it wasnt the best workaround I could have said but there its been said nowAngie threw around some more micromanagerial criticisms before taking her leave She also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine I was building for inductees before the end of the day An hour out of my life for no purpose SighAngies final email that day made her feelings on the IT Cupboard clear no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket evidencing their need to be in there and not without the express permission of Angie first Another typifying trait of Angies hardline stance against ingenuity control a persons ability to conduct themselves and create the illusion of importance by demanding constant permission seeking The clever bitch had laid the foundations for her new play there was a new ball to throw out on to the court Tickets for every machine permission from Angie to use the IT Cupboard And what would she do with her newfound knowledge of ADs existenceI contemplated these things as I drove home sat in the traffic jam from hell As I drew up on the accident the gaggle of other motorists gawping at the overturned x which littered the inside lane of the motorway seemed to exemplify the futility of each days passing as firefighters scuttled around the wreckage feverishly confronting the mass of metal as if finally overpowering a once vastlystronger enemyAs I passed the scene sure enough the traffic started moving at its prescribed mph over the speed limit It was as if we had all just escaped some fatal consequence and were now running away for dear lifeFor me tomorrow was another day another opportunity to dance in this fascicle struggle

TollhouseFrank,510,1169,1nzgin,2146,Another story from my magical job at that now closed dialup company  I had been at the company now for a year and a half or so was there slightly over  years and had become good friends with some of our regulars  aka repeat callers  If you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars you know how it goes  You see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver  Some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends  they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possibleOne of these repeat enemies  errrr callers  claimed to be a professor at a local college in its engineering department and all the time talked about the boost in spending after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern panhandle if you are from WV you already know which college it is  He was very snooty and because he was so smart had a Doctorate and taught a real discipline not a fake industry like IT that he was better than me and all the other techs  You could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called  You could tell he thought we were beneath him and should service his every whimWell after dealing with him for months and his disdain over everything  even calling me a liar when I explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal  I finally got the shocker of a call from him  As an explanation of the lie about noise on the lines  being an Engineer he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line wasnt possible because it was against Electrical Physics Properties or some such thing Anyway he calls in one day and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection  aka the only useful damn thing you retards can do  That is an exact quote from that call  After doing the usual steps and being ready to get him off the phone I tell him he will have to hang up to then dialin and try the service  But WAIT my friends he is an ENGINEER  He thought ahead  He was on his brand new Portable Mobility Enhancement Device  Crying inwardly I went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up  x  x  x  by the th attempt it was obvious he was getting no dialtone  I asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer  He got mad and cussed at me but then confirmed it was  I even had him unplugreplug both ends until he heard the click just to make sure it was firmly seated  After he tried again still no dialtone I concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory it happens modems were throwaway devices and had terrible failure rates and as I was starting to suggest this he cut me off and stated the following gem of wisdomI dont need a modem  This new PC has a Universal Serial Bus port  I just flattened the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and jammed it into that port  It is Universal so that means it will fit and use anythingI was stunned  Beyond stunned  He was a self proclaimed Engineer and Useful Member of Society and I was a Useless IT Retard  Yet to hear him admit to purposely mangling and misusing a phone jack and USB port I have no idea how he fit it in there even squished with a pair of pliers just floored me  At this point I just started laughing  It was all I could do  I laughed hard and long  The more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me the more I laughed  After a few minutes I calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his IT Department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did wouldnt work  Later that month he sent a strongly worded letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dialup did not work with Universal Sandwiches  Yes a direct quote from his letterTLDR  USB will work with anything even if it doesnt fitEdit   To the detractors I cant count that high so I cant keep track of the upvotes  For everyone else  Thank you for the hilarious stories that are similar to this one,IT is a Fake Industry,3315,TalesFromTechsupport
jaxmagicman,358,857,1ln41w,2139, years ago I was hired at my current position to help bring the financial institution into the st century  My first step was getting them a mobile platform  Check  My second was to take them from paper loan files to paperless  I implemented the product one year after being hired and to this day people still dont use it correctly They use the old way and then SCAN the paper into the system  Which is the hardest way because you can send everything directly into the system without ever printing a piece of paper  But you know people have to hold their paper  I have given each of the loan officers single page scanners for items that our members bring in but they use those single page scanners to scan WHOLE entire loan documents  So for the last  years the loan officers have been complaining about HOW slow the paperless process is and how much faster the older process is  My response has always been do it correctly and it will be faster  I have showed them and showed them and showed them how to do it without printing and scanning  And they have all responded for the last  years that their way is quicker and that I am not a loan officer so I dont understand And I cant tell them how to do their jobSO comes today  I made a deal with them I would take on their fastest loan officer and that person could do it their way and I would take a loan and do it my way  If I finished first they have to learn the way I want them to do it  If their loan officer finishes first I will never again bring it up and I will get each branch a big multipage scannerThey picked the person who complains the most  The person who gives me the hardest time about how fast she is with the old way and how my scanning PAPERLESS is causing more headaches than it is worth  We sat down and they started the clock  I am sure they thought that with me not actually being a loan officer I didnt have the experience  The goal was to get everything into the system and the person who got it done first would win  It started out as a small competition  Everyone was watching  She got off to a fast start because she knows the boxes  She can type without even reading what is coming up  I was still busy typing in the data into the system as she started to print  I was just finishing up entry of the information when she started to scan  I hit my button to send everything over into the system and there was stunned silence when I said DONE and she was in the process of scanning  pages stillThey didnt believe me at first  They all said I probably didnt do it correctly because she was way ahead of me in the process  I showed them my completed loan in the system and they all went over it with a finetoothed comb looking for a mistake  Telling her to keep going that if I made a mistake she could still win I had made no mistake  I just didnt have to spend  minutes scanning single pages of stuff JUST to scan it  They can now all shutup and learn the system like I have been begging them to do for  years because I beat their best and I dont even know their job,I come to you guys glorious Bring me all your bandwidth and the best flash drives in the land,2996,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,343,2517,1anqmu,2131,My attempts at garnering moral support from my girlfriend had failed After recounting the days events she thought my overreaction was simply the male chauvinist in me speaking out against a woman who was just struggling in a mans world and in her eyes doing it well Arriving for work I had three video conferences to get set up planned for exactly the same start times After working diligently to get them set up I finally set off for the ground floor the home of IT Support This time having grown smart of Angies disposition for anyone drinking coffee I swung by the kitchen firstOh yes Angies still on form today I sit at my desk and fire up my machine Angie glares at me whatever Im learning to ignore it Anything to say she sniped OK I wasnt quite expecting it to be that openended No came my reply accompanied with my best Whats going on ere then lookOff we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops Half expecting an array of torture weapons to now adorn the walls she slammed the door behind us Why were you late she demanded Confused I informed her I wasnt late I was in fact  minutes early I had arrived at  to get the video conferences set up for  despite the fact that my shift wasnt actually due to start till  anyway However due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the American side of the video conference had failed I was working with a counterpart to resolve the issue thus arriving at my desk at Im sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received I may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of lion taming after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building trapping me for  minutes It would have been just as well listened toShe then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that if I was  minutes late every day how much I would effectively cost the company over the course of a year which worked out to approximately  working days She then demanded to know why I felt it was OK to cost the company days and what was I going to do to make amends Despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up evidence of my keycard accessing the building  minutes before my shift the end result was I was  minutes late for work itd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of itShe then demanded I called your work mobile Why do you not have your work mobile Aha  one I can win  You had me give it away to a new starter in Mondays IT Induction Angie demanded to know why I hadnt ordered another one from Vodafone Sadly Vodafone have already distributed our contracted quota of Blackberry smartphones the Nokias we have are basically junk and dont integrate with email  kinda crucial for our work  and until the new starter feels like swapping back my Blackberry for a rubbish Nokia I would be without Not a very likely scenario as you can imagineSadly no I didnt win Ordered to retrieve an old Nokia and new SIM card she demanded to know if other members of nd line were also similarly furnished I knew where this was headed no more blackberries for anyone Wed all be on the rubbish partsbin Nokias by the end of the dayThis made me wonder about the subject of the rat On the one hand given I had now inadvertently ratted my team twice now frogmarched into culdesacs of inevitable verbal doom by her spitefully clever wordplay I just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who at various times had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature But no Someone showed her how to use a printer someone retrieved ticket logs from TouchPaper someone put her onto the IT Cupboard the thought bothered meAn urgent call awaited my attention when I got back coffee now cold and bitter to the taste It seemed a PA had a nonfunctioning PC Rushing up to the scene it seemed that someone had attempted to help the PA out prior to her calling support The  year old work experience kid they had up there diagnosed a RAM problem and tried to reseat it However this had failed to do the job and the PA remained with a beeping machineAfter trying a few rudimentary things it was apparent that there was no quick fix I unplugged and picked it up promising to return moments later with one of our spare stock machines by way of a temporary fix Not ideal but at least she could get to her profile data we used roaming profiles and use standard services A bline made for the IT Cupboard I found my card failed to open the door I tried again no luck Defeated I made my way back to the desk PAs machine in hand I returned with MAFG whose card also failed to unlock the door The reason became clear upon our return to ITS One of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that Angie had also demanded our access be removed from the IT cupboard From now on access was to be via facilities and only after her approval Great Especially useful as Angie had already left the office with her drinking group to experiment with yet another of Starbucks many offerings Running around like a madman trying to find anyone from facilities who wasnt already changing a light bulb or driving a forklift and was willing to bend the rules slightly A few rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now ostracized from our precious bounty Our actions were similarly stunted when pleading our case towards Balding IT Head who simply responded that he supported Angies decision and that undeployed hardware was technically responsibility of facilities OK maybe technically but this is stupid minutes later still no Angie still no facilities The PAs umpteenth attempt to get news on her machine came through from Helpdesk closely followed by a call from he dept head demanding to know why we were stopping his PA from workingOK nothing for it lets see what we can do with her machine Already receiving glares from three fat Finance ladies as I begin tearing the side off her machine we set to work After various tests MAFG and I agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit Kicking my machine off as theyre the same model I can only think to try mine minutes later armed only with a knife stained with old jam which had been liberated from the canteen at some point and found in someones drawer I managed to remove PSU screws from my machines PSU and the PAs machine A quick hodgepodge to exchange the PAs PSU we hastily hook back up the cables A quick power on test reveals the glorious Windows XP boot screen problem solved We shut it down carefully reattach the bits and pieces and I make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a recentlysacrificed chicken the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacentIve reattached PA ladys machine but its all too late Her boss is chewing me out over there now being an hour lost of her time Despite my best attempts to calm the situation down citing a problem with security access he vows to email my manager immediately going so far as to demand names PA lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can The day plays itself out to conclusion It takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the IT Cupboard I retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same caveman like style as it had been withdrawn Angie passes my desk as I finish up pointed at the knife and demanded What is that I got rd of the way into the first sentence of explaining its role in reattaching a new power supply when she snapped Take it back to the canteen right nowI spent the rest of the day on desk visits guiding users around various windows issues doing a desk move and I finish the day up with mentoring a guy on the virtues of active directory I knew I had an Angie moan coming I was expecting it at any minute But to my surprise Angie left for the day what no come back No dragging into the meeting room of doom for another lesson in stupid That PAs boss was very definite about laying the smackdown Where is itDriving home it bothered me that Angie had said nothing about this complaint Had she realized she was wrong No I dismissed that very quickly Total bitches like that are never wrong in their eyes It usually means that people like me failed to understand properly and need a shouting at to get it through my thick skull But where was the backlashI was stopped at lights watching a mother scold her child as they crossed the road This made me realize It was all just another spiteful orchestration by Angie She knew that I knew there was a complaint She knew Id be expecting her to smack me down over it But what she knew and what I didnt think of until now was that there was no sense on doing this on a Friday Its the weekend after all She wants this exact situation she wants me wondering what sort of smackdown awaits me Monday morning  and she wants me to think about this

quantumanomaly,268,959,1mhz9j,2130,So in the past  years Ive been aggressively trying to get myself in the IT industry I went back to college full time in a great Networking Technologies program but then the wife at the time hung divorce over my head Dropped out of out college to work on relationship still ended up getting divorcedI felt like my chance at having a professional job in the IT industry was gone I used to day dream about having the chance of being that guy where the boss called you of a critical issue and needed you in ASAP ITNetworking has always been a passion for me and I was dedicated to having a job where I wake up and look forward to work Fast forward  yearsThose day dreams became a reality Two months ago I was very fortunate to have landed a data center admin position Even though I was not able to finish my degree in networking I was able to some how make the cut out of the  applicants who probably had better credentials than myselfLast weekend was when the day dreaming became real I was at a friends house BBQing and it was around pm that night when I got the call Boss says Hey quantumanomaly is there anyway you can come to the data center I know youre BBQing but weve had  servers go down since am Were not understanding what the Network Engineers in corporate are asking and we need your helpI immediately accept and head into the DC wearing shorts and a tee along with  beers in the belly I got on the phone conference and got the low down of the issue In the  hours that I worked that evening I was able to resolve the issue and bring the servers back online that were down since am I went back to the BBQ after that late night IT encounter and finished my  pack of Warsteiner DunkelTurns out that my bosssboss was on the conference call and I scored some hardcore brownie points The whole team thanked me up and down for helping them restore the servers on a short notice I left the office that night with a massive smile and a feeling of accomplishment I got a little tearyeyed too because I was once told by the exwifes parents that I would never be successful in obtaining a professional IT career Dont ever let someone or an event prevent you from doing what you love doing My fear after the divorce was that I would become a depressed old man by not living a wholesomelyfulfilled life and I refused to let that happentldr exwife wanted a divorce while in college for IT career so I dropped out Wife still left and I still landed the IT career I always wanted even though her parents stated that I would never obtain my dream job,It finally happened that big time IT feeling,3089,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,314,2831,1aq69v,2121,I walked into the office Tuesday morning brandishing a Starbucks latte with a ginger shot It was my little way of celebrating my minor victory of no customers waiting to tear my face off for lack of machines OK there was a little part of me happy about getting just a little win over Angie My mind was already on the task of prepping up some laptops for the next round of inductees due in a few weeks At this rate I may even get time to reimage my own machine as it badly needed itInto the office I go exchanging light pleasantries with the security guards Now Im not sure why I didnt expect it I thought the battle was won this round was done and dusted and more importantly the meeting room booked for the week MAFG looked at me in sympathy as a crowd rallied around Meeting Room  BHIT with two facilities guys and several third line guys were gathered in what seemed to be some sort of epic teardown akin to one of those American cop shows exercising a search warrant I walked straight up to own my actions nonchalantly still brandishing my victory coffee BHIT seemed to ignore me at first issuing orders to some of the third liners unplugging my gear Turning his attentions to me his usually weak and ineffectual voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded I dont know what youre playing it but this is not on You cannot turn a meeting room into a comms room Add in more bleating with health and safety concerns my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and Angie was why I took matters into my own hands rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machinesI was ordered back to my desk The thirdline monkeys tore down my mancave which I had lovingly pieced together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion I could The familiar green tshirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as I watched the rest of my now tepid coffee disappearing down my throat as evocatively as my victory As it would seem this would eventually serve to complicate matters wholly as the customer machines which had been imaged or were waiting for imaging were taken off to some mystical thirdline hole where I was unable to get at them In fact as it would later transpire I would never see those desktops ever againAll the while Angie sat with her back to me presumably trying to get to grips with TouchPaper I knew she was everything to do with it but at the same time it was only BHIT and facilities people up there My answers were provided moments later when BHIT came for another chat telling me in no uncertain terms that booking a meeting room to perform IT work was totally out of bounds Right at that moment Fat Finance Bint appeared by his side She was aching to get her say in too Suddenly this was making senseIn her finely tuned ultramoralistic vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path she pleaded with me that my actions were selfish and wrong You cant just take over meeting rooms we need those rooms all the time for legal purposes You cant just take one they arent there for you to just use as you please Her rising inflection that completed every sentence drove through my skull like rusty nails on a blackboard Amazing In the time Ive been there I dont think Ive ever seen finance use one of the meeting rooms once In fact there were eight of them and two were used as archive storage and not locked either Most of the rooms sat unused day in day out But now I see the path of treachery Angie didnt like the fact shed lost Fat Finance Bint complained on her behalf to her manager he called his people they called their people they eventually called BHIT who immediately agreed with his higher upsI threw down the gauntlet We used to build all the time in the IT Cupboard That was suddenly disallowed We cannot build at our desks we cannot use any of the server rooms as theres no space and now when I book a meeting room through the proper channels to get some work done this is suddenly out of bounds Exactly how are we supposed to do our jobs I followed this up by fervently clicking through several open tickets pointing out several tickets requiring build timeBHIT stood mute as impotent as ever He didnt have the answers or the means to get them He just simply retorted Well this is the first Ive heard of any problems You need to communicate with your manager moreHow can it be this difficult to just do your damned jobThat day I happened to lunch with one of the third line guys I relayed to him our tales of woe following Angies arrival He was almost stunned He did mention how hes been unable to access the IT Cupboard for a while but when he was nd line the IT Cupboard was always the build areaNevertheless I had to admit defeat Id already made so many positive impressions up the ladder being cited as a troublemaker was not something that would have been useful I returned to my desk to the first of many emails from a customer dutifully CCing their managers in a typical passiveaggressive style Where is my machine You took it three days ago and Im still having to use the spare laptop you gave meIt seemed I was now more behind Work was piling up interteam tensions were getting high and all the while Angie sat and clicked around various tickets not saying a word Fearing a further reprisal I took finger to keyboard and again demanded Angie and BHIT work out where our build areas should beAs the afternoon grew darker I carried on desk visits refusing to take any more machines away Angie rose from her desk at pm and in an unnatural tone just said Night all She had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger nearly vindicated in her arrogant yet chanty swansong Clearly this beast of hell was more learned than me in the art of war  and it seemed she held all the cards too Was there to be no retribution for thisPreviousPt A new

jon,145,2472,1annxl,2122,As I closed the door on my cozy warm house on a bitterly frosty Thursday morning clutching my car keys in one hand and a small plastic scraper in the other I immediately regretted my decision of not purchasing gloves the previous night while shopping My car bellowed smoke as it churned into life as my red cracking knuckles powered the scraper into the solid ice on the car windows The fact I had purchased a Ford for its clever quickclear windscreen technology just seemed to mock me more as the damned thing was had failed to operate at all over the last few daysI made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the turnout of animal rights protesters  the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the gates of the center as emailed by HR seemed rather overkill as I spied a single figure waving a poorly legible placard from near the gate being carefully watched by two security guards It seemed a rather poor effortI duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking Jaguar I admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head thought that one of these days all this toil will be worth itExchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards I arrived at my desk and removing my jacket the cold radiating outward I couldnt help but notice a familiar stern sniff Jesus Angie was here before me There I was hoping for at least an hour or two of recovery from this mornings voyage before having her in my faceMere moments had I sat down to get my machine warmed I reached into my drawer for my coffee cup only to find Angie standing right next to me her stature akin to that of a Hitchcock serial killer Armed with her coffee cup she placed it on my desk dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand Can I help I politely inquired I want to see what you get up to in the morning I motioned towards my empty coffee cup but she meant business You can get your tea later I want to see what youre going to do first open the paper program She meant TouchPaperThe next two hours was like being dragged over icy knives naked I had started the day with eleven open tickets six of which I knew were long ones and had already made appointments to service that day The other five I could knock out easily while waiting for builds to finish thus leaving plenty time free to pick up anything new that came in Angies plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket  even those not to do with nd line Support My colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle shrunk into their seats trying to root out any ticket which would mean escaping their desks and the vicinity of Angie By  oclock my queue looked like a ticketbomb had gone off  open tickets Crikey  what was I meant to be doing this morning Angie had retreated back to her lair as MiddleAged Family Guy sent me a quick communicator message Do you want me to have a look at some of those cases for you I duly replied whatever he fancied doing go for it After taking a couple of password resets Angies snarl came from her desk Jon I did not tell you to make others do your work for you MAFG if you have nothing to do I am more than happy to GIVE you something to do MAFG quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word  motionless minutes elapsed until Angie walked up to MAFG and ordered him to accompany her They disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fateI decided to keep to my plan that day I retrieved five machines from leavers desks and made for the IT Cupboard to get them reimaged for some imminent arrivals and replacements I sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit I had a reps laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight The sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock followed by the sincere knock on the door thrice performed meant it could only have been one person Up until now although she knew it existed Angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it Putting on my proface I duly opened the door Immediately Angie went for the neck a starbucks tall firmly clasped in her bony fingers eyes like a spearWhat are you doing in here Why arent you at your desk What is going on in hereI politely showed her around the IT Cupboard though what I really wanted to do was batter her with bits of Dell laptop and bury her somewhere in with the junk P Viglens kept only for laboratories and their outdated gear The prospect of me attempting to fit her bitter bony body into a fullsize tower also crossed my mind Not happy with my explanation theres a surprise she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to whereeverthehell and the fact that the machines I was imaging needed to be on desks by close of businessPlanted at my desk she left me there with a Now get on with your work and dont let me catch you again I felt impotent Time for a reaction I figured if the above work doesnt happen Im in it with several department heads If I go back Im in it with Angie So I fired an email to Balding IT Head CCing in Angie asking for direction It read I have work going on in the IT cupboard which requires resolution Angie has made it clear that I am not to return to the IT cupboard Can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completedMere seconds after I signed my fate Angie frogmarched me and some spotty helpdesk kid back to the IT Cupboard She ordered us complete the work as she watched and verified every step Of course spotty helpdesk kid had no idea what any of these nd line processes were about and questioned nearly every stage An hour later we were finished and went our seperate ways to redeploy our efforts As I walked away with two machines and a laptop bag slung she said I want you back at your desk in ten minutes dont let me come looking for youThat afternoon Angie sent us all an email We couldnt help but imagine it read aloud by her razor sharp tongue each paragraph almost lyrical in its context Her order was that the IT Cupboard is no longer to be used for any sort of maintenance or work it is for storage of computing equipment only Having recently learned that her circle of bitter women in positions of power that drink too much Starbucks coffee also included some oversized tank of a HR Administrator the icing to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety violations and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinaryA few of us held vigil over our lost IT Cupboard as we watched several burly men from facilities tear down our nest The glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley ready for its trip back to the server room our beautifully installed network cabling and network switch was unceremoniously ripped from the wall and tossed into a rubbish old box our carefully ordered and neatly packed away toolkits were also in a box it seemed that they had been claimed in the name of facilities our electric kettle together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated packs of tea bags coffee sugar and dairy creamers were tossed into a black bag headed for the skipWe discussed the predicament in depth How would we image machines with a threeitem limit on our desks Where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware These sentiments were later echoed when one of the server admins asked I notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms I thought you guys needed that for building machines Yeah we did tooMy shift ended and I made for the sanctuary of my car again a thick layer of ice and snow serving to only impede my progress I again noticed the brand new Jaguar which had miraculously seemed immune from the effects of this brutal British summer You can all predict who was behind the wheel Angie glanced as she noticed me approach over her black leather steering wheel no smile or acknowledgement She reversed out of her space as her shining black Jag powered her away from my presence her work for the day was doneThorougly deflated I clicked my Ford Mondeos remote key Strange the remote wouldnt work I put the key into the lock and the central locking groaned into life Sitting into my ice pit realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also wouldnt start A few more tries and there could only be one culprit My reward from the days toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the RAC Recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start Bang goes my early leaving timeWhat a day ,The B Manager from Hell Pt Marking territories,4594,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,221,2660,1apz9g,2096,The week came to its natural conclusion over several bottles of spilt milk and the mandated amount of crying Several more instances of Angies managerial style being put into action came and went However I still had tickets building up which needed build area time Realising BHIT was ineffective in offering a solution I tried and failed to sweettalk third line into segregating some of their server room space for machine builds I turned my attention to our sofar more than amenable postroom guys But it seems I was slightly pushing it at the prospect of wheeling our server in there The request was met with more displeasure at our storing new laptops and bags in there alreadyThe answer flooded towards me one day when Angie Fat Finance wench unnaturally skinny finance wench and the HR Tank took off for their near twice daily trip to Starbucks I heard them gossiping about their new coffee related discovery on their way out See they have to take baby steps otherwise HR Tank will break out in tonnes of sweat But so I hear ginger shots in lattes are simply gorgeous Angies seemless change in personality between her dealings with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment It was just odd to hear this scorpion do nothing but treat us like shit all day but then with friends actually smile and be human But my time came to put my diabolical fuck you plan into actionLike batman with a purpose I ran round the office building like a thing possessed I had a third liner retrieve our imprisoned Ghost server from the network riser room and patched up some network ports I finished phase  of my mission with an email to Angie requesting several parts from the IT Cupboard just as she returned stinking of coffee and biscotti She accepted my request with a disinterested but reassuredly managerial styleMonday morning Car defrosted its time to get the hammers on Im at work early for phase Quiet Blonde Girl QBG always seemed to fly under Angies radar I did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a tendancy to be popular with higher up types Though I would say a lot of that would be hormonal Her arrival in Helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody  not even the helpdesk manager  had even interviewed her Similarly her record quick transfer to nd line was equally enigmatic I think we were just lucky that QBG was actually a decent worker and learned quickly Underhandedness Personally I think more cleavagerelated All suspicions of her being a mole were slightly dispelled one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about Angie the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed QBG with her P the sack However Monday was to be her day She had done some extraordinarily terrible thing and it was time for her to feel Angies wrath And female to good looking female Angie was in no way going to let her off lightly But I was ready and waiting for AngieAngie with QBG in tow opened door to her dungeon of dispair with an angered and authoritative fling She stood in the doorway sideways motioning for QBG to enter Her attention was soon diverted There was I several machines imaging on top of the file cabinets two further machines lay dissected on the table and a studious and official amount of paperwork lay with my blue ballpoint nestled neatly on top I said with a slightly officialised and victorious tone Can I help you at allAngies face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple bulged leaving QBG outside she closed the door and turned her attention to me Her sharpness was echoed in the warming meeting room amidst the blur of machines Who gave you permission to do thisMy short simple reply amounted to Nobody I used my initiative We have no build areas anymore customers are waiting on their machines Knowing that there was nothing she could do she left the room with Ill be checking on you later As the door closed it was obvious QBG had returned to her desk assuming she had escaped capture No such luck Angies venomous streak played out as she called across to her in a way one would talk to a  year old with a simple Hey you Here as her bony finger pointed downwards QBG obliged with this demand as Angie simply stated This one is taken come with meThe door closed completely leaving only me and my machines I felt like some sort of mad professor finally alone in my domainAngie was usurped I relaxed in my new mancave all manner of industriousness going on MAFG even swung by minutes later for a victorious highfive the smiles from other team members shining through the open door like lighthouses I think I just further angered Angie more when I came out to the team that The room has been booked all week but theres plenty space Feel free to use it back to business as usual I think it was the last part Angies hand froze as she amateurishly moved the mouse around the screen in her attempts to find the Outlook icon againIn a way I did sort of feel sorry for Angie My girlfriends hypothesis of a lone female trying to make it in mans world resonated a little That was until she turned around and demanded we kept the noise down people are trying to work Her snap only reaffirmed her brittlenessThough something told me that I hadnt heard the last of this One thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who arent cut out for the job They always win No matter how much you think youve had the upper hand they still win I returned to my desk to reply to some emails leaving my machines image in my cave claimed in the name of man I couldnt help bu wonder if this would eventually be QBGs fate socially promoted as guys in positions of power like the eye candy until she gets to a stage where she is truly out of her depth only able to rely on her position of authority to motivate her staffAs it happens I was dead right My moment of victory was surprisingly cut shortPrevious

jon,224,2798,1ashkr,2077,The inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected I arrived bleary eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell Angie was about to concoct that day My fate was postponed as Angie was busy providing a critique of every detail as QuietBlondeGirl rearranged her desk to Angies preference It became apparent that Angie had taken issue to some typical girlie deskwear and was ordering it be suitably secreted in desk drawers or disposed ofA grim reminder of another of yesterdays ordeals came in the shape of an email from HR Tank demanding to know when her new faster computer would be delivered Not only was HRTs computer perfectly fine it was only  months old and not due for replacement for two years This I knew was an argument I would have to save for later I logged a ticket and moved onBHIT arrived in just after me and made a pitstop at my desk He must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night His pale head seemed to silhouette against the dimly lit office lighting I grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately With Angie trapped in her reprimand of QBG I knew I was stealing her thunderThis is getting just stupid now Customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and rebuilds at the desk side whats more theyre taking longer as weve had to use USB Hard disks for builds since the Ghost server went missing we have six machines now that nobody knows where they are the networking gear has also gone missing What annoys me is that all this was working perfectly fine while we had our build area So the fact remains you need to sort this out now We have a major rollout project coming up sort it outMy concern echoed with my vocal severity BHIT was well and truly put in his place I could feel Angie wincing as I had beaten her to the punch BHITs bald head nodded as he claimed he understood With every nod a ceiling light just slightly came into view as he stood over my desk almost cowering behind the green partition It was about damn time he took this on board BHIT walked away with the weight of the world on his shoulders He knew I was right he knew he had to step in I sat at my desk uncomfortably the newly recovered bleachsmelling Ghost Server had found temporary shelter home under my desk where my legs should go the PSU fan blew hot air almost providing some relief from the cold  a small yet powerful offering from the inanimate object almost thanking me for its rescue The prize was doubly exciting as for first time in many weeks my overnight WhatsAlive script proudly showed Ghost Server as now being rejoined to the network like a soldiers homecoming Its location Switch B port  area ITSI busied myself that morning by staying rooted to my desk firing out responses to some of my tickets In part I wanted to make sure BHIT was doing his job but I also wanted to see how Angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again An hour rolled by and Angie was still busy reprimanding the team She had worked out  or been shown  how to properly use TouchPaper and its accompanying stats screens The evidence of an interteam rat was all too clear as Angie who could barely use Outlook could never have worked out TouchPaper to this degree Nevertheless this rat would have to be discovered at a later dateTea in hand I rolled up to BHITs desk for progress Finally he had some news I was to report to facilities so they could show me some rooms I picked up my Napalm Death fleece to embark on my fantastic voyage But the familiar loud rattle of Angies keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her veiny neck Right lets go she proclaimed as if to usurp leadership of my mission BHIT cowered behind his computer screen rather than face confrontation What could I say I felt the next hour of efficient decision making suddenly hampered as Angie set off to Facilities as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded schoolboyAfter the Facilities Manager had led us to our third room visit it soon became clear what Angie thought constituted a suitable room She wanted something near to the main office so she could check up on us regularly difficult to work in and not much space Ironically the meeting room would have fit Angies specifications exactlyI wanted something near the IT Cupboard for supplies  access was another battle I was soon to wage  plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold Aircon vents We finally came upon Angies ideal The only access was a flight of stairs  just short enough in number to appear inconsequential yet just ever so slightly add enough inconvenience to keep this bitter woman happy Add to the annoyance of not being able to get a trolley up them they were just narrow enough to ensure scraped knuckles in the event of anything bulky This would be enough for Angie to know that this place would be a last resort  no longer a fort of solitude when the outside world became too muchThe room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the Aircon vent This is totally unsuitable Any one of the first few rooms would be fine I protested Angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out This will do The Facilities manager looked perplexed at Angies decision Rather than argue it he just agreed and muttered something about arranging access and desksI knew this would happen I relayed our adventure to ITS as Angie disappeared off for another Starbucks run with her Menopause group Their faces looked angry Calls of Out of all the rooms you just saw Angie picked some shithole thats basically gone unused for years Rather than offer an explanation I merely motioned in the direction of BHIT still cowering behind his monitor I could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up Itd have to be me again Fine BHIT I started He almost winced behind his monitor  he knew what was coming Can you come and join us for a secondAfter regaling yet again what had just transpired BHIT seemed like he was mustering all the courage that he could As I continued let loose on what a stupid decision Angie had made together with her obvious attempts to prevent the team actually working he dug deep one last time With a quivering yet determined voice he said I thought I told YOU to get a new build room sorted out Well which one do YOU want I looked back at my crew and just said Well actually the IT Cupboard was perfect Its got a window its worked fine for years theres plenty storage In fact its only called a cupboard because theres racking and shelving in there I also have an email you sent to Fat Tony from rd line when he was on nd authorizing the use of the Cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for workspaceSometimes the odd swift half after work with monkeys in other teams can pay dividends Leave it with me said BHIT as he made for the doorway ITS smiled at me but deep down I shat a brick Ive really done it now If I wind up getting BHIT to relinquish the chains on our beloved cupboard I can only imagine what sort of games Angie will play with that one But I was pleased For once I was up where she didnt know I was up She was out with a bunch of menopausal women blissfully unaware sipping her insipid Starbucks Coffee somehow providing life support for her scrawny architectureI decided I didnt care about Angies reaction anymore Id won a major victory Now to just let the day play out I wonder what Monday Morning will bring PreviousPt A new world

trrwilson,112,555,1b5f6x,1979,I do onsite tech support for a large bank  My coworker well call him Bob and I cover an area that includes  locations some are really close some are about  hours away the rest are in betweenOne Sunday a really bad thunderstorm rolled through our coverage area a few of our locations lost power so Bob and I were expecting a fair amount of calls on Monday  We get to the office Monday morning and over the course of the day we end up with about  calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages  We spend the entire day loading software on PCs unboxing displays and local printers and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on TuesdayTuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day  We leave going in the same direction after about  miles he was going to go south and get  of the branches and I was going to go north and get the other About  minutes after leaving the office Bob calls me  trrwilson meet me at that gas station up the road  We meet and he tells me that he has to go  hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch tickets like those take priority over any others  We transfer his equipment into my car I wish him luck and we part ways  While he was on the road he called his  branches and let them know what was going on and that I would be out in the afternoonI get to my first  branches and things go OK  I head south to go to the branches Bob was supposed to visit  I get to the first one and it was a mess  One of the replacement PCs wouldnt come up so I had to Frankenstein a working replacement from all the bad ones we picked up  I finish up and realize that Im not going to get to my last stop before they close not a huge problem since I have after hours accessI call them up and tell them whats going on and theyre cool with it then I ask them if they can mark the bad equipment for me so that I dont have to stumble around in the dark trying to figure out what I have to replace  Again no problem theyll have them marked when I get thereI arrive at the branch about  minutes after the last person has left I carry my equipment into the foyer and then I see it  There is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer  I figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving  I go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby  I look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipmentI follow the trail into the first office  Taped to the monitor is a picture of the user fakepunching the monitor  I pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed and sure enough the monitor was called in so I replace her monitor  I follow the trail further and the next office has a picture of the user fakestomping on their PC  I take the hint and replace his PC  The last stop on the trail had a picture of the user fakekicking his printer so it gets replacedBefore I left I took a picture of me giving a cheesy grin and a thumbs up and taped them to each replacement  The next morning when I got to the shop and checked my email I found that each user had send me a picture of them hugging their new equipment  They really managed to brighten up a long and annoying day,Sometimes I love my users,2534,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,454,3297,1b2hp0,1977,Journeying to work that day I knew there was to be plenty bad noise Despite this feeling of ensuing doom it was an oddly upbeat kind of day The morning sun was subdued as it accompanied the first warm day of the year and seemed to fill the office with naturally warming UV light News of our remarkable failure flurried around the office as eyes stalked my path from the lobby to my desk As my Outlook churned into gear it presented several new emails to look at I was only waiting for one The ominous calendar entry from our eminent Sales Director was present as expected decorated with the highimportance flag I spent the morning glancing through my tickets though I really had no intention of doing any of themAngie appeared around her usual am Her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory Starbucks cup distinguished Angies obvious apprehension Care to explain what happened yesterday Her condescending vocal tone was different this time Before harsh and snappy like a loathsome strict teacher a faint quiver existed somewhere in the background I dont know I responded For once I seemed to be in the power position I dont feel I was involved in this project She pressed for further information her voice taking on her signatory snarl and gripeHR Tank accompanied by an anonymous administrative orderly unexpectedly appeared to relieve me of this interrogation She demanded the immediate presence of the entire ITS department in the nearest meeting room Again our walking pace to the meeting room seemed exaggeratedly slow a homage to HR Tanks slow purposeful walk I stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of BHIT HR Tank began to speak through her reddened face fatigued from her trip Her drained voice read her palpably preprepared and rubberstamped statement from a sheet which seemed to also serve as a barrier of defence It has been decided she began that due to incongruences that have arisen in the department of late that BHIT is no longer able to fulfil his duty as Head of IT He will therefore not be returning to the business Her statement droned on with all the officialdom you would expect from such a legally exacting statement Her statement ended with I am authorized to answer any questions at this point The ITS team shuffled out dazed and wounded For his spinelessness BHIT had evidently had all our backs somewhere along the line We took our seats like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt Angie remained with HR Tank discussing an imminent Starbucks trip as Roland stood guard in her absence We all sat still and silent in one way to mark the demise of BHIT and in the other we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence The fact that BHIT had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed unreal Angies consistent belittling and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook we were shellshocked that she had apparently wonThe postrollout meeting time came up As Angie Roland and I made our way to the top floor in the elevator the air grew thick with scorn The silence bellowed like a thousand years of social indifference as if the slightest word could ignite the situation like a megaton bomb It seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened Angie and Roland obnoxiously barged out of the lift though I had yielded to them anywayThis was my first time in front of an official board The room layout had changed The Sales and Marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk flanked by the conspicuous presence of HR Tank and another woman who it seemed was there to take notes Cantering the congregation was a man whose obverse mannerism exuded the confidence and exterior meant he was someone of importance Angie Roland and I took up position in front of this jury of VIPs Our plastic chairs clanged and noisily bent into form to exemplify their cheapness an extreme contrast to the leatherbound pews claimed by the panel The central character who it soon became apparent was the division manager opened with a speech akin to that of some great dictator His appraisal of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume yet remained controlled and collected It was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some preinterrogation tacticThe panel would interview us one at a time I remained sat outside the office with Roland as Angie pleaded her case as ITS manager Memories of sitting outside the school principals office at school seemed came flooding back Though I had never really been a bad kid I found myself winding up outside the heads office a few times  a Catholic warden clad in black whose manifestation was intended solely to scare straight Roland sat with a smirk apparently unconcerned with these ongoing His motionless gaze made me think that this guy had far more experience explaining himself to school principals than meRoland was up next Angie sat in the seat Roland vacated Her arrogant indifference mirrored Rolands posture with eerie exactness I began to grow worried Angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress Thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half thoughts of having to jobhunt made me nervousAfter an hour of waiting patiently my time was finally up I sat central to the panel trying to remember every interview technique that had ever been drilled into me by any chance Id previously had to take such advice on board I made sure to look at the person who was addressing me back straight shoulders back Here we goThe panel had their tactics down It seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time The questions came slow strategically calm and collected The lady on the end of the panel appeared to note everything I said as the panel would wait for her silent OK to continue At this moment I was ready to hang Angie and her bastard youth out to dry I just waited for my chanceAfter the initial questions largely surrounding who planned what the director placed his pen in front of him He placed his elbows on the table as he leaned his hardened chin on his first and second fingers mirrored and extended to provide support As he leaned in he said Tell us in your own words you account of what happenedI relayed my entire saga from Angies commandeering of the project plan Rolands inauguration to being responsible for the images our flawed and hapless manner of couriering laptops instead delivering at the conference  all of it I finished almost spitting out my words exercising this demon called Angie One of the sales managers enquired Why didnt you check anything before you built them I defended There was no time to do that They had been built and QAd by Roland who apparently knew what he was doing We had  machines to build and no means to verify anythingI couldnt tell if I had impressed with my answer or not The thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview Why did you believe Roland fully equipped to manage this implementation The weightiness of their questioning became stronger I didnt responding inadvertently with a tone similar to Angies impertinent and selfaggrandizing sneer I followed the direction of my management I was told to leave him alone I did The MD passed me a copy of my rollout plan Was this the rollout plan you followed I picked it up glancing through the already familiar pages I had spent several days perfecting reenumerating before my final presentation I looked up and said No Angie altered the specification several times The final version was signed off I believe by everyone here I felt like I had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been rooting for me as if Id had twisted the knife in the very same way Angie had done to claw her way to the topAfter  minutes of grilling I left the room Angie and Roland had long vacated leaving the empty seats their emptiness like some satirical congratulatory prize HR Tank had concluded the meeting thanking me for my time ordering me back to my dutiesITS was silent for the remainer of the day juxtaposed against the now brilliant developing sun obviously out of place in Britains Spring but seemed to invite action and good times contrasting against our officeprisoner mood Angie and Roland were stealthy silent against the humanistic blur and shuffle of the ITS inhabitants as they adjusted their postures to comfort The only reprieve came from Angies regular group ushering her to their second of their Starbucks trips this time joined by Roland The escape of my pm leaving time couldnt have come quickly enough I made for home wondering if I would ever set foot in ITS againThe crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day The grime and dirt that incrusted my car seemed to beg for a good washing and detailing session It was relieving to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a dole queue As I approached the car park gates of the pharmaceutical giant I wondered if security would deny access to their fortress I envisaged ramming the gate in some movielike attempt to exact my revenge to dance on Angies decrepit corpse  months of this woman was too much for anyone to deal withAs I uneventfully descended the giant lobby stairs towards ITS I expected to be bundled to the floor at any moment by all manner of burly security guards to the approving look of Angie I was convinced this woman was far too streetsmart to be outdone by anything Almost disappointedly ITS remained unmolested in its usual groundfloor spot My Windows login worked as I began to prepare for the days workI arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy still licking his wounds from the onslaught of sales reps QBG met us on our way down She smiled wryly excitedly yet softly declaring Angies packing her desk Shes historyI didnt believe her I had to see this with my own eyes I sat down maintaining as detached an outlook as I could pretending not to notice as Angie wrapped her scaly neck in the familiar black and grey shawl Rolands desk surprisingly also lay vacated Angie disregarded the looks from ITS as she picked up her leather clutch bag and made for the exit Is she gone Was she fired A fervour of questions engulfed our modest team As we excitedly theorized and conjectured we eventually realized that there were only questions  no answers This tumultuous turn of events did nothing to allay my own fears I tied myself to my desk waiting for someone  anyone  to order me into a closed doors meetingBut nobody came that day nor the next PreviousPt A new world

jon,332,3134,1auvm9,1964,A month had passed since MAFGs passing Morale was at a low point and apart from Angies bipolar temper things seemed to slog along as they were each day proving to be more and more difficult to get through The IT Cupboard slowly relinquished its isolation as Angie seemed to track our movements with animallike instinct imposing ridiculous policy after policy The battery indicator on MAFGs mouse had at some point faded to nothingness having spent its remaining energies fruitlessly lamenting its masters disappearanceMAFG sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning Many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car some theorized hed wronged some director in a drunken moment of sincerity there was even a rumour he had put Angie in her place in some magnificent fit of comeuppance bathed in the flabbergasted stares of twenty faceless onlookers The reality was far more boring and told to me over a weekend pint of fine ale MAFGs wife had previously worked with the company in their research division She had left under explosive circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company Management felt that MAFGs continued employment was incongruous and had compelled him to take a PILON agreement to end his tenure It seemed odd that MAFGs wife had left the company over six months ago we felt that this discrepancy stank of Angies involvementFor a while though a specific date had shone brightly in my Outlook calendar It had acted as a target representing a reprieve from the mundane trivialities support had to offer I had prepared for it arrival with jubilation It finally arrived and my audience with several heads of salesmarketing BHIT and the software vendor was mine to shine in The purpose was to set into motion the plans for their largescale laptop rollout Armed with my carefully crafted numberwork dutifully outlined on several handouts I set off for the meeting three floors up in the swankier part of the building In my mind I was Alexander the Great sword raised in hand off to conquer in what seemed to be an inevitable foregone conclusion OK I dont know much about history but all I knew was my sword was huge and I was about to go kick some ass My arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands The meeting room was perfectly air conditioned with several pieces of foliage standing elegantly in large ceramic plant pots The large window welcomed the sun in vast quantities into the fragrant room Underneath the heated rays of light was the ominous shape of Angie sat at the far end of the room away from all human contact The sunlight seemed to darken and blur Angies outline like some satanic aura but her bent bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignoreThe meeting began with the usual round of roundtable identification Angies snarled introduction was only suffixed by the words I am in charge of Support Her declaration made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on The software vendor rep was a techy through and through He stood for his presentation draped in what was obviously a brand new suit purchased for the occasion It seemed to contrive him as he awkwardly passed around his company endorsed paraphernalia pens cards product sheets there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this endeavour but try to hide his obvious geekinessMy segment came I eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement adorned with pie charts Gantt charts and technical jargon made just basic enough to empower even the most ITilliterate of sales managers I explained my intentions with a wellrehearsed speech which lasted several minutes  new laptops and  to remain in the field Across three hardware types several primary targets were to be used for pilot testing each user would receive an extra MB on Home drives and be responsible for their own backups each reps laptop would be first imaged for any later data retrieval and each rep would be refurnished by the end of the day Angies eyes remained focused on me throughout the session I felt odd as she hadnt interjected once Our vendors rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation They liked what they heard new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all OKMy moment of triumph at an end Angie finally spoke up What sort of manpower do we need for this Her voice was rather different she spoke as if I were part of her Menopause club all harshness had dissipated into a normalized vocal tone I retorted putting aside my stunned silence that I expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of MAFG She nodded in approval as she made notes Her lack of typical Angiestyle anger perturbed me Nevertheless the meeting ended in what appeared to be a climactic sense of collaboration as the Balding Head of IT smiled proudly sharing all manner of managerspeak with his congregationAs the vendor techie and I exchanged pleasantries Angie left anonymous in her wake without saying another word I knew this move by now Her silent departure was signatory of her underhandedness she was up to something It distracted me momentarily as I asked the vendor guy to repeat what he had just said what was this devious cow up toI was not left in suspense for long That afternoon ITS were summoned to a meeting room where Angie wanted to discuss the rollout I knew Angie was cooking something and I knew it was a clear move to usurp my finely laid plans My only consolation was that I had the backing of BHIT and several higherups what could she possibly doOur entrance into Angies meeting was made strange by the unexpected presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to Helpdesk His sharp eyes and pointed thin facial features seemed disturbingly familiar his unbranded shirt and pale jeans seemed to be a desperate attempt to look normal Angie began the meeting by introducing the urchin returning to her familiar intense vocal tone This is Roland He is joining nd line today she hissed as her eyes danced around the room as if to highlight her claim The meeting continued with Angies voice droning my exact words complete with inaccuracies one could only attribute to someone whose obvious depth had longsince been surpassed I think at some point the only thing keeping us awake was Angies voice shrill and bent in character She had finally finished when I decided to speak I knew my interjection would further madden the beast mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which Angie could never possibly dream of But I had to stake my role in this project Well have the majority of the machines built prior to the event so most will only need booting up and profiles loading There will also be a ghost server file server and well have a connection back to the office All outoffield laptops will be backed up later back at the office any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit Well also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything happensThe ITS crew hung on every word as if I were mandating a life or death situation Angie fired corrections in as much as she could though mired in technical incompetence You will have to back up EVERYTHING you get her accusatory vocal sneer hinted that we may do anything differentWe had a mission we had our tasks I had a rollout to deliver It was getting towards the end of the day Roland had picked his spot next to me taking MAFGs spot He was not talkative he barely acknowledged anybodys presence A few banterlike quips intended to embroil him into our team didnt get so much as a raised eyebrow His body language was eerie in its familiarityBrandishing my purchase order signed by BHIT and bearing Sales amp Marketings stamp approving the project with every endorsement that one could ever hope to see on such a document I headed to the elevators to scale the heights to the Procurement department I was joined in the elevator by QBG who seemed eager to have a word It seemed QBG had some sort of big secret she would have burst if she hadnt let outRoland You know who he is dont you QBG spoke softly as if the lift were rigged with some manner of bugging equipment Thats Angies son Her words were difficult to believe but Rolands mannerisms posture familiar sharpness it all rang out clear as a bell The thought of this woman propagating seemed unnatural It conjured images of some monstrous carnal act between a musty stickinsect and some hapless male donor entangled in her web held prisoner for his seed But it all seemed too obvious now Like a slow headon car accident everything started to make sense There had to be someone who had shown Angie how to access TouchPaper she was clearly still struggling with it a month on Someone had to show Angie how to use the printers Someone had to have fed back to Angie anything and everything wed complained about her Someone had to have kept Angie informed of our whereabouts  how else could she track us with such animallike accuracyThere he was  in the background the whole time as enigmatic and as slimey as the bitch that spawned him That same spotty st liner who Angie demanded I cleared down the IT Cupboard with so long ago the insignificant shadow which seemed to appear every so often as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image superimposed somewhere on it standing by a printer walking through the ITS area sitting nearby in the canteen her spy invisible to the naked eyeAs incredible as it seemed there it was our rat Exposed far too late to be in any way wary he was now closer than we could have ever imagined We had allowed him to creep up on us like a ninja  Angies inside manPreviousPt A new world

jon,244,2914,1auof4,1957,ITS had a full compliment of staff the following morning There was work to do  but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for We were all were gathered for one purpose One of our soldiers was in trouble Though we were powerless to do anything other than  offer moral support we felt glued to our desks Angie was palpably absent her familiar black and grey shawl being the only spectral reminder of her presence somewhere in the building MAFG was quiet assurances of help to find other work and amending CVs came and went like splashes of waterSoon Angie and HR Tank arrived at MAFGs deskside The scene brief as it was seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only handcuffs They led him to Angies special place of solitude situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from ITS A bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it I had seen Angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure Today though they moved artificially slowly MAFGs limbs moved uncomfortably as if to not let on their progress was impeded by HR Tanks inability to keep up with normal walking pace  a walk that Angie had seemed to perfect As the figures shuffled around the corner at the end of the corridor the dim lighting served as a poignant landscape of some mysterious doom the shadow of Angies tall thin figure casting on the yellowing walls like some fairytale ghost A few minutes of disbelief followed in ITS The team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area trying to explain things in our own minds not even a breath was audible This two minutes silence was terminated only as MAFGs monitor emblematically entered their sleep modes and faded to black As quickly as the images faded so did any sense of hope or morale we barely clung onto and so did our moment of stillness We promptly turned to our own desks to workAngie and MAFG returned two quick hours later Accompanied by two security guards they stood sentinel to Angies familiar sharp tongued leadership of the situation HR Tank was nowhere around I could only presume that her weight disallowed her making the return journeyMAFG added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box his lips dry from lack of saliva his throat obviously lumpy Angies stern face stood expressionless The silence in ITS was broken only with Angies snipes Where is your USB disk you cant take that she barked MAFG coiled the USB cable around his impeccably well taken care of Freecom drive She snatched it as he offered it to her her eyes still now showing even a grain of benevolenceWe need your phone too Her growl seemed to antagonize MAFG but he couldnt react His slow purposeful movements were fighting every urge to succumb to the lump in his throat MAFG duly handed her his trusty BlackBerry refusing to make eye contact It instantly brought back memories to me of when we had first been issued these phones MAFG and I had spent a good week exploring their potential loading on useful utilities and configuring them for maximum IT Support effectiveness They had been the formation of a good workbased friendship It just seemed this memory was torn now trampled on by this monsterAngie took MAFGs BlackBerry and extended her arm in my direction  clad in a heavy black cardigan sleeve as if to contrast so heavily with her pale skin Her emaciated hand ushered it in my direction As I took it from her it felt like I was taking a gift from some devil She said with a bitter tongue There now you have one I sat stunned as MAFG looked at both me and AngieThe ordeal was nearly over  but not quite MAFG picked up his cardboard box of meager possessions old pay slips and desk candies He motioned his completion but Angie again extended her hand to block his passage Springing into life one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably officiallooking stance and took the box from MAFG He placed it back on his desk The guard started digging around in the box almost neanderthal in his movements His grey security shirt stretched over his fattened arms as he bent over for his task He removed several company branded pens and an unopened pack of MAFGs business cards On their discovery each piece of contraband were cast onto the desk surface their respective rattles and thumps a soundtrack to whatever wrongdoing MAFG had done to earn this punishment After nodding towards Angie and refolding his arms the security guard took his rightful place next to his

jon,51,2250,1am1be,1946,Obviously fake name Anyways a while ago I was working a contract for a rather significant pharmaceutical company It was your standard runofthemill st line maybe nd line type role with a clear differenceOur manager was great Attentive offered good career advice when you needed it always had your back when the proverbial hit the fan guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of Quality Street The guy was excellent  one of the few times I could handonheart say itHowever good things dont last and as higher ups decided that Support was way too happy decided to dispose of our erstwhile leader much to the cue of Oh Captain My Captain upon his departure Enter Angie there are few words to describe Angie Wed heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the campfire Apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a  year old suffering major attention deficit disorder at a lecture on string theory Angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade To put it into perspective if you took this companys product and turned into a blue Octapus that shot fire the authorities would contact her department for advice Now from what I could tell these guys seemed to be very well versed in everything from chemistry biology and some were even former doctors None of this sheer brilliance washed with Angie she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way  even if her way was clearly stupidStill  judge no book by their cover and all thatAngie arrived in Support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile She immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk where she chewed out a  year old girl mercifully due to there being dust on her desk and grit in her drawers This relentless torture went on for a good  minutes while Angie inspected every inch of the girls effort to appease her whims even recleaning several spots more than once Afterwards she walked away red faced eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unitWe all knew it was to be a new world order with Angies arrival we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops it was very apparent to me that she was just a vicious troll marking her territory showing everyone who was bossSuffice it to say we finished up the day typing up CVs and comparing layouts,The B manager from hell Pt  A new world order,4196,TalesFromTechsupport

jon,460,3074,1az9o3,1935,The IT Cupboard had transformed into a veritable hive of activity Boxes of laptops littered every available crevice in the IT Cupboard Some boxes contained freshly built machines signified by their address labels destined for their new homes Others lay brand new yet to be called to command Our efforts were meticulously presided over by a flickery Samsung monitor which recorded our every move in a single excel spreadsheet Names addresses serial numbers asset tags  all required recordingDespite the obvious pressure QBG and I were under Roland seemed content with doing the bare minimum He took his position in the only seat left in the room Our demands for action seemed to go unnoticed as he idly fiddled with his phone occasionally breaking his concentration to scroll up and down the excel sheet his arm outstretched to reach an old mouse and keyboard we had rescued from a junk box for our purposeRoland indolently looked up his phone What one are you doing now QBGs response was evidently irate in tone as she read out the serial and asset numbers Roland duly tapped in QBGs response barely even taking the effort to capitalize his text The keyboard old yellowed and not even built with the Windows keys clacked loudly as he typedRolands attempt to permanently affix himself to his throne and rule the roost had grown weary After this exchange while unwrapping a fresh laptop I decided enough was enough Roland I started If youre not going to help could you kindly go back to supportIm busy His snide response grated on me As if to exemplify his uselessness QBG dragged the keyboard away from towards her as she entered another row of data into the spreadsheet Her body language exuded bitterness towards Rolands unyielding lethargy in a stereotypical way that only the female of the species can perfect I knew how she felt though Roland sat without a single reaction He seemed to silently shrug off this display of discontent as if it were of pure meaninglessness For the next hour we worked around Roland uncomfortably as if he were a cold and jagged heavy rock inconveniently situated in the center of the room We had expected Angies inevitable visit Her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of Dell laptops She discussed our progress with Roland loudly taking great purpose to exclude mine or QBGs input Roland dutifully furnished Angie with our present number we had imaged repacked and addressed just under  laptopsThe fact is Angie could not bear to leave any situation without imposing her sense of authority it just wasnt even in her vocabulary Angie especially liked imposing her authority onto QBG more than almost any other engineer It was though QBG represented everything that Angie was not to the letter True to form Angie directed her attention towards QBG where she was loading a trolley of outbound boxes Angies voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the groaning ghost server Are these laptops supposed to be finished Angies loaded interrogation was not intended to garner any real information QBG duly provided her response knowing that Angie had simply just opened her line of questioning to find faultThese postage labels are entirely too small You need to redo them all in a larger print This condescending request lashed QBG like a whip as she winced at the proposition QBG declined Angies proposition instead offering Well do the next ones bigger these are fine as they are Angies insistence was delivered over a lambaste which seemed almost infinite as she constantly picked up more and more trivial matters of discontent Not enough tape this box is slightly damaged there are too many boxes on that trolley Angie satisfied with her instruction retreated back into the ether of the office Roland remained motionless on his pedestal smugly smiling as he reclined back into the chair where he stayed for the next hourpm slothed into view Roland donned his dark grey duffle coat each popper irked us more and more as their echos disturbed our frustrated silence He left for the day without saying a word leaving QBG and me to continue our work His departure was suffixed with our in depth symposium of the situation As we offered one another further anecdote of why Roland and Angie both should be buried in shallow graves we seemed to further agitate each otherRight you know what I started this isnt happening another day Lets go see BHITOur mercenary strut through the hallowed halls towards ITS seemed to gain in speed the closer we got it was tantamount to a race to reach BHIT As he sat blissfully unaware of the onslaught we were about to deliver his balding reflected the ceiling light with a dull shineQBG and I tagteamed our way through our complaint as BHIT listened Our frustrated accounts grew louder as we described in depth what the first day of builds had brought We spilled the beans on Roland Angies micromanagement and how the duo were jeopardizing our attempted rescue with their banalityBHIT pondered our predicament as he noisily scratched the side of his unshaven head He finally

jon,507,3309,1ax63o,1920,The following morning I waited at my desk primed for a showdown with Angie Roland sneered and snorted loudly as he worked on some inscrutable task Angie fresh Starbucks cup in hand barely made eye contact as she approached the ITS area My opportunity to loudly demand satisfaction was at hand As she placed her cup on the desk I armed myself with a copy of her project plan I stood up to metaphorically remove my glove to slap Angies face with it Just as I began talking I was stopped in my tracks as Angie barked into gear Her scoff trampled my incursion with a strident whine Why hasnt HR Tanks machine been replaced she demanded I defended with theres nothing wrong with her machine at all its barely a year old and is one of the highest spec machines we have deployed Anyway I Angie dismissed my petition with a stony faced ultimatum I want that machine replaced before you go to lunch today Reopen that ticket and get it doneStill brandishing Angies project document she retrieved her cup and stormed towards the lair located somewhere beyond the dimly lit corridor which had seen many an engineer walk to their deaths I was left immobile the duel won before I had even drawn my weapon The emptiness of BHITs desk offered no sanctuary in this moment I left the project plan on my desk skulking away towards the IT Cupboard to furnish HR Tank with a new OptiPlex After enduring yet another hourlong session of unintelligent questions garbled half chewed up and spat back out by the HR Tank I escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would At the top of the list she required a colour printer placed near her desk I guess having to walk half way across the floor to the communal printer may have burned vital calories necessary to plug the realestate offered by her inch wide trousers In reality I was aware through the rumour mill that an apprentice she had appointed in the guise of being mentored in all manner of HR and Legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career HR Tank had instead used her as a dogsbody to fetch printer output deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and on the way back from such voyages procure various canteen supplies for herThis mornings diversion of Angies insistence became all too clear BHIT had finally gotten word of what had happened last night  most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained vehemently about Angies actions It seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded Angies explanation via email  which of course Angie was all too eager to give Remember this power woman had a lifetimes experience of deviously plotting her rise to the top Attached to Angies response was yet a new project plan now detailing my newfound responsibilities as technical delivery engineer Whats more the handover of machines would nolonger be carried out at the conference instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients This lunacy has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that Angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of timeOpening the PDF I scaled down to the procurement section only to validate what I fully expected to see anyway Against the parchmentcoloured background of the branded company document my atatime proposal had been replaced by a single line  machines to be ordered from Dell The statement rubber stamped by all and necessary seemed to vindicate Angie completely The ball it seemed had bounced clandestinely into my back yard BHIT rushed to my desk I knew what he was going to ask before hed even asked it Even though Roland Angies eyes and ears sat in close proximity I let my true feelings known to BHIT So youre telling me there is one week to image  odd machines So in reality thats  machines per day BHIT nodded hoping I would concede and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency This is stupid Whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them My claim had now garnered the attention of the rest of ITS no longer were their eyes transfixed on their screens scared to move They were intently watching the spectacle as it unfolded in front of them I turned to Roland demanding Are the images even ready Rolands familiar ratty vocal snare simply retorted with a shrug The images are ready whenever you want them Angie returned to ITS and immediately interjected my exchange with Roland as if something deep inside her had fired up and manifested into some sort of primal trait of a mother defending its young She started You told me it would take a week for the laptops to be imaged Her obviously incorrect statement seemed a purposeful twist of words on my initial claim No I said that each batch of  would take a week to build and QA Refuting my claims Angies stern voice still sought to overshadow any offering of reality Delving deep into her PDF I demanded Why are we now couriering the laptops out Why arent we delivering at the conference as planned What about the  or so that are staying in the field that only need reimaging I felt confident  for once I felt that BHIT had my back albeit ever so slightly blunted by how easy he had historically caved in Angies abrupt answer seemed to be the line she had used to sell her project amendment with I will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops It is better to present the face of IT by offering a support dropin service as people need it instead of disrupting an entire eventThere was no way we could now argue this round now Angie had landed us in it She had played her cards now it was an allornothing game of seeing where the chips would fall BHIT was powerless to do anything other than hope for a magicwand solution Angie was golden in the eyes of the upper management who had rubber stamped her new proposals all the way There was only one card left to play I hadnt expected things to go off to this magnitude  I was inexperienced in this sort of corporate espionage If I failed to deliver  built laptops Angie could easily pass the buck down my name made synonymous with total disaster If I delivered  built laptops Angie would get the glory and I would remain a nameless entity For me neutrality or bust For Angie glory or neutralityI dunno how were going to do this I said rising from my chair Leading the procession QBG followed closely behind me as Roland wheeled the Ghost server towards the IT Cupboard BHIT watched us disappear hoping we would indeed find this desperately needed magic wandPreviousPt A new world

Craysh,279,550,q15i9,1919,Sometimes fellow techs that makes you want to smash your keyboard all names have been changed to protect the incompetent I used to work in a ServiceDeskTriage capacity lovingly dubbed Tier  where we would monitor ticket troubleshoot and escalate as needed we were expected to have a  selfsolution returnOne thing that we never were allowed to touch was network issues  Our area telcom team had lost their extremely competent team lead some  months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who didnt really seem to care about their job  They were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement  This made them act like they were untouchable  As such I had learned fast to start recording my phone calls to them thank you Google Voice so they couldnt pin anything on usAnyway one day around PM the network dropped out As such I called the Telcom OnCall  Me Leaving Voicemail Hi this is Craysh from Tier  It looks like the network is having issues again  Internet communicator and email are all unresponsive All three webfarms are unavailable Trace route to the gateway has failed Ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is inaccessable due to the issue Please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident minutes go by and SOP dictates that I call back before escalating to their manager  The oncall answersTech OnCall Phone this is SteveMe Hi Steve have you gotten my voicemail Were having issues with the networkTech No I havent  Tell me whats wrongMe Repeats what I said aboveTech Ok Wait  minutes and try again ClickI had assumed that by Wait  minutes he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in  minutes   minutes go by and the network is still having issues The network has now been down for the last  minutes or soI call the OnCall phone again  No answerMe Leaving Voicemail Hi this is Craysh again The issue is still ongoing Please call me back as soon as possible Minutes go by so its time to call again No answer Time to call the acting supervisor Supervisor This is AaronMe Hi Aaron this is Craysh from Tier  We are having issues with the network and the OnCall has stopped answering their phoneSupervisor Stopped You mean they initially answeredMe Yes he said to wait  minutesSupervisor OK hes probably working on it  Call me back in an hour if the issue persists clickAt this point Im calling my supervisor and apprising him of the situationFor the next hour I continue to call the OnCall every  minutes as is procedure No answerI call the supervisor againSupervisor This is AaronMe Hi Aaron this is Craysh from Tier  again We are still having issues with the network and the OnCall still has not answered his phoneSupervisor OK Ill take a look at itTurns out that Telcom had pushed a policy to the Junipers that had scrubbed the white lists completely blocking all access to all ports All in all it took  hours to get everything back up and running  I documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available againThe next day came the fallout  Telcom was claiming that I had never paged them and they said that a customer ended calling the supervisor to find out what was going on  They even showed zero calls on their cellphone they had removed the calls and messagesAs such we had a meeting to discuss Tier s failure to report a severe incidentI walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs including Aaron and and Steve  They demanded why I hadnt contacted the oncall and I stated that I had and that they had lead me to believe that they had been working on the issue Nobody believed me because The OnCall phone didnt have any messages or call logs from Tier   Their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phoneI calmly walked to the overhead projector logged into Google Voice and played each consecutive voicemailconversationThey no longer work here and Ive had three promotions sinceEDIT Someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting  Here goesI was working the  shift at the time and I had stayed an hour and a half late to own the incident  A little after am Im woken up to be informed that there is a meeting I need to be at for am concerning the Issues that Tier  had alerting proper individuals in a high visibility incident  Running on  hours of sleep I usually went to bed around am and got up at PM I figured Great Its about time Telcom got reamed for never answering their OnCall phoneWhen I walked in to the meeting I pretty much knew that the Telcom guys had decided to screw me They wouldnt look me in the eye alarm bell oneWe sat there while management had a little powwow before hand outside the meeting room including the acting supervisor for Telcom and I heard phrases like separation procedures obvious alarm bell two as I knew that they would not get rid of any Telcom guys as of that point  My supervisor was not a part of this meeting he was sitting next to me alarm bell number three and he was pretty sure that they were planning on letting him go tooThey came in the room and sat down quietly  They asked my supervisor if he had been apprised of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative We went over the procedure that I had followed and my supervisor acknowledged that I had called him and told him of the situationThey then asked Telcom their version of events  They essentially said that I had never called the OnCall phone and that the Supervisor had been contacted by a customer friend of his who asked in passing why the internet wasnt working  They took out the OnCall Blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night  The actingsupervisor forgot his cellphone that day so they couldnt check his I so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away He was one of those people who had their Blackberry attached at the hip The Contracting Officers Technical Representative or COTR came in to the room and he was fuming Asking me pointed questions and kept repeating why didnt you page out and There are procedures in place that you should have followedI couldnt get a word in edge wise and the Telcom guys had very smug looks  I pretty much didnt care anymore at this point so instead of trying to explain further I stood up which pretty much made everyone tense up a bit and I walked calmly to the overhead projector Logged in turned on the screenhttpiimgurcomCfjpg and started playing the voicemails Nobody really said anything at first but the Telcom guys definitely had priceless faces The COTR told me Please excuse us Craysh We have some business to discuss  Feel free to take the rest of the day off with a  per diem I think I ended up seeing Prince of PersiaMy supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after I left  All he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the US government  The only reason he told me this was because I had to help file an amendment to the incident report ,Wait  Minutes and Try Again or How I Almost Got Fired Wall of Text,2469,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,208,3050,1ax0bd,1916,I graciously admitted defeat in the face of managerial apathy I accepted my diminishing responsibility as I set about my regular duties visiting desk sides and dealing with the various whims and fancies of the user base In one way it was a relief to detach myself from any view of the perpetually turning cogs of the rollout I engrossed myself in some other issues which had come to plague the user base most notably a problem visiting reps had experienced with their laptops and smartphones failing to maintain a stable WiFi connection in the office I made my way past some familiar faces as I strolled around intrepidly laptop in hand waiting to catch the moment when the WiFi would drop Just as the signal dropped my investigation was put on hold as one of the Sales managers caught my attention His artificially whitened teeth seemed to surrender every line of imperfection under the light as he smiled his wellpractised salesman smile As he casually enquired about the rollout I deflected his attention towards Angie as the new goto person I was only in a consultant capacity as needed His smile took on a slightly apprehensive expression I knew full well that BHIT had sung my praises right from the start To hear this dramatic change in events appeared disturbing Maintaining a professional demeanour I simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable hands the first time Ive ever flat out lied on the job He disappeared back into the hustle and bustle of the office leaving me to my WiFi investigationAn oddly airy Wednesday afternoon surged into view ITS felt clean and clear We could at long last breathe a hearty sigh of relief Angie and Roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages The absence of their black auras had left a dramatically spacey vibe like we had all just surfaced from some colossal ocean depth finally able to drink in some of the bountiful fresh air Its taste was like a cool breeze amidst some arid summer heat wave It was a relief to actually hear our own voices again The drone of insipid chatter from the Finance wenches had been the only aural accompaniment of recent days Their meandering discussions on male pop sensations  years their junior various coffee recipes and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging portly women found attractive made for a percussive din the only moments of reprieve as Angies led her Menopause group for their twicedaily Starbucks fix Of course she would leave Roland on guarddog dutyStill we now had an opportunity to let our guards down With a secretive half vocal whisper QBG was eager to catch up on the latest rolloutgossip Her face contorted in disbelief as I confided Angies actions I was just barely loud enough to be heard outside our conversation but just loud enough so to ensure BHIT was in earshot He barely flinched while I concluded my full update to QBG In one way I didnt care who heard me anymore so long as BHIT did But it felt good to get listened to as if my account needed to be heard by someone Theres only a month to go shouldnt something more be happening by nowAs the week trundled towards its closure Angie and Roland made frequent trips to the higher floors for rollout meetings as ITS beavered away in their duties I waited for consultation requests from Roland sometimes even publically inviting him to check anything he wanted with me through as an agreeable manner as I could muster Roland refused to ask for help but in reality I think I was happier without having to endure this pairs attitude and negative manner My working life seemed basic and simple again just the way I like it Well of course with the regular admonishments of Angie Morale was long gone but there were our own little private worlds to disappear of toThe biggest casualty was the Ghost server that MAFG and I had acquired built loved and later valiantly rescued from its janitorial doom It stood poignantly next to Rolands desk  the threeitem to a desk rule apparently mute given Rolands status It was now clearly being held prisoner like a hostage whose captivity had broken them down sympathising with their kidnapper and taking on a new persona to mirror the evil twisted nature of its jailer The beige box was coated in the alienesque slime and goo that oozed from Rolands skin like Spidermans evil doppelganger shooting acidic goo from his palms The Dymo label which had so proudly identified the Ghost Server by its hostname ITSGHO had been forcibly removed as if to eviscerate some evidence of its history It left a white rectangle obvious against its discoloured skin with scratches and scrapes surrounding it akin to an animals claws Two weeks passed by all news of the rollout went untold Roland appeared to be busily toiling in another part of the building  we were quite happy to be relieved of Angies underling Monday morning I was training QBT in the fine art of replacing an old ATX Pentium  motherboard in an desktop that she had retrieved from a research department A donor Packard Bell from the rear of the IT Cupboard had already been looted for some other parts previously its casing battered and bent However luckily an entire motherboard and CPU remained It was this we were transplanting to the distressed research machine its rare and irreplaceable exclusivity commanding the utmost care and attention The antistatic wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its plasticcoated coil snagged on various parts of the metal chassis We were happily bonding in our moment of isolation catching up on each others hearsay it had been the first time I had been able to relax with someone at work for a while QBG it seemed could make a suitable replacement for MAFGOur mothers meeting was almost at a close when our a stony faced Facilities monkey clad in dirty green jumper which seemed to evidence hard toil appeared in the doorway with an aged disapproving look Jon he mumbled Theres a truck turned up with loads of laptops Where are we meant to put em His Manchester accent echoed from the hallway through the opened IT Cupboard door his frame slightly obscuring the overhead lighting His accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home like a lone warrior holding his own in some foreign land Right here I guess theres some space at the back I said motioning to an isle MAFG had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure His toldyouso smile accompanied the shake of his head What all of em You know theres about  of the thingsConvoyed to the scene of the crime the Facilities monkey purposely shuffled me towards the articulated lorry that had arrived in the yard standing like a bruised battle tank just returned from war Its rear doors were flung open to reveal box after box after box adorned with the familiar Dell logos as a team of Facilities workers scrambled to unload them You better figure out where were going to put these double quick he commanded thrusting a manifest into my hands I could see my name planted firmly at the top of the documents recipient list I knew right then that my evening had just been squandered by whoevers administrative oversight had caused this turn of events Of course I knew full well it had to be only one persons doingThe lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk Its appearance had a stealthy corporate doublemeaning On the one hand visitors would be impressed with such a bold artistic statement On the other it reinforced to any tardy employee that they had been caught redhanded their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards To add to this crafty corporate purpose this oversized clock always seemed to be a few indistinct minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed  Tonight it took on a new role It sarcastically emphasised my rapidly vanishing evening as I walked pumptruck after pumptruck of Dell branded boxes to their temporary homes Neither Angie or BHIT were anywhere in sight to mediate the situation Repeated appeals to helpdesk to locate their whereabouts went unanswered In the end some sympathetic Facilities manager had yielded to my plight and offered three temporary rooms to hold the laptops These were now crammed floor to ceiling with Dell boxes My clothes smelled old from my efforts prickled with boxdust and the stale smelling air of the rooms I had been afforded which had sat unused for some time I packed away the last box finally leaving the building at pmMy disentanglement from the project as prescribed by Angie seemed to have been suddenly and majorly rehabilitated in this single dramatic move I had clearly stated in my project plan that these deliveries should be conducted in batches of  at a time we didnt have the space to deal with  machines  as this very evening would attest This detail Im sure had made it into Angies rewrite of my project plan in verbatim I know I had even seen it Whats more with only two weeks to go building  machines in that time was no mean feat What had Roland even been doing this whole time This blunder which felt a little too obvious seemed to signify stage two of Angies sabotagePreviousPt A new world

jon,674,3112,1b03d2,1901,QBG and I worked long and worked hard Machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked  this time with larger address labels as per Angies demands The previously arid air infected by Roland seemed more pleasant now that Angie had declared he had far more pressing duties to attend to That didnt stop Angies persistence in micromanagement Each visit brought a new list of vices which had to be adhered to her elephantlike memory seemed to retain every minor piece of misdirection she spluttered her leathery face and tongue breathing fire at the slightest transgression QBG and I pulled overtime on WednesdayThursday Our thanks came with a companysanctioned pizza on one night followed by an impromptu trip to the local Chinese takeout the next We both worked diligently for our cause until sometime on Friday afternoon when the last batch of laptops sat imaging The IT cupboard looked like a bomb site Discarded baggies hastily recorded CDRs with various drivers on them several cardboard cups which once contained cheap cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of illcut tape and inners littered the floor I sat on the trolley gently rocked myself back and forth thoroughly shattered as QBG lounged on the chair Our hands were grubby from the manual lifting but we were finally done We still had no idea if our plea for clemency from BHIT was the real reason for Rolands absence but were glad of the break The last laptop completed its imaging process as I struggled to my feet After loading the correct user profiles we loaded the last box onto the trolley We turned the lights out on the IT cupboard as we rolled out the door which clanged loudly echoing through the lifeless corridor as the electronic lock whizzed sealing the cupboard with a tomblike finalityAs I pushed the trolley towards the mail room again filled top to bottom with our efforts the conversation turned to the conference next week Angies plan of having a support presence seemed unnaturally forwardthinking yet seemed to be yet another construct of some great demonstration of incompetence We had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another  machines to image as reps waited QBG and I had also realized that our unanticipated teambuilding time had come to an end a valuable insight we would have never gotten had Angie not interfered in the way that she did But mired with her constant micromanagement we were glad it was all over  for nowAnother Monday morning The rain and sleet smacked my windscreen as I could only think of the same old mantra I hate Mondays ITS had arrived early at the conference centre to set up Our Support booth spanned four tables which had been strewn with all manner of Supportrelated paraphernalia It looked like someone had raided some longforgotten box of promotional material which now served to entice passers by A sizable gazebo stood behind the dubiously supported makeshift tables housing the secondary support areaWhen I arrived I found Angie midlecture as some helpdesk underling borrowed for the purposes of the day had met her disapproval in some way Her shrill demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the waiters and waitresses igniting several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates Angies constant barking continued up until our official open time of am at which time she scarpered to makenice with some apparent acquaintances It always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so seamlessly when interacting with anyone who wasnt well usAlmost as soon as the hall opened our first delegate arrived at the Helpdesk brandishing a very familiar laptop bag The delegate bore all the hallmarks of a vintage salesman his suit was worn distended around his stomach which showed obvious patronage to many miles behind his repmobile on motorways Placing the bag on the table he stressed with a clear but jovial tenor voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with itI ushered him into the back of our support area Our IT setup seemed to impress him The Ghost Server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations demarked with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their prospective tenants Its like mission control in here the delegate quipped With a confirmatory laugh he added We have lift offThe delegate presented his laptop As I hooked it up he withdrew a shabby bluecovered notebook filled with scribbling bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit Peering through the frames of his rounded spectacles he declared that he had a number of problems He reeled off each entry on his list as though sermonising from his blue notebook The software though it could open was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which though meant nothing to me meant the world to a marketing guru such as this man It also seemed to failed to synchronise in any way with the central database While scanning through the laptop I had also noticed McAfee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of MS OfficeThe realization that Roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real This was polarized by the sight near the helpdesk tables at  The queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall all said the same thing The rickety tables seemed the final barricade on the front lines as reps brandishing the same laptop bags came to voice their ailsTensions ran high as the word spread among the queuing reps IT had blown it theyd screwed the pooch and messed up bigtime Dissent spread quickly into the queue Our borrowed Helpdesk guy was buckling He was illequipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation I relieved him with the instruction to find Angie In the meantime all we could think to do was accept laptops back enmasse and deal with the fallout laterThe rear support area filled as some  machines lay piled as portrait of the enormous blunder Angies eventual reappearance was complemented with another bout of her ranting and raving despite her inability to offer another solution she stormed off in anger leaving us to somehow organise transportation of  laptops back to head office Two sales and marketing managers also appeared demanding explanations and reasons for this mother of all fuckups Our borrowed helpdesk guy and I loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office Our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing The rain reverberated off the large metal hulk of the van only dampened by the cloth of the soft laptop bags The only thing to look forward to now was another drenching skirmish through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cellsPreviousPt A new

jon,57,2208,1ambp1,1854,Its Monday morning I am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear Im usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by Thursday eveningFriday morning at latest However thanks to BMFH our longstanding policy known to all department heads of IT requiring  weeks notice of any new starter so we can obtaining and set up new gear is summarily binned Of course I find this out Friday evening and need to scrounge up four new laptops and get Vodafone to live up some SIM cards double quick for delivery Monday morningIm literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room Ive had no time for tea or coffee yet Im expecting salvation from a sympathetic coworker at any minute Still best foot forward I meet my delegates with my usual optimistic smile and my welcome aboard handshake Only the air is about to darken The familiar stench of putrid an old woman with too much perfume enters the room She walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman Out of the corner of my eye I see the young woman attempt small talk to no availI get started and Im giving a brief introduction to the Company IT I cant help be but distracted by the icy stare of BMFH piercing me like a lazer As I duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates she watches my every move as I dart around the room ensuring everyone gets a new toy Laptops in bags phones and chargers in the pocket its a little like Christmas morningIn my haste to get my lateattendees set up it seems Ive inadvertantly packed the wrong chargers in by mistake After bringing it to my attention before I could get a word out BMFH hops to her feet to investigate the situation Holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me she silences the room with an authorative Well Before even being able to offer either explination or promises to make amends she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door with Come with meAfter a solid dressing down I walk BMFH down to the stock room where she watches me hunt around in a spares box for any combination of phone and charger that would fit After rejecting my first three finds as unsuitable due to being slightly scuffed she demands I instead use my company blackberry as suitable replacement Rather than enduring her wrath any further I oblige kitted with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly customised toy of awesomeWe reenter the room like a freshly scolded schoolby I duly hand over the blackberry to noobie who feels mixed between Oooh awesome this is better than that rubbish Nokia you tried to give me and instant pity as she totally knew what just happenedEndeavouring to continue the induction my noobie starters felt compelled to keep any and all kitrelated questions to bare minumum Not the most ideal situation Im sure youll wager By the way where is that coffeeWe make it to  BMFHs face looking like shes gnawing her teeth more and more throughout the session Salvation the facilities lady arrives with delegates lunch and coffee Blimey I need a coffeeYeah BMFH has other ideas We break for lunch Im making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies  a standard tactic in making them feel comfortable with support The queue for the coffee jug disipates and I walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup Just as I pick the cup up BMFH appears by my side She again orders me outsideShe starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only though no its not Its been SOP for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to chinwag talk shop correct any misunderstandings whatever However new policy as of right now I need to return to my desk where BMFH will watch me complete some meandering tasks she has for me My coworkers are initially confused by my presence when I should be in induction but on seeing the redfaced snaggletoothed hellhound quickly understandShe insists we look at the queues well Ill look at the queues shell randomly point to various call tickets and demand why they havent already been dealt with This carries on for the next  minutes after which I mention I need to get back to the induction For one glorious moment I thought I may have been off the hook as BMFH began wagging her finger at another lowly employee who had dropped a mouse on the floor Back upstairs half the delegates have gone missing It seems that our departure to some had signified the conclusion of the induction A frantic runaround the various departments and  minutes later we were a full team againStill no coffeeMaintaining my professional demeanour against all odds I politely carry on with CRM and best practices The CRM training goes down like a slow slaughter Every step requires clarification courtesy of BMFH like shes picking out every little thing and reexplaining it to the group A one hour segment turns into a two hour bloodbath and everyone has just run out of happy Best practises I cover in  seconds with Theres a laminated card in your laptop bag about best practices password lengths etc Read it good luckAfter the delegates have left BMFH decides to reel off at me what a terrible job Ive just done and how if this is how inductions are performed its no wonder IT Support are a joke OK Ive had enough Three days of this b Monday morning no coffee shes on her fourth cup I react I just said Firstly it would have gone a lot easier if you hadnt had landed me with four delegates I wasnt expecting needing me to run around and scour kit up from somewhere Secondly this is not indicative of how inductions are usually run at all And I resent your opinion that the support department is a jokeOh no you ditintShe exits with a calm and collected look yea OK I know it Im fkd now And where is my damned coffeeThe Coffee I ran into Mr SureIllBringYouACoffee no good lying git coworker who I thought had my back I just said Dude you said you were going to My sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the mornings proceedings After helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together he had taken my cup from my drawer filled it with some lovely hot brown coffee and was on his way upstairs BUT unbeknownst to him he was being hunted As he turned for the stairs the BMFH had towered in front like a blackclad SS officer standing in front of a little girl in a pink dress Demanding to know where this coffee was headed this was where she had learned of the IT Induction In between dressing down my colleague for Godknows what and observed him as he duly tipped away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher she had decided that she had to be a part of this inductionAs I left for work that evening I knew I had incurred the wrath I knew something was coming What I dont know more of the same My job Us ITers are very dispensible My thoughts only revolved around one thing I need to get my

jon,50,2299,1amlsr,1840,I arrived for work the next day this time fulfilling my mornings requirement for coffee before leaving the house I was on the late shift so I could afford the luxury of adding breakfast For some reason I was unpreterbed by the events yesterday offered I arrived to find a deathly quiet IT department Sadly I had begun to expect this when Angie had imparted her usual words of wisdom on some poor unsuspecting fool I duly logged into my PC fired up TouchPaper and began the arduous task of setting up some appointments for the day I was surprised to hear a new type of noise from Angies direction Rather than the snarling voice of Satan demolishing yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare there was banter and the sound of humans talking I looked over to see Angie discussing in depth the virtues of a nearby starbucks with some Finance Hag On the one hand we were all pretty shocked that Angie seemed to be demonstrating a more human side to her character Though given her affiliation with Finance hagSee IT Support and Finance were situated directly next to each other Some time ago we had all been segregated into offices beautifully adorned with departmental monikers which happily contained our respective messes and existances At some point some middle manager in a fit of synergetic genius decided to implement an entirely openoffice strategy and had all walls removed As far as I can see it served to merely underpin the adage of good fences make good neighbours and that destroying the efficiency of Aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensionsFinance had repeatedly become irritated with ITS occasionally walking through their area as they would usually have varying currencies hanging around for traveling business reps  it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk  and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us Really  IT Support does not suit open office especially next to Finance hagsSuffice it to say there had previously been a blowout and IT Support were mandated by up on high to keep a three desk distance from any Finance team members a problem as they were forever encroaching on our space with temps filing systems and new layouts meaning we had to constantly move and shrink Simiarly they had enforced a threepiece rule whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time As the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying projectorhome routerprinter Our constant commandering of any postroom space and the need to create a PCden in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation IT Support really was in the company Though our jobs were now more difficult in that we had to maintain a presence outside whilst actually getting to work in a cupboard was a constant struggle we all remained cooperative and chipper in our existances Nevertheless Angie was evidently on first name terms with Finance wench With pleasantries exchanged off they set to the local coffee emporium to embark on their selfmade challenge of attempting every single combination of coffee type they could think of  not forgetting the ominous stare at support personnel as she passedFinally The coast was clear  we could take a breath Being the last one in my colleagues were quick to ask Jon have you read your email yet Well no actually and there it was Retribution the storm of the BMFHs reign was upon us Angie had decided that during the course of the day she would be performing ticket reviews on an individual basis MiddleAged Family Guy MAFG was on the early shift He had obviously already been the meat grinder Angies special treatment Of course we were now fixated on his response to find out what went down It soon became clear when he relented and maximised his IE window to reveal several Jobserve results Wow it went that well thenMAFG wasnt a slacker not by a long shot In fairness there were slackers but he wasnt one And it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales He began to tell us how Angie had spun her web She had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets She had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases until launching into an allout pincer move to demonstrate terrible goings on within his daily work This invariably was forcing him to reopen old tickets she was dissatisfied with despite no suggestion from the customer of that being the caseThats when it hit me As he talked about the meeting the fact that things were printed Angie has no idea where the printers even are the fact that she was able to search the ticketing system for tickets at all its obviousThere is a mole thats all there is to it someone here is working against us all Someone had to have provided Angie with a method of retrieving closed tickets Someone has to have shown her how to use the printer The cloud of suspicion was very much there I knew it and I could sense maybe some others knew as well Is there a traitor in our midst After our team postmortem of Angies impact to date we were left deflated and totally unmotivated We returned to stare into the bleakness of the computer monitor hoping that salvation lay within I duly opened my Outlook calendar Sure enough Jon tickets review at  right at the start of my designated rotad lunch breakOK Angie you foul smelling b its on ,The B Manager from Hell Pt Undercurrents,4139,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,472,2286,1b2mf7,1832,So did this really happenYes This is an asaccurate as I remember account of a bitch manager from hell that I endured over a  month period The story indicates a much shorter timeline but I only have time for so much writing In reality Angie micromanaged to death several ITS initiatives cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person All of this led to her ultimate er promotionHow many parts are there going to beTo be honest I had no idea when I started writing how many parts there would be I just started initially thinking  parts at most As I found people started enjoying it I just wrote more In truth Angie was such a nightmare that if I took to time to recount every single thing she did there would have been near on  parts At some point given I have other commitments to adhere to this needed to end sadly I decided to steer my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of Angies reign Are you a writerNope Not professionally Ive never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this novelistic before Ive been writing lyrics for years and used to trying to fit syllables to beats restrained to only a few available lines to get the point across I play metal though  so like anyone cares about the lyrics so long as theres a few cleverly picked crowd pleasing lines RESPECT  WALKI suspect he is in reality BritishYep sorry about that Why didnt you just quitIt had been my third IT Support role In reality theres no such thing as a nice IT Support role Theyre all disturbingly hostile places to be and I would urge anyone to get out as soon as possible its a slow suicide by telephone My take on IT Support is that it is the one area thats simple to get into but difficult to dig out of Managers like Angie are just all too common in this field If I had just quit as I managed to prove to myself when I did change jobs moving from one deadend support role to another resolves nothing Its just the same thing different placego to her boss Explain how shes impacting negatively on productivity and on your teams mental healthThere is such a thing as crapping in your own back yard No upper manager wants to be bothered by some troublemaking runt from some lowend support role going on about how much he hates his boss Its a fast track out the door I can assure youThe BBC should just go ahead and turn these into a showHahaha I am open to offersI would have flipped my desk and said fck it Im done I am amazed with your amount of patience throughout this matterI was brought up to be very patient But the fact I had a mortgage to pay a car to keep running various other responsibilities I couldnt be that flippant about it  I dont understand why the entire department doesnt walk out That would get the attention of Angies superiorsThis is a rather Hollywood ending but the reality is everyone has bills to pay Id wager such a bold move would fall foul of its forerunner when this reality would dawn on everyone In truth we were all jobhunting though  secondsDo I owe you a new spring for your F keyI love you JonAwww shucksIf this series ends up with a treefiddy joke ill be both angry and impressedYou dont know how tempting this was to put up  even for just five minutes Though I hope it didnt end that way for youSo just to be clear this all took place in the midlate s and jon was  at the time correctIts safe to say I was about  and this was around  I dont want to say much more than this though anonymity and allHow does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jonOdd But Im pleased I provided such entertainment  and I hope I didnt get anyone in trouble with their bossesI feel like Chelle at the beginning of Portal  All that hard work and the feeling of victory at escaping the inhuman clutches of GladOs only to find yourself back in the pits of hell once more The evil thing is still alive and kicking and youll have to deal with her all over againLuckily I never crossed paths with her at all after that But its the one big lesson of the corporate world Credit travels up blame travels down The higher you are the harder it is to fallGuys guys We got to the end We did itWe sure did my large diversion from doing coursework has also suffered Im envisaging a very hard Easter weekend ahead to catch up But Ive enjoyed writing for you guysMisogyny loses my sympathyI would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women For one theyre lots of fun  OK I admit I had to google misogyny The correct British vernacular is male cheuvanist pigJoking aside I feel an explanation may be required to this line of questioning My account describes the situation endured by all at that time I tried to paint a picture of the characters involved as best I could Where you can define your own definition I would welcome you to do so In some cases my brief description of quiet blonde girl should be enough for you to paint your own picture However Angie and her gang were such an uncommon abnormal collection I felt that to not describe their mannerisms and neurosis would have done them an injustice Similarly Rolands ratlike appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him BHIT I think was also subject to rather unrelenting description Ive had some excellent female colleagues managers and so forth so I would hate for it to be assumed I have a problem with women in power

wonderweirdo,230,575,159g16,1818,So heres one I thought you all might get a kick out of  A new guy started in my office a week ago  He sits in the cube next to mine hes a vet and has served in Iraq and Afghanistan  I think hes a nice guy kind of laid back for someone who just got out of a war zone  He seems to know his stuff fitting in nicely  Well Today Im sitting in my cube its after  PM which is considered after hours for most of our clients  This is important because in some cases if we have to escalate an issue it wont be attended to until the next business day especially for one of our clients that has a no exception policy for some crazy reason  With the Holiday Weekend that means something coming in tonight wont be addressed until at least WednesdaySo Im sitting there wrapping up a ticket and I hear him catch a call  He reads the script for our crazy client No exceptions and starts troubleshooting with the caller  I hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket  He tells the caller that given the holiday weekend he may not hear back for at least four days  Just then I can hear the client screaming at him on his head set  I stand up and I look at him hes sitting there cool as a cucumber fiddling with a Rubiks cube while this caller screams at him  He casually tells the caller this Please Ive been in Iraq and Afganistan  Ive had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years  Raising your voice to me like that will not get your issue attended to any faster  I can put in an email to the head of the level  department but if he decides you have to wait until Wednesday theres nothing more I can doThe caller seemed to calm down and my coworker just smiled Thats alright Ill send that email now  Have a nice dayI learned something very important today you dont know how bad youve got it unless youve had your life on the line makes the stuff Ive had to put up with seem so trivial now  That and its possible to be a hardcore bad ass and still be polite and maintain your dignity ,Ive been to Iraq you dont scare me,2393,TalesFromTechsupport

ZaphodB,404,723,zd5g1,1800,Several years ago I was running a  to  at a K school in the US   to  deployments mean every high school kid gets a laptop  I was managing  Macbooks and  servers as well as  or so Mac desktops at the time   One day my boss calls me and the conversation goes like thisBoss  Hey Zaphod we have a serious issue and you need to address it right nowme  OK boss what is this serious issueBoss  Your coworker DerpdaDerpalot printed out the master password list for the local admin accounts and left it on his desk and a student stole itme  Grrrrreeaaat  So basically I need to reset  local admin passwords like right nowBoss Yes drop whatever youre doing and do it NOWme  No problem boss I will have it fixed with in the hourI hang up the phone whip up a script in bash to reset the local admin password but I make one fatal mistake in my haste  I forget to output everything to devnull so everything goes to standard output ie the systemlog  My mistake under pressure plus I thought no way a high school kid knows Unix   I find this out fix the script redirect all output to devnull and the password in the script stops getting logged  So the password is on clear text but only on several hundred machines  OK no problem I am going to send a command out to wipe the systemlog file and clean up my mess  Since to change the password I had to set a password in a script  This was back in like  and lets say now my scripting behavior is a bit different now  During this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file  Somehow picked out a string he thought looked like a password and bam he had local admin access to the machines   So I start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system  Basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does touch another file to stamp it with a dummy receipt and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts   Sure enough this one students user account was synchronized to a lot of Macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to adminI gathered my evidence called the student into my office  Socially awkward kid but actually quite brilliant  I asked him why he was violating the AUP acceptable usage policy and that I had proof he was giving himself admin rights  He broke immediately  I didnt even have to threaten the kid  He spilled his beans I asked him if he pulled the password form the log he said yes  I asked him if he had ever used Unix before he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly  I told him I wasnt going to turn him in and that I will just forget the incident ever happened  He asked me why and I said youre too smart to get expelled or suspended  However you need to take your brain and use it constructively  What do you want to learn the most on the computer  He said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in Python  Next week I rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a Compaq dual XEON server with a RAID  controller and  hard disks in it and like  or gigs of RAM  It was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal government am I right and they had been sitting there since I started working there so about  years had passed and those servers had been collecting dust   They had no OS on itI come into his building with the server on a flat bed  I said here is your development server  Here are the rules  You cannot plug this into our network my network manager will shut this box down immediately do you understand   Yes he replied  Second rule this server has no OS on it so you must choose what OS you want to put on it and you have to support it yourself  You cannot call help desk for help and it has to be legit either open source or someone buys an actual license  I understand he said years later the kid graduates and gets a full ride to Boston College  he also wrote the advanced math curriculum his senior year  He did a bunch of stuff in Python and LaTeX  Oh I also turned him into my mole  Every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do   I havent talked to him since but I bet by now he is graduated  Pretty smart kid hope he succeeds  Him getting expelled or suspended or even in trouble may have damaged his record which may have damaged his chances at a full scholarship  Mind you I was working for an impoverished school district a lot of families in that district were below poverty level  EDIT  fixed formattingSometimes it is good not being the iron fist ruling over authoritative dick head system administrator but sometimes you gotta do that to get your point across  I was lucky enough to realize the situation and actually put this kids smarts to productive use  I hope he has a bad ass job right nowEDIT Several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops  Let me explain to you how budgeting works in public education  The state you live in sets a budget and according to your size and your location you get X amount of dollars every year  Now additionally you can get federal money as well on top of state money  The budget is then broken down into categories  You have budget for staff which covers their wages benefits and so forth  Capital Outlay is the part of the budget you spend on technology desks renovations and so forth  It cannot be used for salary the government does not allow you to do so  Furthermore the government has a thing called eRate which I believe is regulated by the FCC   It forces companies who join such a program to lower their prices for schools and allows schools access to technologies through this program   The school I worked for which I no longer do work there decided they wanted to go  to   With Macbooks being about  a pop it wasnt too much out of the question  You only have a little bit of savings with a desktop since you must also pay for keyboards mice and monitors and they require more power  A laptop is  plug   The school was about  buildings and  students  The laptop program was at the high school level only which was You have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school  I grew up lower middle class and I thought I had missed out on certain things in life and that I was a bit under privileged compared to all the other kids I went to school with  I didnt realize how selfish and self centered I was until I got this job  I worked there for  years running their laptop program  I got a bike for Christmas and while my family was unable to ever take me on international vacations or cruises we at least got to go to the lake for vacation  These kids have nothing  It taught me how privileged I was  Giving them a laptop is awesome  Sure some kids will squander their opportunities and not care sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it but some kids will put it to good use and get full scholarships to good colleges and come out on top   That right there makes it completely worth itEDIT It is possible the kid read this post  I am not going to say who my employer was or where it was because I believe anonymity is the best   I would hate to have anything backlash and reflect poorly on the school system I worked at   Plus now I work back in the private sector and have learned it is really just a professional courtesy to keep your mouth shut   I will update if it was really him   UPDATEThe student in question has in fact found this thread and I have been messaging him via reddit   I have told him I wont reveal his name my name or the schools name for anonymity reasons  I think it is best kept that way  He also reminded me of a few other exploits the students found and used which I forgot about   The ARD Agent bug Apples fault which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges ie sudo   Then we had a package that had a self healing auto update and I had to have one folder in that package writable bad developer and we managed application usage by file path  So once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did   To remedy this I switched off the write bit in POSIX and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just redeployed said packageIll have to admit I was impressed by how adaptive and smart a few of the students were    They made me pay for my mistakes  Plus it is impossible to test every aspect of security with out a security audit team  That is why companies have and contract out IT security people to audit such things   I also changed my whole approach of imaging and managing the Macs after a lot of these issuesThe student in question is finishing up a computer engineering degree currently   Glad he made it to a good school,When a student hacked our schools

paracelsus,313,620,1j7rcf,1761,Many of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users shortsighted bosses and basically anything that arises from working in an industry where nobody else really understands what you do I thought Id share a different sort of story  the only time I really wasnt sure what to do ethically Im still not completely sure I handled this properly but screw it Im not going to bother with a throwaway I had several clients I supported longterm to the point where I almost became another employee These were engineering firms and while they didnt understand all the technology they understood the value of preventative maintenance taking care of equipment and the IT itself was typically pretty lowstress Some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers which is how this story starts Im at one of my best clients and their senior engineer a man in his s approaches me Ive known him for years and even met his family at a few company functions He has a few daughters and a son  all in their s and s Heres how the conversation went My son has recently passed away and Id like you to help recover some of his files  Sir Im very sorry for your loss What can I do to help When going through my sons estate the most recent copy of his will which was updated about  years ago has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend and not to anyone in the family We found some files on his laptop we cant open and thought they might have some clues as to why he made this decision  maybe a journal or something We always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why hed disinherit us The friend seems just as surprised  Sure Ill be glad to take a look at it although depending on the security there might not be anything Im able to do Im thinking TrueCrypt etc  No problem  whatever you can doSo I get the laptop and go home When I power it up I see in CProgram Files are the files in question ArchiveRAR ArchiveRAR etc through about  or  Someone had obviously been doing some digging  who the hell checks program files for RAR files Anyway they vary in size from say GB to GB Try to open them up  and of course password protected As RARs are known for their rigorous security I figure Ill have this job done in  minutes or less I grab some random RAR password decryptor and get the password I open the files and  theyre all filled with  gay porn Most of it is pretty vanilla but theres a little bit of light bondage and watersports No journals personal files or anything else  just porn As I work my way through archives  and  I realize that the file names are all now John and I doing X  not the names youd see from a porn site Great So as I realize that Im looking at the amateaur porn of a dead man who was obviously in the closet to everyone  it dawns on me The friend was really the boyfriend which is why he was named in the will and for whatever personal reasons the son  boyfriend dont feel comfortable coming out to the guys father even in death Nows probably a good time to mention that Im only  at the time and that I also happen to be bisexual I was completely in the closet at the time I still am to my family So now instead of dealing with a simple file recovery Im faced with lying to an important client about his dead son or outing a dead son and boyfriend  with photographic evidence Fuck I decided Id pull the laptops drive and search for deleted files in the off chance the son had a note or journal or letter to his dad that might somehow help the situation I found nothing helpful  it seemed that his computer was solely for web browsing  online banking  porn Nothing helpful at all Fuck I thought about it for a while and decided that the boyfriend was fully capable of disclosing this information if he chose to and that the son obviously wanted this information secure and that it wasnt my place to disclose it However this still left me in a tricky situation with the father I couldnt tell him Sorry I wasnt able to open the files because hed simply find someone else who could and might not be as discreet as me Somewhere down the line the boyfriend and son would still be out and the father would know the homegrown porn existed No I had to lie about it in such a way that the father would be satisfied and not pursue the issue I pick up the phone  Hello Its Paracelsus Ive got some news REALLY Did you find anything A journal notes anything at all No I was able to decrypt the files and I could see why your son wanted to keep them secure It turns out that he had downloaded some bootleg software and movies off the internet Its not a big deal but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer so youd want to keep them protected Id suggest deleting them or at least not trying to open them  Ah that makes sense My son was always really good with computers and I could see him messing around with stuff like that Thank you for letting me know  the last thing Id want to do is try and open them and mess up his computer You didnt find anything at all Paracelsus No sorry I even ran a fulldrive search for deleted files just in case there was something in another location I didnt really find any personal files at all Wow thats thorough Thank you for doing that How much do I owe you Oh considering the

thesistergeek,437,803,15n4do,1738,Sorry if this isnt strictly tech support but seeing as it plays a large factor I thought it was relevantBackground Im still in college  My soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me and since my credits oddly transfer to whatever communication program exists in the world Im looking for jobs for both of us somewhere out of the American South  Ive worked tech support for my dads consulting business and all his clients since I was knee high and while Ive never been IT it was what everyone called meI freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school which is about as difficult as youd think it is as in not really at all  Older computer illiterate people just dont understand the internet but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help  I have a rate that turns out at about hr depending on how much of my help they need  Because I work in a lot of really teeny businesses I often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side  Im very accustomed to genuinely confused clients and bossesToday a small marketing firm out of a major New England city called me for a phone interview  Everything had been going really well and I had spoken to them several times  We even had a time set up for an inperson interview in March when I would be in town  The employees Id dealt with were super nice and there had been no red flags up to this pointId actually become rather close with a specific guy who Id talked to and emailed multiple times over the last few weeks and who I know is a redditor  Well call him Geoff  I had his extension number and his personal email addressThe person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else Id dealt with  He sounded like a late s smoker who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant  He starts giving me scenarios asking how Id respond to them  Really weird things like If one of our clients made cupcakes that killed one out of every three customers how you would respond to that  Every time after the second sentence of my response he cuts me off saying Ok thats enough sweetheartAfter about  minutes of this he suddenly asks Do you know anything about resetting wireless routers  We really need someone to do that  We just had to fire our IT guy because he kept messing up  Lying bastard anyway would always clear his internet history  You dont do that do you  Because only liars do thatI spent a couple of seconds in complete silence wondering what the hell I just heard  I eventually said Yes I do know a good bit about networking setups  What seems to be the issueHe then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network so that he knew his employees werent liars  He had also installed security cameras so that he could see how much they were taking breaks  I needed to be OK with thatI also helped him install a wireless mouseNow he was speaking REALLY loud  I had to turn down the volume all the way on my phone and still had to hold it away from my earBy now I was sort of scared that the employees didnt know about any of this  I decided to stall telling him that was going to have to talk to my fiance and see if the dates lined up for when he first needed me  I obviously wasnt taking the job  He wanted me to start as soon as possibleI got off the phone and immediately called Geoff  I asked him if hed heard any of that  He confirmed that he had heard everything and that no one had been aware of what was going on  Hed checked his processes and there it was a keylogger as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything hed done during the entire day into a file on his bosss PCHe told me hed call me back  He had to call a lawyer then quitHe called me back later and told me the entire office did just that   people  Theyre starting their own firm and have invited me to join once they get on their feetThe owner had died a year or so ago and this guy had bought the business  His previous job  Head of sales for a sofa making companytldr  Big Brother is revealed in a phone interview entire office quits edit Just got a text again from Geoff  Though he didnt give me any information on how his boss was doing it apparently he was recording every phone conversation in the place and saving it without notifying anyone including the person on the other end  There had also been some discrepancies with pay with half an hour being taken off somehow or being made to work an hour longer  Apparently even though most were salaried he had been docking their checks for EVERY MINUTE spent on nonworkrelated activities  Theyre hoping they can sue him just on the phone conversations alone,On how I got an entire office full of people to quit  All because I had a phone interview,2541,TalesFromTechsupport

store Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close The players And yes the details are important TSV me a  size  chick Darren customer easily  muscled guy Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit shaved head etc Guys biceps are as big as my headJeff Coworker playing captain of the ship in the tech area The game Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correctSo Im doing my thing fixing user error issues the occasional software restore and so on Oddly quite for a Sunday But whateverJeff hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I couldTSV whats upJeff got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it No appointment TSV sure Bring him onJeff brings over big guy Huge guy from my POV I firmly invite him to grab a seat as its the only way I can look him in the eye for those that dont read my retail stories Im partially deaf so half my hearing is lip readingTSV hi Im TSV Dude Darren Not real friendly but not pissy toneTSV Nice to meet you Darren Jeff tells me your phone was broken sorry to hear that Lets get you set up with a new one Okay yeah this is how the company makes us talkDarren kind of nods pulls out the phone Now this model has a glass front and back Both are shattered Total spider web He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it wont turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red Yeah its dead time to bury this dogTSV I need to take this in the back for just a moment okayDarren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like hes about to bawl Over a phone WTF  So I make quick work of going to the back popping the back off the phone get the serial and look up the warranty and part I put the phone back together as best I can pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off Back to the floor I goTSV Okay Darren I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have warranty thing so a replacement is just  Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since its on the SIM card I have you out of here in just a few minutes Darren okay pulls out his wallet and hands me cash What about my numbers and photos and stuff Can you get those TSV I hate this part it never goes well unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and wont power on so theres no way for us to retrieve any informationI brace myself for the yellingDarren my wife is going to kill me Shes an ex Seal Shes good at killing people when she needs to Shes going to cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush Mostly directed at himself Some at the universe in generalDarren Im an idiot She told me to back up the photos She said folks phones get stolen in Vegas all the time She kept nagging me so I said I did it Shes going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his sin and Im the priest Hes not yelling or anything so okay Ill listen Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend Its not uncommon as we are in LA You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain Now why was Darren so flipping out It wasnt over the phone but the data See Darren was the generally happy father of a baby boy A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party How nice etc But before he left Mom had reminded him to back up the photos the only photos of Darren Jr to the computer in case something happened to his phone She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered And yes Darren told his wife he did it And now she was going to kill him Having seen Darren Im a tad worried about a woman hes scared ofNow our company has a backupsync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly I figure whats the harm in checking if he had it on Theres a part of it that does save photos although its not on by default I dont tell poor Darren about it because I dont want to get his hopes up Darren finally out of steam oh well its my fault Time to face it like a manTSV thats the spirit Your wife will be mad but Im sure she loves you and will forgive you after a lot of grief of course this actually gets a chuckle And hes only a few weeks old you have plenty of time for taking more photosDarren yeah not quite convinced hes not a dead manI ring him up for the phone power it on Get to the screen for him to log in At this point he just thinks hes setting up the new phone like normal And what to my wondering eyes do appear But a backup made the night before his trip TSV well thats interesting Theres a backup listed in our system for your phone Last updated Thursday nightDarren I dont remember doing thatTSV you probably set it up when you first got it That was months ago so its easy to forgot Plus it runs on its own so you dont have to do anything other than plug your phone into power It might just be contacts and notes But why dont we try it Cant hurtDarren okay if you think we shouldTSV knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are I do Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloadedDarren hey all the apps I had are thereTSV waiting to download but it knows what to getDarren if it knows that could it have my photosTSV lets lookHe taps the gallery app Darren those are my photos Old photos Wait those arent as old Those are THE photos You saved my photos You saved my life Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me Remember hes got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process I thought my LP guy was going to explode Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldnt have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back He thrusts his hand out to shake mine Darren you just saved my life Literally My wife is an ex Seal TSV so you said Im glad it worked out Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home Darren yeah I learned my lesson Im never lying to my wife again TLDR guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water Had lied to wife about them being backed up I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didnt know he had set up man vows never to lie to wife again My job is done ,Never lie to your wife,2374,TalesFromTechsupport

jon,393,2325,1b2k7r,1689,Weeks came and went another month slipped by unnoticed A new support manager had appeared Young new and inexperienced his often rash decision making seemed reminiscent of Angies vicious and brutal idea of management though it seemed driven by immaturity rather than vindictiveness We continued to exist in the knowledge that there was nobody who would be like our first ITS manager But thankfully nobody like Angie either I had two major projects after Angies departure I was in the midst of successfully redeploying the laptops complete with fully working software However it became apparent in the days subsequent to her finding out that Angie had opened administrative access to AD to the entire Helpdesk As you can well expect our sparkling and carefully maintained AD structure now had contradictory group policies login scripts which went nowhere and more phantom accounts and objects than I think we would ever finally sort out It was if Angie had left me a parting gift a final fuck you from the Queen of Aggression Its twopronged effect seemed unintentional given her ineptitude But it had encroached on every single user in the company as their login times grew exponentially together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privilegesIt was getting to be the hottest summer Ive ever known in Britain I still hadnt taken time out to wash my Mondeo its recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth The grime that lay affixed to the bonnet and wings seemed an apt punishment for depriving me of yet another wage check Arriving back to the office from a wellearned summer pub lunch I walked towards the building across the car park As I passed a familiar Jaguar graced a VIP spot in the car park Sleek and shiny its black finish shone in the midday sun freshly polished and lovingly detailed Its congeniality seemed marred by the fact that Angie had once owned a car like this her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel I had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an OptiPlex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress Particularly this was one of the sales guys damsels in distress As I connected the machine back up he came out of his glassclad office for a chat Did you see your ex manager is back he grimaced I knew what he meant this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living The news that Angie was back seemed unpalatable Who Angie I questioned She got sacked didnt she The Sales Manager shook his head with a learned look People like that dont get sacked he explained I hung on his every word as if this was the most important lesson I would ever receiving in my life When someone like that is put into a particular position its usually because someone recommended her for it Someone put her there Jon If she had done well the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back But if she cocks it up theres no way theyre going to turf her out Whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a sling for recommending such a dud nobody would ever take them seriously ever againHe continued When people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that they get paid off They get promoted with a golden handshake just so someone above her can save face with the board Admitting failure isnt even on the menuDespising the obvious truth to his words I had to probe deeper Then who got the blame for all that then Well BHIT of course He was so close to retirement and he didnt really make much noise anyway People forgot he was there It was either him or you guys reallyI looked up from over the desk partition Across the cavernous office I could just about see the familiar twisted frame of Angie as she stormed with intent around a small section of desks her shrill and piercing tone somehow breaking through the human noise over the sound of printers phones and chatter Another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her both barrels I turned eager to continue this discourse however the Sales Manager had already retreated to his office He held his phone to his head as he clicked the door closed As the OptiPlex spun into life the Windows XP splash screen floated as if to stand testament to the spoils Who had really won here Well nobody it seems  As I struggled to think for a moral to the story I was interrupted by the returning damsel She thanked me for my time turning back to her work our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end

mrlithic,211,571,1h8z4b,1657,This happened a very long time ago when I worked for a very large organisation rd largest employer on the planet if that is a clue I worked for a National Group in this organisation and we had offices in every major city in the country One of the cities had a regional holiday and I had agreed to cover any local calls while the two IT Support guys took the day off I was not expecting much other than a few senior managers who had to catch up on work No calls had come through until about am when a senior member from this remote office telephone number came up Ive been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the printer he told me Not a problem I said I will remote into your machine and check it out myself  So I get onto his box and could see that someone had changed his printer to a networked one You are not printing locallyI am sorry he replied You are not printing to your local printer it has been changed to a printer on the network I changed it back to the one on his desk while I explained  You are printing to another printer in the country Oh he said and hung up really abruptly I did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rudeThe next call I got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices I did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only  staff This girl had started about a month before and this was her first job I think she still lived at home Hello is this IT Support She asked Yes it is My printer has not stopped printing this morningI was kind of expecting this call and so I told her not to worry and was about to say I knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me It wont stop printing ppporn she exclaimed She had trouble saying the word porn as if this was something bad that her parents had told her about It is pages and pages about mens things and their problems I am sorry what is it I asked Mens parts and them having difficulty with them She explained Erectile Dysfunction I asked I am not explaining this any more There are picturesWe have been hacked She yelled at me in quick succession  I calmed her down and told that I had stopped the printouts and that we would not be hacked again I guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared he had pressed print several more times He had tried to print over  copies of multiple articles The secretary left a short while later stating that she did not feel suitable for this position It seemed to have really rattled her EDIT Wow  Front page  Thanks He was not in a medical profession This stuff was strictly personal He came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later This was back when folks did not have home broadband I think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it until he remembered I never chased it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him I thought the fellow had suffered enough The offices were on opposite sides of the country roughly  miles apart The lass had left after this but I think other things were also affecting it She was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well Closeted schoolgirl to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks This probably did not help I have no idea what the pictures showed Use your imagination ,There is porn coming from my printer,2228,TalesFromTechsupport

deleted,105,449,1kijzn,1612,PositonDeploy Technician  Main duties were building the computer to the requested specs and delivering to the end user or to the machinery it was used to runCompanyBig Green tractor makerWe had around  various buildings with different IT equipment in them but the one that everyone dreaded goign into was the Foundry  If youve never been in a foundry they tend to involve a lot of activities like this httpwwwwalkerfoundrycomfoundryjpg and thishttpblogkenkamineskycomwpcontentuploadsKamineskyBlogInnsbruckGrassmayrBellFoundryjpg  Needless to say this was not our most favorite place to deploywell anything  The one redeeming factor there were the people  They fixed and madedo with whatever they had for as long as possible to help us out and we appreciated it  When they called for hardware they needed it  There was never a complaint from us about them requesting too many things as they used things to the last shred of usefulness was gone and THEN they called us  One of these fine people was Alex aka the Mad Russian  Alex was really a fun fun guy  Got work done but when things went wrong due to ineptitude or bad planning on someone elses part he let it be known  He also had the pull to make things difficult for anyone who crossed him so we usually went out of our way to keep him happyUsually  This is a story of what happened when we didntI was driving in the foundry to drop a computer off for a small office located just next to one of the hotter holes of hell located in the Foundry  I make my drop hook up and confirm it connects  All is good and grab the gator to leave and head back to that air conditioned office  I can see the door at the other end but then notice a  bald mids Russian standing directly in the middle of the inside driveway  No no for most people but not for him  Hell who would tell him to move  The following exchange occuredAlex Derp we need to talkDerp Sure how can I helpAlex Where is my printerDerp noticing this isnt the regular happy Alex Imnot sure I know  I dont handle the printers reallyAlex unimpressed with my lack of answers The printer I requested  weeks ago Ours broke beyond patching and we need it Quickly  PLEASE find out and get back to me ASAPI agree and speed back to the nerd cave we have on the other end of the site  I approach one of the more senior techs about this  He assures me he knows and is trying to do what he can to get it and that he will contact Alex  He does notifying Alex that due to restraints put in place by our contracted company terrible place by the way we had to wait for too many varying levels of approval  Alex understood he wasnt happy but he understoodNow Alex isnt dumb  He knows things such as hardware requests replacements etc are pretty low on the hierarchy of IT issues around there  The bigger issue we had was network security  The Wireless we had was strictly for laptops and they were hardcore at making sure it stayed that way  No personal phones corporate phones or personal laptopsanything not a business use laptop was allowed  When something not allowed connected it was noticed and that area was notified immediately  More than that the higher IT people were forced to deal with it look into it and update superiors on the issue etc  Massive email chains always erupted from thisThe very next day we get a high urgency ticket regarding network activity and an iPhone  Specifically someone attempting to logon with Alexs credentials through a phone  Emails were spammed Alex was contacted  The phone was disconnected from the network  As he had recently gotten the phone he was made aware and disconnected  He also became aware of just how serious this network intrusion seemed to beFast forward to the next dayAround  pm the following day the same thing happened  Emails Alex contacted phone disconnected from network ticket resolved  Again the following day it occurred  It started happening each and every day  Ignorance no longer a valid excuse this email roundabout was becoming a hassle for all those involved as it touched some pretty important IT mailboxes not to mention some higher ranking managers of the plant overall  Not soon after this first week of calculated attacks he stepped up his game   times a day he would connect his phone to the network  By the middle of the second week our IT broke  Literally Every other email seemed to be about why we couldnt keep the network secure  Why all these intrusions were happening  To the passive viewer of emails most higher ups who were CCd out of requirement all this looked like was a bad IT company not able to do their job  To us in the IT area it was pure genius  He couldnt get his printer in a reasonable time  Fine but to make up for it he would swamp the IT higher ups with so much grief and email that he would be impossible to ignoreFinally one of the higher IT people of our company called him directly  At first to berate him on his constant breach of wireless protocol  He left a stern voicemail and stood by in fake bravado as he told us it was handled  A call came in but as he was talking we were to listen and let it go to our department voicemail  When he finished he turned saw the missed call was Alex and put the phone on speaker before playing it  Obviously expecting it to be an apology but getting something much much differentVoicemail starts In a heavy Russian accent Im aware that Ive broken yourrules  I do not care  Ive waited Ive followed yourrules to get a printer for this area  You ignore me  Can you ignore me now  I want my printer clickThe bossman stands in silence not sure what to think  We all sit there doing our best not to laugh our asses off at his failed attempt at returning order to the land  If the situation wasnt perfect enough we all got an email as we sat there in stunned silenceIntrusion alert days later Alex got his printer  mad Russian  not anymore  TLDR Russian turns into cold calculating network abuser to convince IT higher ups to give him what he deserves,How the mad Russian broke IT,2061,TalesFromTechsupport

CanIGetaHellYeah,253,493,1q7ilu,1551,I was a new starter looking after a client we had taken over  months ago who where having lots of issues the CEO was concerned the old IT guy was still accessing the system I thought that was a bit crazy but strange things were happening account lockouts passwords changing services being disabled it really felt like something malicious was happening but I couldnt prove anything Then it happened One afternoon I was light on work so I decided to log into their system and have a poke around I log onto the terminal server look at active usersLogged in user  BackupHoly shit that didnt look right I bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old IT guy was currently working for We look at his IP and bingo reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work placeReset his password and displayed this message on his sessionTHIS IS AN UNAUTHORISED CONNECTION YOUR IP  HAS BEEN LINKED TO YOUR DOMAIN COMAU AND LEGAL ACTION WILL FOLLOWKnowing his session wasnt idle I let that sit for a nice  seconds so he could marinate in panic and fear then disconnected his sessionLogged in and opened Outlook and he had EVERYONES mailbox connected to his with full permissions we checked his sent items nothing  I hit recover deleted items and hey presto  months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself OR forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with  He is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantageHe had forwarded other emails that I had written to the CEO assuring him the old IT guy was not logging in remotely and he had added Haha these guys are fucking idiots they have no idea Cancelled another backup last night do you think they will figure it out  MoronsI could not believe what I was reading I simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected it was the most exciting IT work I have ever done in my life It was filled with justice and epic winsEpilogueThe CEO decided to get lawyers involved I provided them with every scrap of data I could find and they put together this intimidating  page document that included itemised lists of connection times showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system It stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not capitulate with the terms of the agreementThat document was delivered to him personally at his desk at am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at am He was escorted out of the building at amEdit Epilogue not prologueEdit II Answering some questions hereWhat happened to the girlThe CEO decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well not putting in sales orders in from people she didnt like deleting messages and saying they were never recieved and in one more serious incident she edited someones timesheet resulting in lost overtime She had to pay the back money owed and lost her job they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amountWhat where the terms and conditionsI wasnt privy to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several depositions in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues I think it was in the thousands not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was There was some provision about not working in IT I am not sure how legally that works but I believe he had to stay away from IT for  or  yearsYou arent an IT detective youre a big phonyYes when taking on a new client all password should be rotated and the entire system should be reviewed Unfortunately I had been working for the company for two weeks they took on the client six months ago I later determined that several factors went into why the system review wasnt done time and cost constraints but mainly laziness My coworkers had already looked into it and concluded that he wasnt logging in and told me a full password rotation was done later I discovered it was ONLY for real peoples accounts not service accounts When I was given management of the client account manager not IT helpdesk guy the CEO gave me a the full story and I began looking into it It should also be said that my job role was account manager I met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk their IT agreement and projects  I was not meant to do troubleshooting that was apparently for the helpdesk tier  The jobs that came through to the helpdesk backups cancelled account lockouts were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that All of this coalesced into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid I didnt accept that and found what I found Did I use any advanced techniques  No The guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it I am sharing this story because its interesting not because I think I am a detectiveWhat other evidence did you findHe was a prolific user of Lync and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read They had flashes of red hot anger swearing at each other like two drunks at a pub followed by pathetic apologies and disgusting make up flirting Constant bitching about others in the office I found that this woman would contact HIM to fix IT issues it explained why she was so hostile towards me when I met her in person Several incidents where he was attempting to fix something our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this inflamed the problems He had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook web management site of his personal domain some other weird forums Couldnt do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites the audacity and gall of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity The most disturbing of all though was the M Night Shyamalan twist when I discovered that the old IT guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go He had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him He also claimed to be logging in to check on things and make sure backups run that kind of thing quotes from emails he wrote He was sabotaging the system while pretending to fix things saying that if he wasnt logging in things would be so much worse The owner believed every word and met with him on several occasions to discuss how to deal with the situation  The CEO was furious upon this discovery and went to the other owners who decided to use this opportunity to push him out of the businessThanks for reading ,Old IT Admin couldnt let his little baby go things get

shwabob,309,533,1mle4z,1548,Greetings fellow support experts  Ive come to regale you with a tale of GREAT JUSTICEThis is a follow on to an earlier tale about a ridiculously stupid userowner that just doesnt have a clue what shes doing which you can read athttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsjdrpxhelpmehelpmeimnotonthenetworkAfter undergoing quite a great deal of hassle and headache associated with their migration to Quickbooks  the owners of Senior Corp finally came to the realization that they were ridiculously undermanned and overworked plus lacked real quickbooks experience to deal with their  contractors  So they decided to add a few heads to the operationAt the time they had  employees   workstations including Owner Ps server machine  They wanted to add  more stations and IntuitQB support advised that they would need a dedicated server for their Quickbooks data  something I had been suggesting for the better part of a year now yes I could conceivably have up to  stations with  pro but a server is clearly the way to go here  Since Owner P never listens to the IT guy but listens to QB support she now was onboard with me and Owner M that they needed to go with a dedicated serverhooraySo I spec out an inexpensive Lenovo server box with TB of RAID storage and Server R with  CALs  Plus  additional workstations identical to what they purchased earlier  They have no issues they order the stuff stuff delivers  All is wellOver a weekend I get the server in and set up move the data etc no problems at all backups are running and the only machine with any shares at all is the k box  SweetOwner P also requested a second monitor since User L has two hooked up her old nonHDMI monitor to the VGA port  So there was an extra monitor in there for Owner P since she needs to feel special P has her new p monitor set to x resolution BTWMonday evening Owner P starts texting me like crazy while Im at the gymgt WHERED THE QUICKBOOKS DATA GOgt HOW COME THE QUICKBOOKS ISNT IN MY DOCUMENTSgt I MOVED THE QUICKBOOKS FROM THE P DRIVE TO MY DOCUMENTSgt I CANT LOG IN TO QUICKBOOKS IT SAYS IT CANT FIND THE FILEgt YOU SCREWED EVERYTHING UP WITH THIS SERVER I WANT IT BACK THE WAY IT WASgt I CANT SEE MY QUICK BOOKS SCREEN THROUGH GO TO MY PCAt the same time User L emails megt P fd up the quickbooks somehow Can you unfk it when you get a minute  Also the vendor excel sheet is gone I think she fd that up tooI come home and prepare to VNC in to unfk the fk up before dinnerTurns out that Owner P did in fact move the QB data file and Vendor Excel file to her My Documents and her Desktopseveral times  I proceeded to undo the mess and put the files in the right place so User L and everyone else is working just fineAs Im wrapping up Owner P apparently GoToMyPCs into her machine and sees Ive done work  She proceeds to call my phone and thats when the sparks flewgt P OH THANK GOD YOUVE ANSWERED  Things are REALLY SCREWED UPgt Me  Well yes they would be since you moved the data file off the server where it belongs  You cant go moving the data filegt P  But it needs to be on MY PC IM IN CHARGE so it should be ON MY PCgt Me  Thats not how it works anymore  We have gone to a dedicated server nowany and all shared data needs to be on the servergt P  Thats not how I want itgt Me  Well thats how it is now  Your PC doesnt have any shared folders as it should so nobody else in the office can see the data on your computer  Anything that needs to be shared must be on the P drive anything you dont want shared should go in your Documents folder gt P  THATS SO STUPID  I SHOULD BE THE MASTER COMPUTER  MY COMPUTER SHOULD SHARE EVERYTHINGgt Me  No  You just spent X dollars on a server which does all that now for you just like Quickbooks and I recommended  You cant share with all the office PCs using just your computer remembergt P THATS BULLST  BUT FINE  I GIVE UP  DID YOU FIX THE THING AND WHY CANT I SEE MY QUICKBOOKS ON GO TO MY PCgt Me  Well its unfortunate you dont like it this way but its the way it has to be  As far as your GoToMyPC access it would appear that you have Quickbooks running on your second monitor  Did you switch monitors in GoToMyPCgt P  Switch monitors  What the hell is thatgt Me  You should be able to control what monitor youre looking at when using GoToMyPC  Im not sure what the control would look like I dont use GoToMyPCgt P  FINE  SO HOW DID YOU FIX THE MESSgt Me  I put the Quickbooks file and Vendor Excel file back in the appropriate locations on the P drive  Now everyone can access them and User L is already in the system remotely from home without any issuesgt P  How come I always have so many problems with Quickbooksgt Me  Well once everything is set up properly and the files are in the right place youre the only one that has problems P  L M and S never have problemsand every time you report a problem its due to you not opening the right file or something else that is only on your endgt P  ARE YOU SAYING I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOINGgt Me  No Im merely stating my observations from current and prior experiences  I believe you guys are hiring a new person thats a Quickbooks expert correctgt P

phlogiston,182,456,uaqs1,1494,I asked an old coworker if he remembered any good stories from our time as small network admins so I could share with Reddit  He said Remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and muddy and said you didnt want to talk about it  Its time to talk about it It began innocently enough  I received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and PCs  This was a newish Japanese restaurant in a declining part of town  This restaurant was the only business still afloat in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse  I walked in introduced myself to the nice Korean couple who owned the place and got to it  As I got down to business I was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbors son  I took this to mean Were used to paying  and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support  I was not surprised to find a lot of work to do but nothing out of the ordinary  The first complaint was the point of sale machine  It was unusually slow even considering the lackluster hardware  I could not bring it down as they were still checking out the last of the lunch rush  So I brought up msconfig and decided to see what I could disable and turn off  I remember going to the startup tab and thinking wow what a bunch of crap  Scrolling down Holy Cow  Scrolling down OK were turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on  After this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a reformat  For some reason the internet was still dodgy  I pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to Googlecom and let that run for a few minutes  When I came back I found high latency and lost of lost packets  No big deal well try to reboot the router and modem and see if that helps  So I asked what I considered a simple question Where is your router and modem  to which I received in answer a puzzled smile  They were not sure what I was talking about as they had only recently moved from dial up  OK time to switch gears  Who is your ISP  No idea  Who do you pay for internet access  Nobody  Apparently they used to pay for internet access but the teenager set them up with free internet  Big Red Flag was raised  This just got slightly interesting  I tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor  Similar story in the back office with the accounting machine  So I tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what I was looking for  I encountered the DDWRT password prompt  Thats cool  I prefer Tomato myself but weve got a tinkerer  A tinkerer who thinks its a good idea to change the default password for LAN access why  I point out the network cable to the owner and ask him if he knows where it goes  As he looked at me the room grew dark and foreboding  It got noticeably colder  The crawlspace  Im not sure what that cable goes but he took a whole box of cable into the crawlspace and then we had internet  OK can I call him I asked  No hes gone off to college  Thats why we hired you  A second later Im standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room shining my flashlight into a dark void  There is a dirt floor and it smells  An old stepladder is there but I dont trust it and just jump in with tools and laptop case in hand  My first thought was surprise at how big it was  My flashlight didnt reach the far two walls  It was a forest of concrete footings and steel supports  There was a lot of power conduit and water pipes to duck under but for the most part you had about  feet to stand up  It stunk like death and decay  I found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my trek  Do you remember the Aliens movie I forget which one where the guy is following candles in the dark hallways and there are monsters stalking him  This is what it felt like  I tell myself that it cant be that far because extension cords are only so long  At the end of the cord is another plugged into it then another plugged into that one  OK well at least they cant run Cat cable longer than  feet  Its quiet and stinks worse all the time  I keep thinking I hear something or multiple somethings moving around  Eventually I see green LEDs ahead of me and find a small network switch  The two network cables from the PCs plug into the switch which is powered by the extension cord and another cable continues onwards  My only hope of a  feet max was dashed  I had always thought I was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency  I didnt think I was the type to panic  Well I learned something new about myself a few score feet beyond that switch  As I continued to recall every scary movie I had ever seen I shone my light ahead and saw two glowing yellow eyes looking back perhaps  feet away  A chill ran up my spine and the hairs on my arms stood up  Something in my head snapped and an ancient primal part of me took over  For reasons I still dont understand I hunched over and screamed into the silent darkness AN ALLIGATOR  And just like that it became real in my mind  A  foot alligator with long teeth faced me  Like a pudgy uncoordinated ninja I grabbed my screwdrivers punch tool and wire crimp and threw them at the eyes  And then I ran screaming like a little girl  I must have hit my head in my disgraceful retreat because I ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair  I got back to the stepladder and found THEY HAD CLOSED THE DOOR  What kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of alligators like that  I threw it open and jumped out in a single leap  I found myself face to face with the waitress who screamed  I screamed back at her  The owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern  I managed to compose myself and said She startled me  I think I bumped my head may I use your restroom  I splashed cold water in my face and was ashamed of myself  An alligator  Really  Here where we have more snow days than warm ones  It was likely a stray cat and I might have just killed it  So I am back in the hole retracing my steps  I keep telling myself Im not afraid but I still wish I had my  target pistol in hand  I get to the switch and then beyond it my tools scattered over a large area  The slot head screwdriver had blood on it which frankly amazed me that I actually hit the poor creature in my panic  So with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other I continued my search for that modem  At the far wall I found the router  Standard Linksys blue box zip tied to something holding it up  And nothing else no modem  How in the heck were they getting internet  I plugged in and tried again to guess the password without luck  Then remembering some of the features of DDWRT I checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from establishments on the other side of the road  So my best guess is the teenager had bridged the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant  I power cycled the device which didnt help at all and went back  I must have been a sight  The owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow  I was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water  We kept that contract but the restaurant owner requested a different tech be assigned as he was not sure about me  I did not complain  Imagining he must have heard me screaming and crying under his restaurant and then screaming at his cute waitress I really didnt want to face him again,So with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other I continued my search for that modem,1950,TalesFromTechsupport

GetOffMyLawn,218,422,1hecd6,1466,Back in the days of Big Iron a modest sized computer was the size of  refrigerators the expansion cabinet was another  refrigerators and each disk in the farm was the size of a small washing machine They were large and there were a lot of parts lots and lots of parts Boards and cables and more cables and all sorts of bits and pieces Here is a pic httpwwwmuseumwaalsdorpnlcomputerimagesjpg for your viewing pleasure  The IT department and back then the term IT had not been coined it was the Computer department bought one of these modest sized monsters Now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people including the Vice President of engineering better known as the mad Dutchman Now Dutch was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs as opposed to generating new revenue He was a bean counter extraordinaire This purchase was no exception When purchasing one of these monsters the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component Dutch carefully perused many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered noncritical such as the console terminal and keyboard hey we can reuse one in house right  And he crossed out cables to connect the CPU cabinet to the peripherals cabinet cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives cables to connect everything else together I mean theyre just cables we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right Of course we can were engineers we can do anything And wow look I saved  on a  order I am a financial genius So without having the Computer department do one final check on the items being ordered and really why would you have technical people review technical decisions made by a guy who isnt technical the order goes out And the manufacturer ships the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote And the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room And field service comes on site to do the installation But then field service starts asking questions like where are the data cables for the disk drives Where are the bus cables from the CPU to the peripherals On and on all these pesky little missing cables Proprietaryonlymadebythemanufacturer cables Someone investigates and discovers Dutchs dastardly deed OK so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables Or so they think You see these cables are not normally sold separately they are sold as part of a package a package that includes a  computer There are no ordering numbers for these cables There is no way to tell manufacturing hey just send us a few parts No one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts And no doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out isnt going to work So the computer sat in the computer room unpowered for  months while this snafu was unsnarled If we look at this in terms of engineering man hours lost  months is  weeks one week is  hours there were about  engineers who were going to use the machine and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about  So about  lost man hours Plus a  paperweight Maybe I should have called this Cables We dont need no stinking cables,The  paperweight,1888,TalesFromTechsupport

AsthmaticNinja,132,392,1fjpgj,1461,This isnt strictly a tech support story but I figured it would be enjoyed hereFirst a small bit of backstory  I am a regular member at my local hackerspace where we keep a rather large supply of pc parts most of them fairly dated About  months before the story I picked up an old WD to use on my Pi until I could get my TB drive back from Western Digital Amazing customer support by the way  Due to various reasons Yay AP tests I didnt even look at it for a few monthsI was working on setting up raspBMC on my Pi so I could use it to store movies and TV shows from my DVD collection  Once I had the software up and running I realized I needed something to use as storage  Thats when I remembered I had the drive tucked deep into the Narnia that is my desk drawer  I plugged it into my home PC to figure out what filesystem it was using so I could reformat it  Thats when I saw the files  The drive was nearly full  Out of idle curiosity I dug around a little bit in some of the folders  The previous owner left a MASSIVE amount of personal info on the drive  There was insurance info tax data addresses even bank account info  I figured that since this drive was left at my workshop it must belong to a memberprevious member  So I began searching our forums and wiki for the names I found on the drive  I found nothing  I couldnt find ANY info on the internet about this person  After a few days I started looking again on the drive for more info This time around I found some chat logs and based on the date I assumed they were IRC logs  With nothing more than a few nicks and channel names I set off to search the internet again  I tried every IRC network I could think of  I trawled the internet and searched every IRC network that had those channels  I found nothingFinally after a week I was ready to give up and just wipe the drive  I decided to give it one more try  Finally I found him  Hed thankfully for me been using the same IRC nick for almost  YEARS most of the logs were dated late s early sHeres a chat log Ive changed the names and whatnot obviously  Irssi Starting query in IRCNETWORKGOESHERE with DriveGuy ltMegt we need to talk ltMegt Trying to find the owner of a HD I found ltMegt I think it may be yours are you INSERT NAME HERE ltDriveGuygt HD ltDriveGuygt who ltMegt Hmm ltDriveGuygt oh fuck ltDriveGuygt a hard drive ltMegt what ltMegt yep ltDriveGuygt shit ltDriveGuygt i bet one i donated ltMegt yep ltDriveGuygt im doxed eh  ltMegt No ltMegt I dont intend to do that at all ltMegt I was actually going to try and return it ltDriveGuygt jesus ltDriveGuygt thank you ltDriveGuygt how did you find me ltMegt Well ltMegt IRC logs ltMegt a few screenshots ltMegt and some documents ltMegt zero your drives dud ltMegt dude ltDriveGuygt i thought did ltMegt If literally anyone else got this you would be toast ltDriveGuygt sounds like i got rid of a drive i didnt intend to ltDriveGuygt  ltDriveGuygt fuck ltMegt Well do you still live in the HOMETOWN area ltDriveGuygt i moved to florida for work ltDriveGuygt but ltDriveGuygt i can have my best friend pick it up ltDriveGuygt i am fucking endebted ltDriveGuygt what would you like ltDriveGuygt seriously ltMegt  ltDriveGuygt you deserve something for being a good human being ltDriveGuygt i could have been owned ltMegt I wouldnt even know what to ask for ltDriveGuygt do you need a job ltMegt I think Im a little young for you to hire meTurns out he used to be a hacker now he works for a security company and now Ive got tickets to an epic security conference next year He wouldnt let not accept something in return for returning the driveTLDR  Found an HD and using  year old data tracked down the owner and returned it,The single coolest thing Ive ever done on the internet,1853,TalesFromTechsupport

Pavix,418,390,1knoij,1418,So a couple years ago a local business was turned to me to acquire a server on the advice of a local consultant When I asked the office manager why they didnt go with the consultant for the work he said that he felt like the price was inflated and he declined Fair enough I suppose So I asked him what the consultant recommended and was handed the sheet Apparently this office was using local accounts on WinXP for authentication no backups and no network filer they used simple file sharing to share files in the office UGH So the consultant recommended a server for AD running SBS  with  CALs so they had room to grow and it had Volume shadow copy so if something got deleted it could be recovered easily The owner was also recommended to buy tapes for backup but he nixed this idea saying he didnt want to have to deal with tapeswat Whatever he wants to take it in the pooper once his drives fail thats on him Then he hands me a sheet of paper with his requirements I found this odd since he is not technically capable of using his computer much less dictating hardware requirements But lets see what he has quad core xeonsGB RAMTB SATA drive with no RAIDummm watSo I first ask him if hed rather use RAID in case of drive failures nope Ok then what about the machine are you planning on running virtual machines Hosting your own email internally Running a busy SQL server Nope nope and nope huh Ok So I tell him that for his purposes a single quad core xeon would be more than enough with GB of RAM Nope he is adament that it has to be that exact specs I ask him if he got those specs from the consultant Nope but I know thats what we need Your money guy So I go out and spec the server with the SBS  license and CALs print it out with an invoice for BucketsOMoney Understandably he flips his shit Manager So why is this so expensivePavix Theres an itemization on there indicating the price of everything I wouldnt be able to cut the price in half but Id be able to reduce the cost by metricshitton if we went with a single xeon solution with GB of RAM which is more than enough for what youre using it forManager No it has to be the exact specs I statedPavix If you dont mind me asking who gave you those specs It seems like someone at least a little familiar with IT work since the specifically referenced Xeons SATA etc Manager Look I dont know what youre getting at Weve already hired a consultant just do your damn jobI would like to point out that this is typically where Id NOPE right out but I wanted the money so whatever I got the manager to approve the budget ordered the kit and left I get a call a week and a half later saying the order is there and asking if I could drop by to get it setup Sure So I get there toss in my earphones and start building the server Get it racked plug in monitor mouse and keyboard and begin the SBS install As Im about to grab another refill of water and hit the can the manager comes in with some kid thats about  or  Manager Hey Pavix this is JeremyPavix Hey Jeremy whats upJeremy Nothin Im just coming to helpPavix Help with whatManager Well Jeremy has got software he needs to install on the server once the server is upPavix What software If its licensed and was installed from the old server I can do the migration for you once I find the mediaManager This is something only Jeremy can do Just let him know once youre doneHmmmdafuq Whatever I dont have time for this crap So I go around getting the names of all the employees Get AD setup create accounts with default passwords for everyone and go around joining their computer to the domain Theres a few squabblers of how the New system is slower and Why did we have to change if the old system worked Worked huh If by worked you mean no way to remotely manage accounts easily no way to easily apply security permissions no easy way to reset a password if you forgot yoursoh well of course you will have to use a password to get in So after everyone is logged into their domain accounts and the computers are on the domain I set about setting up shared network folders when Jeremy comes into the closetJeremy Are you almost donePavix Umm in a bit What did you needJeremy Well I wanted to get this software setupPavix What softwareJeremy BF dedicated serverPavix Umm what Are you the one that gave the manager the server specsJeremy Yea I went on a forum and asked this group what server stuff they had so I could get it too and host my own serverI walk into the managers office and explain what was just told to me He told me that it wasnt my responsiblity and to finish the install So I go back get shares setup to match what was preexisting setup OUs added the users with correct levels had users reboot and test Copied all the files over after configuring VSS I goto the manager and explain that its done but that I wont be offering any support to this network in the future if hes going to let his kid host a BF server on the domain controller After about  minutes of yelling saying Im unprofessional and how he knows more about IT than me and that a BF server wont affect the server or its security he begrudgingly cut me a check for my hours His number is now on my verizon block list because fuck that edit Wow Front page thank you so much UPDATE Yesterday since this was a somewhat popular post I decided to reach out to the consultant who referred the customer to me and ask if he ever heard from them again Of course he has where else was the customer going to go Geeksquad Anyway I know this post is getting long in the tooth and if this should be a new posting feel free to let me know mods First things first it was MW not BF he was hosting off this new server My apologies for the confusion Ive never setup a server for either so I wasnt aware of the restrictions OriginEA has for servers So after I left Jeremy tried downloading his shiny new server software if what Im being told is correct its run through Steam but anyone that has logged into a Windows server with an administrative account knows that IE runs in Hardened mode to protect novice Admins from doing something stupid But Jeremy wouldnt be thwarted by some geek engineers from MS oh no He went back to the forums asking how to get the software on his machine and the internet being incredibly helpful suggested he download Firefox on another machine put the installer on a flash drive and plug it into the server So there was Jeremy with an unrestricted browser downloading whatever he wanted Oh boy And I know what youre going to askBut what about his firewall Wouldnt that block him Im glad you asked When the network was setup the contractor was quite adament about using private  IP ranges but the ladies didnt want to have to deal with pesky VPN to RDP into their machines and couldnt be bothered to change ports that corrispond to each of the workstations Nope instead every machine in the office has public routable IP addresses This of course includes their network printer and the server Oh joy And they dont restrict inbound or outbound traffic in any way After a week network shares were unavailable Jeremy stopped all services that the helpful gamer forum didnt recognizetheyre gamers so they should know all things IT rightwhich included volume shadow copy service so backups werent being done Oh and the ladies or Jeremy found some way to enable C shares on all workstations so after Jeremy started to get the Scary FBI virus warnings on his machine the entire office got it as well This is a Real Estate office so HIPPA doesnt apply but im sure there are some legalities So my friend got called in to quote a price to fix it He said he wouldnt Fix it except to nuke and pave all workstations all servers and that he wouldnt hand over Administrative credentials until a paid IT staffer contacted him They politely declined Im guessing the manager tried my phone was told there are Call restrictions in place and moved on

,162,408,1bidvw,1419,A small bit of background I work as the IS Manager for a small company with about six branches and under  employees  About a week ago we had an issue where one of our SCSI HDDs burned out in our mail server  It was RAID  so I replaced it and let it rebuild but I began to closely monitor the server in case anything odd began to happen  I say this because I normally dont monitor our mail logs all that closely otherwise unless people are having problemsOur company employs a team of third shift workers to pull product for trucks that depart in the morning  Most of these employees have been with the company for over ten years and are mostly all over the age of fifty  Theyre all good guys just not the most tech savvy which is fine  Theyre also unmonitored all night for the most part  We also dont run any content filtering software so all websites are open for browsing  Our CEOs thoughts are that if we hire someone we expect them to be adult enough to know when its appropriate to browse websites for personal use and when not to and what sites are appropriate to begin withwhich is okay for people who legitimately arent going to download the worst viruses imaginable on accident but I digress One employee in particular well call him Stew doesnt like not being savvy and every morning hell wander over to my desk with a plethora of questions that Im more than happy to answer for him  Theyre usually things about which phone he should look at buying or how to do something with the computer he had never done before so its nice to just shoot the shit before getting on with my day  Well a few days ago Stew walks over to my desk and begins asking me some questions about Craigslist  His issue was that when he clicks on an email address on Craigslist to email someone it opens a bunch of options that I have no idea what to do with  I think on it for a second and then figure its probably because the computers in the warehouse have no default email client they all use web based email because so many people share the computers out there  So I tell him that if he just copies and pastes the email address that will work or he can just type it by hand  Which is what I believe he did becauseThe next morning I walk into work and begin searching through email logs  We have a queue of bad emails that couldnt be delivered for one reason or another and more often than not its because someone sent an email to the wrong address by mistyping a letter or some such thing  So was the trouble with poor Stew  You see as I found out that morning Stew was using Craigslist at work to solicit sex from people creating FWB posts  There was a message from Stew stuck in the Bad Message queue to whoevercragslistorg instead of craigslistorg and it had been rejected  Both the subject and message were there in all of their glory describing in detail what this  year old man wanted to do to this supposedly  year old busty blonde college girlI lost it and absolutely could not stop laughing  I legitimately felt bad more than anything else  I wasnt going to tell his boss or call him out on it because he needs his job but it was obviously not appropriate so before he left that morning I met him in the warehouse  I pulled him off to the side and let him know that regarding his question yesterday Id appreciate it he not use his work email for Craigslist if thats what he planned on doing as sometimes it results in increased spam for the company  Its only been a day now and I havent seen another email go out but I just absolutely had to tell someone because I really dont have a team at work and I dont think anyone else could appreciate it as much as you guys,You will find nothing for you at cragslistorg,1827,TalesFromTechsupport

PolloMagnifico,293,490,1qguwv,1405,Now a short disclaimer This information went through two technical people before coming to me so I may have gotten some bad informationAt my previous job I was responsible for managing a large number of laptops out in the field Basically they would come in I would reimage them and send them back out as needed Sadly the guy I replaced was bad at managing his images So we had four laptop models and all the images were in terrible condition Half the laptops would come back because for some reason something didnt work rightSo I set about redoing the images and got two of the four models reimaged The field supervisors thought I was the greatest thing ever and told me their emergencies had been cut in half in the short time I had been working there They were sleeping better there was less downtime and I had gotten everything so efficient I was able to reimage any number of computers that came in and get them back out the same dayWell something important to note was that they had a multiinstall key for Microsoft Office They refused to give me the key And one of our images that I hadnt gotten to fixing didnt have the right keyWell we had to send out this laptop and had no extras to send in its place Originally it was going out in a month but the next day it got bumped up to the end of the week and later that day to in two hours I needed the key the head of IT wouldnt get back to me so I used a tool PCAudit to pull the registry information and obtain the corporate keyOne threat assessment later I was let go Its a shame too I really really liked that job,Apparently Im a hacker,1895,TalesFromTechsupport
jon,182,537,1agon8,1397,Ill say it  anytime Ive retold this story I dont think anyone has ever believed it  I have to be honest I wouldnt either However me and at least two other people in the world know this to be absolutely true I was doing a contract for a major national public sector organisation Obviously no names but if youve ever been to London youve been a customer It was your standard high staff turnover pay em till they get bored throw them the BS tasks kind of role Anyway one day myself and another contractor were set the task of a machine hunt Basically the network was a hodgepodge of bolted on spokes using various standards practically held together with poor soldering and bits of gaffa tape However there were a list of umpteen Windows x machines which were apparently alive on the user subnets which needed reimaging to XP or replacing Our job was to do the preproject hunt to determine who was using them and where they were I say preproject it wasnt exactly thought out it was some task that appeared from the ether which would most likely be refiled into the ether This is the same organisation who only a few months prior saw a  shipment from Dell literally get delivered outside their offices which nobody retrieved or was aware even being ordered and over the course of the next  hours were promptly retrieved by members of the public Yep it got left there overnight and there were only docking stations left Good use of public money ehAnyway we hunted down an old Compaq on our list Serial matched IP matched now to talk to the user The user was a guy who wore a grey suit impeccably turned out but who looked like he was about to wet himself with fear He asked us several times who we were what we wanted what for where was this information going etc After placating him as much as possible that it was just an upgrade programme and we were IT Support he finally relinquished his nameIt just so happened another machine we were hunting for was right next to his desk our decision to wait around for this user to return was overshadowed by his worried glances after a few minutes of uncomfortable Im pretending to not acknowledge you silence we went away aiming to return later  ideally when he had disappearedA few days later the same contractor and I were out on a pub lunch The guy happens to come in and immediately notices us Hes weird really weird He walks quickly to the back of the pub hovers glances at us and then makes for the door Of course now were talking about him like WTF He makes an about turn at the door and comes up to us he nervously asks Are you definitely just IT support We reply and say yep and he just immediately leaves with an OK thank youOf course were weirded out but whatever We just put him down as a fruitloopAgain another few days later were out on a smoke break this guy appears again seemingly on a smoke break too His eyes are wide as soon as he notices us but as hes already lit his cigarette he kinda has to come out now Were wary of him this guy is a fruitcake He tries to make small talk it seems to me hes probing so I just come out and talk about what we do all day pretending to moan about our menial dutiesAnyway it turns out after a few more chance encounters he kinda settles down and starts talking  mainly about F racing etc He shows up again on a friday afternoon drink this time with his wife in tow It turns out that he has every right to have been nervousThis guy was initially hired as part of a major projects team in the organisation He applied for a role got accepted gave in notice at his old job and duly showed up for work as prescribed However as it turns out in between getting confirmed for his role and actually starting the entire major projects department had gotten nuked The manager who hired him had left the business members of the team were scattered far and wide yet he showed up some receptionist showed him to his desk where he was to wait for someone and nobody showed up He made enquiries all he ever got told was that someone would come talk to him eventually  but nobody ever did For the last  years he had shown up for work Nobody ever hassles him nobody ever asks him for anything sometimes he just doesnt show up and nobody questions it he gets paid every month gets a statutory annual pay rise and thats it Hes been filling his time writing books for the past  years on this that and the other and that is literally what he does every day As the physical office hes in also has a high staff turnover theres no time to make relationships or for anyone to even really acknowledge himOf course he was slightly inebriated at that point I just thought he was plain outright nuts permenantly resident in psychosville I didnt believe a word of it Its too hollywood to be trueThat was until the Monday morning we had to check Sure enough HR systems showed his dept had indeed been nuked mere days after he was recruited and his active manager on the HR system had indeed long since left the business Everything we did to verify his story checked out We even performed a few random dropins and sure enough there he is with Word opened and hes tapping out page   for a novel He never seems to do anything Of course hes back to being nervous again as he let his guard down while drunk and told someone Even his wife at the time seemed to corroborate his taleI left the contract a couple of months later but as far as I know hes still there I still even questioned the reality of such a situation HoweverOn my first day of that role I duly asked where IT was I was told to go with a massive group of people to induction I passed three checkpoints where security guards asked my name and though I wasnt on their list let me through with an OK must be a mess up One even said Whos your manager to which I replied I have no idea Ive only just arrived He too allowed me through What I went into was an entire days induction for permenant staff A lot of sensitive stuff got said a lot of activities went on  nothing catastrophically major dont get me wrong  but there we have it On leaving and switching my phone back on I had several voicemails from my recruiter demanding to know my whereabouts I told him Id been in induction which surprised him It took me another  minutes to track down WHICH IT department I was even supposed to be in and even a day later got told I was still in the wrong place while I was armsdeep into laying some network cable This place was so disorganised I cannot think of anything to discredit his account  other than how absolutely jawdropping it isLucky  fkkktldr  someone shows up for a new job to find his department nuked to the ground he ends up flying under the radar for  years with full salary and nothing to do but write novels,This is unbelievable,1934,TalesFromTechsupport

outhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsdqhgahighschoolnetworkunrealtournamentand I wasnt technically providing tech support but I couldnt help but hope others would enjoy a story about my juvenile network exploits I couldnt have imaged it would get this kind of response I guess we all have something to bond over when it comes to circumventing school network restrictions  Some of you have some pretty impressive stories and Im glad I posted   Ive loved reading all the different workarounds everyone came up with uCoolbrys recent story Mischievous Computinghttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsdlhdmischievouscomputing about his creative victory against students gaming on school computers brought back an old memory from my own days in school Forewarning though  In this story I am the admins adversary Just prior to the turn of the century I was in high school My junior and senior years I took one computer class each year one which turned out to be the same class Id taken my freshman year but had its name changed and one which turned out to be little more than a keyboarding class This resulted in a lot of free time sitting at a computer Freedom Trust ampamp PicklesMy junior year in the class that had its name changed there were three other kids who had already had the class as well The teacher put us together and pretty much told us we could do whatever we wanted provided that we could pass the quizzes to show wed retained the material We could work on whatever side projects we came up with as long as it didnt disturb anyone The teacher knew us and our elite skills well so her trust was not entirely naive Throughout the year we did various projects to keep ourselves busy and present to the class occasionally to prove we werent wasting time It also served to make us into a sort of peerrole model which made other students actually pay attention the the basics after seeing what kind of advanced stuff we churned out The most popular project used VBA to script the Microsoft Agents with custom dialogue so that when we gave a presentation we could have a simulated conversation with Clippy but our personal favorite was a very compact messengerchat executable that would allow us to text tofrom any computer on the network However even with the freedom to make our own projects boredom inevitably set in As we began to waste increasing amounts of time playing Unreal Tournament which we had installed on several computers we were also getting frequently called to various other classrooms and computer labs throughout the high school to act as tech support Our teacher was a little passive aggressive so rather than tell us to stop wasting time gaming any time she saw us playing shed send us to help a teacher somewhere with a basic computer problem  word of our abilities spread quickly among the faculty We addressed all the typical problems Monitor power  computer power logins dont work with caps lock on system volume doesnt matter if the speakers are turned off etc Despite the trivial nature of most of our highlypraised repairs on many occasions we had teachers volunteer their passwords As if this werent enough of a security breach apparently each lab teacher had the admin password It seems that the original network admin had done a web search for most common school network passwords found a top ten list and picked the number one most common password at the time pickleAbsolute Power Corrupts SometimesWe deliberated for many days on whether this was useful to us and for what purposes it could be employed As we weighed our options we reconnoitered the network thoroughly We had access to just about everything We could remotely login to any computer on the network We could use that remote connection to subsequently connect to other computers We could access the main offices attendance records We could even access the grade books and even the backups of the grade books We also determined that by remotely connecting prior to accessing any documents we could make any changes we wanted and could cause the last saved by field to reflect the name of any teacher with an account on the networkWhat did we do with all this power Well since none of us were at all nefarious and because we knew wed be the primary suspects if anything went awry we actually opted to do absolutely nothing with this knowledge Aside from continuing to play Unreal Tournament in our down time the rest of that year was entirely believe it or not shenaniganfree The following year however was a little more interesting A New YearOver the summer a new IT company had been hired but aside from new registers in the cafeteria and a new naming convention for all accounts and terminals not much had changed It amused me when I confirmed that I could still access everything Although most computer labs had been completely reimaged I was able to find a backup Id stored in a subdirectory on the assistant principles computer st world anarchy amiright and I quickly distributed the game across the entire network All in all there were about  or  labs with  computers each so we had some pretty epic games going towards the end of each period as everyone finished their work with as many as  players in a single free for all deathwatch Those were glorious days The teachers actually didnt seem to mind They saw it as incentive for us to finish our lab assignments quickly After a few weeks though our copies of the game began disappearing from the lab computers No notices from an admin no new antigaming policies from the school  the files just started disappearing Teachers even started asking why we werent playing anymore The CopyDelete BattleAt first it was about once a week theyd disappear and it took them a while to track down all the different computers that had the game No big deal Recopy on Monday and play all week Then the cleanup started taking place daily So Id just begin the copying process at the beginning of the period so by the time we finished our work it would be ready to go When doing this I would use a different account to do the copying which I think kept them from figuring out who the culprit was Since this was time consuming I eventually made a bat file that I would run from a different computer each day using a list of all the computers in each lab which was only possible thanks to their new standardized naming convention something like schoolnamermroomcomputerof This worked well for a while until one day they removed the original game folderCrap It was a long disgruntled couple weeks before I figured out what do to next In the meantime I managed to find a computer that was connected to the network but for some reason was overlooked during each wipe and I hid a new copy of the game there for later I dont know if the computer was even on site the room number didnt exist anywhere at the school Odd but irrelevant Edit In retrospect theres a possibility that this nonexistent room number may have been the admins offsite computer lolWork Smarter Not HarderRemember the offhand comment I made about new cafeteria registers I mentioned Those could only be connected to from a couple specific computers It took me about a week of poking around the network every day before I found them and about another week before I realized I could use them I have no idea why they were on the same network but the were I also have no idea why the registers daily transaction upload bat files could be accessed so easily but they wereAfter some manual trial and error I copied the game folder and bat file to all the registers completely unused and apparently completely unmonitored backup drives Then after backing up the originals I added a new last line

The best past is that every day it would randomly choose a different teachers account to be the one doing all the copying Expect The WorstGiven that I expected to be caught I actually fully documented the file commenting each line very thoroughly In the event it was found I wanted it to be immediately clear I hadnt done anything as harmful as what the network setup would have allowed me to do The

all transaction data The PrestigeEvery day every single lab computer on the network received a fresh copy of Unreal Tournament and most students had no idea that it was disappearing and reappearing every day They only thought that whoever had been deleting the files had given up We continued our daily gaming sessions and even though my classmates had started to suspect Id had something to do with it most kept quiet The only ones who had the gall to ask me about it were the well the most ganglike guys in my class One in particular had often asked me for help in the lab he probably hadnt ever used computers before honestly He was actually pretty sharp but kept up his ignorant thug persona when his friends were around When he realized Id been the one to ensure we could keep playing Unreal every day he gave me props and said something about street cred Not even kidding I think that once he realized even a straight laced nerd like me could rebel against the system in my own way he was more comfortable with admitting to being interested in learning And you know what the best part wasFrom that point on he always had my back ingame As of my graduation the little setup was still working perfectly and it probably continued to work until whenever they changed the name of their computers or changed the password For some reason I doubt either happened very quickly TLDR Cafeteria

DEPLOYMENTREBOOTINGHello again TFTSIt has been a while hasnt it Todays story is simple relaxing and humorous and details exactly what to do when your vendors refuse to replace equipment under warranty or at least what ID do  LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN  The afternoon was boiling Patton used to joke about renting out Texas and living in hell as hell would be cooler  he wasnt kidding It was a crispifying  outside and it was only early MayFortunately I and my support staff were inside a specialty clinic we were rolling medical record software to so we were nice and cool and our coffee supply was flowing freely When you have a conference room with a HUGE dark wood executive boardroomstyle table and really comfy leather chairs and overhead lights with a dimmer switch at your disposal you REALLY want to base your operations out of there you knowId just fired up a few tabs in Firefox with several subscribed subreddits for a fine productive afternoon of dicking around and Id had a bottle of Sodastreamed diet Red Bull next to me when one of the RNs registered nurses walked into the conference room where we were and looked expectantly in our directionUm Jack We have a bit of a problem with a printer down at one of our nurse pods downstairsNow normally Ill tell users to cram it with walnuts and to go to the helpdesk then idly entertain fantasies of flipping a table at them but today I was feeling uncharacteristically altruistic for some reason I think the caffeine did it so I thought what the hellI motioned for her to tell me what was going on and she related a problem that involved the printer jamming  repeatedly  and being a royal pain to clear Now mind you were an allDell shop here and Dell stuff is usually pretty easy to clean  repair but this particular model of printer well the Oatmeal was right when they said printers were sent from hellThis particular one a Dell m was wellknown to the field techs that serviced that location regularly One who I worked with occasionally sent me a ticket history for the past six years out of warranty from Dell but not from our printer service company oddly enough for that printer and the logs on it were longer than a rpolitics thread about Michele Bachmann After reading only a few of them   of which were for it not being able to be cleared when paper got jammed in it about  were for it spewing out extra sheets of paper and  were for miscellaneous problems  I had but one reactiongtbertstaregifNow as this printer was at a pod where nurses and clinical assistants sat  and were expected to give patient progress notes to the patients before they left  its malfunctioning directly impacted patient care Thats a HUGE red flag for me and for most people in healthcare ITI got one of the printer techs wed outsourced printer repair to a major printer  MFD  copier company within the past year on the phone bypassing the helpdesk and was told no you cant have a hotswap this isnt a hospital facility so its not directly affecting immediate patient caregtbitchpleasejpgIm onsite right now and its completely nonfunctional Were supposed to pass these progress notes out to a patient as they leave Youre telling me that THAT isnt stopping us Thats a workflow stoppage right thereThe tech groaned and grumbledFINE Ill see if I can get out there tomorrow to fix itAfter a bit of finagling with his boss I had him out there that afternoon and he had it fixed after clearing stuck paper from pretty much the entire printing path on it Right after he put it back together and reconnected it to the network queued jobs started spewing off and  OF COURSE  right after he left the printer jammed dead shut againA quick stroll down to the elevators resulted in my pulling him back in and having him fix it againLook this things nearly six years old Its obviously out of warranty by Dell theres no way we can keep using this and expect it to function reliably on a longterm basis let alone for parts to be available if  when  it dies again Its no Laserjet  Seriously can we get a replacement preferably within the week or at least a hotswap to tide us over until you all can fix this to a point where it doesnt suck like a Sears Shop VacNope sorry It has to be completely effed before well replace it and this thing doesnt even remotely qualify Sure it jams on occasion but what printer doesntThis thing has spent more time down than up Its the printer equivalent of a hamplanet in a scooter If it was working even half the time wed give it a pension and benefits but this things the surly hiredon bosss son who screws up everything it touches and somehow gets a pass because its been here for twenty years on and off Has anyone ever told you youre not really that good at analogies just fix the bloody printerThe next morning the practice manager came up to the conference room  nearly catching me on rfirefly read RGENTLEMENBONERS  and in no uncertain terms told me that the printer had jammed again and she wanted it dealt with She also stated that she knew it wasnt part of the rollout we were supposed to do but she would count it as a personal favor as the printer techs had stonewalled her for months over replacing it and she was tired of all the clinical staff complaining at her about itI told her that I would fix it out of hours that evening and that it would have to wait until everyone was goneI dont know if we can wait through a whole day SeriouslyFor this Youll want toHer suspicious look was wellrewarded as I went into a fullon Gendo Ikari pose with my glasses catching the light from the dimlylit lights over the conference rooms table Hey Im seated at the end of it its got dark wood and black leather you HAVE to go for the dramatics sometimesI have two words for you Plausible deniability Now I strongly suggest that no one be here after eight tonight and my fee for this is that your practice orders lunch for us techs today Do this and the printer will never trouble you againShe nodded got up from her chair and leftThat day we had a very nice lunch catered in by a local bakery one that makes a very excellent creme brulee French toast The other techs and EMR analysts were effusive in thanking the practice manager for the delicious lunch though over the table she and I exchanged glances and we knew that the  pieces of silver had been spent the hitman had his blood money and the target would meet its untimely endA short time later I descended the stairs to their suites entered the comms closet and retrieved their office toolbox and two cables then returned to my table Opening the toolbox I found a pair of wire cutters and a box cutter and in about fifteen minutes I had a tool that would solve our problems I returned the toolkit to the comms closet and sat quietly reading and playing Penny Arcade Adventures  on my phone until seven PM The clinic was empty  not a soul was there not even the cleaning people Id queued up a certain song on my phone when I left the conference room and as I walked through the empty corridor inside the clinic the strains of the  Overture serenaded me with but a hint of the potential of what was to comeI reached the printer and couldnt resistIn the name of Gerald of the department of information services vicepresident of the ministry and overseer of all that we provide within the realm I Jack of the department of information services Bastard Operator from Hell lord of the cubefarm do sentence you to dieMy hand descended into the pouch on my belt and withdrew the means to the end  a device which makes all electronics tremble for precious little can shield against it and to use it guarantees instant deathIt was an Etherkiller built for US threeprong outlets and just as lethal as the chairhttpimgurcomMbxykSwift hands swapped the RJ end into the printers NIC and the other end into a poweredoff surge protector on the floor The music was fast approaching a crescendo and I knew the cannons would start soonDoes the condemned have anything to say before the sentence is carried outThe display perhaps in one final act of defiance flashed ERROR  at meSo be it May your creator have mercy on your soulAs the famous finale started and the cannons went off I flipped the switch and with a swift pop the printer was ended its metaphorical bowels emptying as the smell of ozone flooded the room As the cannons in the overture blasted I flipped the surge protector on and off in time with them and continuous popping started sounding from the printers smoldering corpse  capacitors bursting I assumedI shut down the surge protector removed the Etherkiller and filed a ticket with the helpdesk to have them replace the printer based on that it wouldnt power on at all  THE NEXT MORNING INSERT FFVII INN MUSIC HERE  I was back at my desk at my cubicle in another building about six miles away enjoying a cup of coffee and my desk phone rang Caller ID showed that it was the printer tech calling from his desk phone and with a grin I picked upEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyesThe techs tone was frustrated and angry and I had no doubt he had no idea what was going onHOW DID THIS BREAK IT WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT ON TUESDAYWhen I got back from getting dinner there was a HUGE smell of ozone in the air I know the smell of burned electronics  my house was hit by lightning when I was a kid  and the smells pretty distinctive I followed it to the printer and when I got there it reeked I almost threw up Anyway I unplugged it and made a ticket with you all Im going to pick it up in fifteen minutes Do you want a hotswap Hed gone from angry to defeated in a quick turn of events and with a smirk I replied in the affirmative then told him to call me when he gets there and Id make the backend changes with the server team for the DHCP leaseHe did so and when he got it back to his lair he called backWhat the hell happened to this Its burnt Every capacitor on the NIC has MELTED ON BOTH SIDES The NIC port has scorch marks on it The entire motherboard is completely ruinedDont ask me youre the printer repair guy I just deal with systems and networksThe network admin here  and it should be noted that the field services guys used to repair printers before the new company took over the guy whod had to cover that clinic had gotten promoted in that time   he said it could have been a misconfigured power over Ethernet port that blew it out but but I just dont see how that could be possibleYou may have to go out there with a current tester and try that drop I mean PoE doesnt really have that much current anyways what are you able to do for them to get them up and running in the meantimeWere ordering a new one Itll be there in a week Theyve got a hotswap and that should hold until the new one gets thereReally Thanks You know how it is when we cant get work done Thanks for taking care of this for usHe hung up on me Id SWEAR I heard a muffled sob on the other end of the line but eh The clients were happy the printer ended up being replaced and the patients could get both their progress notes and any EMRprinted prescriptions that the

Tesseract,107,466,1602js,1322,I work on an IT Help Desk for a global company and the first position I had there was Tier  Analyst which basically means taking calls from employees and try to solve whichever problem they had with the numerous applications that the employees of this company use as well as being first point of contact for any big problem that needs to be escalatedOnce I had a call from an angry lady stating that she was unable to log in her company provided laptop The first thing I asked was the error message that she gets Incorrect password Next question is where she is at She is at home Then I asked her if she recently changed her password She did notSo she is not connected to the companys network and her password should be the same than the last time she was using her computer I checked on Active Directory and confirmed that What is happeningShe was angry because she had a lot of work to do and she had already spent quite a while trying to log before she called I took a deep breath and asked her Please I know this is basic but could you verify that Caps Lock is not activeShe started ranting about not being her fault She told me that the day before she saw one of her colleagues messing around with her computer and caught her while passing by the office where they both worked She told me that she didnt have time to ask her what her colleague did but she was sure that was related to this problemI asked her what made her think that it had something to do with this whole matter She said that her colleague left her information on the computerI thought that probably her colleague logged in with her account on the callers laptop and the caller did not modify the user name on the logon screen I told her that She told me that her username was fine but her colleagues information was still there I asked her to read that information for me She read what it looked like a computers name which also appears at the top of the logon window Brief background This company uses a computer name convention that includes the name and last name of the computer ownerThen I figured what the problem wasI told her Well there are two possible situations here Either your colleague logged into your computer and changed your computers name and changed your Windows password yeah right OR you have your colleagues computerAwkward silenceThen she screams St This is not my damn computerclickNow whos the one messing with someone elses computerPS First post btw,There is a reason why she was messing with your computer,1788,TalesFromTechsupport
TollhouseFrank,308,392,1p4cw3,1316,Another magical tale from my job at the now closed dialup companyEven though I do not remember the reason why now I had asked to swap one of my weekend shifts for a midweek shift with a coworker  My manager ended up swapping with me as his wife had something to do that weekend and it gave him time to work on his project  he was working on programming the gpx and writing a new gui for it  so I could have that saturday offI come in to work Sunday and everything is out of place  It looks like someone has rifled through every drawer  even the financial officers desk  and left in a hurry  I call my manager and ask him what was up as the door was locked when I got there so it couldnt have been a breakin this was  stories up with no windows to the outside so no smashngrab either  However if it wasnt that way when he left I was gonna call the policeHe told me to clean up what I could but it was ok  He would explain everything monday morning because it was too long a tale to tell on the phone as apparently the police had already been thereSo I spend all day sunday straightening things up and cleaning up Come monday morning  ME and MAN managerME  So boss whassup  Why all the mess  Did you have a party SaturdayMAN  You could say that  I was sitting here minding my own business writing code for that GUI for the gpx I was showing you and I hear the elevator running and a ding on our floor  I look down the hallway and see a huge German Shepherd coming out following by  DEA guys with guns  ME  Uh you werent doing drugs were you  I mean you look like a hippy but you are clean as far as I knowMAN  I was confused too  I had to get down on the ground with my hands on my head while they searched  After  minutes they gave up and started asking questions  When they got to what address this was to confirm I wasnt high I guess I told them  They started to arrest me until I asked them what address they thought it was   They told me then I started laughing and told them they had the wrong building they wanted the crackhouse across the streetME  Uh wow  That is a weekend to remember  TLDR  Swapping shifts saved me from a drugsearch and interrogation,Apparently the police had already been there,1708,TalesFromTechsupport

PhatDaddy,120,300,14bnqb,1273,All Right since the demand was high and I received many PMs asking for the story here it isWorking at the same call center as the earlier story REFERENCEhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsflbthedayisavedalittlegirlacrossthecountryThis is about  months before this call my first most memorable call although the toughest call Ive ever had and ever will since I dont do tech support anymoreMore background on the situationI was a part time Tier  support at the time but taking Tier  calls except I had all the tools and info from Tier  still at my disposal so I had a bit more power than your average JoeSo I just sit down coming back from a break and get my first phone callThe caller is I would assume early to mid s woman She called up because her internet is down and has been for  days She was already a bit shaken up while speaking to me but I get that pretty often its frustrating having to call and hope your issue will be fixed we go over a few of the basic steps everything seems to be in order but her DSL light just wont stay on itll go on for a few seconds then drop At this point I was doing a few tests but tell her the bad news we probably will be needing to send a tech over to the CO as there seems to be issues on the line itself for what it matters she was  Miles into the loop and her max frequency on her modem said she could  only attain mbit but she should be getting Mbit big difference But as soon as I say technician she lost it crying screaming Im at a loss of words really its just  hours away and its just your internet But that wasnt the issueI ask her whats wrong The internet will be up shortly and I mentioned that the last  calls she had she declined a technician and she starts crying again  minutes go by and Im still sitting there trying to figure out what I do do I hang up Do I stay here Theres obviously something going on so I stuck around while my supervisor is tapping his wrist watch as Im over my AHT of  minutesI ask her why she doesnt want a technician going over and then she tells me  months ago she had a technician FROM THE SAME COMPANY went over and forced himself on her raped herNow a bit of back story on me In my late teens early s I loved to stick it in anything and lots of unstable  crazy people And ended up going out with a girl for over a year that was very unstable she was violently bipolar turns out she was raped a few years before that and was also suicidal I learned a lot about saying the absolute minimum during an episode as that can be a catalyst just sit back and let her vent and try and comfortSo here I am on the phone with a rape victim who called the same company who sent over a guy who raped herAt this point I tell her I need to run a few quick tests I put her on mute hold music is the devil and put my headset down go talk to the floor supervisor Tell him a bit whats going on and he tells me Just take her info but fix her problem and hang up Ill take care of it Clearly he didnt give two shits just wanted his metrics looking good at the end of the day This guy was a tool and in no way he was going to do fuck all with that infoI do the only thing I know how to do I asked her what happened was it reported you sure it was a XXXX ISP technician I was writing down the info make sure I can report thisShe didnt have any names but I was able to pull out the technicians record  months previous she had two techs go over in consecutive days the same guyNever a call since we assumed problem solved WRONGThis is where I knew i fucked up royally I brought it all back to her she starts freaking out telling me how the only thing that stops her from killing herself is going online and finding somebody to talk to and comfort her online playing games and all that And now her internet is down and she needs another rapist to go over and fix her internetShe starts telling me how shes been cutting herself all night making the pain go away needing the internet I was shivering Ive been through this before and it felt like I was talking to my ex It was too realShe tells me how nobody would care nobody would notice she would just die alone in her apartment laying there rottingI asked her you must have family mother father siblings She has a mother and sister her dad left as a kidI asked her what about your Mom your sister dont you think they would miss you Youre her Daughter Youre her pride and joy and your sister dont you want your little sister growing up with you now I only went there because of the tone of how she mentioned her mom and sister in a good light compared to the rest of the call so I took a riskShe just talked for a good hour or so about her Mom and Sister about the good times how she misses her and should go visit her shes still in the same townAs this was going on I was on chat support with the dispatch center have tier  account permissions trying to figure out what was going on with her account and if there is something we can do RIGHT NOW Lucky for her there was a tech a few miles away and dispatch having a bit of info on the situation sent the tech to her CO and replaced her line card it was defective All at the same time she was still talking about her family clearly she was cheering upAt this point I was near the  hour mark on my call Supervisor was still giving me the stink eye other agents on the floor were all starting to wonder what the heck I was doingStill probing her modem I see her modem again The CO work is done DSL light is back modem registers full  Mbit and max speed of  Mbit PERFECTAt this time I ask her to take a look at her modem she just stopped talking gasps and screams My internet is fixed my internet is fixedAfter a few more minutes she asks me if there still needs to be a tech going to her house and I tell  her no but she should report the issue but she didnt want to and was scared Not wanting to trigger a meltdown didnt push anythingShe thanked me profusely wants to know where i live wants me to meet her meet her sister all that I kindly explain Im just your internet tech support agent I cant meet her and her family but she should go visit them and tell them about it I tell her I just want you to think of me of the tech support agent who fixed my internetI finish the call a bit over  hoursNow after storySince I had access to previous tech tickets I was able to know what technician who went over and found out he was no longer with the company since  months  months after the incidentA little bit more probing with a friend in the tech depo turns out he was reported for trying to force himself on a client and was arrested jailed and obviously fired KarmaNow comes my supervisor with a Form of Action or a Written Warning form for taking too long on a call and giving unsupported help I asked him what its for and he tells me stupid stuff not supported took too long blah blah He knew damn well about the situation but didnt give a shit it makes him look bad I sign it and tell him hes a piece of shit I was anxious nervous and just about to throw up months after this call I was full time tier  support my old supervisor was still there but dealt with T I eventually go the bleach call at T supportStory here for those who missed ithttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsflbthedayisavedalittlegirlacrossthecountryIts now been  years since I worked there  since I did call center work  years ago I seen my old supervisor in line at the office I work at waiting for a job interview he never got the job I didnt say anything I dont know what hes doingTLDRGot a call from woman who got raped by the ISP Technician started talking about killing herself I myself having a suicidal  bipolar ex did the only thing I knew how listened comfort her Solve her issue via chat while we were still on the line Was never reported but tech was later arrested for same thing with different personPS I dont remember the exact details in what she was saying the call was extremely long and covered a life story Not to be insensitive but I was only paying enough attention to keep her busy while I solved her issueThere is no way I could

areaguy,139,308,1go03c,1235,I originally posted a shorter version of this in response to thishttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsgnactheserverroom posting about negligent IT guys Someone suggested I repost my comment as its own taleMy first job in this field was working at a national forprofit college that I also attended I worked there officially for around three years though I was the intern for roughly another year I took the job from a guy whose nocall noshow antics caused his termination the day he returned THAT guy had been hired to replace the first sysadmin hired at this physical locationGuys mantra was job security Only he knew how to do certain things and never explained them Wiring was a joke that he had mapped out in his own head and again told no one I spent much time fixing this guys shitGuys mantra was screw it lets game Myself and the other intern did most of the work and he did only what he couldnt pawn off onto us The rest of the time we were deep in vidjamagames It was fun but he barely tried to keep that jobEnter me I will not be a braggart by saying I was the best damn tech that site had seen I fixed problems and explained them in laymans terms Anything I could possibly fix I did though there was much that I was not allowed to fix This was either due to a lack of resources or time or an unwilling of the jackass manager to give me overtime or let me shift my scheduleOur server room was utter shit I never had the ability to fix this however because my boss was a complete jackass with no understanding of IT or best practices He wanted  uptime regardless of whether or not anyone was on campus and refused to pay overtime Do it on your own time if its so important was his mantra Pay me was mineI had submitted around six proposals to this DunderMifflin reject all declining in price from k We needed new switches that met with our colleges Acceptable Equipment list We needed a new server we had two one for studentrelated items and one for the business ASAP We needed a complete rewire of the server room and other networking closet to sort out what went where and to label it allDenied every time when I had people at a level above him who said it would be approved if he submitted it I pleaded with him to bring our stuff up to HQs code but he denied everything stating that it wasnt in the budget or that he couldnt be bothered to pay for the time This meant that if something broke I was expected to drop everything to fix itSo my rule of thumb became Customers First I didnt care if the business was suffering If classes were being affected because of downtime it was my job to fix it Dean of the Criminal Justice school cant get on Facebook Fuck em Lab  is down and theres a class in there in two hoursAs the years passed I began to be more bold with my time If I knew I had a major project to get done I did it I didnt care if the office wasnt staffed because they had removed my ability to have more than one intern If Jackass Manager asked me where I was I told him and informed him of what could have prevented the downtimeMy pleas for new or newER equipment were still ignored and I was done with itCut to the last hour of my employment there I was leaving for greener pastures to work with a team at a medical facility It was my dream job but my work ethic is such that I had not yet checked out I remember it being about  minutes until freedom Server room alarms go off Three switches have died the student server has crashed and wont come back on Phones are out due to the wiring being so haphazard that some of the lines were on the dead switches The whole student side is down Normally I would go to Mr Jackass and inform him of the situationMr Jackass is on vacationI go in and assess the damage then assess my time left I grab my cellphone call his assistant and tell her that he needs to authorize emergency overtime for me as well as prepare to be contacted by HQ regarding the equipment She calls Shes a nice lady Kinda hot too I sit outside of the server room waiting when my cell rings It isnt a number I know so it must be Mr Jackass It isConfirms its me Under no circumstances are you to stay over your  hours Fix it Hangs upI stare at the cellphone and start laughing I dial up my Level  contact and brief him on the situation He starts cracking up He knows Im outta here in another  minutes or so He says hell start the official process and I let him know if anyone from Level  up needs to ask questions to call me I then unplug the three switches and gather their cords up placing them in one box I know HQ will want these so I label the box and hand it to the newlyarriving Assistant She asks what Im doing I tell her Im doing damage control until PMShe begins to laugh He didnt approve the overtime did heNope I immediately begin to bring down the administrative network and restore it using the shittiest switches that I had I filmed all of this with my phone stating my reasons for doing so I then brought the student network back up using our productiongrade switches Fuck the administrative staff these kids are paying for school and theyre going to get itInstructors are coming down to find out what is going on and Im letting them all know I wont brag Im a nice system admin so they all at least liked me if not loved me Every single one of them left the room laughing I leave detailed notes both digitally and on paper as to what has happened what needs to be done to fix it and why Im leaving the site at PM I save copies of the filmed work on three locations head to the office and grab my stuff Hands are shaken as I inform the intern about what has gone downAt PM and I couldnt make that shit up if I tried the admin network goes back down from the horrible switches I was forced to use Intern calls and asks for advice I tell him theres nothing he can do and give him Level  techs cellphone which L had already bade me do At PM as Im pulling off the highway and nearly home I receive a call from Mr Jackass He demands a status report I inform him that HQ has been notified as has the Level  technician and that its out of my hands I tell him what I did with the networks and that I left crystalclear instructions with everyone who matters He demands that I return to the site I laugh in his ear and tell him Ill return as soon as he authorizes the overtime He growls out that I am not to count these hours and I laugh again I decided to bargain with him you supply the hours Ill go buy the equipment personally He starts raging threatening to fire me if I dont get to the store buy parts and get the school back to  I ask if I get overtime he yells no and I calmly state the next bitYou cannot fire me as I no longer work for you Ive done my due diligence and informed everyone that needed to be informed but I am not a hardware wizard You were informed several times about your hardware and wiring issues and you chose to ignore them I included that in my communication as well Now lose my phone number because Im not your employee any longerI hang up to the sound of his rage Three hours later hes the only one who doesnt show up to my goingaway party Tales are spun of how Mr Jackass was furious calling everyone he could to get them to convince me to return Amazingly none of them had seen me nor had my phone number I found out later that this incident plus my reporting on his practices such as no overtime but fix it for free was the nail in a coffin of evidence collection that the school had taken years to gather He was fairly decent at covering his ass but I was better and they took him to task for it Intern ended up helping them fix everything then replace everything and was finally hired on as my replacement Original TLDR Dont assume the IT guys were idiots Instead assume that they werent given the tools that they needed to fix everything and let their work speak for itselfPosters TLDR I saw that the Dragon was attacking

farkanoid,203,436,yugsk,1220,I worked as a general tech at a local high school around  They had hundreds of workstations running Novell Netware ontop of Win  and SE all the machines were PIIIs and below typically PIIs and Celerons for students PIIIs for staffComputers were generally offlimits during lunchtimes unless you booked one of the public workstations in the library in advance youre restricted to  mins which is the first half of lunch or a full recess There were a handful of Senior thth grade students allowed access to private unsupervisedish computer labs at lunch time most of the students would play StarCraft and GTA over the network others would browse the web and mess with Visual Basic  for classLater on in the year some of the machines I looked after in Lab  had trouble loading their desktops Essentially Explorerexe had been corrupted Rather than try and troubleshoot these machines standard procedure was to restore a knownworking image using Ghost instead it took around  minutes to do a complete wiperestore of a Winx partition or closer to  minutes if the image is streamed over the networkStudents have their own drives and desktops mapped to subfolders on the server so there shouldnt be any personal data stored locally on the machines Applications are installed onthefly using Novell Snappshot on firstrun so the recovery image was barebones OS Drivers NetBEUI amp Novell stacks and shortcuts to Snappshotted applications on the networkAfter restoring a few machines I noticed some juniors pointing at a screen and giggling uncontrollably  I figured it was porn and carried on working weve all been there and being a tech I have no real authority anyway Soon more students started acting the same way towards other machines My curiosity got the best of me so I casually walked across the lab hoping to get a glimpse of the screen as I passed bySure enough someone had changed the Start menu text to Penis on a few machines I admit that I found it amusing at first and suddenly the Explorerexe corruption made sense as the culprit must have messed up modifying the file the first few times before figuring it out Needless to say I wiped the affected machines and restored a knowngood image after everyone left This happened on and off over the next week until I started receiving concerning emails from staff saying their machines have been affected tooOne email stood out in particular it was from the Librarian which the students arent terribly fond of Someone had changed the text of several public library machines to Psycho a nickname the students had given her as it rhymes with her surname and reflects her default demeanor I admit that I may have been rooting for the underdog a little I watched with glee as she tried to hilight and delete the text on the start menu to no avail of courseOver the next few days pretty much every department excluding the front office had been affected  Im talking hundreds of machines I was gobsmacked how the hell could this many machines be affected I can understand the students working together and affecting lab machines that they had access to But staff too Students dont have access to staff machinesSome departments started becoming supersnappy towards me accusing me of not doing my job and allowing this to happen  Bare in mind I was a basic cardlevel tech there I had adminlevel access to the server but I was not to mess with configuration user accounts or network policies that was someone elses job My job was to run leads replace cards troubleshoot and format machines no moreFeeling like my job was on the line I got to work in trying to find out how it was being done It had to be at least semiautomated to reach so many machines in such a short time so I started from a freshly imaged student machine The staff gave me a lend of the Office boy for a while each day they pick a random student to run errands for the office the seniors nicknamed todays one Office bitch I asked him to have a seat and show me exactly what he does to log into the machine to play gamesHe entered the usernamepassword combination of studentstudent  apparently only th graders get their own logins everyone else is to use student with the exception of library computers which use librarylibrary Immediately after startup I notice a black command prompt appear for a moment with nothing but a blinking cursor then the machine reboots automatically I ask him to log in again after which the command prompt appears for under a second and the desktop shows upLo and behold the start menu text was changed to Penis on this freshly imaged machine too Office boy bursts out into tearyeyed hysterical laughter I figure yeahyeah I get it penis man I miss high school Only this time there was a subtle change the windows logo next to the text was replaced with crudely drawn penis with and similar colour scheme At this point I was unable to contain my laughter and chortled repeatedly I got an I know right chortling from office boy in return too I havent seen anything like this since my Amiga days I posted elsewhere that the Revenge virus on Amiga changes the mouse pointer into a penisFiguring its something being messed with serverside I start NwAdmin and dig around for a while I found several lines of code appended to the login scripts of student and library this script essentially maps network drives and starts rdp services prior to explorerexe loading One of the lines pointed to a bat file on a publicly accessible driveI open the aforementioned batch file and am amazed at what I see First line echo off explains the blinking cursor and nothing more  Next few lines are conditional IF EXISTS statements to determine the likely windows version and if the machine has already been patched Next xcopy is called to copy one of four possible Explorerexe files from a publicly accessible directory and finally rundll is called with SHExitWindowsEx to reboot windows I felt bad undoing the changes and deleting the files but it had to be doneI then did a global search for explorerexe on the student directory and found one interesting hit in a th graders home folder In this folder there were many revisions of explorerexe as well as MicroAngelo studio icon editor and HexEditexe  I found the culprit Clearly this is one smart kid and hed definitely be suspended or expelled if caught I removed the files and left him a READMETXT file explaining how I found him that I could have lost my job and that I wont be telling the staff I actually lost my job a few days later anyway so I didnt get a chance to hear what happened nextAs to how the infections started it turns out the global login scripts for student and library were userwriteable rightclick the N novell icon in the systray edit login scripts  this explains how many machines were affected in such a short time and particularly how the Psycho text only affected the library machinesAs for staff machines getting affected it turns out some occasionally log in as students to participate in multiplayer starcraftGTA Oh how I miss those daystldr th grader finds out global login script is writeable uses it replace explorerexe on hundreds of machines start menu text changed to Penis on staff amp student computers staff were affected because they secretly joined student multiplayer games,A student changed Start menu text to Penis on hundreds of workstations,1656,TalesFromTechsupport
tuxedojack,421,464,1oaudk,1220,Im writing this on my cake dayFor once I can honestly say that even though the cake is a lie Im okay with it                              Tuxedo Jack and Craptacularly Spignificant Productions                                                  present                              Here Comes the Bastard Crushing Hopes and Dreams    Two weeks into my new job and already I was slammed with things to doOur ticket queue was at  on any given day which was fine We usually had it reduced to  or less at the end of the day as is between me and the other officebased tech A lot of it was the techs using it as a reminder system for work they were doing tooOne of our major clients a religiously affiliated high school had ordered   yes   Dell Latitude STE slate PCs xbased Windows  Pro tablets without consulting usUsTheir IT firmლಠ益ಠლNevertheless we got in on it and ripped their Dell rep a new one for telling them that one of the big points only available in Win Enterprise would be in Win Pro As a result Dell comped us a MAK for  Win Enterprise licenses plus the services of a project firm to get all the tablets reimaged and deployedIt fell to me to get the image created and after a night of cursing and swearing since they were UEFIonly and couldnt boot to PE or Win off their flash drives  and yes I tried a lot UEFI only likes signed things and FAT  I cursed swore and built a WinPE  boot USB with the Win installer and all the drivers slipstreamed in An hour later I had my install and over the next day I nurtured and crafted it into an image for the tablets complete with pervasive branding lock screens Default user profile branding default home pages et cetera Office  Enterprise was installed again activation MAK So nice the programs they wanted GloBible and a few others were installed and I tweaked the HELL out of it to go even faster than it shouldWhen I was satisfied with the gold master image a Dell tech and I sat down the next morning created a WIM from it and split it to allow it to fit on the FAT flash drive booting via UEFI remember GB isnt half bad for a Win image especially with Office installed We handed it off to the imaging company confident that theyd fuck it up somehowBOY WERE WE RIGHTWe got them back and there had been a second local admin account added No matter we thought wed fix itThen we found out that the faculty and administration wanted a whitelist for the Windows StoreThis isnt possible normally Sure Applocker will let you block apps from running or downloading thats fine We had our GPO in development for that They didnt want them to even SEE apps that are PG or higher on the store T or higher for you ESRB people This had never been done supposedly and wasnt even supported by MicrosoftSure enough some sysadmin in North Carolina had done it for his district and Dell was desperately trying to hire him We got in contact with him to mirror his setup which worked pretty well It also implemented by the by web filteringAt any rate I digressThe tablets were imaged rolled out to the students at the high school and on launch day we disabled the local admin accounts on the PCs via a single psexec command psexec assetlisttxt net user LOCALADMINNAMES activeno where assetlisttxt contained the list of every tablet name exported from AD as CSV copypastad from Excel into Notepad Due to a scheduling quirk and the sysadmin who was supposed to apply it being out for a few days we didnt have the AppLocker whitelist GPO rolled out but we had the Windows  management VM in place with the whitelisted apps installed and the GPO was configured and ready to be linkedI was sitting at the office listening to Tears for Fears on Pandora and enjoying coffee and the schools tech called me in a panic Jack whats going on there Kids are downloading apps here Theyve got Angry Birds on some tablets Ive seen Netflix on others and one kid has pulled  gigs over the Internet connection Didnt you roll out AppLocker yetI sighed and got up from my chair Cool your shit Skeezix Im on my way to the high school Ill see you there in  A few clicks later I was in the management VM inside the Group Policy editor I linked the GPO to the Student Tablets OU then thought about somethingGPupdate takes too long to check in and apply I tapped a finger on my chin I have an ideaAfter a quick drive to the school I met with the tech in the cafeteria where lunch was being served The kids were crowded around the ones whod gotten their tablets and a few were watching Netflix one even had Breaking Bad on I resolved to torrent that show when I got home that night The tech was running his hands through his hair in frustration and I smirkedSo what are we going to do he said resignation evident in his voice Theyre saturating the Internet connectionWell its easy I replied launching X on my phone and RDPing into the management VM which Id left a dialog box up on The GPO is deployed and linked its active We need them to check in and update the GPO The easiest way is to take the tablets and restart them Thats not an option for these overprivileged little brats though  remember what happened last week when we locked out all Apple devices thanks to them oversaturating BOTH Internet connections downloading iOS  on release dayAt his nod I flipped my phone around him and showed him the window up on the VMJack what does shutdown i doThe target machine dialog had the list of every deployed tablet and the message AH AH AH YOU DIDNT SAY THE MAGIC WORD in the comment field with it set to restart with no warning to the usersPush the button Frank I said with a smirk ripping off Dr Forrester and he tapped the OK button and kicked off a restart on every tablet in the schoolA minute or two later the students were in an uproar when their tablets restarted and the nonwhitelisted apps  Netflix Pandora and the like  returned the message This app has been blocked by your system administratorWe stepped over to the microphone and speaker system that Id asked the tech to bring in there before I arrived and tapped the mic to ensure it was liveAttention students I said my voice echoing over the cafeteria We apologize that your tablets rebooted without warning and that you didnt have a chance to save your work The last word was said with clear snark Please note that when your parents signed the agreement to let you all have the tablets you agreed not to install applications As such weve just removed that temptation from you since some of you cant be trusted You know who you areThe clamor and ragefilled yells started up We also would like to point out that the agreement included you all not trying to bypass security restrictions So think twice before you try to do what we know youre going to try to do I guarantee well knowI clicked the mic off tossed it to the campus tech and walked out of the cafeteria with the wailing and grinding of teeth of several hundred entitled whiny iPhonewielding teenagers behind meYou know I could get to like this job I thought Ive never gotten to drop a mic before    Heres everything Ive ever submitted to

processhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsrismfirsttechjobthepenultimatestoryAnd now the final installment      If youve been reading the stories above you know that all good things must come to an end And at the end there was nothing more for me in this my very first IT job It was time to let go say goodbye and ring down the curtainAnd it was time to do it with style  Now the office manager and I had been involved in semifriendly officefu fighting for some months He would demote me I would use the spare time to embarass the crap out of him in front of his friends He would try and lock me down I would get a photo of me and the CEO smiling together and put it on my desk He would try and loom menacingly over me I would run my chair wheels over his shoes Wed bring each other up on charges in front of tribunals and legal hearings try and get each other fired that sort of thing Both of us were too slippery to really make anything stick him because of his connections and me because I was smart and bored and Id actually read the administrative process manuals  So the stage was set for a showdown  Now one of the things the office manager was very smug about was that hed decreed not openly of course that I was under his permanent control I would not be escaping out of his influence unless I actually quit and I was too stubborn to do so Although his hobby was breaking new staff making them resign or have breakdowns hed never been successful with me But he wanted to break me Oh he wanted it bad And that was his weakness      Once Id decided that it was time for me to move on I had to find a way to do so without the office manager interfering with the process So I set up a little misdirection a few weeks before I took my vacation I mailed some paperwork to the capital city I took a day off and used that day to visit over twenty other offices of my employer in the city I only spent a few minutes at each one and what I did was to ask to see the manager or acting manager and tell them that I was interested in moving away from my current office and into theirs I brought copies of my CV and examples of all the savings Id made and work Id done to date taking my office to the top of the state rankings Some of the managers had even heard of me which was quite gratifying And I would thank them and move on to the next office and the next and the next  I got back to work the next day and let it slip in conversation about where Id been This in turn got back to the office manager as planned and he was furious I might weasel out from under his control Hed be putting a stop to this by thunder And so he kept an eagle eye out for any incoming contact from other offices and when they expressed an eager interest in acquiring my services he would shred the messages and tell them I wasnt available This kept him so busy that he didnt notice me taking a rather long and intense call on my lunch break or that the call originated from the national capital from within a quite different branch of the Service  After hed concluded that he had stamped out any chance of me getting a job from any of the other offices in the city he was quite quite pleased with himself  until the events where as noted previously I acquired a photograph of myself and the CEO together He instantly swung into action and contacted his network of cohorts and those the location of whose skeletons he knew It took him quite some time but he eventually nailed down the chance of me being promoted or transferred AT ALL without his sayso as office manager So now I couldnt go anywhere Not in the city not in the state not in the country not even to another Department I was completely absolutely totally stuck As far as he knew  The manager worn out from all these activities knew it was worth it  hed won There was nothing I could do and nowhere I could go And so when the Department was merged with a little minidepartment the week after and their staff were being placed tempoarily in our offices in various positions the office manager decided that he was going to take his first vacation in ten years He did this in the knowledge that his job would be filled by an incoming manager from the other department and that that manager would be completely useless because the office was actually run by the triumverate of nasty undermanagers who would proceed to eat his replacement alive meaning he would be all too glad to move on after that time Oh and just in case I got sneaky the replacement manager could NOT authorize any of the office staff to be promoted transferred out of the Department or even permanently transferred inside the Department        And so it came to pass And verily the replacement manager did turn up and verily he was rapidly reduced to a deerintheheadlights look as the office triumverate pretty much tore him to pieces and he retreated to the small glass office near my desk to hide and wait out his two weeks Which is where I found him  O Captain I said to him I have a request to make of you For today you are going to get a request from one of the offices in this city an office which I have not physically visited on my day off but which I have kept in contact with through other means The request will be that I be transferred to that office for a temporary period of one month You are going to authorize this request and you are going to do it the moment it arrives For verily I am young and confident and you currently have the mental fortitude of Jello and I seem to be the only person in this establishment who both knows what they are talking about and is not actively undermining you every hour of the day  And yea did the request arrive and yea did the replacement manager sign it for as the office manager he had the authority to sign temporary interoffice transfers for the purposes of crosstraining and such buzzwordcompliant purposes And thus did I pack my desk and head off to the other office for as it seemed on the surface the duration of one month only      A minor victory you might imagine For the temporary manager could not authorize more than one month away and after that I would have to return to my place under the thumb of the freshly vacationed original office manager  Only there was that little matter of the paperwork I had sent to another Department in the national capital It had been an application And the phone call I had taken during lunch while the office manager was occupied with other matters had been my interview And I had won the job  Except that in order to take it I would need to be released from the Department by my office manager You may recall that the temp manager did not have that authority  but the manager at the office Id be at for one month COULD        No wait thats not quite the right word Whats the one Im looking for Oh yesDID  I mean I did mention above that Id been in communication with this other office for a while yes And that the computer macros Id developed turned out to be very wellsuited to taking offices right to the top of the state listings Especially as Id been refining them  You see it turns out that apparently some office managers are actually interested in being at the top of the rankings Particularly if it meant knocking my old office and its smug snake of a manager out of the top spot And so it came to pass that my new office suddenly leapt from the bottom of the barrel to being the new golden child in about two weeks Which was exactly the amount of time it took for the paperwork to come through from the other Department for me to pack my life into a suitcase and hop a plane for Capital City and for me to achieve a great big honkin triple promotion and pay rise in what was my secondonly tech support position ever        The change of status as with all other personnel changes within the Service was categorized recorded and dryly published in small writing in the Service Gazette  I photocopied the relevant section blew it up onto an A sheet and mailed it to my old office manager  And that ladies and gentlemen is the story of how I slipped the noose put the dust of my home town behind me came to the  Capital and started working for a very powerful government department indeed  During my time there I would see many things I would work on infrastructure the government swore didnt exist I would learn to program in Perl I would completely revamp the IT support section from the ground up and I would learn that government servers are home to a truly stupendous amount of porn  I would take over two hundred calls a day I would see my first truly multilanguage batch file in the wild And it was at this very job dear readers that I received The One Call I will Never Forget      But all of these tales and many more besides are stories for another time        tldr Free at last free at last  INDEX EDIT  CHAPTER

FredFltStn,175,404,1r22gy,1201,A few years ago I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop The app was actually written is basic if that tells you anything As you can imagine support was a bitchWe had a user that was having a strange issue with printing Every time he tried to print something from my application  copies came out of the printer This only happened when printing from my app When printing from Microsoft office everything was fine and dandy  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolutionThe guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC The PC had been recently refreshed so when the desktop support team couldnt figure out the issue they passed the ticket back to hardware and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time No luck on a fix and the ticket was passed back to Desktop supportActually the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times but had been unable to resolve the issue and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks It finally made it to my queue leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wakeI visited the user onsite and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on As the ticket said he could print fine from all of the other apps but printing a single page from my app resulted in  copies He must have had  sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copiesMy app actually printed through the LPT port I checked the setup and everything seemed fine The app was designed to send directly to the printer and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app so I knew that couldnt be the problem I checked the printer and it seemed normal I was seriously stumped and had tried just about everything I could think of Out of options I started playing with the printer again and going through the various menus It had been a long time since Id messed with one of the older LaserJets After about  minutes I blundered across the issue In one of the menus his printer had been manually set for  copies The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting so they would always print the selected number of copies My app just sent the basic info to the printer so the printer used the build in print menu when printingWe had easily spent more than  man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing not to mention a case of paper Modern tech at its finest Thanks for reading Im giving away free TShirts to people who participate in the rRandomactsofChristmas sub Please click herehttpredditqnfi to help us out and get a cool shirt for freeIf youre interested Ive posted a few other stories herehttpwwwredditcomuserFredFltStnsubmitted,Thousands of dollars and dozens on man hours trying to fix a printing issue,1605,TalesFromTechsupport
Warlizard,467,440,1q3wpz,1194,Ive been waiting to get some more info before I updated so here it is with clarification on exactly what happenedHeres the original post  httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentspsaetldraccountingfirmgetscryptolockervirustechIt turns out that what they wiped was ALL of the local backups  they still have the files that were encrypted by the virusI have spoken with the owner god knows how many times and it has been frustratingFrom the getgo the owners actions have baffled me I told her that if she just sent me the encrypted key Id see if I could crack it but shes apparently so techunsavvy that she simply doesnt know how to do anything at all with it Her tech has been with her for more than a decade and is a family friend however he bolted and she cant reach himNaturally shes pissed off as hell at him because well he deleted all the Carbonite backups deleted Carbonite forgot the password and cant install it backFrom one of the comments in the last post I learned that the hackers who created the virus are now allowing people to log into an onion site through Tor send an encrypted file pay about k in bitcoins then they promise theyll send the unencryption key plus a utility to unlock everythingThe owner is naturally skeptical that shell get the key after paying k plus the world of the deep web may as well be wizardry plus since her tech guy is AWOL she really has no one to help her outI told her that Id log into her server grab the carboniteencryptionpem key and see if I could get the password from it but I guess she got too busy last night to do itThis morning she sent me a text asking if we could do it today however its my birthdayI dont work on my birthday At all Period Today is the day I fuck off and do precisely what I want without thinking about anything other than doing fun thingsTo that end Im going to eat food thats bad for me drink concoctions that will inebriate me spend time with people of illrepute and do nothing at all of any valueTomorrow when I get the file Im going to throw the bit cuda version of hashcat at it and see what happensIve already pulled  down a GB collection of dictionaries but lets be real  the odds are lowThis whole thing has been really bizarre The owner should have thrown the  at the original people and gotten her shit back the tech should have WRITTEN DOWN THE FUCKING PASSWORD they never should have wiped the backups deleted Carbonite only had one backup etc but hey this is the perfect storm of shitty and it is what it isIve learned a ton of interesting stuff so for that reason alone it has been worth itAnyway Im off to get the mirror on my car fixed fuck Mercedes and their  bill that I foolishly cracked when I tapped the gates leaving my community get a hair cut and Ill continue to snapchat the fuck out of the dayOh and Ive gotten the best snaps from you guys and its really fun so if youre bored add me Warlizard and you TOO can see absolutely nothing of interest from the great state of Arizona LaterzEDIT First of all wasnt trying to be a pretentious fucktard about the mirror was just angry with myself for being a dumbass and hitting the gate because I was trying to beat it closingNext just had my car washed and the guys there are replacing the mirror fixing the cracked turn signal on the front of it fixing the crack in the bumper repainting the bumper detailing the car and wetsanding  waxing the whole car for a bit more than the dealership wanted to just replace the mirror glass So fuck the dealershipThe owner told the tech that he should cover half of the cost to get this shit fixed and thats when he bolted If I were in her shoes Id pay the k and hope I didnt get fucked It seems to me that the only way this scam works is if the hackers actually do what they say theyre going to do Sure some people would pay the  out of desperation and maybe some would lose but when people start paying k if someone anyone doesnt get their information back then far fewer people would be inclined to pay at allAnyway time to grab something to eat Ive been enjoying the snaps from you guys and the cool birthday wishes I know that Im not  years old and I shouldnt give a shit about something as trivial as a birthday but fuck it I do Its fun and its what you make itEDIT  I know this really isnt the place but I need to source a good tech for a friend of mine whos looking for a fulltime IT guy to manage his offices PC stuff Server  networking etc Its a salaried position not paying crazy but about k plus health care If anyone is interested and in the Phoenix area please let me know Its a hodgepodge of crap and you will be unappreciated plus the hours are long but its an interesting challenge mostly because managing a heterogeneous environment held together with ducttape and the tears of the frustrated can be pretty fun,UPDATE  TLDR  Accounting firm gets Cryptolocker Virus Tech wipes the server to clean it because he has Carbonite backups He cant remember password to the privately managed encryption key file and cant download the firms backup Everything lost,1634,TalesFromTechsupport

HigherEdSysadmin,193,297,1eb9ph,1190,Like many of you here Im a departmental sysadmin at a university  Over the years our staff has gotten fewer and fewer so we all have to pitch in for major events and special conferences  Thats fine Im a team player blah blah blah  Plus special events break up the routine and give me something different to doSo this week were hosting a conference for about  people roughly half of them from outside our university  Were holding it for the first time at a new conference facility that opened up on our campus a couple years back  Convenient rightWell whats become evident very quickly is that the people running the conference center are small time  Theyre accustomed to holding small alumni lunches departmental faculty meetings that sort of thing  They arent really prepared for large conferences involving a high number of nonUniversity attendees  Example the assistant operations manager when told the caterers needed to get in at AM to set up breakfast said Really  I have to get here that early  Yes you do  Unless you want to give the caterers a key  They cant set up breakfast in the parking lotSo anyway two months ago this same person told me Yes we have free guest wireless  Great  Im assuming that this means some sort of open visitor wifi perhaps timerestricted like youd often find in a hotel convention center or hospital etcOver the past two weeks Ive wanted to gain more information so I could put it in the program book yes Im designing and printing the program books cause no one else knows how to do something like that  ApparentlyCome to find out yes we have free guest wireless means something different to them than it does to me  For our attendees who are affiliated with this University no problem  We all have an assigned University username and password which will work to log on to the facilitys wifi networkFor our nonUniversity guests its a different story  Theres no available blanket visitor network  The University does have a way to purchase visitor wifi access at a nominal charge  The money is no problem but each person has to be registered individually with their own email address and phone number since were allowing onsite registration this isnt something that can be done for everyone in the pastI talked to the operations manager about this expressing my displeasure that his assistant had told us there was free guest wifi two months ago  He proceeds to explain to me that Im confused that they do in fact have free guest wifi  When they have an event with outside attendees what he does is log them on to the University wifi using HIS OWN USERNAME AND PASSWORD and he suggests that I do the same for our  external attendees  I should log them in with MY OWN USERNAME AND PASSWORD the same credentials that access my financial records my gradestranscript I was a student here my ITspecific resources on campus etc etc  And again he is sorry for my confusion on the matterNow I doubt that any of our external guests would be using their laptops during the meeting to download kiddie porn or pirate software  But Im not going to essentially promise that by logging them on with my own credentials thus putting my career at risk  I also doubt they have a keylogger installed or some other way to cachecapture my password  But they might  I dont know these peopleI sent off a stunned email to the IT guy who sort of manages their network for them the fact that they dont have fulltime IT support is clearly a factor here and he says Yeah Ive told them about that in the past Ill remind themTLDR Operations manager at conference facility suggests I provide wifi access to dozens of nonUniversity guests by using my own credentials,Yes we have free guest wireless,1487,TalesFromTechsupport

SanityInAnarchy,250,369,tuolx,1161,As long as were sharing school stories and since I dont think Ive posted this one here yet I thought Id share a few stories of hacking with such illicit tools as Windows Explorer Firefox and rightclickThe first incident was the year my high school tried to have a programming elective They were trying to teach Java but the IDE and associated tools were nowhere to be found I thought Id look around drive C to see if I could find them The network admin showed up saw me with Windows Explorer open and said Stop I dont care what youre doing just stop Pretty much wordforword with a tone that suggested any second now I might hear Step away from the computerThis being high school I was teased for hacking the system for quite awhile I didnt think much of it until much later I discovered that while the network folders were locked down with reasonable permissions the local drive was entirely worldwritable So Windows explorer was actually enough for a DoS of sorts  I could open CWinNT and just start deleting things Or worse if I was clever enough to rootkit them I wasnt and I didnt care it was just fascinating Maybe someone upgraded from a FAT drive How does this happenTLDR Surprisingly justified paranoiaWhile Im at it the admin did manage to lock down which programs could be run He did so by a whitelist apparently as there would be a number of login scripts which would fail because of this on every loginFew students were willing to risk putting such illicit material as Doom on the network drive so we loaded it onto USB keys along with a portable Firefox  Flash wasnt installed so this allowed us to play Flash games as well as easily configure proxies I also ran a proxy outside the school network as the school had the ISP filtering content for us and an actual Squid proxy pretty much completely defeated this filteringHow was this possible Doom and Firefox certainly werent on the whitelist Ah but notepadexe was and it was entirely by executable name Not even the full path just the filename Once I discovered this we all had multiple subfolders consisting of various notepadexe files Any class in which we all had access to a computer lab and were ever left unsupervised would devolve into a Legacy Doom LAN party  these may have been ancient NT machines but Doom was much older and ran perfectlyTLDR Muliplayer Notepad deathmatch,Hacking high school with Windows Explorer,1530,TalesFromTechsupport
Cyfun,177,333,1q3a4b,1156,Used to work at a cable ISP callcenter  Many of you probably know that cable modems have or used to have a Standby button on the top and if you hit it it would essentially turn off your internet  God forbid they call the button something logical like Off or Internet Disabled  Us TSAs loved these calls though cause it was the easiest fix in the worldI should also mention that we had an automated voice recording where if a person lived in or near a city with a known outage itd just tell them while theyre on hold so they didnt have to wait to talk to a real person  Unfortunately it was activated per city so it was often overkill if the outage was smallOne day a dude gets through to me cause his internet has been down for days and he asks when the outage will be fixed  I tell him theres some work being done across town but no outages affecting him directly  Have him look at his modem and sure enough its in Standby  He presses the button and his internet returnsI ask him the required Is there anything else I can help you with today He says he wants his account credited for his lack of internet the past few days  Hes not yelling at me or being pissy or anything just says it matter of factly  I explain to him that there was no outage his internet wasnt down hed somehow bumped that button and shut off the internet from his end The problem was entirely on his endHe argued that he had no way of knowing what that button meant that nobody explained it when it was installed and he never received a modem manual  I pointed out that had he called sooner we could have fixed it immediately He said that he actually called several times over the past few days and the automated recording said there was an outage affecting his area so he hung upI tried a bit more to argue against it but in all fairness he was right we did make things pretty confusing Plus he wasnt bitching me out which I did appreciate  And we had the authority to credit people up to  without requiring approval  So I crunched the numbers real quick and told him at  a month and being down for  days was only   Its enough for a sixpack he says and I agreed and credited it to himI salute you sir for being calm collected and not being a dick  You earned that ,Persistent customer gets refund for putting his own modem in Standby,1489,TalesFromTechsupport
deleted,372,438,1ewjb9,1158,I got a call from my MIL this morning complaining that her computer wouldnt turn on As in it wouldnt boot at all Nothing appeared on the screen when she pressed the power button After a few questions I found out what happenedWindows was updating It had downloaded and installed the updates and when it rebooted it had one final phase of updates to install Even though the screen said Dont power off your computer she did just that by forcing it to power offby just removing the laptop battery While it was updatingSo now her computer is screwed She lives in the States and Im in Canada so I couldnt really advise her on any quick fixes especially since the laptop is completely unresponsive I just suggested she find a reputable local tech support guy to come and take a look at it but it seems like she might have caused a power surge and fried something Anyway I thought it was sadly amusing that even though the only thing that was on the screen was text saying Dont turn off your computer she did just that There is clearly no such thing as idiotproof I wonder if when she sees a sign saying Wet paint she touches it anywayUPDATE She took it to a professional computer repair placeUPDATE  The repair place discovered that she had inadvertently installed a second virus scanner I had set her up with Avast most likely as the result of downloading and installing some other software that came with a free trial The two virus scanners were interfering with each other and she got a virus as a the result Then the whole Windows update fiasco happened Because she barely knows anything about computers I couldnt get the specifics from her but ultimately her computer got fixed and the money and time it cost her has hopefully taught her not to power down in the middle of an update again,My motherinlaw may have fried her computer because she didnt read the only text on the screen,1596,TalesFromTechsupport

that I should also be the one that services help desk work orders So now it is my responsibility to write any software solution whether it be a PHPmySQL website a VBnet site a WPF Information kiosk or an iOS app but to also make sure that I assist any of the other  employees with tech support by phone email or in person comes along and I graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science they bump me up to salary so that I dont have a reason for ignoring phoneemail tech support in the evening This seems good to me because Im finally getting paid more than hrhr At this time our IT office consists of  people Boss Tikrin and Derpette Boss sits in his lair and only helps with work orders if I can directly prove that he has messed up on his DNSswitch server or router settings Derpette is a VOLUNTEER This is where I suppose the story comes inDerpette sometime in  created a Yahoo Small business website From that moment she started to email our comments email about how she could improve our websites that we have Back to  administration at the organization have decided that it would be great for her to volunteer and help me out with the websites Always looking for a break we sit down and discuss what we both know I quickly find out that she has no idea what HTML is no idea what a motherboard is no idea on anything tech support related besides some intermediate Windows knowledgeI try informing the higher ups that she doesnt have a skillset that would really benefit IT I get reprimanded for trying to turn away someone who wants to volunteer So Derpette starts showing up on a daily basis Shes a grandma btw Late s early s I finally provide a back end interface solution for some of our websites This is good because she understands this She starts spellchecking and making sure blogs look good Something I dont have to worry about this works for meTowards November of  she gets hired as a part time staff member She assumes the role of answering any tech support emails she can Ive been able to teach her how to log into Active Directory so she can reset passwords taught her about security groups and several other things Shes finally catching on to tier  tech support things Boss finally installs a time clock server so I no longer have to walk  yards to another department to clock inout with card However they set up Derpette in a secretarial role to manage my time clock So if I forget to clock in she would be the one to approve of the time clockAlright so some time goes by and she has begun to email me any work orders she cant do and shes approving my time worked Being a good ole secretary or so I thoughtDecember  I email my Boss personally to ask if I can help out with another department for  hours a week I tell him I understand I wasnt hired for that role and its completely okay if I cant It was just something that I would love to do and would rather try to do it than not I also tell him that I understand if he has to take it higher up He replies with a Ill see what they say and CCs Derpette to let her know that I may be doing this for  hours a weekI immediately get a response from Derpette to only me asking why I thought it was okay to email my boss first instead of her She starts rambling about a chain of authority and how I shouldnt circumvent it I inform her that Boss is my boss and the first person I should be asking She responds with another email saying that we will talk personally about this the next dayNext day comes along and nothing is said shrugs Over the next couple of weeks she starts sending me mediocre work orders Work orders that she could handle I inform her that Im busy working on an Adminapproved programming assignment and she says that I should do them because she wouldnt have sent them to  me otherwise OooookaySo I do the work orders Trying to squeeze in the programming projects that I have deadlines on Eventually it starts getting ridiculous We have a remote location  miles away They email to say that their dual monitors are not working anymore on one of the computers Derpette emails them back and says that I would gladly start driving that wayI inform her that I would not and that we could either try to remote in or they could bring it to usThey have a runner that comes to us everyday Remote location says that isnt a problem and the runner gives us the computer I hook it up and it works perfectly I double check just to make sure and give it back with two new DVI cables I even write down some instructions of how to set up dual monitorsA week goes by and I show up to work Im now tasked to drive  miles to the remote location because I didnt fix anything Everyone is gone from the location that day so I cant remote in I have to drive there and fix it Disgruntled I get a company car and make the drive I get there and lo and behold one of the DVI cables is not hooked up Simply hook it up and yep dual monitors working I take a picture and text it to Derpette for accountability that the problem is now fixed I then start to head back to my office  miles away She corresponds with me a little bit on the road and everything seems okay I reach the outskirts of our town when she emails back and says BTW did you fix the other thing they needed doneI having no idea responded I have no idea what youre talking aboutShe then forwards me an email between the remote location and her In the PS section the remote location asks for me to look at another monitor hookup She adds to the email Do you not know what a monitor looks like This needs to be done so turn around and go do itI flip park my car and then send an email letting her know how sick I am of her attitude She responds back all hurt saying that she is offended Once again it ends with a Well discuss in person tomorrowSo I drive back to the remote location and the monitor turns on with a shake of a mouseNEXT DAY I come to work having no reason or want to talk to Derpette She walks into my office closes the door and pulls up a chair She then says Its sad that I have to tell you Im your bossbut Im your boss And you should consider yourself lucky or you would be fired after what you emailed me yesterday My boss then walks in to crack a joke about somethingI could tell from his smirk but she quickly demands that he leave so that we could talk She then rants on about how she has been my boss ever since the time clock server was installed and was absolutely shocked that I didnt pick up on that I tell her that no one has ever told me that she was my boss and that if she was I am sorry Her response was No one should have to tell you that Im your boss you should just know Ill have to bring this up to Administration because your lack of respect isnt going to get you anywhereTwo days go by and I get pulled into Administration Im completely baffled that Im being called by them and surely Im not getting fired Nope They apologize for Derpettes behavior and have no idea where she got the notion she was my boss If she ever tried to do something like that again I should only need to tell themSo it ended well but geez she got crazyEDIT grammar,Its sad that I have to tell you Im your boss,1466,TalesFromTechsupport

DoctorWhoToYou,279,257,1cfxar,1131,I have been involved in tech for  years It has been both a profession and a hobby for me One thing I have always done for cash on the side is computer repair  All of my business is word of mouth because if I were to actually advertise I couldnt work a full time job and do all the side work I tried doing it as a stand alone business for a while but there is a lot of competition so I decided to just keep it as side work There are a lot of people in my area that take advantage of the less technically inclined Ive run across it multiple times  This is one of those storiesAbout two years ago I had a voice mail message from a gentleman that was having trouble with what he described as a liquid cooled gaming computer I made house calls and he somehow got my number from a past customer I called him back and made an appointment to go to his houseI arrived at the house and was kind of concerned because it was somewhat run down for the area I tried not to judge rechecked the address realized it was right and parked my truck I walked up to the house all the curtains were pulled shut and it sincerely looked like no one lived there There was no car in the driveway there were no signs of lifeI hesitantly knocked at the door The curtain in the bay window cracked open just enough for me to see an eye I then heard WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT screamed through the door at me I replied with You talked to me about fixing your computer we had an appointment set for today  Everything was dead silent for a minute Then I heard multiple locks unbolt and a safety chain get removedThe door swung open and the guy asked me for identification I was rather confused but I handed him my drivers license He looked at it for a few seconds held it out and looked at the picture then looked back at me then looked back at the picture and then said Okay you check out  I am not really sure who I check out with butokay I check outI stepped into the house and I was instantly overwhelmed with the smell The guy immediately gave me a feeling of Randy Quaids characterhttpiimgurcomuYPHLqjpg from Not Another Teen MovieThe conversation that took place inside the door was him telling me that his computer was running slow he couldnt play the games because they failed to start and he couldnt get a hold of the guy that usually worked on his computerI asked him to take me to the computer When we walked through the house the guy was clearing the rooms He would duck behind the wall look into the room then enter the room He did this through the two rooms we passed through as I followed him I was already regretting stepping foot in the houseWe made it into his kitchen His computer sat at a table where he had moved a recliner to be more comfortable The table was packed with food wrappers cans and overflowing ashtrays It was a messThe first thing I noticed was that his gaming computer was conveniently housed in a Compaq Presario case I can only imagine it was early pentium technology I never actually got to seriously look at the computer  Mostly because I was so focused on the teflon line that ran from the side panel of his computer to the kitchen faucet By this time I am really really regretting stepping foot in the house So I ask him to go ahead and boot the computer up for me I honestly didnt want to touch it It was dirty the keyboard looked like he was eating meals off of it and I am pretty sure that there were some fluids attached to it that I didnt want to make contact withOkay I will boot it but it will take a few minutes I watched as he walked over to his kitchen sink latched a boot to the faucet put the exit tube into the sink and then turned the cold water on  He then walked back to the computer and hit the power buttonI walked over to the sink the teflon tube ran from the sink to the computer and then back to the sink to drain I was now at the point of This has to be a joke there has to be cameras somewhere around here But nope Guy was seriousThe computer booted after a while I told him to go ahead and shut it down because I needed to look inside I seriously needed to look inside I wanted to see how this water cooled system was plumbed just to satisfy my own curiosityI told him that I needed to pop the side panel off the computer He was hesitant and said I am going to watch you I want to make sure youre not planting any bugs Because you know I actually care what this guy is doing on his computerI popped the side off the tower where the teflon lines ran in The teflon lines ran in did two great big loops and ran right back out of the case There was no connections for the tubing on the panel It was literally two holes drilled teflon line ran in one hole did two big loops and then ran right back out the second hole I could hold the panel and there was no plumbing connected to anything but the panel Every time this guy booted his computer he would turn his sink on water would run through this system and then discharge back into the sinkThe first thing I noticed was the liquid cooling plumbing the second thing I noticed was that his heatsink was packed with tar dust tobacco cat hair and I would imagine other stuff that would give me some incurable disease The fan in the back of the computer was so packed full oficky that it wasnt even turning anymoreI instinctively blurted out This isnt liquid cooled this isnt even close to liquid cooled whoever did this scammed you out of money Evidently this was the wrong thing to say The guy who regularly worked on his computer was his nephew Regardless of what I knew his nephew knew moreI told him that the teflon tubes were doing absolutely nothing but sweating pooling water in the bottom of his case and rusting out his case and probably causing some moisture issues inside his computer I was immediately told I had no clue what I was talking about His nephew had installed this cooling system for  and the computer was running great up until a few days agoAfter trying to explain to this guy that the computer needed blown out to get rid off all the dust that his rear fan was dead and definitely needed replaced that the teflon lines were doing nothing to help cool his computer and telling him that he probably needed a thorough operating system cleaning he called me a liar I had met my limit and although I cant fix this usually isnt in my vocabulary I said I cant fix this  To add insult to injury the guy then said Yea my nephew said it was a pretty complex system that most techs wouldnt understand I then made the mistake of telling the guy that his nephew was screwing him just in a nicer way  This was met with instant hostility and I was asked to leave his house Which I gladly did I was actually a bit concerned for my safety at this point because I knew I was dealing with someone who was a few cards short of a full deckAbout a week later my phone rang with his number again I let it go to voice mail The message was basically berating me because his nephew had come over and had the computer fixed within  minutes and it only cost him I shot down to my local PD to talk to them to see if there was anything I could do But the PD basically told me I was powerless The guy didnt do anything directly to me and unless he specifically complains about being taken advantage of they cant do anything They knew who I was talking about because theyve done welfare checks on him in the pastI tried to back track who he got my number from to let them know his nephew was siphoning money out of him while ruining his computer but I couldnt find out how he got my number Unfortunately everything I tried just ended up in a dead end While I was there I sincerely wanted to take pictures of it but I am pretty sure if I whipped out my phone and started taking pictures this dude would have lost itSo as far as I know to this day every time this guy boots his computer it starts with him walking to his sink turning on the water and then booting his computer I highly doubt the computer is even actually running anymore Ive worked with elderly people and other questionable people in the past but no one ever to this point I now

bhnchd,163,246,1jn9jv,1079,Longtime lurker first time poster  This is an encounter that I will remember for the rest of my lifeI used to be a contractor with the military doing mostly computer security documentation one of which was tracking security vulnerabilities for our computer systems  The agency that we fell under sent out auditors every so often to run security vulnerability scans to make sure we have all of our systems patchedIn this particular instance one of these scans checked for a vulnerability in Microsoft Office by checking to see if a particular file or registry entry exists if they exist then its patched  If the file and registry entry arent there its vulnerable  They ran the scan on one of our servers which did not have MS Office on it so naturally the scan couldnt find the patch or the registry entry on the system  After we went over the results we marked the finding as a falsepositive and gave it back to them  This is the subsequent conversation between the auditors and we contractorsAuditor OK so I see you marked this as a falsepositive You need to change it backContractors Oh but we dont have Office on the server so its not vulnerableAuditor Doesnt matter you still need to install the patchContractors But we cant install the patch because Office isnt on the systemAuditor Then you need to install Office on it then install the patchContractors But that would just introduce a whole slew of new vulnerabilities not just this oneAuditor Doesnt matter we cant mark the finding as fixed unless the scan finds the registry entryContractors So you mean to tell me that we need to INTRODUCE a vulnerability to the system by installing a piece of software with holes so we can patch it rather than just leave it without the vulnerability in the first placeAuditor Thats correct  And you need to do it before we leave or it will count against youContractors HeaddeskYour tax dollars at work folks This is just one of a thousand examples of how scarily asinine the government is and why Im so glad Im not working with them anymoreEDIT FormattingEDIT  Just to clarify Im not saying everyone or everything in the government is to blame Ive met people there who are extremely intelligent and who know their jobs well however I and my colleagues have also experienced astounding levels of incompetence in the govt sphere at multiple sites that for me personally Im glad to be away from it now YMMV,Doesnt matter if the system isnt vulnerable MAKE it vulnerable so you can patch it,1325,TalesFromTechsupport

SilentDis,185,325,w62i0,1077,Things continued swimmingly with Phil for the next few months  I could handle himhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentswfwuangrycluelessyouhavemetyourmatch and I was his only contact at our companyhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentswzaphilelectricboogalooMost of his calls were still entirely outside our support boundries he had a horrible time with printers scanners fax machines and at one point his fridge that he was sure was Internet related  Every time I came down with the same firm response of Nope we dont help with that  Our stuff works heres the number to talk toI remember a few issues that I actually did help him with but they were exceptionally few and far betweenOnce hed manually renewed his domain through a rd party saving himself  or so on our renewal fee and hed then given them incorrect pointer info hosing his domain horribly in the process  I did the expeditious thing and just took responsibility on that one got the phone number for his support company and wayed him and myself in with them  Phil verified security and then handed off to me  I efficiently listed off the A and MX records we needed the other tech made the change and we were done in less than  minutes  I then took  minutes to explain to Phil how hes now waiting  hours for it to propagate down  This set him off a bit but I countered with the fact that he wanted to save the  and take all of it away from us and that was fine but thats what hed have to deal with  It shut him up quickAnother time he installed AOL and hosed himself  It was an older version that would bind itself up in weird and interesting ways to the various network adapters causing no end to headaches for connecting with anything other than AOL  I again explained to him that I could make XYZ work but he was on his own with AOL and if it happened again wed just keep breaking AOL to make XYZ work if he wanted better talk to AOL or ditch themThis got frustrating to Phil  He couldnt have his rousing hourlong bitchfests in which hed make people cry or make people question the life choices that lead them inexorably to dealing with their lord and master Phil  Basically I wasnt fun to call because I had the answers and the process down to an artSo once the shiny of having my own tech to abuse wore off he started calling the general helpline again  Usually after being told to take his printer problem elsewhere from me  There was a big flag on the account indicating that he didnt get support from anyone but me and sometimes he just found himself coldtransferred to either my voice mail or to my line if I was in  That was perfectly fine by me not to Phil of course whod just hang up when he herd my voice and recall the main line  I knew it was him though as our Caller ID system was sweet in that it kept original data through cold transfers  Id just make a note that hed called and hung upAfter a time though he would badger someone else on the helpline long enough to get them sucked into a call with him  Id gotten few if any actual calls from him lately  At first I chalked it up to Oh I finally cluesticked him into understanding but upon checking his account I saw other techs logs popping up at weird hours when I was out of the officeThing is they knew they were supposed to dump him on me  They knew they were supposed to not help him in any way  But there it was plain as day  sighI mentioned this to my supervisor and he did his best to put a stop to it  Emails coaching cubeside with the other agents etc  It was brought up at our monthly meeting in fact all techs for  hours in  room to go over general things like this while Tier took calls directly and stated in no uncertain terms that Phil doesnt get help from us you dump him on this extension  PeriodIt helped little  Many of you whove worked in tech know theres always a few lowhanging fruits in the group that just drag everyone else down  When you have  agents its bound to happen  As good as management was about weeding these people out they still managed to hang on thanks to a corporate environmentOf course Phil pushes and pushes and I have to give him credit where credits due hed manage to suck a good number of people into his little game of make the tech rip their hair out  Eventually hed not call me anymore because he found it much more fun to scream at the brick wall or attempt the fun whackamole game of finding the one bad or poorly informed tech to tormentHe got one eventually  She was a newish hire so I cant blame her entirely  On the floor for  weeks and now reduced to a puddle of tears in the middle of the isle  She quit that day  I knew what happened even before Id been told directly and I was furious  I felt like I had personally let her down regardless of the fact that she didnt heed the rather interesting special note and popup that his account generated the only account that when you pulled it up would also pop a fullscreen bright red box with pt white type that told you to direct the customer to me and not help themThe next day my supervisor called me into an unused meeting room  floor up  I was greeted by the director of the help desk the lead Tier agent the telecom hardware director and the system administrator who managed the webhosting serversemail serversetc  Id met all these people and they were really decent folk but Ill be honest I figured theyd decided to blame me for the whole Phil situation that happened the day before to that poor girl and I was getting the axeAnother person in expensive suit and tie walked in and I was introduced to the CIO of XYZ Incorporated  FuckThey started out asking how I felt about the whole situation  They all knew I wasnt one to pull punches that I was very blunt and when cornered rather crassI believe the first thing I said to this meeting of the bigwigs was From what I can tell of the people gathered here today Im the lucky fuck who gets to have this shit storm hung around his neck and you intend to each take an arm to make sure I land squarely under the bus  I ooze class when Im cornered I admit itDeafening silence ensues  It lasts a good few minutes  I take stock of the faces in the room from my little tirade the systems guys are eyes wide but bemused  The CIO is slackjawed I dont think hes herd such an honestcrass combo before cool  My floor supervisor is hiding his mouth in his hands attempting not to show his laugh  Meh  Let the fireworks begin Im going down with a bang not a whimper in this one Ive decidedThe system administrator pipes up Umm Actually No  But I can see how itll look that way  Well thats all fine and dandy could you clue me in before I go ahead and shoot my other foot then  This got a laugh out of my floor supervisor and the tensions eased considerably  The CIO cracked a smile as wellSince you appear to appreciate bluntness Ill return it in kind the CIO said  Youre not fired  We are on the other hand attempting to decide what to do about Phil  Since Im not fired and all these people are here and you all know what Phil has done Id say its pretty obvious what to do about Phil  He doesnt have more than a few thousand dollars a year in profit for this company yet hes monopolized my time and made a rather sweet new girl quit  He is a horrible person and should be kicked to the curb  Why sugar coat the obviousThat was our thought too began the telecom director  But we figured wed try one other option  Would you consider going on call for Phil  As in wed route his calls to a cell phone that youd have   That depends how big of a raise are you offering me to go with thatEveryone has their price even me  Ill deal with Phil  but its not going to be cheapWell we wouldnt be able to bump your paygrade began my floor supervisor  I cut him off  Then thats not happening is itThis illicited a chuckle from the CIO  I like you right to the point and honest  But you are going to make the call to Phil to tell him were giving him the boot  After what happened yesterday Id be a little pissed if you didnt give that to me consideringAnd so it came to pass  A registered signature required special delivery went out that very day containing a legallydrawn up endofservice notice  I was given the tracking number and watched it like a hawk  I knew when it was signed for and I even had a little digital copy of Phils signature to prove it  I gave him a half hour to read it then called him upMe This is SilentDis from XYZ support calling  Is Phil available  Phil Um this this is Phil He sounds hurt  How touching  Me Phil I am calling on behalf of XYZ to confirm the contents of the letter you signed for half an hour ago  We are terminating any and all services you have with us due to the abusive nature of your calls  Do you understand  Phil You cant do this  I pay my bills on time why would you do this  Do you know how much money youll lose every month  This little tirade continues for a good  minutes  Its normal Phil though  A little popup appears in the corner of my screen from my onfloor supervisor  Apparently  of the help desk and much of the upper management is currently listening in  I respond back fuck you I dont want a goddamn audience which earns me a distant guffaw from over the cubicle farm  I mute myself as hes continuing to rant and shout Dont you people have anything better to do  A chorus of chuckles and No rings backPhil eventually runs out of steam on his rant  Hes not switched to legal threats yet as that was never his way amazingly enoughMe Phil this is exactly why were terminating our services with you  You are abusive you are rude and you do not listen  You cost us in manhours more than what we make from the services we provide  To top it off you made a rather nice person quit her job after  weeks  XYZ has decided that you are a liability to provide service to rather than any sort of benefit  Your service will terminate tomorrow at midnight  At that time we will make a final copy of your website and of any email sitting on our servers burn it to CD and send it to you via the same carrier we used to deliver the notice you received today  I would still recommend backing it up yourself  Phil I dont know how to do that I shouldnt have to  This isnt  Me Phil it is right it is fair  We as a company simply no longer wish to do business with you  Its fine if you do not know how to backup your site were doing it for you anyway and youll get the CD in the mail  Please understand we will no longer help you with anything going forward calls to this number will go unanswered and we will not sell new service to you  This call isnt to help you with anything its simply to inform you  Good day  Phil  he actually managed to respond just before I pushed release  very meekly Yeah byeclickThe next thing I hear is thunderous applause from across the help desk  The queue was basically forgotten and had stacked up to the s but it didnt matter  Phil was goneWe actually had a potluck party the next day in celebration  I brought a pieTLDR Mmm  Pie,Phil   The Final Insult,1402,TalesFromTechsupport
campycapper,400,285,xev2e,1075,I have a tale for you of the teacher I may have to kill For this tale I am going to call him Bob Bob is a good guy except he believes he is a tech genius and that my job could be done by trained rabbits Now I am going to have to back into this story a bit so hold with me A year ago I was able to get a grant and put new computers into every classroom in my school I am a teacher and a tech support Every classroom either received laptops or really nice desktops Now installing this computers was no issue and in every classroom they have  worked with limited upkeep from me for a year All of them except Bobs computers Over the last year I have had Bob do a emergency reformat on his own computers because he thought he had a virus It was windows security essentials He did the reformat and half way turned the computers off and tried to boot in the morning So i come into work the next day with my boss yelling and freaking out that I have to go look at Bobs computers because nothing at all is working I have witnessed as he has attempted to installed Did not know at the time how he was doing this because he did not have permissions different software that dates back to the windows ME timeline because he must have the software because he used it last time he had computers This again ended with him attempting to a emergency recovery of the computers So the next day I walk in to my boss yelling that I have to go down and look at Bobs computers because nothing is working For the networking cables that run behind the computers he has cut the ends of them off because he thought they did not look good He has also rewired his classroom by himself at night and taken every cable hooked from my switch to the computer and feed it back into the switch Did not end well for my switch and as  I walked in I received the all too familiar yelling that I had to go look at Bobs computers But this summer took the cake and I finally had enough of Bob and proceeded to do a bit of yelling myself At the end of the spring semester Bobs unhooked his computers for storage I had told him to leave everything alone so that I could clean up and do a bit of routine maintenance on his machines while he was gone for two months He refused to listen Well I thought to myself at least he just packed up the computers it will not take me that long to re hook everything and do the maintenance No such luck I finally was able to get down to Bobs classroom and all the computers were still connected but there was no power going to the room Bob had turned off the power breakers so nobody could use his classroom Not a big deal but pain in the ass I turn the breakers on and started the machines The first machine I went to I tried to use the mouse and nothing tried to use the keyboard and nothing Checked the back of the tower and everything was connected and the board and mouse both had power going to them Thought maybe they just did not recognize at first Tech support  I restarted my computer Same problem So I decided to unplug the mouse and keyboard and replug them to see if they recognize Sure enough familiar ping and new hardware installed correctly My mind was boggled so I pulled the mouse out again and started to switch it with another mouse when it hit me He had cross wired all the computers So the mice and keyboard in front of a computer were all tied to different computers I was furious and dumbfounded What purpose could this have possible served So I bite my tongue and rewire the classroom and since I have seen this I check my switch Sure enough he has wired all of the network cables from the back of the towers to each other and the computers on the end were tied back into the switch Creating this giant loop of network cable ling that was tied and cut to make it good looking It was here that my mind started to explode I had already dealt with this exact same ridiculousness once and yelled at him and he has done it a second time Once I was able to get everything redone new cables run and all the computers up and running it was time to leave Now remember this is summer break and Bob is supposed to be gone for two months Nobody was to be in that room it was locked up Well I had to go on a business trip so I was going to finished updating and cleaning his computers once I got back Then I went in yesterday HE HAD DONE IT AGAIN Every computer was cross wired He had clipped the ends of the network cables and turned it into a giant loop ring network He had flipped the breaker and taken all the mice from the computers so that I had no mice When I walked into the classroom blood poured from my nose and ears Steam rolled from my eyeballs and I screamed the profanities of a thousand sailors Bob no longer has computers Apparently I was the only It guy willing to deal with Bob and since I have made it perfectly clear that I am willing to put him out of his misery The administration has chosen to remove his technology He doesnt even get a teacher desktop Side note How he was able to subvert not having the privileged set for him to change the computer was by bribing an older tech guy for his password Older tech guy

theOtherJT,158,223,1bzoi7,1073,I apologize for the length of this one so get some coffee preferably with something strong to fortify it and dig in As usual all conversations are somewhat paraphrased and all names anonymized to protect the guiltyRather surprisingly Monday last week I was asked if I could prepare some laptops for a conference that would be going on today This came as a shock because what normally happens is someone rocks up at my office first thing in the morning and says Im just off to a conference now and I need a laptop to take with me can I have one please which leads to the inevitable No you cant because you didnt give us any notice and theyre all on loan to other people and then someone going away in a huff and complaining about how unhelpful IT are This time however the brief was remarkably clear We need  laptops running linux with all the departmental software that has been purchased by our research group installedOk so actually thats a bit cheeky because the research groups have their own laptops they theyve paid for and demanded root access to and are therefore meant to manage themselves However since theyd actually given me a whole weeks notice I decided to be nice and set up their machines for themThis was a mistake What software do you have licensed for your groupI dont knowOk what software do you need for this conferenceI dont knowRight well in that case Ill do a default install and can you please get back to me if theres anything above and beyond that that you needThat sounds great thankyouSo off I go do the install then call back on Tuesday So the machines are ready can you just give me the licence keys for any additional software you need Ill hunt down the install packagesI dont know what software we have licensedOK do you know who doesI dont knowsigh Ill call aroundSo I called around a few members of staff and finally managed to track down all the things that theyd ordered through purchasing and one thing that we happened to have a couple of keys for that theyd not officially paid for through the department but must have gotten from somewhere else Installed all of that and took the machines back Wednesday afternoon Whilst I was there asked them to do one thing Could you please find someone whos actually going to this conference and get them to check that everything they need is installed on here before they leaveI dont know whos goingWell find out and get them to check okOkFade to this morning the phone ringsOh hey its person from the conference group software isnt installed on this laptop and I need it for a presentation someone is giving at Ok did you not check the laptop before taking it there like I asked you too last weekUm I dont knowDo you have a licence for softwareI dont knowAt this point Im wondering if theres anything they do know like perhaps what day it is or what their name might beOk well as far as I can tell you dont actually own software so its not been installedIm sure we do we use it in the department all the timeYes the department owns that but youre not in the department right now and even if you were we dont manage those laptops you do You insisted on it As I explained to you last week those machines are stand alone and you need a stand alone licence Thats why I asked you what licences you have Weve been through this Who handles licencing for your groupI dont knowFind Outbut Im feeling pretty good natured this morning and the staff room coffee is doing sterling work so I decided to have a looksee if I could find out for her Turns out I can Attached to a ticket in the RT queue from  repeated in  AND  ccd to this very person is the following You can generate licence keys for software by going to website and entering your email address and the following code DO NOT LET person responsible for licencing lose them like they did last time AND THE TIME BEFOREI forwarded this on to the user out at the conference site and  minutes later the phone rangI got your email I dont remember doing any of this before person responsible for licencing says theyve not done it eitherReally seems unlikely given that you replied to the email in RT and in fact have done so every year for the last  years but lets try and be politeWell regardless thats what you need to do When you get the new keys theyll come with a link to the software download and you can install it yourselfOh is it not already installedgive me strength No Please follow the instructions on the websitean hour passes The phone rings againperson responsible for licencing says theyve been trying this for an hour and it doesnt work HelpHave they followed the instructions on the website that I sentI dont know Can I just bring the machines back in Im only a  minute drive awayok its like that then I know I shouldnt do this but Alright lets do it Sure ok bring them back and Ill test the licence generating thing whilst youre on your wayWhich I did And it works Perfectly There is however a proviso waiting in the thankyou text Please note that new keys will take  hours to come into force So theyre screwed either way with that one But hey this means I dont have to go through the teeth pulling process of finding out how many steps in the software licencing procedure she doesnt know about Instead well just install the network licensed copy set up a VPN so the machines think theyre still here and everythingll be good rightSo she shows up I tell her what Im going to do she agrees that its a good idea and I get to work In the mean time could she please tell me whos going to use the machines so I can preconfigure the VPN connection for them Um I dont knowRight in that case Ill set them all to authenticate as you ok Are you registered for remote accessI dont knowFine Ill look it up Whats your usernametake a guess whats coming nextI dont knowSo whilst the install is going on these machines Im looking up her username setting her up with remote access configuring the VPN and with  minutes to spare before the pm presentation shes good to go and taking them away again Feeling pleased with myself both for a job well done and not murdering her despite severe provocation I go to lunch like I should have an hour ago I return from lunch to  missed calls Help software isnt working Its saying it doesnt have a licence keyDid you connect to the VPN like I showed youOh I just gave the laptops to the guys giving the presentationDid they connect to the VPN like I showed youI dont knowOk can you go get one of the machines and Ill talk you through it over the phoneWhich I then had to do Four times Honestly I think it would have been easier for everyone if Id just murdered her after allTLDR User doesnt know User doesnt know anything,and the big bad I Dont

sawser,285,247,17h4tq,1070,This story popped into memory while writing my previous talehttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsgdapsiryoursonisafelon earlier todayThis one was bitter sweet since in this case the bad guy was quite awesomeBackstory again Working tier  software tech support for an ecommerce payment company that works exclusively with higher education Our department handles calls from university technicians and office workers not students We work with the same customers day to day so we tend to develop report rapport and learn the quirks of our customersIn this case we got a call from a frantic bursarHey Sawser does your guys software prevent someone from making repeated quick paymentsUh no Gregfake  we dont Whats going on Well it looks like we got close to  payments last night Typically we get around So I remoted into their system to check out log files etc Sure enough they had roughly  individual transactions Even better they were roughly  cent payments all to the same accountA quick tutorial for those who arent familiar with Credit Card merchantsThe merchant who takes your credit card generally pays a small flat rate per transaction plus a few percentage points to a credit card processor The rates change wildly based upon how much money your take in a month if your system takes the ZIP code and CVV information and if you negotiated your ratesThis school paid  cents   per transaction Which meant every  cent transaction they took they paid  cents to the credit card processorThis student paid their k tuition payment in ten cent increments but almost k went to the credit card processor in fees edit  update Since I clarified technical details below Ill update this as well k didnt actually go to the processor it would have gone to the processor had they settled the batch containing those transactions After a few days of additional research we found that what happened was a Computer Science student was screwed out of a class he needed and was forced to wait an extra semester to graduate This guy was not happy so he wrote a bot to open up a few dozen windows and crank away making payments He also told the university that Discover was having a promotion where for each payment he made they entered him in a contest to win some big prize I guess we can call that a winwin The kicker There wasnt any notices that bots werent allowed so he technically didnt abuse any of the systems and couldnt get in troubleWe did write a script to refund all the transactions and put checks to make sure that multiple payments couldnt be made but it just goes to show Dont piss off computer guysIn fact I wouldnt be surprised if it was one of you bastardsEDIT To avoid confusion  we wrote a script to cause our software to issue the k transactions refunds void the k transactions Thus the money never left the students account In the end the students money was returned no fees were paid to the processor and the student paid his full tuition with a single payment  dollars to the credit card processor I imagine There wasnt any harm done except a handful of sleepless nights in the Business office and a couple hours of a developers times to write the refund scripts EDIT  Im going to add more technical detail since this got bigger and because there are a few posts regarding the legality of what happened I didnt elaborate on this before for simplicity but its become important Credit Card payments occur in two steps The credit card is authorized  this is to ensure the money exists in your account and when you look at your account balance and you see pending transactions this is the state those transactions are in The authorized amount hasnt been removed from the account but the money is frozen for  business days  The credit authorization is settled   this step removes the money from your account and deposits it minus processing fees into the merchants account Generally merchants are charged an additional fee per settlement  so settlements are grouped into batches Thus your authorizations may not be settled for  or  days depending on the settlement habits of the merchant you paid In this case the school did not settle the transactions Because there was no settlement money had never changed hands I used the term refund above for brevity but in commerce speak the transactions were actually voided Because they were voided and not refunded and no money changed hands the school was in the clear It is not my intention to get anyone into trouble or embarrass the school Ive got plenty of stories Ill be posting more through out the week ,Technically he paid his full tuition off,1317,TalesFromTechsupport

cobysev,226,279,161g1p,1050,Nearly a decade ago I was working on a helpdesk at a US Air Force base in JapanBecause we were just across the water from North Korea we were constantly preparing for worstcase scenarios  We call them exercises and they would typically last anywhere from a week to a month  During an exercise we would simulate a wartime environment  We would have various simulated scenarios occur that we might see during an actual attack  Unexploded mortars lying near the building signs of chemicalnerve agent mist in the air wounded victims lying in the streets unauthorized people trying to talkforce their way into our secured facilities etcOne day during one of these exercises our squadron commander a Lieutenant Colonel LtCol showed up with a large plate of homemade chocolate chip cookies  He came in early in the morning while the night shift was still working and he left the plate in the middle of the office where it would be highly visibleHe told the night shift not to eat any cookies and not to tell the day shift where they came from  He then leftOf course the day shift comes in and instantly starts digging into the plate of cookies  Nobody questioned their origin most people assumed that someones spouse delivered them  Exercises are miserable times for us and sometimes spouses like to bring us baked goods to improve moraleIn the early afternoon the LtCol returned to the helpdesk  There are a couple cookies left on the plate  He asks the room Where did these cookies come from  No one had an answer for him  Not a single person knewOkay he said how about this  Whos been eating these cookies  Every hand went up except for one lowranking Airman  This guys rank was Airman E  This is typically the lowest rank you can have and not be in Basic Training or tech school  So this guy was very young and brandnew  Practically no experience and still learning his jobThese cookies were poisoned explained the LtCol  Everyone who just raised their hand youre now dead  Go stand over in the corner  The whole room shuffled to one corner of the office and crowded around a large meeting room desk  The lone Airman stayed putYou Airman are the highestranking person left  So youre in charge of the entire helpdesk  Good luck  And then he turned to the crowd in the corner and told them Remember youre all dead so no talking and no helping the Airman out  Hes on his own got it  Then he leftThat poor Airman ran the helpdesk by himself in the middle of a stressful exercise for a half hour before the LtCol returned and resurrected the whole officeThe moral of the story is not to touch any food that magically appears in your office  If you dont know where it came from keep it out of your mouthTLDR  LtCol secretly delivers poisoned cookies to the helpdesk during an exercise  He killed off anyone who ate them everyone except for one new guy  He left that one guy in charge of all operations by himself for a very stressful half hour,Lieutenant Colonel Kills Off the Helpdesk to Make a Point,1329,TalesFromTechsupport

SilentDis,139,332,w4fwu,1033,EDIT Thanks all for the comments  Ive been meaning to get these down for a while  Part httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentswzaphilelectricboogaloo is now available  The finale is in part httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentswiphilthefinalinsult This happened many many moons ago  If I had to guess it was sometime between  and At the time I was working helpdesk for an ISP that was growing from the local provider level to a regional provider  Theyd buy up ISPs here and there and roll them into our service  In all honesty they were a very very decent company good tools access for all the techs our Tier at the time was all of  away in the cubicle farm and very affable to talk to  Tours of our main datacenter were always available and the kit they were using was topnotch  On top of that it was all very very well documentedWe had a caller whom Ill call Phil  Phil had a DSL line through us with a backupon the road dialup account with a couple email addresses we managed a domain and small exceptionally simple webhosting account little if any scripting support  It was rolled into a businessclass billing structure of course meaning that he paid a bit more and his webhost was on a slightly higherend server from the MiB Free server and they gave an uptime guarntee on his DSL  Pretty basic stuffPhil though was anything but basic  He was horribly mean nasty and clueless in all things tech  Hed also call for anything multiple times  I remember seeing a few items in the call logs for stuff like problems with various office equipment  A good example was when he bought himself a flatbed scanner and called us to help him with it  I luckally didnt get one of those calls somehow but there was a good week straight where hed call multiple times a day trying to get it to work the ticket log would have Scanner Wont Work listed a good  times spanning a solid  daysHe was horribly abusive to other techs women especially as you may have guessed  I herd stories of others leaving the floor in tears after and during calls with PhilI took a few calls from Phil and I personally didnt have too much trouble with him  The thing was I was and still am an extreme stickler for process flow of calls staying inside support boundries being exceptionally clear and hitting the call record button when I stepped outside them that people wouldnt get this help here ever again  Phil of course tried every opportunity to yell bluster cajole blame and be rude to anyone who attempted to show him the slightest hint of leniency or kindness concerning linear tech supportMy first call with Phil was a model for all further calls I personally had with himMe Good afternoon XYZ tech support my names SilentDis  May I have your name please  Phil This is Phil  Me Alrighty Phil how can I help you today  Side note I learned long long ago to just get a name and let the customer vent  If I cant find their contact info from the Caller ID Ill get it soon enough  This makes callers feel that youre a human and on their side  Phil I am trying to get the page you are hosting to connect to my printer and it wont connect  What is wrong with your company are you behind the times  This is a new printer why dont you support it  I swear Ill take my service somewhere else if you people dont wise up and fix this mess and get it working  Im paraphrasing a bit here but this was the tone tenor and reason for his call to a tee  I pressed the call record button at this point which will backtrack and record the entire conversation  Me Ok so youre having problems printing a website is this correct  Always get that verbal contract  Phil I just told you what the problem is  Werent you listening  Whats wrong with you  and on and on and onMe I just like to be sure Im helping you out as best I can  You are having problems printing a webpage is this correct  Phil Yes  I cant print the webpage you are hosting on my new printer  Verbal contract established  Me Ok  Were not really able to help out with printer problems but  Phil Why cant you help me whats wrong with you  Youre not good at your job are you  Me Sir do not insult me  As I was saying Were not able to help out with printer problems but I can help you make sure everything we do help with is working properly  Ive pulled up your account from Caller ID  I see everythings in good standing and I see no reported outages for your area  Can you hold one moment while I verify the connections from my side  Phil  Fine  Me Thank you be right backWelcome to the penalty box Phil population you  I telnet into the various switches and routers hes attached to and see his modem as attached physical layer is good  Send a ping on the Data layer fine  Send a ping on network layer and dont get a response  Thats fine firewall is in place  I ask for the stats on that line wait a minute and ask again theyve gone up  Hes sending data over the line without any issue whatsoever GoldenI check his website a Geocitiesesque site selling various bricabrac  Whatever it comes up  SSH into the server and it shows a nice  uptime  Ping his site from the switch hes attached to no problems therePhils been in the penalty box for a good  minutes now lets see how thats changed his attitudeMe Sorry about that sir  I list off all the tests I performed above nonstop without break throwing in a few technical terms here and there  Phil Uhh perfect  Ive gooed his little brain exactly my intent  Me Since everythings working on this side lets make sure everythings working on your sideI walk him through opening up a webpage opening up his webpage and checking his email  All work without problemMe Now thats what we support your Internet connection is working your website is working your email is working  You stated though youre having problems printing which is not something we support  Who makes your printer  Phil Umm Hewlett Packard  he sounds unsure thats fine I dont really care anymore my job is done  Me Then it would probably be best to call them  If you want I can give you their phone number  Phil Yes pleaseI gave him the phone number and away he went  He of course attempted to call a few more times concerning the same issue with varying degrees of illiciting the argument he wanted but most techs were savvy enough to just pull his call record and ask him if its the same issue then why hes calling again about it and off they wentMy boss later told me I was the only one who could stop Phil when he calledThis went on for a few more weeks before Phil got to another tech and got them to cry  It was decided at that point to just give Phil my extension and deny him service if he called on any other line  If I wasnt in he got my voicemailTLDR I will break

machine and bring that machine with you gtgt Regards gtgt ITand then there was silence Fridayand then there was pm this evening when guy giving lecture rolls up and says Where do I plug in my iPad I presume youve got a lead Oh and which computer is redacted onand then I handed over the printed copy of the above email exchange that I had brought with me just for such an eventuality  and then I went home EDITTo clear up a few things and to give a rather disappointing answer to top comments thereSoftware in question is basically for doing stats with and guy giving lecture isnt teaching anyone how to use it hes giving a lecture on statistics and using this thing to provide examples As it turns out he didnt actually seem to think it was that important it was mostly just some people in admin getting terribly excited about somthing they hadnt actually taken the time to understand The iPad problem was solved neatly by emailing the presentation to himself and picking it up the mail on the machine that was already in the room so as far as I know the lecture went fine I dont really want to get into a big arguement about whether or not him being in our building and using our equipment makes him our user but technically he doesnt work here Hes a visitor who happens to have booked the room Since shit like this happens far too often we have a pretty straight forward policy regarding buying software for people that arent actually employed by us We dont do it Ever If he had actually been a member of staff I would have gone to see him earlier in the week since yes that would have been easier for all concerned,and then I went home ,1279,TalesFromTechsupport

orlet,198,199,1g6t29,1010,This happened back in  Back then I was working as the Computer Exorcist read a computer technician at this small IT company providing techsupport for a few local businesses onsite servicing random users computers at our office and running a small computer and related stuff shopSo one day a customer brings a PC for repair saying it wont even boot to windows The front desk girl documents it all creates a ticket and hands the PC over to me all the usual stuff I do the standard diagnostics and obviously the HDD is dead it doesnt even get recognized by the BIOS no wonder it doesnt boot I call the customer saying that hell need a replacement of the HDD and ask whether we should attempt a data recovery off it for an added price of course the customer insists we do everything in our power to retrieve the very important data stored on that driveI believe most of you know the trick with harddrives and freezers where you put one into the other and it magically makes them work again for a little while It sort of worked this time as well but the drive was old and would warm up pretty quickly failing within minutes of poweron and not allowing me to do a proper data recovery off itSo here I was sitting at my desk after having the drive reunited with the frozen vegetables in the freezer once again trying to think up a working solution for this situation when my eyes wandered over a few bricks laying in the corner  we used them as a deadweight to anchor our outdoors banner on windy days  suddenly the gears in my head sprung into motion and a wild idea appeared in my mind I immediately grabbed one of them and shoved it into the freezer next to the failing HDDNext day first thing in the morning I took the drive and the brick out from the freezer connected the drive to the external pATA controller put this whole assembly on the brick and wrapped everything up nicely with a big old towel to provide thermal insulation as well as to keep the moisture away from the electronic components and started the drive imaging process Approx an hour later the imaging was done and the drive was successfully retired ie put into a big box with the other fallen comrades And the brick went back into the freezer because you never know when you might need one againtldr an apprentice techie discovers yet another use for a brick,nd use for a brick a tale of very important data,1209,TalesFromTechsupport

AN UNRELATED NOTE HOUSEKEEPING TO THE COMMISSARY PLEASE BRING A MOP AND BUCKET AS WELL AS THE DART GUN WITH THE CAFFEINEFILLED DARTSGood morning TFTS Sorry about that I tend to get a little unstable without my coffee in the morning I really need to look into intravenuous infusions of caffeine and B blends Maybe the anaesthesiologists can give me a handAnyways I digress Todays tale is of people not listening to me  as usual of buying cheap kit  as usual and karma being a right bugger  as usualLets flash back a few years  SIR THE GOOMBAS ARE DANCING AGAIN  And thats why you dont play Evelynn Ever I said clicking CONTINUE at the end of the League of Legends game Id been playing with a coworker and exitingShes more useless than a solarpowered flashlight he chuckled as he left the shared tech roomSure enough the phone on my desk rang and the office manager shot me an AIM message telling me who it wasgtHey Dr XXXXXXXXX is on the line They want to start doing some new stuff MXX wouldnt tell me what Mind picking upI shrug and replygtSure why not Its not like she doesnt have my damn cell number SOMEHOWSo I get on the phone and sure enough its the doctors wife who just happened to be the practice managerHi Jack How are youOh this was not a good sign She was cheerful and effusive and whenever a client is like that around me I get very VERY worried very quickly Sure enough my suspicions were warrantedI could be better I could be worse MXX Whats going on down in your neck of the woodsWell the doctor has decided that were going to start doing remote clinics next month and we need to be able to work remotely Were also worried about his medical study data When you come down can you take a look MXX youre aware that its the end of the month When is his start date for the remote clinic and whos going with himWell were starting in two weeks at one of the local hospitals We also have two techs who are going with him and they need laptops Can we get them iPads That would be so neatMXX give me a minuteI hit mute on the phone and opened up the U case under my desk with a pair of old P Xeons and a SuperMicro board in it However since the PSUs were dead it was a perfect place to hide a bottle of Glenlivet and after a swig of the wonderful elixir which purged by fire the invectives that were pooling up in my mouth I unmuted her and continuedOkay Im going to send you a quote Youre going to approve it call our Derp rep and get whats on it ordered immediately Without it you cant do secure remote desktopA server Those are expensive We were going to do GoToMyPC on their computers and then let our temps use their computers while theyre not at the office so we dont have to buy new machines Cant you do it without buying a serverMy eye twitched and I resisted the urge to reach for the U cases blessed contents againWe have to account for security remember Youre passing HIPAAprotected info into the medical record software On top of that you also have your credit card machine on the network Finally GoToMyPC will take up the machine when its in use Your temps wont be able to do anything with the machines and youll need new ones as is Seriously you really need to have a proper server for this On a not entirely unrelated note did you read the email I sent you about the echocardiogram storage requirements Storing a year of ECGs on a single nonRAIDd hard drive is just asking for disasterWell Jack he needs to be able to view them anywhere and sometimes GoToMyPC just isnt fast enoughMXX Ive said it before its been in writing three times now This firm will NOT be held liable if you keep doing that if  no WHEN  you suffer data loss Youre disregarding the advice of people whove seen everything and weve offered to build you a storage server for them for months but youve turned us down on a cost basis Whats cheaper  a server and maintenance or a data loss incident under HIPAAAfter a bit of negotiation she agreed to order the quote I sent out for the TS server but not the storage one they went through a terabyte of data a year of ECGs and this was a few months after the flood in Thailand so drives were insanely expensive I specced out a cheap little TS box  hardware and licensing plus Office Enterprise licenses came out to about three grand USA few days later it arrived at my office Surprisingly the two small Latitude laptops Id put into the quote for TS purposes werent in there I prepped the box set up everything and drove it the hundred miles to their office to set it up at the end of a day  END USERS WILL BE ENDED  I pulled up to their main clinic around seven or eightAnd I yelled to the cabby  Wait I was driving and I made it there around four or so Once I got there I took the server inside and unlocked the comms closet then stared in disbelief at the contentsMy previouslypristine comms closet was covered in boxes of crap like old phones P Sony laptops and even an ultralight Toshiba Satellite P laptopI made room for the server punted the old gear to the side on the shelving and powered it on After joining it to the domain I did my normal checks on the alreadyinplace server saw that everything was good  the SQL database was backing up properly nothing foul was in the error logs the usualAfter that I beelined it to the practice admins office and sat down with a cup of coffee in my hands She was a typical WASP suburban lacrosse mom  blonde mids railthin cocksure of herself refuses to take no for an answer the kind of soccer mom you just love to hateLook MXX I have the remote desktop server up and running Its tested and your users can log in remotely from anywhere They have EMR access Office printer access they can fax out from your giant MFD the whole nine yards My question is this  where did the laptops go I quoted two out on the Premier quote but they werent there with the serverOh well we didnt order them the techs said theyd bring their personal laptops and they could use those And the doctors going to use his iPad too so we dont need anything for him right okay heres the reasons thats a bad idea One your EMR isnt designed for iPad use so he would go crazy trying to use the thing over remote desktop We went over that before when he tried it with LogMeIn to his desktop and the studies Two their personal laptops arent under warranty Im not going to drive  miles each way to fix them when they break and cant work Thats why we buy Derp because the hardware can be replaced next business day without me needing to be here Three you didnt upgrade your Internet tier like I asked Id asked you to get a static IP and to go to  down and  up and Speedtest said today that youre at  down and K up If you dont make the call Ill do it since you put me on as technical contact on the account last week Im going to do my regular support checks on the workstations here and once Im done Ill be driving back to AustinThe clinic closed down while I was checking each machine and as I had the alarm code I could get out after I was done I winced when I looked over the doctors computer and saw the single TB WD MyBook was still there  the one with the year of ECGs on itEverything checked out okay and I put it in writing again along with the results of all my scans and checks that she needed to get the storage server ASAP At that point I buggered off to Austin and fell asleep with the sleep of the just  OF COURSE THATS WHEN EVERYTHING WENT TO CRAP  Two days later at six AM my personal cell  rangNot my office cell my PERSONAL cellBlearily I answered it and the practice managers shrill voice rang throughOur entire network is down Your new server broke the network and we cant see any patientsAfter answering that nothing I did could have caused it I showered got ready and drove the hundred miles to her office after calling my boss to let him know that I had an emergency there that dayI was greeted there with the sight of the staff lounging around waiting for things to come back up and one even sarcastically greeted me calling me the best tech ever and the only hope for the officeI would have gone Biblical on this  as in Sodom and Gomorrah pillars of fire the whole nine yards  but one staffer who I rather liked quietly passed me a venti white mocha shed gotten for me from Starbucks when she heard I was rushing down there and the whole thing about finding one good person and sparing everyone came into play As I gratefully accepted it and took a sip my anger mellowed and I plugged my laptop into the network to try to get things workinggtIP Address xxgt DHCP wasnt handing out addresses but I was damn sure I didnt enable the DHCP role on the TS box Grumbling I turned on my cells tethering feature to get some connectivity without touching their network The wireless scan on my laptop showed the network I made called GotRoot and wait why is there a network named NETGEARNETGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARI loaded up a spectrum analyzer and started tracing the access point Sure enough one of the users had a cheap piece of shit WGR router with patch in the switch ports going to both his machine and the wall The minute I ripped that out the network came back upConfronting the user in front of the practice manager led to more rage  well I wanted to use my iPad but I couldnt find the wireless network so I plugged this in but it didnt work and nothing seemed wrong so yeahThe practice manager piped up Its okay with me I told him that he could put in wireless for his iPad We didnt think wed need you to do THAT since all we needed was a wireless router thats what the guy at Derp Squad saidDont Do This I turned to the practice manager If you want wireless Ill be glad to order and configure you a Cisco access point so that itll work perfectly and even give you guest wifi for the people in the front This isnt the first time Ive warned you about ordering and putting gear in without letting me know If this happens again my boss finds out about it Hes said that hes fired clients for that before Meanwhile Im calling Slime Warner and upgrading your connection like I said we neededI turned to her on the way out of her officeOh did you look over that quote for the storage server I sent you Thats better and safer than that LaCie RAID external I see sitting on your desk the one that I most specifically recommended against buyingBy the end of the day Id put a dent in her available credit card balance by purchasing a Cisco AGN After configuring it all was good and TW had upped their connection to something usable I drove back to Austin and crashed hard again  TLDR Quit whining about how long it is and read the damn thing or else Ill figure out how to start punching people in the face over standard TCPIPTHIS ISNT THE END PART  IS COMING LATER

erins,169,336,xp7q7,1004,So I was just working as a cell phone tech support rep and usually the customer service rep provides the clients info so that the client doesnt have to keep repeating it Now this CS rep told me quite bluntly that this lady is pissed and wanted a new phone he also said he was new and didnt know where to turn he just had to pass the call along to me The call gets transferred over and immediately she starts ripping me a new asshole I let her yell and get it all out and told her that she needed to calm down or I couldnt help her because I couldnt understand what she was saying because she was screaming She took a breath and explained what was going on with her phone I went through my usual steps to resolve her issue which was that her phone wasnt receiving a signal and she was missing calls etc I reset her on our network and had her turn her phone on and off that didnt work I kept following the steps and I got to a question that pretty much asked if there was physicalwater damage to the device She replied with this I shit you not I was pissed at my boyfriend and threw my phone against the wallI actually went silent for a few seconds and tried to wrap my head around her stupidity I advised her that even though she was still within her warranty it was void because of the obvious physical damage She then started yelling at me saying that she did this a while ago and the phone was fine and that this started the day before I tried to explain to her that damage doesnt have to immediate affect the device it can happen at anytime She went ballistic I mean she was like a bat out of hell Her exact quote Im going to come to your work bitch and shove my blackberry down your throat you cunt I really wish someone took a picture of my face because it really must have been priceless I got so angry that I let her have it I told her that if she wasnt such a dumb ass than maybe her phone would be working and that maybe if she was a good girlfriend perhaps her bf wouldnt have cheated on her hence why she was pissed Clearly this didnt help and she escalated to my mgr After my manager finished the call he called me over and I was still livid He told me that he ended up reasoning with her telling her that she wouldnt be getting a brand new phone that she would have to purchase one Also he told me that I wasnt allowed to yell at customers anymore I remembered the crazy ladys number and typed it in a few weeks later it appeared that she had called in like  times since talking to me regarding the same thing It got to the point where she wanted to talk to the president of the company she got her wish and he banned her from ever using our services again and made her pay all her late bills My faith in humanity had been restored that day ,Apparently she thought this would get her a new phone,1340,TalesFromTechsupport
TalesFromTechSupport,252,770,xtlhx,1009,Hi there fellow redditors This is the first story of my  part saga of working at a local computer store from end  to early  I hope you will enjoy I will try to get a new chapter out monday Lets make that next friday for you folks Please note that this story takes place in Germany many people have been confused about this I use American conventions for aesthetic purposes onlyDecember  was when I first started working at the local computer store I remember it was a late friday afternoon and quite dark and stormy My kind of weather It was my first day of what would be  years of being employed there  years of dealing with rudeness absurdity and stupidity to have it all ending rather abruptly and explosivelyDays before the ITadministrator at my school found out I knew my way around computers and offered me a job at his Business Partners computer store They had started it together back in the late s While he moved on to a fulltime job as ITadministrator for many schools in the area he still did some work in the store and owned half of itThough my mom told me when I was little not to accept any offers from strange people and especially not from something severely overweight Ron Jeremy lookalikes  I took him up on the offer My Nomad Zen a MPplayer I still to this day love was showing its age and I needed money for one of those fancy new iRiver MP playersAfter he made a call with his again Business Partner he gave me the address and told me to get there around  on thursday and he and the business partner would give me a formal job interview The way he said it especially the intonation on the Business Partnerpart sounded like I was invited to do a casting couch audition for some Bgrade porno site Still to this day whenever somebody mentions a business partner I cringe and feel disgusted and violatedAfter finishing up my homework at the school canteen that thursday I set off by bike to the computer store It was located in one of the cheaper neighborhoods of our small city The store  and all the stores surrounding it for that matter  much needed a new layer of paint and a good cleaning of the tiles and signs Somewhat reluctantly I opened the door and walked into the store No turning back now I am greeted by my future coworker Jeremy a year old college dropout How can I help you today pretty girl He asked I ignored the pretty girl part and told him about my job application and was supposed to see Ron Jeremy and his business partner He walked to the back to talk with them leaving me in alone in the store Looking around in the store I saw a lot of old damaged displays Some obscure and mediocre burning software sold for  mind you had a huge cardboard display with a rather  Bgrade category model printed on it praising the product Most of the walls and tables were full of accessories Mainly cheap Chinese and Koreans knock off brands sold for Logitech and Microsoft hardware prices A few PCs and displays with outdated component lined the walls and sold for absurd prices The current generation computers were even more expensiveThe counter was made entirely of glass and was empty aside from the even older cash register and some USBgadgets from questionable quality The space under the counter hold a huge amount of games This had to be the only shop where you could still buy every Doom game released for PC for the full launch price years even decades later Guess its a niche market We never really sold much of it anyway Jeremy came back and told me I could walk to the back I walked around the counter and almost broke my neck over the boxes full of nonbranded memory Stumbling into the back I almost bumped into the business partner The top half of his shirt unbuttoned showing a rather disgusting orangelike forest of hair and a golden necklace Like Ron he was severely  even morbidly  obese and was so large he could block your path Looking up at him I saw a disgusting smile one that still is burned on my retina today A smile of lust I think this is about to mention I was a  year old girl that got hit by puberty pretty fast and hard He showed me a seat and and they took their places opposite me Jeremy shouted from the front of the store he was leaving and I heard the front door slam shut Looking back at the two obese figures in front of me I felt somewhat uncomfortable my boobs seemed to have a gravitational pull as a twin par of suns with the eyeballs of the two obese man  circling around them as planets They kept their distance knowing going closer would burn them  Ron starts talking about how he liked my work at school and thinks I can help Don with the store during nights and weekends Don not impressed by my Mad Skills yet insists on a series of test he prepared in the days before Anyone worthy of working in his store would solve these problems in no time While he says this I start looking at him for the first time He strikes me as the love child of Donald Trump and Fat Bastard from the Austin Power seriesThe first test he gave me was installing Windows XP on one of the new machines for a customer and making sure all the hardware drivers were installed Nothing special in this regard aside from time consuming installing on a Pentium  with MB of ram Don seemed to agree and I had to flash the firmware on one of the actually new Wireless Routers he just got in and wanted to demo in the store To make it extra challenging I had to find the new firmware myself on a poorly translated website of the Korean manufacturer To this day I still think I acknowledged Kim IIsung as my dear leader for eternity when accepting the terms of service for downloading the driversThe third and final assignment was supposed to get make me go running out of the store pulling my hair But really at this point no difficult assignment was needed to get me to do thisI had to configure a Debian linux installation to run a cron task start the apache web server and delete and move a number of files Nothing to troubling but with my limited Linux skills I needed some help from Google Asking whether it was okay to use the internet to look up some of the commands and configuration details Ron told me it was okay Its not hardcore mode like us pros do it but we will teach you the skills girl Don quickly added I felt even more uncomfortable now After some  minutes the third task was completed and they congratulated me with passing the testsA standard  month contract quickly got grabbed from one of their desks and my details filled in My pay would by around  dollars which was actually quite good compared to supermarkets and other shops All I had to do was sign Overwhelmed by everything and against better judgement I did They already has a schedule prepared for me as Ron had already taken my class schedule from the school system to see my available times This gave me the feeling of being stalked but before this sinked in they slid the paper over the table I was to begin tomorrow friday straight out of school from  till    I was to begin my first shift today Jeremy was to be my mentor for the day After changing into the way to small  company tshirt he sat me down and told me what I was supposed to do It would have been quicker if he told me what I was not supposed to do I had to help customers stock shelves order components and accessories from our Chinese suppliers clean the shop work the register answer the phone and repair the PCs brought in by our customers Basically everything you can do in a shopHe showed me how the cash register worked how the store was disorganized and some other tidbits of information Jeremy was actually very likable and smart He could have done much better for himself but suffered from a number of problems causing him to completely shut down when entering a prestigious universityWhen we came to the back things became rather interesting I already seen the back of the store but did not touch any of the stuff yet We had a few work benches for the PC repairs including most of the cabling The power sockets where all ungrounded extensions cords were connected to each other causing the power to fail whenever a computer had a shortcircuit The UPS installed in a corner covered by layers of dust was useless in this setup Though Ron always insisted that it was there for a reason I would find out  years laterThe binders of cds were full of cracked software ranging from all version of Windows and Office to every version of Photoshop and Norton Ghost The only genuine software was the burning software that stood prominently in the store and was thrown in for only  for housewives failed businessmen and seniors our usual mix of customers buying a new overpriced PCThe network drive had even more illegal software movies and music on it not to mention customer data In a feat of NASA equivalent engineering Ron and Don somehow managed to connect dozens of harddrives to an Windows XP installation and create a few terabytes of storage with reliable and pretty fast data transfer rates The Usenet client on the pc always had at least  items in queue  Mostly dvdrips from new movies and pornMy shift ended pretty quickly and was nothing special in that regard My next shifts for over  years would beTLDR  I got a job at a the local shady computer store with Ron Jeremy and the love child

photopteryx,60,235,154fzp,993,I worked for a while at a retail business that sold plants It was a small operation and nothing about it had a corporate feeling We had three employees so we were all kinda responsible for everything but we each had the freedom to play to our strengths We had two small offices a front counter and a room where we kept seeds for propagation in a small building surrounded by our plant nursery We used a natural ventilation system more often than the AC unit which is to say that we simply left the doors open pretty often The most technologically advanced things we had were our touchscreened pointofsale computer and our camera infrared closedcircuit DVR surveillance system You know like thishttpwwwebaycomitmCameraCCTVSystemLongRangeInfraredCamerasandChannelDVRvicontentYou might wonder why such a small operation employed such seemingly unnecessary methods simply for keeping an eye on things but Ill not go into the details about the coffers of our operations benefactors Suffice it to say that we had had some things stolen and they saw a way to prevent things like that So we got a fourcamera infrared closedcircuit DVR surveillance system It got the job done as overkill often doesNow to the meat or tempeh if you like and potatoes of the storyThe DVR and TV monitor for our camera system resided in the seed storage room So while you were cleaning seeds you could keep an eye on the outside world or review the tapes as it were of past nights One afternoon as were closing up shop I look into the room and see that someone has been cleaning Gaillardia seed heads to harvest the seeds The scene resembles this fine image that I stole from the internethttpblackfootnativeplantsfileswordpresscomgaiariseedswebjpg Apparently they hadnt finished but thats fine because nobody will be in here overnight to mess with itThe next morning where the pile of plant matter had been the table is clean Spotless in fact Not a seed left I confirm with the other employees that neither of them had come in overnight to work on these seedsMaybe they blew off the table somehow A reasonable enough suggestion but there are seeds neither on the table nor floor Other ideas were briefly raised and then shot down with equally convincing counter evidence and so we were forced to come to the conclusion that though ridiculously unlikely someone had entered the office and stolen our really abundant and notallthatvaluable seeds Fortunately we have a fourcamera infrared closedcircuit DVR surveillance system With it being a slow day that day we all decided to sit around the DVR and watch what if anything happened the night before and perhaps determine who came in and what else they may have left with We kept a channel on live footage of outside in case we saw a stray customerSo we sat and watched in x fast forward the events of the previous night Or rather as it turned out the nonevents of the previous night No person entered or exited the premises save ourselves at the already established times We had a genuine mystery of missing seeds and at that point it was way more about the novelty of the situation than regard for actual loss of property It was then when I made a breakthrough discoveryWhen I reached up to switch the DVR back to displaying live feed on all its channels I felt that the box was much warmer than usual When I looked at the side vents to see if the vents were blocked by dust or something I saw that they were indeed blocked by something Lots of small somethings actually  But those somethings were moving To my keen eye these appeared to be the antennae of hundreds of rather large ants that had squeezed themselves into the DVR unit through the vents and perhaps have made a new home inside And I decided that if they were making a home they probably needed building materials It hardly takes a Sherlockian leap of logic to tie the two tales together Our stolen seeds were stashed away in the very security device design to prevent thefts I laughed at the irony of it and the other employees then gave me funny looks So in lieu of verbal explanation I unplugged the DVR from its cameras and TV grabbed a screwdriver and gently carried the box outsideI unscrewed the shell of the unit from its base and peeled off the Warranty Void If Broken sticker sealing the gap between the two shh dont tell the manufacturer When I lifted the top and rapidly backed away thousands of carpenter ants emerged in a confused mass of indignation The looks on my coworkers faces bounced from confusion to shock and finally to amused comprehension as they saw that half of the tiny little workers were carting around our Gaillardia seedsI left the DVR outside for a couple hours and let the ants extract themselves from our electronics and then carefully vacuumed out the mess that theyd left behind After I sealed the box back up sticker and all we plugged it in back in the seed room and made a mental note to not leave potential nesting materials behind anymoreTLDR Mysterious theft in the night called

itssilvernotgray,169,271,1fpzgd,962,Sometime toward the end of  a lady brought a computer into my shop with a broken screen  I quoted her  and she paid  When the LCD arrived I installed it and upon turning the computer on the power light began to strobe  After trying a few things I arrived at the conclusion that the MB was shot I called her amp told her about the issue and she wanted me to see if I could fix it I called her back with a price on the motherboard replacement and she said she would call me back  TWO YEARS PASS then one day she shows up on my doorstep wanting her computer  By this time I had taken my screen back off of it and assuming it had been abandoned Id called her several times and always got the answer Ill be by there next week so I had repurposed the hard drive as well  I reminded her of the motherboard issue and she wants to know what I can do about it  I told her I would call her back  I found an exact laptop on ebay for  so since she had paid me over  I would still be in the clear on it  I bought the laptop reloaded it fresh and gave her a call  A week or so later she picks it up and within a week is calling me screaming at me saying that isnt her laptop  No shit woman I told you thatNothing else was heard for another two weeks until one day I was riding by my shop and saw two cars parked there  I went back and stopped and it was her and another client of mine  The male client told me that she had called him because his information was on her computer  They have identical computers  I offered to remove the information from her computer to placate both of them but she began to rant about that not being her computer which she knew she was getting another one so I gave her the remaining pieces of her old one  The guy was threatening to sue me for putting his information on her computer which I didnt do and she was threatening to put his medical and tax records out on the internet if I didnt give her  for a new computerI told them both to go fck themselves long and hardShe kept calling me every day and finally I called the police fraud unit and told them what was going on  They already knew me because I had helped recover nearly  stolen laptops that had been brought in to me from various burglaries in townMy guess is that the two clients knew each other and hatched this hairbrained scheme to get a new computerPlease dont edit this for me guys Im trying to learn this  Ill go back amp re edit myself after I post,The not so Great Scam of ,1233,TalesFromTechsupport
jackschitt,518,362,tvz9f,963,I live in a family owned building  My mom lives right below me  My mom comes upstairs and tells me that her best friends daughter just got a new ipod and was wondering if I could add some songs to it  Between myself my wife and my godchild weve got thousands of songs and  of the stuff most  year olds typically listen to  So I told my mom to have her give me a list of a couple hundred songs or so and Id load up as many as I could  Sounds simple right  Should only take a few minutes or so right  Wrong  About a week passes and my mom comes upstairs with a sealed manilla envelope containing an ipod and a really really long list  Just over  songs  So I proceed to take the envelope upstairs and begin my work  I look at the listand see the most racist offensive hateful songs I have ever seen  mostly involving extreme hardcore rap  Id say about  of the songs are not appropriate for  year old girls  So I bring the list downstairs and show my mom explaining that I couldnt in good conscience give a  year old girl an ipod with that kind of garbage on it  I had also known Pat my moms friend my entire life and know that there is no chance in hell that the girl in question would have been allowed to listen to that stuffAs a result the girl gets grounded for about a month  I then receive the ipod back and a much more abbreviated list of songs  of the  songs originally listed only  made it past parental scrutiny  So I pop her ipod in and get to workThis may sound a bit odd as Im an IT guy but I had never dealt with an ipod before this  I never had the need for one and nobody in my small circle of friends had one  So I spent a couple of minutes fumbling around half trying to figure out how it worked and half out of the usual what does this do curiosity that comes with a new device  Thats when I stumbled across her pictures   And thats when shit went downhill  FastThe very first picture that loaded up was a picture of her completely topless with only her hands covering herself   Shit  A million thoughts went through my head  Do I call the cops or do I call her dad   Could this girl be being abused or is she just doing some harmless experimenting  If I call her dad and shes being abused I make the problem worse  If I call the cops and this is just a case of a  year old exploring her body I could throw the entire family into unimaginable hell for nothing  I call my wife over and she looks at the picture  Does she own a laptop or a webcam  No I said  Well then theres someone else in that room because shes got both hands on her chest which means someone else is working that camera  Fuck  Shes rightIn a probably misguided effort to try to figure out what was going on I looked to see if there were any other pictures  And I stumbled upon a complete folder several of which contained similar pictures but also contained pictures of herself making out topless with a  year old boy taken at the same time  So at least we knew who the mystery photographer was along with knowing the reason behind the pictures existenceBut now heres the situation  Ive got to explain to Pat and her husband that her daughters ipod contains pictures of their  year old daughter naked with and possibly screwing a  year old boy   There is really no good way to explain this to anyone ever  So I go downstairs and wake my mom up  Just come upstars Mom  I cant really explain it  Youre better off seeing this for yourself  So my mom throws on her robe and starts stomping up the stairs basically mumbling wake me up on a sunday morning this had better be fucking imporOHMYGODWHATTHEFUCKISTHATMy mom almost had a heart attack when she saw the pictures  She rushes downstairs calls Pat and frantically starts trying to explain the situation but isnt doing a very good job  Unknown to me Pat hands the phone to her husband so she can go and confront her daughter  My mom then hands me the phone  Here I am thinking Im talking to Pat when Im now stuck trying to explain to her husband whats going on  Needless to say this was the most awkward conversation I have ever had in my life  I explain exactly whats on the ipod to an increasingly furious John  Outside of the occasional mmmhmm the only words out of his mouth were Im on my way over  A few minutes later here comes John  Pats in the car with an obviously sulking daughter in the back seat  I explain to John  Are you sure you want to see this  Theyre pretty graphic and what you see you cant unsee  He looked at the first picture for about th of a second before turning away and saying Ok Ive seen enough  Thanks  Im on my way to the boys house next  I can only imagine how that conversation wentThe songs by the way never did make it onto the ipod  ,Shes a  year old girl  How bad could it be  warning long,1325,TalesFromTechsupport

MoeFuggah,225,213,194ooh,948,I was working for a company that dispatches techs for onsite support and they cover a wide service radius  of  cities   The company has an excellent reputation and quite a bit of business wasnt uncommon to run  dispatches a day  You would call the office and the in house tech would schedule appointments and we would show up within  hour of the scheduled time If it was a DEAR ticket Drop everything and run you paid a premium for the immediate service  x standard rate on the first hour So Im scheduled for  dispatches that day  I get a call from the office wanting to know if I can fit in a sixth  I was paid commission so of courseSo I sync to the dispatch board and find out the last appointment is scheduled for ASAP something we usually dont do since he did not want to pay the premium red flag  The dispatch explains that there are  more ahead of him and I will call as soon as possibleSo every hour on the hour Im getting a message from the office wanting to know my status The guy keeps calling wanting to know if Im going to show up or not Red flag So I plow through my tickets and call him at  in the afternoon and let him know it will take me  minutes to drive from Whitewater to Indio in afternoon traffic and I am on my way I could tell by the sound of his voice he was frazzled and desperate and angry red flag      I arrive on site a convenience store  we will call them pmam I brief the guy and its pretty simple He needs to be able to see his cameras that he had just installed in the store on his phone some cheap LG as well as across the internet  A couple simple port forwards and I should be out of there  hes sweating like a hooker in church the entire time and hes really irritated Red flag   Turns out the guy is what you would call green  He decided to reset the router he jacked the DVR into thinking it would make everything work taking out pretty much every payment option except cash ATM EBT Credit Cards Pay at the pump and the registration info between the router and the ISP costing the store a significant amount of businessI ask him why didnt the In house IT take care of this for him since its a corporate network Red flag    He has no documentation or authority to do anything with the network since he is a contractor and theres no manager there and he doesnt want anyone to know what hes doneSo I take pity on the guy and call the ISP and get the router back online Port forward all of the payment equipment configure the DVR credentials and make everything work but the DVR only worked with Iphone then ask him for payment Hes telling me I havent done the work since he cant see it on his phone  I explain to the guy Im sorry but LG phones arent supported for the web access and even bring it up on my laptop tethered to my phone proving my work    After a call to the boss to fill him in with what was going on he tells me no good deed goes unpunished and to do what I feelI give him  options Pay me call the police and file theft of service call the store manager ask them for my money and fill him in on whats happened costing them even more money or I could flash the router format the DVR back to factory settings and let him explain to the store manager that hes killed the profits for the day as well as the network and take a wash    I packed up my laptop and notes  reset the DVR and told him this is his last chance to pay up before I walk out the door this part only takes a few minutes to fix and I wont even tack on the extra  for the timeHis reply was I called you at  this morning and you didnt show up until  then you take  hours to do it I cant see it on my phone so you arent finished and you expect me to pay you almost At this time its not about the money I want satisfaction and Im gonna make this guy sweat even if I have to take a wash and tell him if you arent paying me you damn sure arent keeping the work So I reset the router  borking the network again and hes right back where he started in the hot seat The look on his face was well worth it On the way out of the store the clerks ask if the payments are down again and I politely tell them unfortunately our friend her doesnt want to pay me so Im leaving everything the way I found it and they will have to deal with telling the customers its cash only and Im sorryOn my way out the door I notice that the store managers number is on the front of the store and called him on my drive home I informed him of whats happened and explain to them I have all the notes and could fix everything in an hour the next day as long as they would pay me for the time I was already there for as well as the next days time which was agreed toTLDR Newbie trashes a business network installing something he doesnt fully understand costing a busy store  of a days worth of business tries to lay his burden on my shoulders to cover it up after pressuring me all day wanting to be cheap I do the professional thing and do the work anyways and then he refuses to pay so I threw him to the wolves and still got paid twice The cherry on top was costing him the work for the rest of the store chain,Pulling someone out of the fire and

MoeFuggah,234,224,196jj4,949,So I start my own shop and offer your choice of onsite or drop off Drop off is cheaperI have a couple bring me their desktop we will call Dick and Jane I usually do the diagnosis before you leave and have you sign the all the necessary paperwork before I touch anything After taking  minutes to do a hardware diagnostic everything tests out fine XP takes another  to get to a desktop The drive isnt jam packed so its not the page file its obviously a bad infestation The honorable thing to do is nukereroll for a flat fee since something that dirty will run up an hourly bill pretty quicklyDick and Jane sign off and away I go So I roll the machine up patch updated installed drivers and AV and configure for best performance More or less true barebones No shovelware no unnecessary programs Call Dick and Jane and tell them to come and get their machine its ready They are pleased it was finished in the same day and gladly paid signed off and left happy as clamsIm thinking great another satisfied customer who will spread the good wordFast forward two weeks laterI get a phone call from Jane This machines doing exactly what it was doing before and I want it fixed again under warranty Now good children I do not offer any kind of warranty unless it comes from new hardware manufacturer and it even says so in the paperwork since there is no telling what they have installed or picked up off the interwebs but I do believe in standing behind my workSo I tell her maam Ill gladly take a look Bring it by and if its something I have overlooked I will be glad to take care of the problem however if its not my fault you will still have to pay me for the diagnostic and decide if you want me to repair it for you again Here comes Dick and Jane a second time Again the hardware is fine and Im getting long boot times so obviously its something they have done either installed or picked up off the internetAfter explaining that I have to charge the diagnostic fee and its up to them to decide if they want it fixed again Dick is furious and Jane is more intrigued to know what is going on seeing as this machine was just repairedDick is obstinate to the fact that he couldnt have done anything to mess up the machine and he shouldnt have to pay since he knows how to use a computer and Jane says go ahead she wants to know whats going on So one of the first things I find is registry mechanic installed on the task bar and programs list You know the so called Speed upOptimize your machine software that is really masked malware But good Reddit Im obviously preaching to the choir here about the effects of such things I politely explain to Jane that the malware was installed by someone voluntarily more than likely thinking it was a good program and give the Free click here are the most dangerous words on the internet sermon as I already optimize the config before it leaves the shop as part of my OS reload service However I must bill them for the diagnostic and if they like I would keep the virus removal at a flat fee of  hour if they would like me to fix everything a second time half the cost of the last service they renderedDick at this point is flushed and Jane flatly says that this should be covered by warranty seeing as my build allowed something to infect her machine and that my antivirus didnt work yaddah yaddah So I pull out the paperwork and show her that there is no implied warranty on the operating system but there is on hardware if any is purchased And explain that no antivirus is perfect if it were there would be no viruses on the internetI launch IE to check windows update just to make sure its completely patched and behold the browsers hijacked to some free meet women stuff you see all over the internetThis clues me into someone surfing prn So I check the cookie cache and lo and behold its chock full of cookies from prn sites and state that the dirtiest places on the internet are these kind of sites Dick is red faced and Janes pissed seeing as the timestamps are when shes at work LOL Dick decides its time to go and hes NOT PAYING ME FOR ANYTHING and Janes pissed at Dick for obvious reasons But he still thinks she shouldnt Have to pay me a dime even for the diagnostic Well I dont touch a machine before the paperwork is signed EVER And tell them I will be holding their equipment until the diagnostic is paid  I Have paperwork signed agreeing to thisHe says that my paperwork doesnt mean shit and tells me they are taking his machine and leaving so I simply say if you touch the machine and I dont have my money expect the police to come knocking on your door for theft of service and robbery after calling in the tag on your car Hes looking like hes ready to rip my head off Shes looking at him like shes ready to rip his head off and I show them the sign on the wall showing that machines left on open invoice after  days will be sold to cover any outstanding balance and they storm offAn hour later they come back with my money and I send them on their merry way and thank them for their business but Im not interested in doing anymore work for themTLDR A couple brings in a machine to

Tomocant,154,230,1bshfb,928,Hello all Im a big fan of this subreddit so I figured Id share a story my coworker told me when I was still working tier  tech support I work for a local ISP in Colorado We use a slightly odd system of pointtopoint wireless receivers to deliver internet to largely rural areas Its a lot like satellite but without the latency Basically one of our techs attaches a radio receiver to your roof points it to a tower within  miles of your home and runs a cable to whatever router or PC you wantOur service isnt as reliable as cable or DSL but is actually pretty stable in severe weather like blizzards and such However Im not sure if our sales team is selling it in correctly or not but people dont seem to realize that this service is largely line of sight based If it is snowing so bad that you can barely see  feet in front of you your service might have some packet lossThis particular story takes place in the summer of  A fairly large forest fire was burning in one of the areas we serviced My coworker whom I will refer to as Nate took a call that happened to be in one of the cities listed in the fire but didnt think much of it at the time Surely if a customer was calling about an internet issue here they were in an unaffected part of the city rightThe following is summarized as its been a few years but youll get the ideaNate Thank you for calling ISP this is Nate how can I help youCustomer Yes Im planning on leaving for a trip soon and Im having difficulty pulling up any websites to buy ticketsNate can hear some mumbling in the background but nothing he can make outNate Im sorry to hear that miss Let me pull up our equipment and we can take a look Have you tried rebooting ourCustomer Yes Ive reboot everything just as Ive done a thousand times before Your service is never up when I need it to beBackground voice mustnowNate I apologize that youve had repeat issues lets see if we can figure out what is going onAccording to our system her radio is not responding at all If she has already reboot the power supply at this point its looking like well have to send a tech to her house to check the equipmentNate Miss it appears your equipment isnt responding If youve already reboot the power supply as you said well havMuch louder background voice Whoever is on this line this is the fire department hang up this woman needs to evacuate NOWCustomer No I NEED these tickets today or Ill miss my conference When can you get a tech out hereNate Miss are you in the fire evacuation zoneCustomer Yes but I need to take care of this before I leave its very importantVoice WE NEED TO LEAVE NOWAt this point Nate had pulled up the most recent evacuation map from the local news and checked the customers address She was in the middle of the emergency evacuation area as the fire was burning towards the direction of her neighborhoodNate Miss for your own safety Im going to have to disconnect this call Im very sorryCustomer NO I need these tickets now clickI never would have believed him if I wasnt sitting next to him listening to his half of the conversation at the time I never did find out if that womans house burned down but based on reports it was pretty obvious to us that her service was down because of the dense smoke in the areaThe fire burnt down a lot of homes and we ended up replacing a lot of equipment that was damaged or completely destroyed with homes Sometimes even in tech support Im surprised at how oblivious people are,Apparently surviving a fire is secondary to purchasing plane tickets,1158,TalesFromTechsupport
OldPolishProverb,165,181,1lekqn,927,FeliciaSexopants story reminded me of one from my youth back in the late s I was working IT tech support at the national headquarters for a rapidly growing company IT was in charge of the computers and communications including the hard wired phone switch that was common to that era A lot of stuff was strung together like a Christmas tree because we expanded so quickly We had tripled the non IT staff in three years We were slowly sorting all of this rapid expansion mess out cleaning it up and documenting it It was one the reasons I was hired The company went through a lot of departmental managers and we were getting new one in charge of the customer support department He wanted to physically rearrange the personnel in the call center A new physical layout to enhance communication among employees Annoying but not unheard of Not too big of a problem either because the center was one large open concept floor A little bit of muscle and some new cables and we could move anyone anywhere in the room quickly When do want to schedule the move we in IT asked the new manager  Oh I told maintenance to do it immediately They should be moving the desks right now he saidRed flags going up in our heads But what about the computers and the phones IT is suppose to be the only ones allowed to move themYea I was told that but whats the big deal Flags and bells now going off in our headsI had my staff just stack their stuff in the corner of the room You can plug it back in later Sirens now going off in our heads What about the phonesOh I just told my staff to unplug them and plug them back in at their new locationMy boss ran to the call enter but it was too late Every device in the room had been disconnected Every unlabeled hardwired multiplelined minimally documented because we had not gotten to it yet hand crafted phone tree component every call forwarding enabled device in the room had been touched Every desk in the room was in a completely different location from the day before If he had just left it all plugged in we could have rearranged it with minimal effort through extension cables or just tracing down a few circuits as needed But we now spent the next three days with line tracers going through the jumble of wires on the floor tracing back to the wiring closet each phone circuit and then determining who it originally belonged to The call center was down for four days The new manager lasted less than five The manager of a call center thought you could rearrange business phones like they were in a home Unplug from one jack and then into another ,Business phones dont work that way,1108,TalesFromTechsupport

doctors train Dragon Medical  today I figured I might as well throw this upThe year was  I was driving a blackandwhite VW for the poor bastards who got ruined by the blueshirts My day was  AM to  PM which was a fairly relaxing schedule and I serviced mostly rich comfortable areas of town basically places where I blended in easily thanks to my upbringing private schools Boy Scouts et cetera These places had clients who were mostly pretty good  intelligent very good conversationalists quick learners and those who were willing to pay what was necessary to get the job done properly eg not

out I had which I found out when I pulled the logs for him in our scheduling system but I didnt recognize him offhandI did however recognize his house when I pulled up to it and I thought Oh no not this guy again Seeing the house which was in the Memorial section of town a rich oldmoney part of Houston or as Tycho and Gabe say Rich Mofo Street reminded me of the crazy that lay therein and I shuddered and went to workI knocked on the door and a semielderly man mid to late s opened the door and let me in after confirming he was who we thought he was He showed me to his computer a era P beast with MB of RAM and XP Home SP and after perfunctory software diagnostics I figured out the BSODs hed been having werent software based as much as Id have liked to blame AOL dialup for it  and yes it was on his system  I couldnt Virus scans came up negative tooMeanwhile Senor Crazy was downing tumbler of whiskey after tumbler of whiskey It wasnt good stuff either  from the smell it was some execrable blend so sue me Im a whiskey purist and my premier stock is older than my fiancee which means that either like Tuxedo Mask I like the young stuff or I have excellent taste in whiskey Its the latter I went for the cheap pedo shot to get a laugh LAUGH DAMN YOUI ran hardware diagnostics and after Memtest tripped a few times I started checking the BSOD logs It was verified shortly that it was bad memory and before I had a chance to explain it to him he started ranting about me taking too long to repair the machine One of the lines he used was you better hurry up or Ill start calling in my friends named Mickey and Vinny and theyll do to your legs what happened to this machineAgain I raised an eyebrow and kept workingAfter more diagnostics finished just for verification purposes I had my personal laptop there a D running XP and Id confirmed that his machine was out of warranty AND out of his service plan so he would have to pay for parts on his ownI explained what was going on to him and he was FURIOUS He started ranting and raving telling me that I was full of it and that I shouldnt tell that shit to an Airborne Ranger who had  kills in  while still downing whiskey He even pulled a Bob Dole and ranted about a war wound while rapping on his skull it actually rang meaning he had a metal plate in it  pretty cool with the sound but the crazy was offputtingAt this point I went up on the company forums and started begging for a bailoutSEE ATTACHEDhttpimgurcomOCRUjAfter I did that about ten minutes later I started getting calls However before I could get out of there I heard something that chilled the blood in my veinsDont look on this as a weapon of war look at it as a piece of artNOPENOPENOPENOPENOPESure enough the crazy bastard had pulled out a locked case and when he opened it he pulled out a boltaction sniper rifle AgainNOPENOPENOPENOPENOPEHe picked it up and started waving it around pointing it at me a few times and when my phone rang again I took the opportunity to get into his backyard I have NEVER been so grateful for Sprint having crappy signal in so many areas and instructed the Agent on the other end of the line to impersonate my stores manager I told her to say that the police were at the store in regards to a previous client and some misplaced equipment didnt exist at all of course but any port in a storm and they needed to talk to me ASAPI passed him the phone when I went back in told him that he may want to go to the backyard as the reception wasnt that good and once he was out of sight in his kitchen then in his backyard I threw my laptop into my embroidered laptop case a gift from an ex who modeled for Suicide Girls grabbed all my other gear excepting my phone and tiptoed out to the VW quietly Once I got there Id unlocked the doors from the front porch via the keyfob I threw my laptop case into the car started it up and dropped the transmission going into reverse then peeling out of the driveway and onto the main roadAs luck would have it this guys house was a mile and a half from my grandmothers so I drove over there and with her permission I downed a few shots of whiskey to steady my nerves before calling centralized IS to wipe my phone hed started calling previous callers  coworkers  after Id left then the police over Skype Once I was done with them I called corporate and had him blacklisted from inhome service forever dashed off an email to my managers and basically tableflipped the whole thing at them and sat back with a cranberry ginger ale while waiting for callbacks and responded to the thread on the forums to let people know I was okayThe Memorial Villages a subcity inside Houston which has its own police force and such police pulled up at her house shortly thereafter with my phone PPC  not a bad little phone for the time all his documentation for them in the original folder which is still on my trophy wall today and the statement that theyd talk to their bosses and to the Harris County Psychiatric Center about a temporary involuntary commit It turned out that he was on meds normally and had gone off them by choiceThey also in a remarkable stroke of brilliance TEMPORARILY CONFISCATED HIS FIREARMSWhen he called the  number to rant and rave at them and he used racial slurs at the rep who was a rep for them since the day they got the call center account they calmly suggested that he would need to go instore to resolve any issues he had then blacklisted his number in the PBX so that he would get redirected to corporate for any inbound callsThe next day he stormed into the store at Bunker Hill and I not my home store but the one where I started and ranted at the senior there for about half an hour including the phrase NERD HERD TOOK MY GUNS It was HILARIOUS The senior who was a friend of mine went back and looked up his logs then cheerfully informed the man that he was banned from not merely all inhome services he was banned from even going

phlogiston,293,253,ttje5,912,In addition to being a bench tech I also used to go onsite to small businesses and do basic network admin work  Nothing too complicated usually less than  PCs and a server or two  In doing this I soon realized that most small business networks were pretty much the same  A closet somewhere had the modem feeding a blue Linksys router with  port switches added on organically as the network grew  Id update and clean it up usually with a Cisco PIX and a big enough unmanaged switch to allow room for growth  Then Id go through and neaten up the rest of the network and reformat the worst of the workstations  Usually less than a weeks worth of work and the client was very happy with the result  It was fun  My favorite task soon became the initial visit to create the cost estimate  I had some neat software on my laptop with which I could map out all the devices on the LAN  Id then make a physical map of the network layout combine it with the logical map and present this to the customer as the before diagram of their network  Id sometimes encounter an early adopter who had some really old tech either gathering dust or actively in use  The following account details one such early adopter that knew too much for his own good  As I walked into this exceedingly ordinary law office in  I was greeted by a receptionist who might have been pretty some  cigarettes ago  Being a tech the second thing I noticed was the old discolored CRT monitor sitting atop an old discolored tower  It was covered with sticky notes with various web sites along with the username  password for each  sigh It was going to be one of those jobs  I explained who I was to which she replied So youre our new tech this month huh  OK lets go meet Mr Head Lawyer  Not a good start  As we went down the hallway I glanced into each office seeing people working but not using their PCs  This struck me as unusual  Each PC was as old as the one used by the receptionist  At the end of the hall were  or  larger offices each containing a lawyer  After a minute one came out and introduced himself as Mr Head Lawyer  The next thing he said will forever send a chill down my spine  I know all about computers and networks  I just hired your company to help with some of the heavy lifting  Keep in mind we dont want to spend a bunch of money if we can help it  I briefly considered throwing my laptop and tools over his shoulder hoping it would distract them long enough to make my escape  Another lawyer read my mind and silently moved to block my exit  Im glad youre here  We have lots of computer problems and the last tech was not able to do much to help  I was outnumbered and flanked  Might as well take a look around before I flee  I said Id like to start in your network closet  Show me where you keep all the network stuff  This question prompted some polite yet puzzled expressions  Head Lawyer  Im not sure about that do you want to see the server room  The server room would be lovely thanks  Lets start there  Calling it a server room was a bit of an overstatement  I was expecting a closet but this was a crawspace under a stairwell  In it was an old desktop PC a  mbit hub collision indicator blinking frantically and a power strip  Attached to that hub were three network cables  one went into the wall on the right the other to the left  The third went to the server  While Im taking this in Head Lawyer proudly said  Some years ago I upgraded this office myself from the old coaxial ring to these new ethernet cables  We were the first business around here to have a network  Coaxial rings I vaguely recall reading about token ring networks  They were literally arranged in a ring werent they  I only started doing this about  so this was all ancient history to me  I plugged in my laptop and didnt get an IP address  I asked where the router was which evoked another puzzled smile  Nevermind I said  Ill just walk around and figure it out myself  So I went into each office and took a quick look around  Every room was the same an ethernet cable came in one wall and went into a hub  Another cable went out of the hub into the next wall  A third cable was plugged into the PC  All PCs were running Windows   One room had a newish PC with XP Pro That room had the DSL modem connected via USB and was sharing the internet connection out to the rest of the network  No DHCP everybody had static IPs  The printers were old the server didnt work never even learned what it was for the internet didnt work it was a mess  The last office I visited connected back into the server room making a complete ring  Wow  I decided I didnt really want the job so I was going to tell Head Lawyer the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  I knocked on his office and sat down  He asked me what I thought  I said to put it bluntly everything in these offices that runs on electricity whose primary purpose is not to provide lighting needs to be replaced  No exceptions  He frowned and told me the last tech pretty much said the same thing  Listen he said the girls here are used to Windows  lets keep it like it is  Just fix it  I told him this was not a traditional network layout and I was not willing to support it  I wish you the best of luck in finding somebody who can support this  I would love to replace all this for you and build you a modern setup but I cant do it and keep anything you currently have  I shook his hand and reiterated my desire to build him a real network then left  I went home washed my hands and then upon further recollection took a shower  I spent the rest of the afternoon thinking hard about my life,The girls here are used to Windows  lets keep it like it is  Just fix it,1165,TalesFromTechsupport

friends  Im mostly ok with this as nobody has unreasonably taken advantage yet and it can be kind of funSo   this morning Im bleary eyed and still in bed no uni at the moment so Im the queen of lieins

do you have any tricks to make a computer turn onMe  Um what  Well yeah lots  Start at the beginning talk me through what happensUC  When I press the button nothing comes up on the screen usually theres some writing and the windows logo and so on  It makes some long beeping noises and then nothing else happensMe  Ok off the top of my head that sounds like hardware failure for some reason in my head at this point Im going through the list of things most likely to fail  It doesnt sound like a typical hard drive failure to me as Id expect it to get a bit further along before dying I think to myself PCI graphics card  Maybe not think his machine has integrated graphics  Could be the RAM its always the RAM so on the bright side if its dead theres a decent chance we can get your data backPause  Inspiration hits meMe  Wait have you ever cleaned the fansUC  No whyMe  That machine is over five years old you have two dogs you keep it in a tiny room wedged under the desk and the weather is really warm at the moment  If youve never cleaned out the fans or had someone else do it theyll be full of layers of ancient congealed dust  Its probably overheating  If you think you can manage it turn it off completely go grab a screwdriver take the side panel off the tower and have a look it should be pretty obvious if thats the problem  Be really careful not to touch any of the circuitboards as you can kill them really easilyUC  Ah I can probably manage that Ive seen someone else do it before  You really think thats the problemMe  If youre careful theres no harm in having a lookUC  All right Ill have a look and ring you back and tell you what Ive foundAn hour and a half later my phone rings againUC  Yeah ok  It was completely choked with dust  Theres a fan over the bit in the middle of the motherboard  is it called a heatsink at this moment Im beaming with pride that hes used a vaguely accurate term to describe something  That was the worst one it looked like it could barely moveMe  Well that explains itUC  Yeah  I went and found a little soft brush and got the worst of it out at this point I winced a bit then spent about half an hour trying to hoover all the gunk out of the carpet  Turned it on with the side off and it didnt beep at me so I turned it off again put the side back on and connected everything upMe  Is it all working properly thenUC  Yeah its actually so much faster than it was before and its not making a noise like a dying vacuum cleaner anymoreMe  That doesnt really surprise meIm absolutely floored  This is the man who damn near had a heart attack when Internet Explorer stopped working properly and I teamviewered him couldnt fix it installed Chrome instead and showed him how to use it  When I was a kid I changed the colour of the boxes around windows on his Win computer and he thought Id hacked it  He thought the printer info box that came up when you booted was a virus and was scared of msconfig  He thought he could use a power cable from a desk lamp to extend the length of his ethernet cable  And suddenly hes perfectly ok with delving into his computer innards to diagnose and then fix the problem on his own initiative  And hes absolutely thrilled that he was able to make it work and then says that hes about to try and back up his stuff onto an external drive in case it fails for real next time  Im overcome with joy and pride  Then he ruins itUC  So  Will this make the internet fasterTLDR  Overcoming technophobia in adults a stepbystep processEdit This thread has put me at  comment karma and this makes me

Cintax,138,193,r6gwm,901,First post in this subreddit Sorry its a wall of text but I at least broke it up into chunks A Bad StartSo a few years back shortly after graduating college I caved to my parents and gave up doing freelance work in lieu of getting an actual fulltime job Thing is this was right after the economy imploded so things were scarce the massive global financial company where Id interned in IT was still in a hiring freeze but thats a different story Adding to the issue was the fact that I wanted to do get more into the programming side of things as opposed to support but almost all of my previous experience was in support So finding jobs was shall we say difficultIn my desperation I turned to Craigslist and found a promising job My first red flag was when I arrived for the interview Looking for the building where the company was Id come to a narrow doorway in between two Chinatown knockoff shops with a rickety elevator Wary but undeterred I gave it a shot hoping to avoid getting mugged on the way there Getting off at the floor I was directed to I was surprised to find it completely renovated with wood floors glass doors Roman style columns the works The effect was jarring doubly so as I looked out the window to find a very obvious sweatshop across the alley But nonetheless I walked onDuring the interview performed by the two business partners the CEO and the CTO they made noises of uncertainty regarding my experience in the field so we struck a deal Id work for k less than the advertised salary and Id get bumped up to it if they were happy with my work upon my review  months in In retrospect I shouldve got that in writing But they signed me up and I began coming in The JobThe job itself was going to be building landing pages for ad campaigns and doing some light IT support around the office When I started however I found that there was already a part time IT guy who was still in college and who they obviously intended to replace with me doing occasional support work and part time programming I felt this was not cool but I needed the jobI was disappointed to find that contrary to their claims of working with big name companies they were actually a middleman for online campaigns The types of pages that you get either when you click on an ad or that come up in a popup with a form asking for your personal information that they promise will be kept confidential hint they resell itThe job was made difficult due to the fact that everyone was running old eMachines running single core Celerons with about  gig of RAM this was  years ago and Id already had a quad core at home for a while Id sometimes spend dozens of minutes waiting for it to complete operations like the painful process of opening Photoshop files on their poorly pirated copies of Photoshop I should also mention that their Verizon line would die about once every  days resulting in hours on the phone with Verizon and having the boss yell at all of us as if it were our fault they were too cheap to upgrade to a proper business class connectionThere were also rumblings You see there were only a total of about  employees including me and the CEO and CTO But not one other than them had been at the job for over a year despite the company being  years old Legend had it that the entire former staff and up and walked out one day Hard to believe as the economy wouldve already been bad by then but managements paranoia seemed to reinforce these things At one point while they were at a convention my coworkers insisted that they had listening devices around the office and were eavesdropping on us because one of them made a comment about something someone said to themselves while alone in the office late one night They gave me this warning written on a piece of paper which they immediately threw out once Id read it Internet was monitored mail was monitored you had exactly  minutes to take a lunch no exceptions etc All of this can be yours plus a low salary and a grand total of  days off a year Did I mention that we were sometimes required to work from remotely from home on weekends A Not So Secret CodeAnyway I put up with it because a jobs a job I slowly worked out all of the IT issues to the point where things began running smoothly and in my off time I began helping out a coworker whose sole job was to run reports Massive reports hed spend hours on pulling in data for a dozen sources to try to figure out how much money we should be making compared to what we got paid and how much we should pay out It was incredibly tedious and frustrating and I figured hell what are programmers for other than to turn the tedious and frustrating into something quick and easy So I automated some data calls for him and wound up getting stuck at the major bottleneck decrypting data thats manually done through a rd party system that provided no API As it is I was screen scraping for some data already and the site was painfully slow at times with no batch decryption available I stared at it frustrated and noticed a pattern Sitting down with a pen and paper on my lunch break I figured out that the encryption was actually  sets of encryption algorithms that substituted numbers for sets of letters with a delimiter in between number sets and a key appended at the end representing the encryption scheme Made a bulk decoder for it and was proud to realize it worked and that Id actually just decrypted something off the top of my head with some guess work because this rd party was too incompetent to use an actual encryption scheme My coworkers morning reports went from taking  hours to taking about half an hour My only concern was that to do all of this I needed to use a users credentials For testing I used my own before asking my boss for an account for tools I built She shrugged it off remarking that it was unnecessary and to leave it as is I told her Id really be wary of that and that it really SHOULD be its own account gtNo and thats final we cant afford to go around making tons of user accounts on this systemOf course there were half a dozen already there under our company for employees who didnt even work for us anymore so I knew this was BS immediately Oh well Id warned her Other tools followed piggy backing on this which would literally cut out work by days every week freeing us to do more useful work and productivity soared The Lithuanian Word for HellI did similar automation for our newsletters all of which while churning out landing page HTML templates on a daily basis and eventually my boss let me work on our custom CRM and CMS systems Ive to this day never seen such a nightmare They were written by a Lithuanian programmer who learned to program as he went along The first  sections had no functions All the code was copypasted and duplicated for reuse There were also no comments no proper indentation no includes to break up the code into chunks nothing Also the variables were Lithuanian words abbreviated to things like kzh or vzb or skazd  Also some of the  or  letter abbreviated variables differed by a single letter or swapped letters such as kreas and kraes I began wondering what sort of war criminal Id been in a past life to deserve thisYou could clearly trace the path where he learned about things Like one page stored the date in the db as a Date object in SQL while another stored a date as MMDDYY which lead to problems like sorting by month across several years when you sorted columns by date ie    etc I figured if I could decrypt something offhand I can figure this out and I mostly did albeit painfully tracing every single variable manually fixing plenty of bugs along the way I even managed to update it visually Had to add a proper menu since I more than doubled the amount of tools available and added a proper per user permissions system for the tools that was granular and easy to use And of course I integrated a lot of disparate systems together to give my coworkers more data to work with and again had to user my user account after double checking with the CTO again that we werent making a separate account for it The Hammer DropsEventually it was time for my review  months later than scheduled My bosses praised my work and the results They said they couldnt be happier and that I was WAY better than those amateurs theyd hired before me their own words They saw a lot of great and promising work we could do together Then they began getting up to leave gtHey before we forget you mentioned a salary bump if you were happy with my work by my review They slowly sat down and the mood changed gtOh you see you misunderstood We meant that when we reviewed you youd get health benefits Those are worth about three thousand per persongtBut you said the job had an x salary and benefits Even assume youre including benefits which is not the case according to how you wrote this thats still k short of the stated salarygtNo you dont understand I know youre new to the business world I wasnt but this is how things are runNeedless to say that I was not happy so I immediately began job hunting Unfortunately I couldnt quit as I had a mortgage to pay and worked so late that I barely had enough time or energy to do actively look It was around this time that a lot of template work began really coming in It was mostly for those forprofit online universities some of which can be rather shady and they had massive forms University of Phoenix alone had thousands of interdependent items in dropdown menus and short deadlines Additionally a bunch of the tools Id built pointed to fraudulent data being passed which my boss made my number one priority to weed out daily At this point my job became largely mind numbing data entry I offered to try to automate removing fraudulent data with an algorithm but wasnt allowed time to do so on top of daily filtering by hand and template building Additionally thatd require access to our data management system that all of the forms submit too and which builds the form processor It had some serious bugs in it and Id offered to help fix it countless times but was never given access and informed that it was strictly maintained by a contractor who works offsite and who I wasnt allowed to speak to When I dug up his info from a carelessly forwarded email from my boss to me in order to contact him about a massive failure hed caused by checking in a typo I got yelled at by management gtYou dont seem to understand in the real world all of this stuff is segregated You have to get used to not being allowed to talk to other programmers about problemsOf course being my first programming job was not the same thing as my first job I knew plenty of coders and had done IT work for them before so knew she was full of shit but said nothing The job had just become mind numbingly depressing by then and I was too drained and demoralized to find a better jobWed had a turnover rate of one person a month since Id been hired and were down to a total of  employees including myself and the  executives by this point And every single one of my coworkers hated working there myself included The Other ShoeTheres always a breaking point For me it started when my mom got cancer and Id requested  days off of work  weeks in advance to take her to the hospital for thyroid surgery It was approved we went and she made it through ok and is now much better But it set into motion the end of my employment thereYou see  months later Id finally scored an interview for an interesting company that Id be excited to work for and asked for a day off under the guise of a doctors checkup to go to the interview I was called into the management office and proceeded to get chewed out for Im not making this up  hours the CEO was one of those people who legitimately enjoyed yelling at people at the top of her lungs They complained that my attitude had become negative no shit that Id been taking an hour at lunch instead of  minutes that Id been consistently  minutes late to work for the past  months starting right after my review that I complained too often about not getting access to fix broken system etc Then they proceeded to deny me that day off citing that Id  already taken plenty of days off recently Now Ive been working there for  months and had taken a grand total of  days off  for being sick myself and  for my mother Thats right they were chewing me out for taking days off which Id earned planned in advance with their consent to take my mother for cancer surgery It was at that moment that I decided that I was done Fallout or I told you soThe day Id asked off for finally rolled around and I sent an email pleading sickness My email was dripping with sarcasm and melodrama I didnt care I went to the interview and proceeded to bomb it Months without talking shop about relevant coding practices left me knowing most of what I needed but unable to describe anything or remember fundamental terms I walked home as depressed as everIt was at this point that my phone alerted me that my email account was offline Figuring that theyd decided to punish me by firing me with no one to replace me I suddenly found myself slightly relieved to my surprise I was free A terribly depressing weight had been lifted from my shoulders I went home for a napI woke up  hours later to about a dozen missed emails By this point theyd disabled and deleted all of my account credentials from all of their systems which brought half the CRM and all of the reporting systems to their knees since like I told them months earlier they were all using my account credentials for their hooks Truth be told even Id forgotten all about it till that point Authentications for automated processes failed across the board destroying their ability to monitor their income based on traffic reports which was problematic as theyd previously fired the company accountant who was the only one other than me who knew how to assemble those up by hand The entire company came screeching to a halt And since no one else knew how to code or access the code or where in the code the credentials were they had a hell of a time changing itMy coworker called to inform me that the bosses had been screaming at one another in their office for over  hours and that this was the best day hed ever had since he started working there The company survived after being down for several days somehow though I dont know the details of it My coworker found a new job shortly afterward and that was my last contact at the company With the looming specter of my mortgage looming over me I lived off of my savings and Id managed to find a new job about  weeks after leaving for better pay salary environment people and benefits and am still working there to this day having just received a raise and a promotion to boot just a few days ago And where I work now they actually listen to me when I tell them we need exclusive system credentials Because when they dont I have a story that I tell themEDIT Remembered that he was Lithuanian not Czech dont know why I mixed that up when I originally wrote thisEDIT  Holy

maumacd,174,162,vr9db,879,So I know around here there are a lot of big name companies we all love to hate on this board but this a story about one of them and our year long battle with them and how it ended up getting resolvedOur ISP is the only one that services our area with high speed internet We literally have no other options which is why we even ended up fighting this for a whole year rather than switching to another providerWe had been having an issue where our internet would go out randomly for about  minutes and then it would come back up and be all hunkydory At first we were like well thats certainly annoying After it started happening EVERY HOUR we began to get really upsetUnfortunately due to the large customerservicehell automated phone system we were NEVER able to actually get a service rep on the phone while the issue was actually occurringThem Well I can ping your modem and I dont see any sort of problems connectingUs We know It comes back after  minutes We cant get you on the phone before it comes backThem Well were not seeing a problem so there is nothing we can doSo this exact conversation goes on for months Which is REALLY frustrating Especially when we got flagged as a repeatcaller Ever call began with are you STILL calling about that connection dropping issue with a weary sigh from the unfortunate tech we got on the phoneAfter one night of attempting to stream a movie on netflix and restarting the modemwaiting  minutesrestarting the modem about  times I lost it I had been dealing with this nightmare for about  months at this point and I just couldnt take it any moreI called the ISP and I cried I just let it all out on the poor support guy As someone who works in the support area I knew what I was doing was wrong and this poor support guy not only had nothing to do with causing my issue and that this poor guy simply did not have any tools at his disposal to help me But it didnt matter I cried for like  minutes on the phone with this guy about how frustrating this whole thing had beenThen he told me the loophole I could upgrade to the business class of service which is about  extra a month for the level we were at already and they would send a service tech to our house for free for any issue and if I was unsatisfied with the solution or no solution had been found they would keep sending someone out until I was satisfied Up to this point we had someone out to check our cables about  times already but we were charged each time and there had been no real work done The first time I think they just walked in and replaced the modem the second time the ran some tests couldnt confirm the issue in the  mins they were there so they left etcSo I tell this poor guy that I have been completely losing my cool on for like  minutes that I dont honestly see how that could help He then tells me that those service calls cost the ISP a lot and if a business customer is racking up a lot of them they GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED so they can stop sending people out Apparently he used to work for the dispatch part of the ISP who calls those guys out and he knew that after  call outs on a business client who is not paying for each one it gets escalated up the pipeline fastSo I say sure sign me up for the business class and send someone outAfter the th service guy was sent out THEY GOT SERIOUS At this point they had Replaced our modem  times  Added  different linefilters to weed out other signals disrupting the line Spent hours sitting in their van waiting for the signal to go out and then running tests Rewired our house to the pole Rewired the entire neighborhoods pole systemAfter all this they decided it was time to send out the big guns We were told that Scott would be coming next time What we didnt realize until he got to our house was that Scott was not an onsite tech He was the type of guy that didnt have to deal with this shit He was a big kahuna and all the other techs lived in fear of himWhat was the problem Scott diagnosed within about  minutes Our neighbor Who had never complained about their service is a retired guy and a big fan of tinkering He had created a bunch of things for his wifes garden which IS a very lovely garden and VERY designed and meticulously maintained that she could turn off and on remotely or change settings about how they movedran or actually program things to do a certain dance every set period of time Think windmills and faeries and other yard art and fountains with different settings What no one had realized in all their visits is that all the tinkering stuff he set up completely fucks most wireless signals and throws crazy interference over the cable line back to all the other people within range which is only us because we are the only two houses on our poleOnce he figures it out Scott goes over to the neighbors house and spends the next  hours drinking our neighbors beer and talking about all the cool stuff my neighbor has made for his wife and how he can fix it so it stops fucking over our internetNow every time our internet goes out the first thing we do is poke our head to look at the neighbors garden Is there a new gnome TLDR ISP amp I spend a year

just had all our Wang terminals replaced with Windows  PCs running mainframe emulators And being a government department dealing with very sensitive personal information our security was locked down tighter than an eels ass We had to lock our screens every time we stood up from our desks and the keyboard shortcut for doing so on the Wang terminals had been ingrained into the employees reflexes sometimes for decades        When we got these newfangled things I had a poke around them and noticed a couple of points   Firstly the mainframe emulator was an offtheshelf model with no special security built in That was all handled on the mainframe end   Secondly Windows  vanilla installs included this little applet called Windows Recorder For those who werent around at the time this was basically a keystroke macro recorder A keylogger in other words   Thirdly the management being unfamiliar with the new systems meant that many people were still reflexively using the mainframe screenlock key instead of the Windows screenlock when they walked away from their computer And given that most of them were running the mainframe emulator fullscreen the result looked enough like what theyd been trained to expect that they would indeed walk off leaving their PC if not the mainframe session wide open   Fourthly Windows Recorder would save its macros in files which were unencrypted and thus if you looked at every other byte humanreadable with a little practice  I think you see where this is going      So I wander down to the office manager who is something of a blustery bloke and not really technical material and tell him there might be a security issue with mainframe passwords and could he give me his opinion on it Hes willing to give me ten minutes so I ask him to log onto the mainframe  just to the main menu screen is fine I then ask him to lock his screen and step away as he would normally do OK I tell him imagine youve left the room for a couple of minutes Someone comes along and does this  and I step around to his keyboard notice he hasnt locked Windows and fire up Recorder and hide it  Then you return to your computer log back on to the mainframe  he does  and continue on your merry way OK lock your screen again At some point whether it be that same day or your lunch break or even a week later youre not in front of your computer for five minutes once more and the person who was there before does this I call up the background Recorder stop it running pull up the macro file in Notepad and scan for his userID then the string of bytes immediately following it And hey prestoI hand him a piece of paper with his userID and password written on it      Now at this point I am a cocky kid who has just apparently cracked national security in thirty seconds flat for a multibilliondollar organisation whose privacy controls are matters of national politics Oh and as far as this manager knows I can access any level of security in the mainframe at will including everything logged under his userID In retrospect I probably shouldnt have stood there grinning and looking entirely too pleased with myself or let the manager decide which channels to escalate this information toAs a result that afternoon I am hauled into his office in front of a number of very unsympathetic unsmiling people in suits who have never graced our office before and dragged over the coals There ensues something of a verbal brawl  theyre trying to determine if I have already compromised the mainframe which controls billions of government dollars or leaked the information to anyone else Im annoyed at the way Im being treated because I was the first person to actually bother to tell them about the very easily identifiable giantass security hole THEY shipped out to every office in the nation I should have been getting a goddamn commendation as far as I was concerned Maybe a medal for as I may have put it in a heated moment Doing all your lazyass jobs FOR you and apparently doing it better      So eventually all the shouting dies down and the suits realise they have to actually do something about this because were a civilian not a military department and there is nothing stopping me from walking up the road to the local Member of Parliaments office and regaling him with enough juicy material to win him headlines well into the next electoral period They cant even fire me  the union for that place was a sixhundredpound gorilla and its hobby was jumping up and down on managers The intimidators have nothing to work with All theyve accomplished is irritating me  Oh and a last point This was the mids well before flatpanels became common As the security detail is shuffling out I toss at them Of course you realise that even if you fix this we still dont have TEMPESThttpenwikipediaorgwikiTEMPEST shieldingThey go bananas They want to know where I heard that term what Ive been doing everything But fuck em they already blew their chance I tweak them a little further by telling them that most computer people have known about it for years  didnt they keep up with the industry  and that it was frankly none of their goddamn business what Id been doing in my personal time Finally as theyd made perfectly clear over the last hour IT security wasnt my problem It was theirs I was going to have a really good nights sleep that night        Then there was the time I made a manager I disliked spend her time personally training me to press three buttons on a VCR        but thats another storytldr MIBs  squibs  INDEX EDIT  Next

HaybuckPony,212,223,12e96o,870,This morning I walk into the office to a ticket labeled Broken Laptop Clicking it open its from a manager that is well known in the IT Department here for being technologically illiterate And even more so most of the folks he manages are as bad if not worse than he is The ticket text is completely blank so I figure its not hugely urgent Brew my morning cup of coffee and then swing over to the lab area where he and his employees workI find him pacing out in front of one of our smaller labs He explains that this is a critical issue as one of his employees cant work at all I nod ask him who and he points over to the corner of the room Gerald not his real name of course he says As we begin to walk over he begins to elaborate Apparently this month they are doing crosstraining between receiving technical support booking shipping and ordering So all of these employees will be jumping from workstation to workstation Something slowly begins to tick away in the back of my head That something is very wrong in paradiseNow this warrants a little backstory At my place of employment we use Dell Laptops exclusively Each laptop has a monitor keyboard and mouse on occasion a USB Hub or set of Speakers as well hooked up to a docking station We primarily use Latitude Es and up so for the most part all of our laptops use the same docking station However there are a few cases where they do not For example the folks in shipping use Latitude Ds One of our older employees in Booking uses a VostroAs I walk over to the machine around the corner and up the slight incline I can already see the issue But hearing it from this managers mouth just really put the icing on the cakeWhen Gerald came in today to work in Booking his laptop wouldnt fit on the docking station I figured it was just weird like there was a piece of plastic in the way or somethingContinuing to walk forward with this explanation the laptop is indeed on the docking station A Vostro On a D Docking StationSo I figured a little elbow grease would do the trick right Got over there and pushed It was a tough little sucker but it finally went on But now the monitor wont light up I have no idea whats wrongI pick up the entire unit laptop and docking station removing the wires from the dock The laptop is skewed from the back of the dock at about a  degree angle There is a faint rattling sound as I lift the machine into the air And the machine really really is not coming off of the dock TLDR Captain were not gonna make it Shes too wideEDIT Typos Typos everywhereEDIT  Holy crud Im the quote of the day Im honored,Starship Enterprise to Docking Bay  do you copy,1093,TalesFromTechsupport

efficientlyUdina We cant question his abilityAnderson IT needs a measured response And areaguys the best weve gotUdina Ill make the callGreetings fellow tech support soldiers  here with another tale of that most blessed of lists the Black List For those not in the know one of my previous positions had this idea implemented At this time my boss was an awesome guy and hed listened to my idea of The Black List had me get the numbers together and pitched it successfully to the CO level The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us with proof that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communicationThis would end up being my defining incident in the time I spent at FirstAid It came on the heels of a very bad professional incident in our department but in my personal life things were going great I was dating Heavylegs and happy as could be Of course we all know what happens in IT when things are going along smoothly and happilyIt endsIt started with a massive cockup by a Level  engineer that to this day I maintain was not at all an accident L was on his way out and had decided to screw over everyone at the company Of course he did this in ways that most users wouldnt know or care about Group Policy edits were made to completely remove the data limit in Outlook for storage File servers and networked file storage had their access rights either cleared preventing access and requiring repair or cleaned such that anyone could access anythingDid I mention that FirstAid was a medical facility with several dozen clients of medium or larger size This was a major problem Had we not been on the ball and in fact on the lookout for L to pull this wed have been seriously hosed As it stood we barely managed to fix things overnight before the next shift We missed somethingRemember that meatgrinder department I so do love telling stories about We met my erstwhile companionhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentslauotheblacklistbrokenhearts there as well as dealt with a not so small problemhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentslqildtheblacklistalphacounter there This department was of course led by one person and that one person reported to the CO level We shall call her AnnaWhen Anna decided to come in for work early on Day  of what would become War she decided to start her daily routine of getting into everyones business by making her way to the shared network drives and seeing what she could find Depending on the data that she accessed she could have been fired and sued or even arrestedSo of course she decides to look for a certain legendary file What does she find there on that network share A copy of the Black List Our CIO required a digital copy of the black folder that Awesome Boss kept and it was a simple spreadsheet of names departments and dates of submission for the Bamphammer The CIO did not sadly keep this file somewhere relatively obscureYes Anna was able to get into ITBLACKLIST with no problems She made a copy of this file on her desktop and decided that it was time her people got removed from the list As she scanned her department she noticed that Heavylegs was now freshly in the clear she had just been removed from the list the previous week and we had celebrated that fact with well Ill tell you when you get older TFTSThis could not do and Anna was at the front door of the office as Heavylegs and I arrived I was not even in the door before Anna was screaming at me and us telling me that I was setting a horrible precedence for getting off of the Black List I gave Heavylegs a kiss and told her to go on inside and when the door closed behind her I responded to Anna very politely Ive just arrived What the fuck are you talking about AnnaAnna IT IS CLEAR THAT ANY WOMAN ON THE LIST CAN GET OFF THE LIST BY SLEEPING WITH YOUNope Not even going to fight this one My cellphone is in my hands as she screeches and Awesome Boss is called As he had just gone home not more than a few hours before I apologize for waking him retrieve HR Girls number and give her a callAs Anna continues to gripe at me I inform HR Girl of the situation and request that she send someone out Ending the call I see HR Girl exit her office inside and come my way stopping to lean into an office door and linger momentarily before she heads my wayFollowed by the Director of HR DHR was as tall as I was six foot five He was far better built than I was at the time and probably could have doubled as a granite statue if he so chose In hindsight it was probably good that HR Girl brought him because she would not have been good backup as Anna described how it was bullshit that someone had to provide sexual favors for Black List removalAs DHR exited the building Anna turned to continue her tirade She fell silent at DHRs upheld handDHR Anna there is no reason to be screaming at this employee as he is coming in for workAnna This man is perpetuating a list of sexual favors to be allowed to workDHR So you decided to go around the chain of command and confront him directly At this point HR Girl comes over to me and escorts me to my desk Our conversation is about how baseless the accusation is until it hits us both as Girl Power my current L apprentice comes to meet usHow in the hell did Anna access the ListAs GP begins to update me on the status of the file permissions it hits us A check of the logs later and we see the truth Before the rights were fixed she managed to get in She made a copy I rolled my eyes and shook my headHR Girl Ill speak with DHR after this and let him knowI began the holy procedure of Cover Your Ass and gather all of the information necessary to prove that this list is not exclusive HR Girl lets me know that DHR would like to see me so I collect this evidence and gather a few other bits of information just in case before I head for HR with GP in towAs I approach I see Heavylegs in the windowed office and she is in tearsRage I know exactly what is about to happen and it infuriates me I turn to GP and she knows GP  you dont have to do this  Youre right I dont Im going to go in there and fight What I need you to do is call Awesome Boss and let him know whats happening Tell him I owe him a bottle of the good stuff but its time to call in a favor from NickGP Nick What does the CEO owe us Why are you going right there Theyre about to fuck with my relationship GP Im not going to let them Im going to go nuclear in there if I have toWith a fist bump we part I turn back to the room and move to the door opening it Immediately conversation stops and the only thing I have is the scene DHR and the Director of IT sitting across from my nowweeping girlfriend On the side of the Directors is Anna smug and practically dancing in her seatI am told to have a seat in the chair next to the Director of IT I politely decline and move down to where Heavylegs was attempting to control herself I kneel and whisper words to her Those words are not your business but they helped to start the calmingdown process I kissed her on her forehead and sat down next to her placing the ratherlarge folder of evidence in front of me DHR  were here to address some serious accusations towards you and the IT department regarding the Black List Could you tell me what your relationship is with Heavylegs My relationship status is none of your business However the requisite paperwork for dating a coworker is on file with your office I have copies here of it including your signatureThey arent expecting this DHR shifts uncomfortablyDHR That will not be necessary The concerns here are that sexual harassment is occurring with women on the List specifically that if they sleep with you they will be removed from the list Patently false I am not even involved with the process for removal You are In fact I have here a list of Black List removals which are signed off on by HR Girl and yourself I also have the original Black List documentation stating that the approval and removal processes both go through your office Are you telling me DHR that you are also accusing me of violating the rules of this list designed with mutual cooperation between our departments specifically to avoid this type of conductDirector of IT is smiling I am not Rage is coursing through my body like a venomous bite looking to burn me out We go back and forth DHR attempting to get me to admit to sexual harassment and my refusal He gets progressively madder and progressively paler as I present my evidence Transcript of the meeting where Heavylegs was removed from the list This meeting took place between Awesome Boss Heavylegs Heavylegss Boss Oh thats Anna isnt it HR Girl and the Director of HR It included signatures of all attendees Continued in a reply to this post wow this got longEDIT Just got fired whee

Defiant,266,195,1i2xy9,856,This incident still bothers the hell out of me it happened a few weeks ago  This is by far the most disturbing thing Ive ever seen in my life and makes all other annoying users since then not seem too bad anymore  Some context first I work for a company with locations in many countries  I had been sent to one of these overseas locations to get the Help Desk in order I am a technician myself the techs there were not following proceduredoing tickets on time etc they were also having a raised floornew AC installed in the server room and since I had nothing else to do in this country in a remote small town area I stuck around to watch it with the IT staff thereIt was on a Sunday night around pm and there were  contractors we had hired to do the work in the server room  They were being checked in on every  minutes or so to see their progress and things were going a little slow but the work was good  We had just left the server room and went to the IT section right next door when it happenedThere were loud cries for help in another language and screaming we ran to the server room to see the three contractors surrounding the other  He was laying in the floor motionless with blood around his mouth and on his head he looked dead  Ive seen this sort of thing in movies but I was not prepared for it in real life  The IT manager with me was in shock as was I but I snapped myself out of it and got him to contact Security immediately they had medics on site  The medics came and then eventually an ambulance showed up which took him to the hospital  By this point he was conscious and moving but irrational and trying to fight anyone who came near him he had to be sedatedWhat the hell actually happenedAs soon as Health and Safety cleared us took about  hours we left for the hospital  The three contractors were outside and were furious at us misdirected rage because of their hurt friend I had to calm them down as they were about to literally kill the IT manager one took him by the arm behind a van and screamed in his face  To make a very very long story short that Ive had to answer and explain to about two dozen managersdirectorsVPs and healthsafety staff over and over the injured contractor had opened the door on a large rack size UPS removed the bottom security panel stuck his head in the bottom of the UPS while reaching for something  His head came into contact with the  Volt rails and he was electrocuted  At no point were they supposed to be near the UPS they were well aware of this and the next morning when we went to check on him again bringing the whole IT dept this time as backup he refused to answer why he went near the UPS  Thankfully last I heard aside from a big burn on his head and hands he is going to be alright which was a massive reliefThere are other details we have found out since then but I cant say them publicly this whole thing was a stressful compounding mess and I didnt sleep for days after it  What a nightmare but the contractor is alive and well and since then other contractors were sourced to finish the work  Im relieved this is all over with,A life was nearly lost the server room upgrade gone very wrong,1051,TalesFromTechsupport
cobysev,144,253,ua2ee,852,A little background I work IT for the US Air Force  This happened about a decade ago when I was young lowranking and ambitious  IT customers had yet to whittle away at my motivation back thenAt the time I worked in a network security position at a base in the Pacific  Managing firewalls antivirus etc  One day while manually pushing antivirus updates to stubborn PCs on the network I noticed a potential flaw in our security  Instead of downloading the latest antivirus updates directly from the companys website as soon as they were released a higher level of the Air Force would download them and test them before releasing them for the individual bases to download  It was the militarys little bit of added security  make sure the antivirus company hadnt been hacked and were releasing viruses instead of updatesThe problem with this process was that the Air Force testers were slow  Really slow  It would be anywhere from  days to  weeks before the latest updates were ready for us to implement  I trusted our AV company so I figured Id help speed up the process  I wrote a little batch script that would check the AV website daily and compare their update with our servers If it matched the script ended  If there was an update it would download and automatically push to all servers and PCs  This also saved me the trouble of burning the Air Forces copy to a disc and moving it to our servers this was before flash drives were popular  This saved me about  minutes of my morning and ensured our network was always updated and securedFastforward a few months  Theres a huge malicious outbreak in the world a trojan if memory serves and people without topend protection are finding themselves quickly falling prey to it  All our bases in the Pacific seemed to catch some form of the virus and are losing network capabilities  All bases that is except mine  Other bases are working long hours days on end trying to purge the virus from the entire network  My base network never so much as hiccuped  Because I alone had downloaded the latest updatesNaturally when the dust settles the higherlevel Air Force sends in a team of techies to investigate  They want to know what we did to stay operationable  Suffice to say they found my batch file and they werent pleasedAccording to them I had violated a direct order and circumvented an official process running my own personal unauthorized scripts on their network  I was threatened with a court martial with guaranteed jail time for using hacking tools on a govt network Seriously They even suggested that the virus outbreak mightve been my faultEventually someone with some technical knowledge actually looked at the script and realized what it was doing  Cooler heads prevailed and the Air Force got a chance to really evaluate their system  They realized that I wasnt a criminal but a hero  I had singlehandedly kept a base operational while all the others were losing valuable time money and manpower trying to get back up and runningIn the end I was given a slap on the wrist told not to implement my own personal scripts on govt networks anymore and sent back to work  No court martial paperwork ever came down for meA few months later I find out that I was handpicked out of all my peers across the entire base for an early promotion in rank  When I asked my supervisor about it she said she submitted a recommendation that basically stated that I had singlehandedly saved the base from complete and utter destruction  For once an IT guy was given greater recognition than the pilots who are actually flying missions all day longTLDR  Circumvented an official process to download antivirus updates quicker  Protected an Air Force base from a malicious attack  Nearly got thrown in jail for it got an early promotion instead,How Nearly Being CourtMartialed Earned Me a Promotion,1105,TalesFromTechsupport

insufficientfunds,140,243,tgf54,860,A bit about my Grandpa  he was a VA State Trooper for a longass time basically from when he was old enough to be one until retirement After he retired from the force he worked in an HR dept at a regional trucking company I remember going to his office once  they didnt have computers just paper and typewriters He worked there until the company shut down which was about his retirement ageSince then he and my grandma have only ever had a desktop its changed a few times but always bottom of the line He never used it unless one of the grandkids were helping him look for a new carAnyways a few years ago I was visiting and he came up to me with a sale add from Best Buy or Circuit City or some store like that and asked me what I thought of a particular laptopI looked through the various laptops at the time and the one he picked out was easily the best one available I asked him and he was like Well its got suchandsuch CPU XXgb ram a big hard drive and the screen is big  of course this stunned me Someone thats never really used a computer and he knows what the hell all of this is Totally unheard ofA few months pass by and I never hear anything more of it  Its about  months later and Im visiting again He comes to me with his new laptop that I didnt even know he had purchased btw asking me to help him fix his antivirus software  It had the factory installed SymantecNorton trial which had just expired  I look at the system and hes installed Office uninstalled some of the vendor apps and been using it wonderfully for a whileThen I also realize that when he bought the laptop he also bought a wireless router previously they only had a wired router bc only had a desktop  So not only did he figure out on his own how to install and uninstall stuff on his new laptop but he also was able to read amp follow instructions enough to setup his damn Wifi and have it functioning correctlyMy grandpa is in his s now and is a better PC user than some of the people in their s and s at my office  I guess it goes to show that some people really can comprehend how to read instructions read messages on the screen and follow a logical path to figure things outOh hes had that system for about  years now and Ive not once been called to fix anything on it Ive checked with the rest of the family as well  he hasnt called any of them eitheredit shit guys top of tfts for now thanks  wish i had more stories most of the stupidity that I come across is perpetrated by my IT coworkers since I dont work the front lines anymore,A surprise from my Grandpa,1103,TalesFromTechsupport

campycapper,191,184,1oflip,853,Well I received a message from a user asking me to update my tales from Bob the most hated evil bastard teacher ever So I thought I would share what my last year has been like with him The back story comes into play here httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsxevetheteacherfromhellAnd when I finally lost my shit at my administration because of them allowing Bob to continue his destructive warpath here httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentszewihatebobpartiianupdateOver the last few years working as an IT guy in a public school system I have witnessed a destructive force of nature that feeds on technology and the tears of IT guys  The single greatest horrors I have endured have been at the hands of a maniac who is so selfdeluded that he believes he is a God among the technology professionals He teaches social studies and his name is Bob I hate Bob I left you last time with the glorious revolution that his technology was going to be pulled from his classroom Unfortunately that lasted only a very short time My administration quickly informed me that he is a long lasting and respected teacher and that my soul was worth less when compared to his teaching So I was forced to replace all of his technology and allow him to begin his process of torment yet again But to be fair he has learned many new things and has finally left some of his old destructive ways in the past I have not had a single cable cut in over a yearSo I will begin with the first story about how he crashed the entire network  We moved to a new system and I am no longer the network admin but I still run all the IT work throughout the school I just do not manage that network  It was a Wednesday and I had just made it home after a long day of teachingit workand my second job They pay teachers and it guys junk so I work other things when I received a distressed message from the new Network manager His entire domain was crashing because our site was pulling so much bandwidth I knew exactly what the problem was right away but not before I got blamed for wiring something wrong or using our network to pirate material  I had to come back to the campus late at night so that he could load up my desktop and view what I was running Of course I had nothing running I do not pirate nor utilize pirated material at work as that would be really stupid After that I made him walk with me to Bobs classroom In his infinite wisdom Bob had found a spare cable in his classroom and decided to plug it into the two unused network outlets We removed all switches from the classrooms and built a network closet and installed tons of new outlets It is beautiful So Bob had created a giant loop in the network and crashed the entire domain This was only the third day of the year That was only the beginning By the end of the first week I was reminded that Bob has a master key to the entire building and even at my request it was not taken from him I have an IT storage closet where my entire wonderful well organized inventory sits waiting to be placed into classroom or utilized throughout the school It is not a big closet but it is mine mine mineI had organized the supplies in the closet the day before so that I could install a couple of smart boards and run wiring for projectors Now I am a bit particular when it comes to technology my cables are organized my drawers are organized and everything is inventoried so that I know where it is and what I have Then comes Bob I do not know if he comes in at midnight in a drunken rage and has a personal vendetta against me or if his mental capacity is limited in another form but he is a nightmare When I came to work the next morning I immediately went to my closet to grab the well placed supplies for the day and begin work Went I opened my small IT closet an avalanche poured from its interior Bob needed a monitor cable and decided he had the authority to grab it out of my closet himself It was if a tornado had entered into the room got in a fight with a flock of angry ducks and shot with a smoothbore canon  Cables that were hanging from hooks were in giant knotted balls lying underneath brand new projectors that had computer towers thrown on top of them Every drawer in my cabinets was left open with the contents appearing as if someone threw my grandmothers mixer on high speed inside them It was chaotic and he was still without the monitor cable He stated he could not find it and that I should make it easier for the teachers to find the pieces that they need I now have a master lock on my closet and a lock on all of my drawers What boggles the mind on top of the filing cabinet was a tub with clearly marked on side monitor cables But wait there is more There is always more with Bob God damn it I hate Bob This is the story of the missing computer and Bobs gifting I was called in one days to Bobs classroom something was not working appropriately which is normal in a school setting  a plugin needed to be updated for the material he was using As I walked into his classroom I was immediate struck by that feeling that something was off I just could not put my finger on exactly what it was Now whenever I am called into a classroom it is without fail more problems than just the initial request So I expect to spend a good  minutes dealing with a variety of small problems Like Bobs headphones have stopped working so he tried to splice two headphones together so kids can sit on one computer and listen to the same lecture But as I am sitting on a computer dealing with a broken mouse and failed Java update it finally clicks in me one of my computers is missing To be specific the entire setup is missing I immediately grew concerned as no technology is supposed to leave the classroom that I have assigned  without my permission Now Bob has a habit of giving things to other teachers that he thinks will help them so I assume that he has done this with the computer When I asked Bob what had happed he informs me that the computer was not working so he gave it to a student to take home and fix Holy hell the words escaped me I wanted to cuss and raise hell about how incredibly stupid it is to send a brand new computer home to a student or even that it could be dangerous to do that but I am out of energy Bob has beaten me I track the student down he had the computer going on for a week or so When I finally got it returned the student had removed capacitors from the motherboard and opened up the hard drive and PSU I never learned what was actually wrong with the computer as it went straight to the trash Bob will retire in two years He is old and will hopefully die a few years after that When it happens I will dance on his grave and decorate his tombstone with cut network cables and broken motherboards May the devil see him in hell where he will be troubleshooting his own stupidity for all eternity I hate BobTLDR My existence is full of despair because of wild ducks and mixers ,Bob he continues I still hate him,1037,TalesFromTechsupport

PirateGloves,149,192,1po9jt,837,So this story is from about two years ago I had been working doing hardware support for a large company for only a few months getting the hang of everything Mostly my role was swapping HDDs from faulty laptops into working laptops or replacing faulty HDDs in working laptops Nothing terribly cerebral but enough to keep me busyOur fleet at the time consisted of Lenovo Rs with the ohsoglorious Accidental Damage Warranty This story is about the single greatest Accidental Damage Warranty claim I have had the privilege to be a part ofSo back to me bright eyed and chipper young techie looking forward to all the wonderful opportunities afforded by working in a large corporation HA Sorry thats another story working hard fixing laptops and closing tickets when a ticket arrives in my queue from the helpdesk ominously titled Laptop Damage Detailed notes only said that the customer not allowed to call them users official vocab guidelines had damaged their laptop over the weekend and needed a replacementNo worries thinks I Lenovo laptop accidental damage swap HDD and send damaged machine to Lenovo for repair Piece of cake I call the customer to arrange for them to come to the workroom and theyre already skirting around the cause and extent of the damage saying theyll be in as soon as possible Well not  minutes go by and shes at my door laptop bag over her shoulder and a thoroughly harried expression on her faceNow accidental damage isnt uncommon Usually its just been knocked off a table or had a glass of water tipped on itNoNothing could have prepared me for what i saw when I pulled the laptop from the bag To this day I regret not taking photosThe right hand side of the laptop base was demolished Keyboard shattered optical drive hanging out shards of plastic everywhere The frame though it was impressive Its difficult to describe but the frame had been bent down so the side profile of the laptop was semicircular Fascinatingly enough the screen was intactI stared at this thing on my desk for a few moments just taking it in then for a few moments more considering whether or not I should even ask Curiosity got the better of me and I just said This is impressive what happenedHer response came quickly and with some irritationI was out visiting my parents at the farm and the kids were playing with my laptop then a horse stepped on itThe sentence rang in my ears a horse stepped on itWhat possible chain of events could take place for a horse to step on an open laptopAt this point I decided it was better that I didnt know informed the user I would get them a replacement laptop I guessed from the extent of the damage that even if the HDD wasnt completely destroyed it was at least on deaths door so I opted to image a new laptop and transfer the data which was the right call as the HDD died half way through the data transferI think the best part was when I called Lenovo to book it in for repair The guy on the line asked what was damaged so I said Base cover chassis optical drive keyboard palmrest top bezel HDD and mainboardHe was silent for a moment and finally said What happenedA horse stepped on itAnother moments silence then an uproar of laughter as the guy completely lost all sense of decorum when faced with the absurdity of itThats the best one Ive ever heard he said after the laughter died downTrue to their warranty Lenovo repaired not replaced the laptop and sent it back to usBeen a couple years now but this is still the single greatest warranty claim Ive ever made,Im sorry what did you say happened,1029,TalesFromTechsupport

PKLKickballer,144,205,18drcf,837,I once worked as the sole tech support person in an academic department  My job involved desktop support as well as maintaining a file server  The job was always a bad match I didnt like them and they didnt like me  I did a good job though while I was there but finally jumped at the offer of a job elsewhereWhile working in this department my most difficult user Stacy was the department secretary She was a big fan of downloading every piece of junkware she could find and slowing her computer to a crawl  Worse still was that she managed to integrate whatever utility the software enticed her with into her work flow so removing it meant retraining her on the right way to do things  I wasnt allowed to lock down her computer as she might find that demeaning this was the official policy from our mutual supervisor  It was bad enough that I kept an identical computer ready to go and would just transfer her files to it when her computer became unusable then reimage the ruined one and keep it ready to repeat the process  Suffice to say Stacy was not a friend to computersThis is not my tale though  Upon getting a job offer elsewhereI spent my last weeks ensuring that there was foolproof documentation for everything  Disks were organized passwords and serial numbers were listed processes were detailed they were left in a state where most small problems could be dealt with until they hired someone to replace me  I even gave them my phone number at the new job just in case they needed help finding a piece of info or a tip on an easy repair  This was my mistakeStacy was designated to fill in for me while I was gone  As bad as that might have been she actually stepped up to the challenge fairly well  I got calls but they were usually of a nature of looking for a piece of software or needing contact info for someone  I had no problem giving them a few minutes of time here and there  It was going wellAfter a couple of weeks though she called with a much more serious issue the server had crashed and wouldnt restart  Crap they have a lot of important stuff saved there  After a few questions I determined that the drive array was dead I dont know exactly what was wrong but it just wasnt detecting a diskStacy asked how to fix it and I told her right off she probably wouldnt be able to  I said they would need an IT professional to properly diagnose and repair this  Not to be dissuaded she tried framing the question multiple ways  She tried reminding me how important the data was  She proposed her ideas for solutions such as asking how she could restore from the tape to make it work  I just kept explaining that until there was a working drive array none of that would be possible  Id end calls and get another an hour later  This went on for days  Shed call and ask if I could walk her through fixing a drive array over the phoneThis was no longer a simple matter of filling in the blanks with a two minute phone call  I finally had to tell her that if they hadnt managed to hire a new IT guy then they would have to bring in a repair service and there was no way she was going to be able to handle this repair alone  The calls kept coming though from poor Stacy who wanted to be walked through recovery from a catastrophic server failure  I finally just had to ignore all outside calls until she stopped ,Youre not going to fix that,1042,TalesFromTechsupport

belongings and the landlord had NO RIGHT to get rid of them is kind of silly because its actually the landlords property and when you stop paying the rent on it if you didnt care about your stuff enough to take it to a storage unit or drop it off at your parents house as far as the landlord knows you just dont care about your stuff Its abandoned If you wanted it you would have moved it

ebook and other stuff Sign up for the email listhttpeepurlcomsvxX  It all ends with this chapter Its been heartwarming reading all your comments and well I hope to see them here again   I was staring at the screen for what have been minutes I was looking at an FTP server software package It was one of the FTPprograms that we sold actually I opened it and was met with the default screen I knew how the program worked and reopened the previous session It gave me a directory with thousands upon thousands of files You could not know what the files were from the names There were many pictures videos and RAR files scattered around judging from the extensions I didnt know what to do Do I want to know Can I now Should I know What if it is nothing I did not feel well and my legs had become rather heavy I grabbed a chair to sit down I stared at the files once again I decided that they could not have expected privacy here When Ron still worked at my school he had always copied my schedule even adjusted it to suit his purpose and I never felt that my personal folder or school records stored on the school network were safe from his prying eyes He has said some things in the past that he could only know from reading my school record My throat felt like it was being chocked when I opened the first image on the list It was a picture of a full nude woman having sex with a man  it looked like it was taken by the couple themselves Like most of the porn that Ive seen in this store I wasnt particularly excited to see it I looked at another  or so pictures randomly sampled from the first  items I could see It were more pictures like these but with different people I wanted to stop before I hit on one featuring Ron or Don Or bothHe probably ran some back alley porn website for people with rather poor taste Questionable yes Illegal No I was calmed down by now and felt easier when I saw a th image was still loading The download seemed stalled because of connection issues but when I tried to cancel it it suddenly loaded and opened It was a picture of a kid A cute girl I have to sayIt was strange to see a picture of a kid among all this pornography I downloaded the next few images that were on the list to see what was going on As they started opening one by one on the screen my entire body went in shock I quickly tried to turn off the monitor and by doing that even knocked it over What was displayed on that screen was gruesome to see Everything I did not want to see that kid do was there on those picturesI went into what I will still call shock I didnt really respond to anything for a few minutes I was just sitting there watching the screen that had fallen over I did not want to know how much more was on there That was the only thing going through my head How much more was there Did Ron did this Did they touch that kid Was this part of a whole network How long was this going on Who knew about thisI must have tried calming myself down for over  minutes before trying to walk over to Jeremy to tell him all about this whenever I closed my eyes the pictures were still visible to me I did not get very far sitting back on the chair again It wasnt until I saw a figure come in that I freaked The cage was open the papers were scattered on the ground and the monitor was knocked over I looked up and was happy it was Jeremy Jeremy wasnt so happy seeing me in this state He kneeled down be me to ask me what was wrong I didnt say much He would be back in a minute he closed the store door and got me some waterIt took him some time to get me talking and after I told him he was the one that didnt say anything for a while He sat with me for a while before he walked over to the computer and put the monitor to its feet again He didnt doubt me He just needed to know if it was just those photos or if there was more Even accusing Ron ampamp Don with something horrible as this was something they didnt deserve if they didnt do it He walked back to me and said We are going to the police there are thousands He acted strong for me but I knew full well that this was getting to him as wellWe walked to the police station as it was only  minutes away When we stood by the counter an agent started talking with us Jeremy did the word as he seemed to still be able to make himself sound intelligible The agent took us seriously and walked us to the back to one of the offices in the building He gave us something to drink while we waited Cheap disgusting office coffee I can still taste it in my mouth It was my first coffee and my lastAfter  minutes another agent came in with a woman who introduced herself as a detective She would be taking our story as the accusation was something they took very seriously I snapped Its not an accusation I saw it with my own eyes She understood my anger and took the time to calm me down and explain everything We had been at the police station for over  hours when my parents were called to pick me and Jeremy upThe police seized all the computers and hard disks in the store the next morning and Ron ampamp Don were arrested From what I heard Ron was going mental when he was arrested Don was going silently   I obviously had quit this job by now and so had Jeremy In the days and weeks after we were being interviewed by about six detectives about the store Ron ampamp Don and what happened that night I was still underage at that moment and needed to have one of my parents with me I had kept so much about the store from them for better or for worse I told everything My father visibly was breaking apart from all of it He wouldve made me quit before I had even started if I had told him everythingFrank ampamp Richard were also questioned by the police and from talking with them later were for the first time in their life silent for more than a minute Even they had not suspected anything and were genuinely concerned about me and Jeremy The interviews with the police were really heavy on Sarah who only found out when the police came to the front door She was just starting to get her life together Johan and Marcel were questioned as well from what I heard but wether they had anything to tell I dont knowThe store was sealed off after Ron ampamp Don were arrested Weeks had gone by and I hadnt seen or heard anything from them They were still in custody When I walked with Jeremy past the store it had been boarded up Last year after being empty for years it was demolished to make place for a new housing projectIt took months before the trial against Ron ampamp Don started and the police stayed quiet about any progress they had been making in the meantime Jeremy seemed to have recovered quite well from all this probably because he wasnt the one that discovered it He knew what he was going to see and was mentally prepared Maybe it makes sense maybe it does not I dont knowFor me it was something that kept me up at nights I went into therapy for this My view before all this was that therapy is for the crazy people that couldnt deal with the world I was hesitant to go and be labeled as a crazy person Nothing was further from the truth I was processing everything that happened and was finally letting goWhen I went to the trial it was the first time in months that I saw  Ron and Don By now I was done with school and  trying to enjoy my summer vacation before starting at my new school Ron ampamp Don looked different They had lost a lot of weight and looked tired They had on suits which was a strange sight Ron looked at me with an intense hate in his eyes He blamed everything on me I suppose Don didnt look at me He looked like a broken man I started to feel that he had nothing to do with it He wasnt the noblest of men but this went too far to make a profit even he had standardsAt the trial I learned that Ron had been hosting the FTPserver with the content since the late s Around that time the store was doing rather bad and he needed money One of the people he knew had hired him to set up the site that was still being used He was a facilitator not a producerNone of the content of the site was original content according to Rons lawyer Nor had Ron ever created or looked at any of the content I was happy when the prosecution did not challenge this fact It meant that it was probably true According to the lawyer Ron had simply rented the computer out to the third man that was on trial as well I didnt know him I did not want too When it came to the users of the server there were a few dozen of users Every user is of course one to many but there was little to no money to be earned from it Ron and the th man netted about a few thousand a year Not something you would risk everything for But they did I must say I was happy they werent professional The lawyer had tried to get the judge to dismiss the server evidence as it could have been tampered with by me and Jeremy or anyone else for that matter I was relieved when the judge didnt accept it and went on with the proceedings barely acknowledging the attempt from the lawyer It should not have mattered much as at Rons home  more hard drives with the same content were found Backups according to the lawyer Evidence according to the prosecutor Ron was sentence to four years for possession and distribution of the material The third man was sentenced to  years for possession as his contract with Ron for the server could not be provenWhen it came to Don the proceedings became fast The prosecutor was sure of his guilt and participation in the crime But the evidence did not reflect it He never was near the cage and there was no any activity from him logged on the server His house search had turned up nothingThe judge did not find him guilty I still dont know wether or not he knew I hope he did not knew  As for me and Jeremy we stayed together after this but broke up later because he stopped going to school again We still talk but nothing like we used to do He has his own life now As do ISarah recovered completely in the months after We still speak and hang out on a regular basis She now works with an ITCompany that provides software servicesAs for me The therapy had helped immensely and  I moved out of the town after the trial was over to go to a new school Not heaving learned my lesson I took another job about  months later that again involved customers and a rather chauvinistic boss

KeithSqik,141,303,1dxclq,817,WelcomeIve been a long time lurker but a first time poster on this subreddit and now Im currently commuting to my lovely job as a tech support agent I thought it would be lovely to share a few of my stories Obviously over the years Ive had your basic problems like Ive bought a new wireless router and my pc can connect to it but dont have access to the internet Have you connected a cable from your modem to your new router No why should I Its wireless isnt it ltinsert facepalmgt but a few really stick out for different reasons and Ill share them with youIve been in techsupport for over  years now and Ive done it all from Tier  to Tier  and everything beyond that and right now Im working with a team of  others setting up a entire new customer service desk for a brand new ISP But I digress On to the juicy stories minionInvoices and inevitable doomLet us start at the beginning this is a story of my first day about  years ago in customer and tech support and as you can imagine I was quite nervous throughout the entire day but I quickly found my grooveHello this is BigDutchISP KeithSqik speaking how may I assist youAnd a really posh guy answered Hi Ive been having some issues with my Digital television as it doesnt appear to work on any of my settop boxes And I thought Ok this dude has more then one settopbox and none of them work so it could be a splitter problem or something to do with the signal and I collect this guys customer information And much to my dismay I saw the problem right away and to be honest I panicked I seriously started to stutter and to sweat and thought to myself Ah man This guy is going to freak out on me and its only my first day I dont want to handle this shit So I swallowed my fear and said Well Sir I euhm I Ive seem to have located the issue and it seems that you have two unpaid invoices that are due with a total sum of  euro and thats why your television services have been temporarily suspended until the invoices are paid Let me just briefly explain that Ive been trained to handle your basic household subscriptions and the average people spend on their monthly services is around  euros so I was just gutted to see the sheer amount that this guy still owed usAnd I thought this guy was going to ge berserk and he replied Ah ok then I know who to call thanks click and I was stunned WTF just happened I thought this guy would go mentalIt turns out after I did some digging that the customer in question was the owner of a hotel and in every room there was a settop box for video on demand and such and his accountant neglected to pay us Pfew dodged a bullet thereFinding out your son is gay the hard way No pun intendedThis is a story of how a tactical error on my part caused severe repercussions for the customer in question Oi here is goesHello this is BigDutchISP KeithSqik speaking how may I assist youYes well I would like to know why my invoice of this month is so high normally I pay around  euros but this time its over Well I understand why you would want to know that Miss And I collect the customer information and pull up the latest invoice Immediately I see that a paid service number has been called quite a few times and I mean service in this case in the broadest of terms and I tell the lady that if she logs into her account she can see the same invoice Im currently looking at and that she can see that her invoice is so high because of her phone usage She told me that she lived in a three person household just her her husband and their year old son And she had spoken to her husband and he claimed not to the made the callsShe informed that her PC was up for repairs and inquired if I could look in to it I told her that I couldnt give her the number due to legal reasons and I advised her to log in via another pc to check the invoice herselfThats when she got smartShe asked me if I could see the number which I couldnt deny because I told her I have the same invoice in front of me that she received via her accountShe asked me if I had access to google to which I replied well yeah I saw where this was going and I was not amusedShe asked me if I could google the number to see what kind of services it provided So I did and I was not disappointed Ive googled the number but I would like to ask you to confront your son about this phone usage because if your husband didnt make those calls and you didnt it might have been your son Because these calls definately placed with your landlineI want to know what kind of services have been dialed you googled it you have it in front of you I wish to knowConsider said services I press you to speak to your son concerning this matter If you really wish to know I will provide you with the information but at your own riskPlease tell meOk the number that has been dialed of which the costs are in excess of  euros this month are to a Gay Sex Phone Linebut I didnt know my son was gayI really hope it wasnt her husband that called those numbers If you enjoyed these stories Ill add moreTLDR  Pineapples are the source of all evil the entice you with their yellow goodness and then strike you with their poisonous coreEDIT  Included a bit of background info about the second call and thinking about it If the boy in question was  at the time that made it actually illegal for him to call those numbers since they were  lines Never pondered that and I added a TLDREDIT  Fixed a typo and changed wish to hope As a non native English speaker I was never taught the difference and I thought the words were interchangableEDIT As the utheleif rightfully pointed out it appeared I made some accusations towards the son which most definately didnt happen in the original conversation ,Wait I didnt pay my invoice but that means my son is gay,1120,TalesFromTechsupport
Smith,90,176,1a0ojg,814,There are some days where I never understand what is going on in a users head while theyre using a computer Years ago in an Enterprise support environment for a company I used to work for I received a message via a page saying a user at so and so extension left an urgent message for me I was already working on at the time a rather critical project after hours to avoid user impact so of course its also the only time something urgent shows up I give the user a call after checking voicemail from a mobile phone to see what the matter is which of course accomplished nothing and the conversation begins with the user along the lines ofMe Hello this is Smith from the IT Department just returning your message how many I helpUser WHERE IS MY DATAMe Your files Have you looked in My Documents or on the file server for themUser No and I dont want to look for them I just want to get my Excel file openMe Where exactly are you trying to open your file up in the first placeUser From the Recent Files menu in Excel Every time I click on my file it says File not foundFrom this point Im a bit confused as to what is going on with the user Im getting screamed at like no tomorrow and Im a  minute walk from their location Anyways to continue onward the call begins to escalate further I maintain a calm attitude as I automatically head towards the users desk since I knew from experience something like this wasnt going to end well whilst remaining on the phone with them to try to sort this one out I continue to ask them where they think they last saved the file if they moved it around and so on I was eventually able to get out of them My Documents after a lot of resistance from them and I had them check the My Documents folder after getting the exact path out of Excel The user states they see files but not the one theyre looking for I have them use Windows Search to find the file name elsewhere in the computer and no results appearAt this point its clear to me that theyve moved the file renamed it or have otherwise deleted it and I inform them Im on the way to sort out the issue When I asked them to check the Recycling Bin and the Modify dates for their files for safe measure they got furious I received an earful of some colorful words followed by NEVER MIND NEVER MIND BYE clickFive minutes later after getting hung up on I arrive at the users desk to find the user not present Their computer was also missing with the mouse and keyboard scattered around the floor The keyboard was missing some of the keys as they had scattered on the floor and the monitor A CRT was turned and nearly about to fall off of the deskI found the computer moments later around the corner from where their office was in a hallway It was laying on the ground with the side panel busted open they are locked shut for obvious reasons the front panel coming off a small dent in the side of the case the PS plug for the mouse connected to the back of the machine with the rest of the cabling missing and well you can get the picture On the inside of the machine the motherboard tray was damaged missing some of the plastic risers holding it up and some of the addon PCI devices were also coming out of the slots due to the motherboard Nothing else looked damagedIn the back of the machine I found of all things a USB Flash drive I take this drive along with their newly destroyed computer back to my officeserver roomworkshop and begin to find out what exactly happened I was fortunately able to get the hardware out of the case install it in a test bench scenario and get the hardware to start up without issue and survive a small stress test so that was definitely a relief to me at the time For their hard disk I installed that into a known good machine and began to run some forensic software on the drive to search for previously deleted items I connected the USB Flash drive to another machine and upon the device being recognized and mounted I see the missing file perfectly intact with a modify date from the day prior sitting right in the root clearly not at the path the user had mentioned on the phone The forensic software also returned back with that same file showing identical dates and data to what the flash drive copy had but in a deleted stateRather annoyed at this point I copy the file back to the hard disk and ensure it opens I rebuild their system into an extra case deliver it back to their desk with some Kensington locks and then resume the project I was working on prior to the temper tantrum I also filed a report for intentional destruction of company property as required for such incidents which was swiftly handled by management the next dayTLDR User moves file from computer to Flash drive gets upset that they lost it since it wouldnt open in Excel from the Recent documents and smashes computer,Surprisingly it wasnt the monitor,990,TalesFromTechsupport

terahurts,105,188,zjviz,813,Most of my working life has been spent in IT support so Im naturally the first person in my family that gets called when something goes wrong  This usually includes my own kids who generally pick the most inconvenient times to ask me to fix somethingSo a couple of nights ago my son  knows how to install Windows but as far as I knew not so good with TS issues appears at the door with a problem  His PC keeps shutting down after being powered up for a few minutes  Given that his room is usually hotter than the surface of the Sun Im pretty sure his PC is overheating so I tell him either I can take a look in the morning or he can have a go at cleaning all the crud out of the CPU heat sink but if he has problems hell have to wait till the morning for me to fix itI dont see him again so assume hes blown the dust out and everything is ok  The next morning he wanders downstairs with a bunch of screwdrivers fans and cable ties from my box of spares and I ask him if everything is working ok  He repliesYeah I cleaned the dust out but it still kept overheating and shutting down but the big heat sink thing was cold I thought that was wrong so I took it off and cleaned it and put some of that thermal paste on it and put it back on again  It started getting warm then and the PC stayed on but games kept crashing I had another look inside and the graphics card fan wasnt spinning so I tried turning it and it was really stiff  I tried spinning it in my fingers for a bit but it didnt make any difference so I borrowed a fan from your box and cabletied it the card now everythings working OK Thanks DadNot the most elegent of fixes but he figured it out on his own  Proudest Dad Ever,Sometimes its good news,1001,TalesFromTechsupport

VERYLOUDUSERNAME,108,149,1ad0wm,808,Long story bit of setupI subcontract for a guy which well call Joe that provides internet services for hotels The ISP brings a line in and he gets it from there to their offices front desk and to the guests over wireless Hes from a city a couple hours away Generally I cover his clients in my city which well call Loudtown he covers the clients in his JoetownHes on vacation Im covering all of his callsSo I take a call Hey were having some issues with internet on all the PCs in the officeBasic questions followOkay Ill connect in and take a look from my end and give you a call backI can connect into both of their routers Thats a good start The one that handles their back office is show a fair number of dropped packets Im getting a lot of timeouts pinging the load balancer from the router The other router seems fine Figure maybe the cables badI call backOkay from my end Im showing a lot of dropped packets between the router and the load balancer I suspect it might be a bad ethernet cable Do you have any spare cables aroundShe hunts one down calls me backI start trying to walk her through identify either end of the cable that were going to try replacing The load balancer is a little DrayTek device that looks something like thishttpiimgurcomCOLqxMejpg minus the antennasGiven a description and the fact that it says DrayTek on the front She cant find it But she can find the router Im logged in I can see the connection to the load balancer is on port Okay can you see the cable thats plugged into the port that says  on it  Yeah  Okay I need you to follow that to the other end that will be plugged into the DrayTek device  It doesnt go anywhereI dont have any diagrams so theres a possibility that the cable doesnt go directly into the load balancer but it sure as hell goes somewhere I can see the packets flowing through itA few more rounds of this same question phrased different ways and she gets frustrated and puts some other guy on the phone Instead of it not going anywhere nowIt goes into the big machine  Sorry  The big loud machine  Does this big loud machine have a door and shelves inside  Yes Oh ffs  Okay I need you to open the door and look in there For the DrayTek deviceIts a rack with a door btwIts about this point I get a hold on expecting him to start looking Instead I hear some muffled voices and some other guy picks upWe have a support contract This is ridiculous Our whole office is down and everyones standing around unable to work and we have to get our accounting done You need to come in and do this right now  Im sorry Joe is away on vacation right now and Im in Loudtown If youll let me try and assist you Im sure we can resolve this  Let me speak to Joe right now  Im sorry as I said hes away on vacation right now and away from any sort of phone service The only contact I have with him right now is email  Okay You need to send him an email right now  I can certainly do that for you however hes only able to check it every few days so well have to wait a couple of days for a response  Thats not good enough Someone needs to come in this is totally unacceptable  I understand your concern however there is no one in Joetown right now to come in I am the only person available and Im in Loudtown  Why didnt he get someone in Joetown to handle his calls  I dont know You would have to ask him that If I had to venture a guess it would be because Ive worked closely with Joe and I am familiar with his equipment and methods and he has full trust that I can handle any issue that might crop up  No Someone is going to come out or were cancelling our contract Were cancelling all of our contracts This guy owns and manages about half a dozen large hotels  If youd just let me  Someone better be here by  or Im cancelling my contractNow this takes place at  Its a  hour drive city limits to city limits on a good day Im still sitting around in sweats and the weather hasnt been great so the highways probably arent pristine Theres no way anyone is getting there by  unless they have a secret teleporter or a time machineTheres absolutely no way I am able to get there by  but I will come this evening  If someones not here blah blah blah hot air  Yes I understand Ill be there this eveningNow if this were one of my clients Id tell him to take all his hot air and blow it out his ass But hes not one of my clients and as understanding as Joe is he probably wont be pleased if he comes back and Ive lost him a half a dozen contracts within the weekSo I pack my gear up toss some spare parts in my car check the oil check the tires fuel up And hit the highwayIts pretty good for the first  miles or so then the highway turns to a skating rink for the remaining  I make it there by Theyve left no instruction with the front desk Theyve left no access to their offices I can get in the comms room so I go in and plug away a bit Everything looks okay I need into the office to figure out what the hells going onSome phone calls later and theyve revealed a hidden key to the front desk girl to get me in with explicit instructions Im not to be out of her sight while Im in thereA little offended because I know thats not SOP with Joe but okayWe head in and Im chatting away with front desk girl while working out loud to kind of fill the silenceI pick a computer This ones fineI pick another This one worksI pick another This one works tooI pick another no connectionI interrupt the conversation with the front desk girl A little unprofessional but I was annoyed as all get out Id relayed a large part of how I had come to be there by this point to a response of Yeah That sounds like ltbossgt Hes a jerkWhose desk is this  Thats Carlas Shes the owners assistant  Does Does Carla do the accounting  Yes Oh my godI pull the cable from the PC plug it into my laptop Lines dead Like dead dead I pick up the VoIP phone its plugged in to Still has a connection I replace the cable from the phone to the PC No connection So the PC port on the phone is screwy I spin the spinny chair Theres a spare port in the wallI measure cut and crimp a new patch cable I plug it into the empty port I plug it into the PC It worksI ask if they can comp me a room since Ive driven all this way Because the highways were bad coming out Because the highways will be worse going back Because its dark outThey wontI stop by a fast food joint and eat a quite meal by myself Did I mention this was my birthday It was my birthday I spent it alone eating a hamburger hours from homeI used to commute on the highway I would drive home when it was blizzarding so badly I couldnt see the hood of my car for  of the trip as long as theres a bit of clear view once in a while to realign your car with the road its okay On days when the highway was empty because no one else dared venture out Id still keep up mphI was doing below mph at points and never broke mph There was so much snow on the highway I couldnt distinguish road from ditch I resorted to simply eyeing some signs a ways ahead and aiming in between them hoping they were the signs on my side of the highway It was a nightmare of a driveThey wouldnt take the support provided and demanded a higher level than what was actually required by contract Joe doesnt eat the cost for their unreasonable demands and passes my bill onto the clientI generally dont bill time spent driving just mileage but reserve the right to I bill that timeI generally dont worry about billing callout fees or minimum callouts but its part of my standard agreement I bill bothBy the time the day is over Ive wasted over ten hours and theyve paid around  to have someone come and plug an ethernet cable in to connect their PC to the wallAll because they had to be melodramatic instead of giving me a proper description of the problem in the first placeBut hey thats the price of being demanding and lying to your IT supportI know this reads less as a tale and more as a rant Because thats what it is Hopefully its still enough in the spirit of the subtldr  I spent  hours on a skating rink that used to be a highway driving to and from another city

howardljones,42,178,1m2c4w,805,Working in an IT department can be a little bizarre  Heres something that happened about seven years agoOnce upon a time my department had their own office far removed from the rest of the company  It was a quirky little office with stairs that seemed to doubleback on themselves windows that gazed out onto brick walls and secret rooms tucked away to the sides  Anyway our supplier was a complete douchebag and would deliver all our Dell kit to random locations all over the country  sometimes to the user directly unimaged sometimes to the regional engineer or sometimes simply left outside the main gates of the office  Thousands of pounds of Dell kit sat on the streets begging to be taken  Our main admin lass  lets call her Babs  throws her toys out of her pram gives a good beating to the delivery company and then sends an email to everyone commanding that ALL deliveries must go to her and also to keep an eye out for rogue deliveries  Quickly after that the delivery company sorts its game out and thus dozens of boxes pour into the IT office as requestedOne morning the IT buildings overlyprotective superjanitor I used to call him Fireman Sam his fire drills were works of art  He would study the evacuation in action then give long boring speeches about who could have evacuated fasterbetter arrives at the office to find a dead cat in the middle of the road outside  He goes to the recycling bins and finds a complete laptop box scrapes the cat into it and leaves outside the gate for the council to pick up laterOne of our Service Desk guys  lets call him Timmy  rolls up to the automatic gates later that morning and while waiting for the gates to open spots a Dell laptop box sat on the roadside  Cursing the delivery company for leaving an expensive laptop on the road Timmy brings the box in with him noting that there must be a laptop in the box since it has some weight to it and takes it to the named person on the delivery sticker Babs  Its still quite early and Babs is not in yet so he leaves the box on her deskA couple of minutes later Babs enters the office  Apparently shes a bit confused as to why theres a laptop box on her desk as shes got no outstanding orders  Its also missing its delivery note so she rips open the box and peers inside  I was sitting just diagonally from Babs tapping an email and nursing a little bit of a hangover first I almost fouled myself as Babs let out an earsplitting bloodcurdling scream  Then I almost wet myself when the remains of a sad oneeyed cat flopped out onto her desk,Cat Box  Box Cat,983,TalesFromTechsupport
krashmo,192,178,1hsg0g,803,upolitesarcasticthing suggested I make a comment from this threadhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentshqyoosometimesihatebeingafemaleworkingintech into its own post I hope you guys enjoy it The first part is a copypaste of my commentAlright then First off let me say that I am one of two employees at my company We are a small ISP with about  customers Anything related to our network is my responsibility including tech supportFirst incidentWe have our main router set up to redirect users with an outstanding balance to a page that says pay your bill if you want your internet to work The boss doesnt tell us to turn people off until they are at least  months behind on their bill Anyway this girl calls in and I remember her from when I installed her service about  months ago She is complaining that her internet is shut off I look up her information and sure enough she hasnt paid her bill since we turned her service on At this point I would normally tell them to pay their bill and I will turn their service back on However she gives me a sob story about how she needs her internet turned back on to do her schoolwork it is the week before finals I guess I felt sorry for her since I was in the midst of finals madness myself so I told her I would turn her service back on but that it would be limited to  kbps Enough to pull up webpages for school but not enough to dick around on YouTube or NetFlix She starts to freak out on me like I did something wrong She says why would I want that This is just going to make me not pay my bill ever Im trying to explain to her that what I suggested is against company policy and is purely out of the goodness of my heart but she isnt having it You shouldnt have turned my service off in the first place She said some other stupid things that I dont really remember but eventually it got to the point that I told her that I was leaving her service off because she didnt seem to understand the concept of paying for services received and that if she wanted to use the internet she would have to go to the university library or a coffee shop At this point she asked to speak to my manager I told her to wait a second and I would put him on I yelled at my boss who was in his office that a woman who hadnt paid her bill was complaining about not having internet access Seeing as this was the first time I had been mouthy with a customer Im pretty sure he could hear everything I said to her I wasnt sure how my boss would respond My boss picked up the phone and without missing a beat said If you want internet access pay your fing bill Now stop harassing my employees Then he hung up on her It was the best outcome I could have hoped for I think she ended up canceling her service with us a week later Second incidentThe end of this incident occurred about a week ago and it still makes me mad to think about We have a customer that lives out in the country Hes got a few horses that run around his yard because he is too lazy to build a fence We are a WISP so our equipment is generally mounted on the roof with a CAT cable running inside somewhere Well this guy didnt want anything on his roof because he didnt trust me to seal the holes from the roofing screws properly Guy lives in a crappy little trailer house but whatever Ill make him happy I tell him that I will mount our equipment to a light pole about  feet from his house if he promises me that he will bury the cable after I leave I warned him that we have had problems in the past with cows and horses chewing on the cables He says No problem whatever I need to do to keep it off the roof Perfect I do my install and then I go on my merry way Around a month later I get a call from this guy that his internet isnt working so I head back to his place Once I get there I find that the cable was never buried and his horses have chewed the cable in half in three different places He tells me he thinks his friend ran the cable over I point out the teeth marks on the cable but for some reason he still doesnt believe that his horses did it A funny side note about this guy hes an electrician When I got there he was confused that his equipment wasnt powered on When I reminded him that the cable was cut in half he said I thought it was wireless I wanted to tell him that as an electrician he should know better than anyone that wireless power is not a thing yet but I held my tongue Anyway I ran a new cable for him reminded him of his promise to bury it and headed home for the day A few weeks later I get another call from him This time he tells me a trailer got pulled over the cable and broke it in half I begrudgingly go out to his place and run a new cable for him again This process wouldnt have been so bad if I didnt have to climb the light pole to get to our equipment and run the cable underneath his house to a hole in the floor Again I politely remind him that he needs to bury the cable or this will keep happening A few months later while I was on vacation my coworker had to go out to his house to replace the cable a third time This got me pretty pissed off I mean how hard is it to bury  feet of CAT cable By the time the fourth call comes around I am livid I go out to his house and have my coworker talk to him while I run yet another cable for him This one had been chewed by the horses again

jon,305,233,1l6o7g,796,This goes back a fair few years and Im wondering if I have retold this story before But anyway its worth mentioning againIts  and the powers that be appoint a stupidly expensive contractor and several people of particular insight and caliber  or as I read it utter numpties who dont know how to shut up  to investigate how we can be more environmentally friendly and cut waste and CO Apparently putting fancy jpgs to prove how much you care in your email signature just doesnt cut it anymoreThe Environazis set to work Nowhere went unpunished Our particular area had our normal two bins removed one for waste one for paper with  different bins together with emails about how they should be used These emails would later be followed up with scathing rants CCing every director imaginable due to some fool putting a crisp packet in the wrong bin Oddly my ingenious suggestion to label what you COULD put in these bins was seen as being clearly against their environmental agenda  paper and tape hurts bunnies apparently We did wonder if any of these bins could themselves actually be recycled but thought better than to question itOne of the big things was that the post room had a document scanner installed Well I say installed It was an older decommissioned bulk scanner but it still worked word around the water cooler was that it was decommissioned in the first place due to it being a stupid idea However the numpty squad decided that the office was to be  paperless A few postmaster officials were ordered to open business mail scan the pages and deliver the mail to the recipient via PDF Now you can only imagine the sheer hell that broke loose with this arrangement namely trying to match names to employees separating out directors and MDs mail for delivery various forms of turnaround documentation that would require returning the delay in actually getting your mail you name itHowever the crux came at the end of the mad season When the contractor had finished and collected his monstrous paycheck and the inhabitants of the numpty squad were satisfied wagging their fingers at anyone who dared throw something away the true effects of their unworkable strategies began to crumble one by one See the big machine that scanned all these documents used a page separator which was a slightly thinner smaller sheet of paper Now at the end of the run the postmasters would sift through the huge pile of documents to retrieve the separators Their boss being rather unimpressed with occasionally having to give time in lieu due to rather large runs decided that retrieval of page separators which cost less than half a penny was uneconomical and that they would be disposed of in the same way as the arriving mailHence in order to become paperless the company ended up doubling the amount of waste paper it produced Even better than that they solved the turnaround documentation issue by ordering people to simply reprint it from their delivered PDFs fill it in and mail it back The act of keeping turnaround documentation aside for delivery was again too complex and costly to implementUp until the date I left several weeks later the numpty squad was still nitpicking and sniping at every opportunity One particular member of the numpty squad called down to support on my last day Ironically complaining of a broken printer after resolving the issue at his desk I discovered that he had printed a list of repeat offenders intent on taking up matters with their managers He then decided that the text was too small and was now reprinting it on A so he could properly see it allFWIW this guy drove a companysupplied Land Rover As far as I know he didnt live anywhere near a farm Or a field Or anywhere even slightly hillyTLDR Company goes paperless doubles its paper usage instead,Environazism at its finest,1029,TalesFromTechsupport

TalesFromTechSupport,344,754,xyazr,786,A little early but another installment is here Enjoy Chapter  will be up on mondayA shout out to Atrocis for gifting me a month of reddit goldPrevious ChaptersChapter   My first job in IThttpredditxtlhx   The first few weeks at the store were rather dull Don mostly assigned me to work the register and help customers finding what they needed Restocking and cleaning the store was a task that befell me from the moment I started working there The shelves were high and stocked from the floor to the ceiling I had to kneel down low to fill the bottom shelves and reach high to fill to upper shelves While I felt uncomfortable knowing customers and especially Ron Don and  were watching I decided to ignore it I hoped the novelty would wear offThat was until Don called us all in for the monthly store meeting Everybody was there Don and Ron stood at the head of the table with me and Jeremy on the left side On the right side were Richard and Frank the store idiots How they got their jobs I still dont know How they lost them I knowDon had great news he said with a cheery voice and a big smile  like a fat man finding another french fry on the bottom of the McDonalds bag With Leila joining us me and Ron felt that we are a big enough team to change the store around a little My mind was only thinking Fuck at this moment Ron took over  We got ourselves a new house style for the store a brandspankingnew website and matching uniforms No old Tshirts anymoreRichard and Frank giggled like little girls knowing something that I did not Jeremy kept silent looking away from me almost as if he felt sorry for me Ron and Don took the new store billboard from the box The house style was done by Rons nephew who was one of those prodigy children that are good at everything they touch and revered by the entire family Unfortunately he took up web design so our website looked like it belonged on Geocities in the s but then again so did the store I should give him credit for staying so close to the sourceDon took the word again and opened up another box and pulled out the new uniforms Polo shirts with our logo stamped on them They looked reasonably fashionable It was better than the small shirt I had til now  maybe I could actually breathe in these My hope was short lived as I saw Ron and Don looking towards me Fuck was the only thing my brain could utter again They got a white bag from under the table looking at it my first guess was that it contained clothes It did My uniform was in thereWe ordered both male and female uniforms said Ron but they wont deliver the female ones until two weeks from now I looked at them and their faces told me everything  it was either a planned delay or the box was somewhere hidden in their offices So we got Frank and Richard to make sure that til the shirts come you will have some matching clothing I dont even know which of the two said it I expected the worst based on Frank and Richards giggles I got the worst My new uniform was the Hooters uniform with our logo ironed on it What creeped me out the most was the fact that the uniform fit perfectly They apparently knew my sizesFeeling like a teenage hooker I went back into the store selling hard and soft wares for the remainder of the shift to our usual mix of customers Most of them middle aged men that needed large hard disks to store their video projectsMost of them were regulars that bought all their computer hardware and software from us including the Bgrade burning software and virus scanners They were always happy with it It was so easy to use and really did not slow down the PC However none of them ever bought any of the video editing software we had on shelf from the same companyThey spend hours on end scouring the internet for movies and pictures of their favorite adult actresses They did not seem to stop until they knew they caught them all To have the very best They however also caught viruses and malware that their Bgrade virus scanners failed to detect warranting a trip back to our store to fix the problem  leaving their pictures videos and browser sessions on the PCs I learned my sexed from their computersJeremy understood my shame in walking around like a teenage hooker for at least two weeks and covered my storeshift so I could work in the back whenever he could Me and Jeremy usually worked the Thursday and Friday evening shifts from pm to pm and Saturdays from am to pm  Don was usually not around during the evenings so it worked out fine except when he made a surprise visit to check up on us and sent me back to the store to help our customers with their needs  I was working my second shift dressed like a teenage hooker and was cleaning up the store that have been left like it had been ransacked by an angry mob Ron told it was a busy day and they had no time to clean it all up I had to clean up the store Great I checked the register first and looked at the sales we made Seven sales all small items It had been a slow day Why the store was such a mess I dont know and could not check the camera system for we had none It would not be for another year that Ron became paranoid and we got a stateoftheart extremely expensive security system Like the UPS I would find out later what it was forTo get back to the story I was cleaning up the store and still dressed like a teenage hooker when a regular customer walked in I was bent over one of the tables causing him to ogle and stammer out that he needed a hard disk Obviously I helped him get a hard disk and went to the register and he paid Before he left he had a question  If I want to put this one in do I have to take out the  other big drives I lost it I cannot even begin to understand how he even came up with it but I knew what it meant Looking at him I saw he was proud of himself for saying it as if he practiced for weeks He then saw that I took offense and quickly wiped the smug expression from his face and mumbled Nevermind Ill find out myself while walking away I hoped Id never see him again however he was nothing compared to the next one a few days laterIt was about  hours into my new shift when a new customer walked in He looked at me sizing me up and smiled I braced myself and walked over How can I help you today I said keeping my distance He kept silent for a bit and then told me that his computer had crashed and he needed it restored Sure no problem  we offer recovery services Wheres the computer I asked Its in my car he said Can you help me get it out girl The way he said it alarmed me enough to not do it You get the PC out of the car and Ill get out gear out of the back so we can see what is going on I said and immediately walked away to the back getting Jeremy to help me out with this oneThe customer returned and brought in an ancient PC it looked ravished and dirty as if he just picked it up from the street and walked over to us to get it fixed Jeremy hooked up the PC and tried to boot it It booted but had trouble in loading the Windows environment  always hanging in booting process and none of the safe boot options helped We quoted him for data recovery and reinstallation of the OS and applications The total was about  dollars or so Jeremy walked to the back to print out one of the forms our customers had to fill in to waive any liability for when we were not able to recover the dataWith Jeremy in the back he stepped closer to me and took a  dollar bill out of his pocket and took a pen out of his other He wrote down something and folded the bill twice making sure I saw the  on it He leaned forward and whispered into my ear verbatim A girl like you should not work in such a store He put the  dollar bill between my breasts I was completely shocked and frozen at this moment He paused briefly and continued  My number is on that bill if you want work that suits your qualities more give me a call Jeremy came back from the back with the waiver and the customer quickly walked away from me turning his attention to Jeremy He signed and put down an upfront payment of  dollars or so I cant remember It took only seconds for all of this to happen He turned around winked at me and walked out Jeremy now sensed something was wrong with me and asked me what was wrong I told him everything He calmed me down and called one of my friends to pick me up covering the rest of the shift alone He worked on the computer that night and got it working When I got in the next day my company polo had suddenly arrived Jeremy probably told Ron or Don and they knew they could not withhold the polo any longer When Jeremy saw me he walked over and asked me if I wanted to know something about that customer I said yes He told me he was the owner of an adult webcam site He had tried to hire me as a performer TLDR we got a new store uniform Sexual harassment ensues Challenge Find the new Pokemon referenceQuestion Im looking to improve

session Her screen was filled with the web browser and she was playing some game on Facebook He grabbed her cursor and minimized the mess telling her at the same instant I have control  In his mind he added maam but he didnt say it aloudShe tried to open Facebook again and he said Ive got it now just hold tight as he pulled up her browser and typed in the address of the printer As the printer control came up in the browser he saw a red flashing error on the status indicator Do you see the error he circled the red area with the cursor and she said no right here on your screen the red error that is flashing Again she said No and continued saying Im not at my desk nowCould you please go back to the deskIn a minute Im busyOK When you get back to your desk let me knowArent you going to fix it Why do you need me Cant you just fix it  She croaked God her voice was like a rusty dental drill This remote stuff never works you waste my timeJust let me know when you are back at your deskHe spent a few seconds running down the hit list on a Mobsters game on line Killing and stealing as much as he could till his stamina was depleted Okay What What am I looking forDo you see the error He circled the red area with the cursor and she said no right here on your screen the red error that is flashing Again she said NoDo you see the cursor movingOn the printer There is nothing moving on the

interrupted My thing is moving You are moving my thingYes Yes I am moving your thing Now He hurried Do you see the red flashing thing there where your thing is movingShe stumbled The red error boxYes there right there please watch the screen and he clicked the red error box and it opened a pop up box that said TONER EMPTY  Can you read that part where it says that the toner is emptyThis printer was working last night Now my printer does not work what did you do to itHe held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall and imagined for a moment the certain cool peace of the inevitable void then continued The printer is out of toner it is empty of the black stuff that goes on the paper and makes lettersI am not doing a letter I am doing mailing labels and I just dont understand why it is that every time you work on my system I have another problemThere are people in this world some in positions of power that are so dense and brain dead that he wondered how they managed to breath and not suffocate and whyPlease listen to me for one second and lets work together to resolve this issue He used every bit of his mind not to sound like the most sarcastic fellow ever to grace the earth I am on your side I am here to help and I need your help to help me help you solve the problem OK He continued without pause Do you have a new toner cartridgeYes she said I have plenty of tonerGreat I knew you could come through with a solution now please get the toner and change out the new cartridge for the old one Ill holdShe finally agreed and the remote experiment in dentistry neared closureAs he held and listened to her fumble and grumble another line rang He checked the caller ID and answered quickly Hey man whats up At least this guy wasnt a complete toolLook man we have a crisis I knocked my computer off my desk and it was fine but I rebooted and not it doesnt work Oh my precious goodness he thought and anyway it has this document on

did great were almost doneThe phone rang again it was another  number he let it go and continued Just hit the clear error button on the top of the printerI am not at my printer I am at my desk she hissed Can you make up your mindYes Yes Yes Im sorry go back to your printer and clear the error and come back to your desk and talk to me Wow this woman was starting the day nicelyAgain the phone rang unknown number no time to answer unknown calls He let it go to voice mailShe came back to the phone OK your error light is off Good he said Notice on the remote panel on your screen it says Printer ReadyYes I see that Her exasperation dripped from every word and she started moving the cursor but he grabbed it backWait just one second and let me check the process and make sure we are not chasing our tails OK he said still smiling a fake smile that probably sounded like fake helpfulness over the phone then he printed a test page to the printerOK did anything printIts making a noise but it is not printingHe could pat her on her precious little head now Good We like noise That means the printer is warming up just give it a secondShe growled If I dont get these labels printed I guess Ill have to hand write themIs anything printing he askedSomething is coming out I dont know what it isIn his mind he imagined her biting off her own smoke stained tongue choking on it gasping for air and turning blue but he said Could you check for meHe heard her huff and bang her way to the printer She had the most blank grey eyes that seemed to reflect her thought patterns He tried to think of a happy place to calm his the phone rang again another  number Another call he wouldnt answer It is still not printing all I have is a page that says Windows Test Page what did you do with my labels  OK great Well print your labels now He looked at her recently used documents and pulled up the first in the list It was a label sheet but there were only  labels out of  that should have been populated so he asked her are these the right ones Is this the right documentShe rattled Yes thats the one that you broke now they wont printOh I can print them I just wondered if it was complete since there are only  addresses She broke in Yes and those are our most important donors and board members Ive worked for weeks to put this mailing list together and now you cant print itJust hold on one second and well see what we have now He clicked print and asked her Are your labels printing nowSomething is printing I dont know what it is I guess you want me to go look again She was an amazingly fast learner for a blithering brain damaged idiot She picked up again OK my labels printedWonderful he said Just give me a call if you have another problemI still dont understand how you broke it last night Her voice was like fingernails on a chalkboardHe held again an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall The printer was out of toner it is working now Talk to you

IThttpredditxtlhxChapter   Store uniformshttpredditxyazrChapter   Spring CleaninghttpredditygzChapter   Questionable OffershttpredditybkrChapter   Summer school Pt httpreddityjaj  I was still working for Ron replacing all the computers in the school and the execution of my revenge plan on the two boys was still a few weeks away By now most classrooms had been installed and I was given a huge stack of DVDs to image all the computersA very boring job but at least he gave me more than one disk so I could image at least one or two classrooms at a time I used the downtime to snoop around in the classrooms What else would you expect from a  year old girlThere wasnt much to find to be honest  just some random strange stuff in drawers the answers for a lot of old exams and chewed up chewing gum a lot of it and not just on the desks Then there was a diary It belonged to a girl from my class that I had not particularly hated or liked But some high quality intel on this girl would not hurt I opened it up and read through it focused on deciphering her sloppy handwritingI was startled when somebody walked into the room It was a school concierge School was to start in  weeks again and needed to be cleaned The concierge lets call him Fred was a moron Not just a regular moron he was designed to be a moron He always did things wrong and said the most inappropriate things And now he stood in front of me I put down the diary there was nothing interesting in it anywayLeila was it Ron told me I should look for you saying you could help me he said Help with what I replied a bit dazed My computer is broken and I need to order new cleaning supplies he said with with urgency in his voiceI had no choice other than to walk down with him to his office I then realized why this building was in such a bad state He was like Ron breathing hard and irregular when we went down the stairs Once at his office he launched himself in his chair and took a sip of his Diet Coke I looked at him disapprovingly He responded by chugging the entire can down Apparently being civil wasnt motivating him to just let the Coke can standHe pointed at his computer the oldest one we had in the school a Windows  machine with an ancient monitor attached He opened Internet Explorer and tried to browse to the website to order his cleaning supplies The site refused to load and an error popped up It was just an error number Great just as well might not display anything I decided to open his history folder It was packed full going back years Did you ever clean the PC I asked He answered proudly I dust it off everyday if thats what you mean Good God He was right though the computer looked like newYou also have to clean the PC every once in a while of files that are not necessary anymore  like cleaning up your desk from old documents and cans of Coke His world had changed You can do that I showed him how to clean up the files and empty the trash and wrote down the instructions so he would not forget The error was resolved and he could get his cleaning supplies now I am still amazed at how easy he was in all this He showed the problem let me do my work followed my instructions and thanked me At times like this I just wish everybody was a moron  I was now on the first floor again just walking around a bit delaying going upstairs I wanted to do something other than putting a DVD into a computer and slowly watching the computer being imaged with a new installation I walked around a bit on the ground floor taking in the emptiness of the school I stopped and saw the cellar door Nobody was allowed there and it was always locked But I had the key now I could go inI did go inThe cellar was poorly lit Many of the lights had died long ago I picked up a torch light that was in a bin next to the stairs Fred did not come down here often enough to actually fix them so putting a torch light down the stairs was his way of fixing the problemThe cellar was huge It spanned the length and width of the ground floor Next to me were heaps and heaps of paper storage old exams and files I took out a few boxes They went back at least  years from what I could see Nobody even cared to throw them awayI walked further down to the left making sure not to break my legs over any stray boxes and pieces of paper There were a lot of bicycles chairs and sporting equipment I could not walk down anymore without the fear of being crushed by the contents I walked back and tried the right side next I quickly stumbled upon a lot of computers  really old ones There were early s and s computers covered in layers of dust as old as the machines themselvesI noticed something again These computers formed a wall I knew there was more space behind it because when the torch light hit the ceiling it kept on going for quite a bit There was something behind this great wall of computers and I needed to find out I scanned the computers and saw there was one pile that was on wheels I pulled it out I needed to make a note to go to the hospital to get checked out because my jaw dropped againIt was a secret hideout There were couches a table notebooks a refrigerator and boxes full of food and drinks The floor wasnt concrete It was a lot of carpets all covering each other What was this placeI looked around and started one of the notebooks I could not go past the login screen but it did not matter Werner was his name And I knew who he was I shut down the notebook again and walked around watching for other things I saw a safety exit It was badly damaged likely from being forced I pushed the handle and it opened I was outside The door slowly closed behind me I tried to open it again It opened Safety doors are not supposed to do that They had broken it and used it as an entrance to their hangout caveI looked around a little more I was behind the school now in the forested area You could come here easily but there was really no point to it so nobody ever went here I spent the rest of my days imaging the PCs and wondering what the cave was for  When school started again I went up to Werner asking him about the cave He went silent Whether it was the fact that an actual  girl was talking to him or that I was talking about the underground hideout I dont know He struggled to say something to me and finally blurted you are not going to tell anyone right You cannot tell anyone I assured him I would not  so long as he would tell me what it was all about He told me go to the forested area and wait there for him after school ended at four I had to wait another  hours Screw meI silently sneaked into the forested area and waited for Werner I realized this was all stupid and turned to leave when Werner came up sweaty and nervous He led me to the door and opened it The light fell on about a dozen nerds They were scared that they had been found out They took a closer look at me and recognized me You work at that dump they call a computer store right Is that the best you can say to a woman entering your nerd cave I asked rather viciously I wasnt angry at them for calling it a dump because honestly it was But the fact that I was associated with it just hit me wrong Werner quickly jumped in not taking minutes to say something for a change and told them I had found our hideout over the summer and he was forced by me to show what it was all aboutThey calmed down and reluctantly introduced themselves They were of all ages and types of nerd This gaming cave as they called it had been set up years ago and passed down from generation to generation of misfit gamers After school they would come here to work on their homework play with the electronics and most of all play video gamesI liked that and joined them for the afternoon I was surrounded by geeks and loved it We had so much to talk about After an awkward first hour they relaxed and at the end of the day they regarded me as a member I was in the first female member of the game cave,Chapter

Singularly Stupid Decisions    When it rains it pours I grumbled sipping at a dripbrewed cup of Dark Magic and practically purring at the strength and tasteGiven the lack of concentrated caffeine in Keurigbrewed coffee Id prised open ten Kcups of Dark Magic to fill a doublefilter of coffee which I then brewed up The weather in Austin had started to get cool again after a weekend that was an alltoounpleasant reminder of the ballscorcher that was summer and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets On top of everything my secondnewest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty so it fell to me to get things done in his steadNever send a PFY to do a network admins job I continued sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet as is my wont and my cell phone burst into Rick Astleys dulcet tones signifying an incoming call I arched an eyebrow  I hadnt expected the campus tech to call me not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on A quick flick of the screen later and my Ones speakers blasted his voice out into the officeHey Jack weve got a problem here he said frustration evident in his voiceIs it NEWPFY I took a sip Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXASCOLLEGE in my contact listI could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it No he didnt do anything He knows better Ive got something new for youHe detailed the situation leaving nothing out  apparently a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to offcampus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant and in his brilliance when he ran into the restaurant he left his tablet and phone on the front seat and the car unlockedThe imbecile also left his keys in the cupholderYou can guess where this is goingTen minutes later when he came out with his order his gadgets were gone and so was his nice new carHe got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did and the administration was in an uproar I shrugged A car stolen Whoopdyshit thats why we have insurance itd be covered The tablet Not so much A police report had already been filed and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them and if it was at all possible to try to save the carIts the principle of the thing I thought to myself as I plugged the kids credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode A few clicks later the police report number was registered with Computrace and the tablet flagged as stolen Such useful tools but only in the right hands I smirked Of course it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misusedAbout twenty minutes later the device stopped moving ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic I took a look at the final location Something seemed off about it I grabbed the nearest crossstreets and plugged it into Google Maps then switched to Satellite View My eyebrows went up at what I saw and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys I drained my coffee then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door I had a drive to make    A SHORT WHILE LATER     I walked into the school phone and bag of fast food  from a rather popular nearby restaurant in hand and strolled into the campus techs officeWhatre you doing here he asked Didnt you track the phone and tabletI nodded and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone followed by the bag of food His eyes widenedYouve got to be jokingI shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before not entirely coincidentally taken outside a rather popular nearby restaurant and he started chucklingI pity him I could sense the laughter rising in him and he stood up and locked his machine The kids in the office he said and walked out of his office with me following I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY who was sitting in the corner stripping down machines for parts in his free periodSure enough the kid was in the office and his father was there too as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in handDid you find my phone the kid said jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech franticallyForget the phone his father said Wheres the carIm honestly surprised he doesnt know I replied Given what he did he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet  and yes his car too  wentWhat are you talking about the dad said his expression blanker than a new chalkboardDoes this look familiar I said turning my phone around to face the teenager and the fatherI went to lunch there today thats where my car got stolen the kid retorted So whatDoes THIS look familiar I repeated flipping to the next picture in the sequence the one Id shown the tech                            TOWING ENFORCED    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATORS EXPENSEHis reply much like his actions which kicked this off was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense I only parked there for like ten minutesAnd thats all they needed to take the car I replied flipping over to the phones last location in Google Maps which when looked at via satellite view was the towing companys storage lot As of ten minutes ago your phone was there and I daresay youll find the tablet and keys there tooHis father glared at himThe cop glared at himHe glared at meI breathed on

VolatileCurry,148,177,1l3028,777,I work at a small computer repair shop and I get quite a few customers who are a bit over the top This one in particular was a different kind of special though She had a terrible attitude and was incredibly obnoxious Bear with me because this one is a bit on the long side Its mostly dialogue thoughA middleaged woman walks up to the counterCustomer Do you fix computersImmediate red flag She walked in through a door that says COMPUTER REPAIR on it Me We sure do Customer How much does it cost Me  Well that depends on what you need done Whats wrong with it Customer I dont know it doesnt work Me Okay So when you say it doesnt work What exactly is it doing Customer I dont know Me Does it turn on Customer Yes Me Okay So is it really slow Does it boot to Windows Customer I dont know that youre supposed to tell me Thats why Im here Me sigh Okay well do you have the computer with you Customer No its in the car Me Okay Can you bring it in so I can look at it Customer Ugh I guess soShe said that with a grunt as if she was expecting me to go out to her car and get it for her or something I already knew this was going to be a nightmare She goes out to the car and comes back with an older Toshiba laptop and sets it down on the counter I turn the computer on and boots to the Windows log in screen relatively quickly Theres a password on it so I ask her to sign in She gave me a nasty look and then typed it in and logged onIt took forever to actually sign in As soon as the desktop appeared it was bombarded by fake antivirus registry cleaners and the nefarious x Help virus I told her the computer was heavily infected and explained our costs and process for virus removals She agreed to have it checked in I started taking down her info Remember this part because its important Me Okay now Im going to need the password for the computer Customer Why do you need that Me So I can log into Windows Ill need to do that throughout the repair Customer Well its personal Me Okay Well if you want the computer fixed Im going to need it Customer I dont care Im not giving it to you I dont give my password to anyoneI should have just told her I couldnt help her and sent her on her way But alas I did not Me Okay well if you wont give it to me Ill just remove it Customer How are you going to do thatI wasnt about to explain to her the process of removing a Windows password  Me big smile We have our ways Customer Whatever Go ahead Me Alrighty well youre all set then Given the amount of work that needs to be done the process can take a day or two to finish Well give you a call when its ready Customer What I thought you could just do it and I could wait here for it Me No Theres a lot of work to be done here First theres diagnostic tests which take a few hours to finish Then theres the virus scanners Im going to run and then I have to do some manual work to clean up the rest of the stuff Theres no way I could get it done before closing time todayShe wasnt happy about this but I finally got her to leave and went about my business I set her computer to run hardware diags so I could verify that there wasnt a bad HDD or something silly like that going on before I start the virus removal work Then the phone rang Me Thanks for calling ltstore namegt how can I help you Customer I want to know if my computer is ready Me Okay whats your name Customer ltgives me her namegt Me Okay I only just started that one a little while ago I quoted you a day or two right Customer Yeah but I thought you might get it done quicker Me  Well no I didnt But when I do finish it I will call you to tell youShe hangs up and the day goes on Then the phone rings again And its her again Customer Youre not gonna delete my stuff are you Me No I dont think thats going to be necessary  Customer So when I get it back its going to be exactly the way it was when I brought it in Me Yup Well Minus the viruses of courseShe hangs up All her hardware passed diagnostics a few minutes before the store closed so I set it to run a series of antivirus scanners over night and went home I opened the following morning and the phone was already ringing when I walked in the door I dont answer phone calls before the store opens so I ignored them while I did my opening duties The phone rang a few different times in the first hour that I was there and I finally answered it after unlocking the door Me Thanks for calling ltstore namegt how can I help youGuess who it is Customer IVE CALLED SEVEN TIMES AND NOBODY ANSWERED THE PHONE I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER Me Im sorry mam but we literally just opened the store Thats why nobody answered the phone The answering machine tells you our store hours Customer I dont care I know you get there before AM and I KNOW you ignored the phone Now give me your manager I want to give him a piece of my mind Me My manager isnt here mam its just me right now I apologize for the inconvenience but there is a lot to do before the store can open and we dont start taking calls before store hours My manager would tell you the same thingShe continued to argue with me about it and I tried to be as apologetic as possible even though I didnt feel bad in the slightest bit I got fed up with it after a couple of minutes and just asked her what she wanted Customer I need to know if my computer is finishedI was starting to get really annoyed with her and I cut back my nice guy attitude and laid into her a bit Me No of course its not I told you yesterday it would take at least a day I left it to do some automated tasks over night but the bulk of the manual repair work still needs to be done and its going to take several hours to complete and I havent even gotten a chance to look at it yet this morning because Ive been talking to you on the phone since the store opened Now theres no reason to keep calling us because I will call you as soon as the computer is ready If you call me again before I call you Im going to tell you the exact same thingShe was really quiet for a few seconds before she spoke up Customer Well how long is it going to take Me Several hours at least It might even take until tomorrow Ill call you when its ready Customer What time do you think tomorrow Me I dont know Ill call you when its readyShe finally hung up Frustrated as hell I sat down and started working on her computer before even looking at repairs that had been there longer than hers I manually removed the x Help Virus and all of the fake antivirus and registry cleaners etc Booted to Windows and immediately got a BSOD related to a program I removed that was still trying to start at boot So I went back to my boot disc and fixed the issue After messing with it for a while I got it into Windows and it appeared to function normally I rebooted it several times and ran some other scanners to verify that everything was gone I did all this in between working on other computers phones and dealing with customers up frontI managed to finish the computer in the midafternoon and I called her to come get it She saw a different employee at the front counter when she came in and she asked to speak to me personally I told the employee to tell her I was on break or something and I couldnt help her She eventually leftLater in the day it was the end of my shift and I was about to clockout and walk out the door The phone started ringing and the other employee was dealing with a customer and asked me to answer it Youll never guess who it was Me Thanks for calling ltstore namegt how can I help you Customer I picked up my computer from you a little while ago and now its stuckI immediately recognized the voice and took a deep breath I remembered the BSOD I got at boot earlier that day and I was dreading the thought that it was the same thing and I somehow didnt fix it even though I was sure I did Me What do you mean by Its stuck Customer I dont know I turn it on and its just stuck and you need to fix it Me Do you see a blue screen with text on it Customer Yes Me Great Have you tried rebooting the computer Customer Yeah and it just does the same thing Theres a flag on the screenI was about to tell her to bring it back in but then I caught that she said there was a flag Me Wait A flag What do you mean Customer Its like red and blue and yellow and green Me You mean like The Windows logo Customer Yeah I guess Me Okay And is it in the center of the screen Customer Yes Me Do you see your mouse pointer Customer Yes Me Can you move it around Customer Uhh YeahSuddenly theres a spark of hope  Me Can you see your desktop icons  Customer Whats that Me Theyre like The icons on the desktop You know When you logged in yesterday there were a bunch of desktop icons One should say Internet Explorer Customer Yeah I see that one Me Okay can you double click it Customer Okay Me What happened Customer MSN came upI was shocked Never before have I encountered a customer that didnt recognize her own desktop or know the meaning of the word stuck Me  Okay then your computer isnt stuck It sounds like it turned on normally Customer It did NOT turn on normally Im used to seeing my picture and I have to type my password to get in Me Well Its not asking you for your password because I had to remove it Customer WHAT I thought you said I wouldnt lose any of my stuff What else did

I got rid of the viruses and got the computer working again without losing any data I had to remove your password because you refused to give it to me yesterday and I warned you that I was going to do it and you told me to go ahead Theres nothing wrong with your computer Have a nice dayI then hung up the phone and left The next morning my boss told me I got a customer complaint after I left Ive never had a complaint before but I wasnt really surprised because I knew what it was about And luckily my manager is a really cool and understanding guy  Me Was it ltinsert customer namegt Boss Howd

Now Read On  Now it was during my time slinging bits and bytes for the Feds and in particular the tax collection parts thereof that the result of the national leader of the days weaseling on the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax came to a head Most famously he had declared some years back that it would never ever be a part of his partys policy after it had pretty much been the single cause of their defeat in a previous election Of course as it was one of his longterm pet policies this was so much smoke and mirrors Coming to power later on he squeaked into a second term in office technically actually losing the popular vote and immediately declared that this was obviously a mandate to implement said pet tax even though he couldnt get it supported without going to other parties Thus political shenanigans and power plays went on behind closed doors so he could force it into existence  So far so national politics  Now if you read the official histories the tax was implemented halfway through the year  presumably after all the gladhanding and subtle machinations However my tale comes somewhat earlier in the calendar as in a good year or two beforehand      You see I had shown up at work one day suspecting nothing out of the ordinary and been asked if I would mind assisting with the installation of a new server Nothing fancy just babysitting the hardware running a couple of tests and generally being eyes and hands on the ground for the central server team Nothing strange about that right  Only the server was being installed in a building my employer had never operated out of before And indeed there was much in the way of outfitting and cubicle erecting and furniture schlepping going on I noticed as I wandered into the new site Funny as I hadnt heard of any new infrastructure expansion at least through official channels  A quick glance through the specialist chapters of the installation procedures plus a little knowledge of government acronyms soon lifted the veil from my eyes I was installing the central server for the never ever couldnt possibly have had all the details worked out yet no siree Goods and Services Tax team The election was barely over the money and most importantly details I was looking at couldnt possibly have been arranged in the time between then and now Someone had been planning this for quite some time  There were a number of other discrepancies as well The team wasnt referred to by any official name other than that on the front of the building Much of the documentation was shall we say whitewashed of any identifying nomenclature There was even publicinformation frontage built on the ground floor of the building at the same time unconnected to the hidden team in the back offices so that noone would express any surprise upon hearing that the Tax department was operating out of that address or raise an eyebrow at the furniture and office kibble being trucked in In short it was deliberately designed so that the general public wouldnt get wind of the fact that the GST team was up and running far far before it was ever supposed to exist even on paper      Our intradepartmental procedures and processes were quietly expanded to include the new server on our list of supported items but it was always just server  its purpose never alluded to in any documentation which might even remotely

setthuzzolo,118,123,1i5ghq,756,This story takes place ohsomany years ago I was in the last year of high school and dynamic websites were fairly new My computer science professor knew I was looking for a job and told me that a friend of his was looking for a student to work for himI meet up with the professors friend who tells me the company promised a website to a major ambulance building company but he didnt have anybody with any experience in building a dynamic site from scratch he only had a designer that created the mockup He asked me if I could create something like that and I told him that although I knew HTML I never built anything like that but I was willing to learn and do the job He said the website was already late and the company only gave them six weeks to deliver the finished product or theyd take their deposit back plus a penalty I said bring itThe deal we made was that Id come to the office every day for a week and if Id show him I could get the job done hed hire me Sound fair So I came to work for the next ten days and studied everything I could about dynamic websites how to prepare an NT server he didnt have any linux machines to run them and how to use databases through Perl thats how he wanted it After the ten days were over I had the first draft of the website up and running I showed the boss and asked if hed hire me He said that was impressive but the end product wasnt like the designer illustrated I tried to explain first draft to him but still said hed want to see the finished project first OkFast forward another week or so the websites finally done way ahead of schedule Sure the source code wasnt pretty but the website looked and worked as requested there was a database with all the products the customer could choose the base vehicle add every piece of instrumentation get a quotation for the finished ambulance and place the order online I also created a CMS didnt even know it was called that at the time so that the customer could update his database online Doesnt seem like much now but it was  and I was a damn proud yo So I show this to the boss His answer was ah good good now just add the price conversion in euros and fix this border to which I reply ok how about that contract we were talking about  Ah no I cant You see you dont even have a high school diploma and no experience in the field so I cant hire you But when the websites done Ill pay you and we can keep working like that Ill pay you for every project you finish  Ok so this ones finished I can fix those two things in  minutes tops So  Yeah finish those and then Ill pay youI didnt Every day I kept coming back to the office and asked for my payment every day he kept saying hed pay me later everyday I capped his bandwidth I had an ISDN line at home this was a T it was AWESOME and every day I went back home Id have to take the train both ways and of course buy lunch All this time I did nothing but nag the boss about my dues and talk to the other employees Excluding the boss six people worked there the designer the incompetent hottie at the phone and four high school students that would be paid eventually These guys were working just as hard as me one of them was preparing a linux box that would become the mail server another one was working on some projects on Auto CAD cant really remember what the other one did Once when talking to the girl she let it slip that we werent the only highschoolers that worked there but many stopped showing up after not being paid long enough She also let it slip that the website I was working on was being paid as much as a supercarAnd so I downloaded stuff from kazaa and bugged my boss until the customer came back asking a progress report The boss brought them in the employee area saw me smiling really wide and was smart enough to ask the designer to tell them how the website was coming along He hadnt seen anything about the website ever since he drew the mockup and only heard hearsay so his progress report was something on the line of yeah we only need to add the euro conversion and fix a border and its gonna look exactly like the pictures you already saw They werent pleasedLater that day the boss called me in his office to talk  So hows the website  All nice and ready I just have to copy it to the server  So ehm Youve been coming here every day right  Yup Its been almost a month now I have to take the train every day  And how much does it cost you  I pay X each way  So X a day five days a week here you go X So can you copy the site on the server  That was the day the bastard learned that you have nothing in writing goes both ways I took the money went back to my computer erased the whole thing and walked out the door none the richer but all the wiser The best part was hearing my professor scold me in class he failed his deadline had nothing at all to show for it had to pay back the deposit and a penalty for half of the cost of the entire project He had to file for bankrupcy  I explained exactly how things went down and had another student that worked there confirm what I said  Ok he was a jerk and deserved it but goddamit you could have warned me Id have avoided his phone callsTLDR karmas a bitch,You have nothing in writing goes both ways,879,TalesFromTechsupport

jackschitt,272,221,xe11s,760,My day starts with a phone call  Hey Jack can you open up site for some maintenance workers on your way into the office  ThanksThis was almost immediately followed by a phone call from someone who needs a keyboard replacement after spilling a large iced coffee on it  This was right near site so this wasnt a major issueThen I get a phone call from a regional office she cant get online and wants me to stop in and see whats wrong  This was right near site and I was beginning to like the fact that everything was happening so close to each other  Also the lady lodging the complaint about not being able to get online has virtually no need to get online in the first place outside of checking emails a couple of times a day  She wasnt distressed or anything so I decided to put her a lower priority and handle the first two issues first   minutes pass and she calls me up screaming at the top of her lungs  I CANT PRINT A DAMN THING AND I NEEDED THIS STUFF PRINTED  MINUTES AGO  WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOUThere are a number of things that need to be printed before she can start her week so that the right people can sign what needs to be signed  Had I known that she was having a printer issue Id have put her at a much higher priority even if it meant going out of my way to backtrack to sites  and   Jill you didnt tell me that  You told me that you couldnt get online  Those are two totally separate issues  Had I known that your printer was down Id have gone to you firstWell you should have known  apparently I woke up in bizarro land this morning where being unable to print and being unable to get online are the exact same thingSo I get over there and  as Im sure youd expect  the problem was that she didnt hit the gigantic power button on the front of her printer   Right in the middle of rolling my eyes she says Now I cant get into my fucking email  Fix thisHow many times have you tried I askedIve been trying for the past  minutes  TIL in bizarro world  seconds   minutesIf you tried and failed more than  times youre locked out  Youre going to have to call corporate to have them unlock it and reset your passwordShe says I dont have time for this shit  Cant you do itJill they wont even talk to me about your account at all  You know thatI need that email NOW  Cant you just hack it or somethingampamp Yeah sure  Let me get right on that  Ignoring the fact that I neither have the skills information or resources to do that on the fly Im just going to spend god knows how much time hacking into the email server just so you dont have to make a  minute phone call  Im sure my wife would also love the explanation of why I just got fired too  I hate mondays,Not a good way to start the week,981,TalesFromTechsupport

Celestium,250,224,1klb7n,756,I work as a tech for an office supply company their name rhymes with taples Today was the first day I felt like I had a story to share with the subreddit I come in as the closing tech  am to close around  PM I enter the store to find that not only is the normal on site guy gone hereafter named guy  but so is the guy who is supposed to cover the floor guy  On top of that I have now have to do the onsite that guy  is not here to do I know exactly what needs to be done as it was a return visit for an onsite I did earlier in the week On top of that we have roughly  PCs in all of which need to be repaired half of which are already late Oh boy I start running HDD diagnostics on four of the PCs that were BSODing on start upprograms openinggenerally running slow I take six that were in for virus removals and start running scans so they can just go while Im gone and head to my onsite First to grasp the whole situation I need to give a little backstory Im now in charge of a massive backlog of PCs roughly half of the entire store in size closer to  in terms of sales This onsite that I need to make a return for is rather simple need to reinstall printer drivers as the tech didnt install them when we had the PC in the store and I had no internet at the house because of downed lines However the guy also brought in another laptop for a virus removal that Ill be bringing with me out to him He also happened to purchase Kaspersky and wanted that installed He had about  kbps at his house and it would take far too long to install it there No worries though I happen to have installers for most consumer AVs on the market so I take my flash drive full of tools and programs as well as another that only has the Kasp installerPrinter drivers to make it easy I head out there and the guy is pretty laid back so I know I can just leave the installers running after I set the printer up and come back to check on them later I run that by him and hes ok with it so I go to work Another preface the laptop he brought in was incredibly infected so before I ran a removal I happened to image the drivewhich Im not allowed to do before I set to it this is important for later I get the printer up in about five minutes and leave the installers to go while I head back to the store Before I do so I tell him that one of the flash drives is my personal work drive and has a lot of programs that can damage the PC In particular I told him not to open DoNotOpenbat located in the folder DONOTOPEN What this file does it sort of like the half assed way to reformat a PC without actually reformatting It nukes all user files reverts back to the default libraries nukes just about everything in the registry then opens another script called DoNotOpenbat that merges a freshclean registry with the old one programming student wanted the practice I get everything running then head out I get back to the store to deal with all the angry customers with late PCsall the sellingdeal with two PCs in particular that nobody else could fix The first PC was a vista machine that had a fucked partition table It was a single  gb drive partitioned into two  gb drives then RAIDed together I assume that it was done to work around Vista pre SP but I dont know as it was before my time However the thing was upgraded to the newest SP then someone stitched the two partitions together but left the RAID controller on On top of that the HDD was starting to fail and was giving me errors everywhere In short fucked Windows wouldnt boot properly so I booted to an ubuntu flash drive imaged the disk formatted the drive the reinstalled on top of that PC works drive going out informed the customer and he said hed just run with it Step one done Step two SOPHOS AKA the Devils AntiVirus was blocking this poor mans bejeweled from running After adding the exe to literally every ignore list possible and still having it shut down I put his bejeweled install on a partition I created and told SOPHOS to completely ignore that partition Finally got it fixed Meanwhile Ive been sprinting everywhere helping customers and getting screamed at because peoples highly important business server isnt done on time I bang out another six PCs before I get the call Its the onsite guy he tells me that the file called do not open in the folder called do not open well he opened it Now all his pictures are gone I enter panic mode as I assumed nobody could ever be stupid enough to open a file called do not open in a folder called do not open that I told him to not open but I was wrong I tell him Ill call him back and get ready for the worst At about this time I suddenly remember that I imaged his laptop last night Seeing a way out I load up and tell my manager that this is vitally important or we might get a complaint to the terrible and mighty corporate Long story short I run over there load the image perform another virus removal and then leave Hes happy Im happy time to go back to work Another two hours later my shift ends nine PCs down all customers not angry sales in my section were great day was good All at  dollars an hour capitalismTLDR Jesus hates SOPHOS and illegal backups save the day EDIT Yeah Ive hidden the scripts and the registry assets Ive learned my lesson on that one,You know that file named Do Not Open that you told me not to open on the computer you told me not to touch I opened it,980,TalesFromTechsupport

takes place in EastGermany many people have been confused about this American conventions for aesthetic purposes onlyTales here with chapter  I put references in again and Oh and look at this Did I just drop thishttpdprijJxK  Don had taken his sweet time introducing me to Alex that morning Though honestly he should not have taken the effort I already knew Alex better than I cared for He went on and on about the skills this new computer prodigy had demonstrated during his job interview but never got into the specifics After the introduction he told me something I was afraid of hearing all along I had to to train Alex Don made sure to put strong emphasis on wanting me to train him I was the chosen oneThis was going to be a long shiftI reluctantly walked to the back to stow away my coat and bag into my locker it only took a minute I wanted to stall going back into the store so I started rearranging the items I had in my bag reading the ingredients on the chewing gum readjusting my clothing checking my cellphone for new messages Nothing that really helped my cause Letting out a huge sigh I went back into the storeAlex was still standing behind the counter when I came back I decided to play the busy game and told him I had a lot of things that needed to be done before I could start training him I pointed at  boxes of all kinds of electronics that needed to added to the shelves He could do that and get himself familiarised with the store that wayI checked the inventory system which was an old DOS program that received its latest update in  The system rarely worked as it should and often randomly updated items to be in stock again We apparently now stocked hundreds of RAMModules and Video cards from the early s It did not matter much anyway as checking inventory was something that rarely needed to be done since Don and Ron just brought in random boxes at all times but it kept me busy and Alex away from me Except it didntAlex seemed desperate for some attention at this moment and kept asking me constantly where each of the electronics needed to be placed I knew that he wasnt stupid and could perfectly well find his way around the store He had been here so many times over the months About an hour in I had stopped counting how many times he had asked me where items needed to be placed but it must have been around thirty times I decided to give him the training that he was supposed to get by decree of the soon to be millionaire DonAs there were no customers in the store I showed him the back where we keep most of the stock the cage with camera system and UPS and the tables with computers that needed to be fixed We walked through the store and I showed him some more things like how the sliding cabinets under the displays worked in the new part of the storeI was on my knees at this moment taking out an mp player when he started coming a little close for comfort I back off and stood up quickly and told him he needs to keep his distance He halfheartedly apologised and said he did not mean to do it It all felt very eerie Against my better judgement I decided to ignore it and move on as I went on with the rest of the day I let him loose in the store so he could harass the customers instead of me I started going down the list of customers who needed to be notified that their repaired PCs and orders could be picked up I was busy calling the customers on the list as another customer walked into the store Alex took initiative for the first time Rather awkwardly he walked up to a middle aged woman and started to introduce himself Hi my name is Alex and I am an expert at all things technical The woman was already taken a bit aback by how he said it lisping at every syllable She started telling him that she was looking for a new keyboard as her current one stopped working Alex immediately dragged her to the  or  keyboards we had pulled out a Logitech G keyboard and told her she needed this one No discussion possible It was a keyboard that we sold for  dollarsI had been listening and watching from the beginning and felt I needed to step in for the sanity of this woman I quickly took over the conversation and pointed her to a  dollar keyboard that would do the job just fine When she was gone I talked to Alex and made it clear that we dont work on commission and our preferences dont count  I sent him to the back with a list of computers he could fix He wasnt any better at thatThe next two or three days were mostly the same story with him receiving negative attention from me because he kept messing up no matter what he did or how I dealt with him Negative attention however is still attention and he seemed to dwell in it maybe even actively asking for it He was clingy always asking the same questions  simple questions he could have easily solved himselfIt wasnt until a month later that he started to become more than just annoying and moved into the territory of being creepy It was one Saturday morning that I found a love note in my locker It was barely intelligible because of the messy handwriting Leila I now have worked with you for a month and have seen you much longer than that I asked you out once and you said no Maybe now that you know me better I can ask again and get a yes I really believe you are the one I will win your heart someday AlexI wasnt happy with this note and felt it had dragged on long enough He was already in the store and I walked up to him and pushed the note into his chest I already have a boyfriend I have said before that I was not interested and no I dont want to be friends with you either It was harsh sure but I really did not want this situation go on any longer He needed to know that I did not want him or his constant peering on meJust leave me alone I said directly into his faceWhen I told him he became angry and started asking who my boyfriend was I refused to tell him He started stomping on the floor and muttered under his voice I will be your boyfriend one day and just left leaving me to handle the entire store alone He didnt return and I called Frank to see if he could fill in for Alex Afterwards I called Don telling him about what happened He wasnt happy with Alex but completely ignored the rest of what I told himI did not feel safe that day and when I was to leave around the end of the afternoon I called a couple of my friends to pick me up and have a girls night at my home I never saw Alex and will never find out if he actually did follow me but it really felt as if he hadAfter that I told Jeremy and my family what was going on I had to work with Alex again on Monday and Jeremy went with me to work just to make sure that nothing would happen In the end he was with me for the entire shift as Alex never showed up He didnt for his next shifts either I was happy he was gone but it did not feel right Something would happenAt home I started to receive postcards with love notes and even flowers He somehow found out my private cellphone number and started calling at the most random times saying nothing when I picked up the first two or three times Texts with just one or two words in them followed soon afterThis was ongoing for about  weeks and I had been in contact with the police several times They had told me there was very little they could do at the moment and I should keep all the postcards texts and calls he send me They had already gone to his house and warned him but it didnt helpIn those two weeks I had been surrounded by my friends family and Jeremy so nothing would happen I hadnt worked in the store during that time either and Jeremy Frank and Richard were covering my shifts Frank and Richard were very supportive of me and didnt like Alex either If they had their chance they would work their magicAround the three week mark we had a store meeting The store meetings had become a mandatory thing every month since the new year I went with Jeremy to see if I could start working at the store again I was not going to back down for AlexAt the store the usual suspects were in Ron and Don were talking about how well the store was doing with the Chinese knock off section and announcing some of their new plans when the suddenly were interrupted by a loud noise Alex was now in the storeHe started shouting JEREMY IS YOUR BOYFRIEND I KNEW IT At this stage the attention wasnt turned to Alex but to me and Jeremy Frank and Richard seemed like they wanted to high five Jeremy but Ron and Don for some reason gave a disapproving look to the both of us I still dont know what that was about Just leave Alex Leave and dont come back I said I did not want to take any of his bullshit anymore Alex did not budge I am not leaving before you dump him and go with me It was at this moment that Jeremy stepped in and said something I never expected Listen you deformed piece of shit go back to the hole you came from and die I was taken aback by the aggression in Jeremys voice I didnt know who to be afraid of anymoreAlex started throwing computers on the floor and broke a monitor while doing it Don and Ron hadnt really done anything during the fight but only now stepped in because they were going to be hit financially You dont work here anymore and are not welcome here anymore Now you better pull out your wallet and pay me or I will call the cops said RonThe cops pulled up fifteen agonising minutes later They arrested Alex and had proof this time The cameras installed by Ron had recorded everything I was free I never heard from Alex again,Chapter   The

Googunk,136,168,13a6b8,736,I worked at Kinkos for several years  My particular branch was open  and near a college neighborhood where   I primarily worked behind the scenes in production positions making the product and correcting newhire mistakes  When I became known to my colleagues as being a computer guy I was called in to assist with customers using the PCrental stations and I was also expected to answer the phone if everyone at the counter was busy  While my job was not techsupport I had to provide assistance to people using the computer sometimes for the first time in their life so I think these should fit in here  Here are my best storiesWynne  Whats the difference between cheetah and leopard  The customer I discovered through protracted inquisition was not referencing OSX versions  The caller actually called a copy store at PM to ask for assistance with taxonomy  The call came in from a middle aged woman named Wynne who would later prove to be either the most incompetent person alive or a lifetimeachievementaward level troll  How do I open the fucking internetOne man mids walked into the store with a handwritten letter and said to me I need to email this He had a slightly oversized piece of paper so it wouldnt fit the standard little scanner we had at the time  I directed him to the selfserve computers which had a larger scanner  To this day I do not know why the fullservice production area had only an X scanner but the self serve had one large enough to do architectural drawings  Nor do I understand why we could not own at least one scanner somewhere in the middle for size  He sat at the rental computer which was visually obscured from my workspace in the back of the store and after about  minutes of evident frustration he surprised everyone in the store especially the mother with a small child when he shouted across the entire store How do I open the fucking internet  I went to him and calmly assisted click on the internet explorer iconThe whatThe button that looks like a blue e with a yellow haloHow do I click itwith the mouseHe then picked up the mouse off of the counter held it in his hand a moment  just long enough to raise my concern but not long enough for me to intervene then touched the mouse to the monitor in the vicinity of the internet explorer icon  He stared with his mouth gaped waiting for the wizard that lived inside of this tiny TV to respond  I decided to cut my losses I couldnt spend my whole night helping one person email a piece of paper   I convinced him to leave his task with us behind the counter as a fullservice job  I went and did it on the big scanner in selfservice when the store was emptyBernoulli diskOne gentleman brought in the file for his business cards on a Bernoulli disk  This was in   If you dont know what a Bernoulli disk is that alone should tell you how antiquated and esoteric the Bernoulli drive is today  I get that his business card information may not have changed for some time but surely someone somewhere at some point asked  What is that  Is that a hard drive A CD case  Baking chocolate  Thats where the story ends when we couldnt use his disk he left confused and never came back  I assume he got into his DeLorean cranked up his Buddy Holly track and went home to enjoy some surge and get caught up on Leave It To BeaverWynne    Eric opens a Factbook account She later called for helping setting up a Factbook account but when the new person didnt understand they asked her to come into the store for us to help her  The new guy Eric was friendly and helpful  He was not yet broken and also not yet experienced in making Wynne go away which should have been a prerequisite skill at that job   By the time I knew it was too late  I only learned what had become of him when I asked where Eric had been for over an hour as I was supposed to be training him  Wynne and Eric were still finding Wynnes extended family inlaws and removed cousins when I called him on the PA saying he had a call holding for himTheres no lines on hold did they want me to call backThere is no call Eric Im just giving you a break  Go back to Wynne and tell her you are needed back here and to talk to someone else for helpOh  Good idea  Wait how did you know her name was WynneFake IDs  Three kids from a fraternity came in around PM  I didnt know their exact ages but it was evident later they were likely   They also didnt tell me outright they were from a frat but it wasnt hard to tell  The store was only  blocks from greek row and these three were much like others of their kind we had seen before  However unlike the usual frat boys these three were amazing quiet  Suspiciously quiet much like when seven year olds are playing and you hear a loud bang followed by silence followed by hurried whispering  I tried to sneak up on them but it was difficult in my work shoes  I got close enough to see they had scanned in one of their drivers licenses and were attempting to Photoshop in pictures of the other two guys into it and change the birthdates  One of them had a copy already printed on regular weight paper  cut out with scissors  and the font was different on the birth date than the rest of the ID  The real kicker though  In Washington state to help identify age under  years old gets a portrait layout on their drivers license while over  get a landscape layout and your portrait layout license always expires on your st birthday  Not only were they using a portrait layout ID for their source they didnt correct the expiration date  I did enough office and apartment keycards to know what it takes to fake an ID and while I wont list the rules of how to fake an ID they broke all of them  They probably have no idea that I saved them a night in jail or maybe juvie by telling them to leave and shred their copiesIf you want more of these let me know Ive got lots  Wynne had plenty more including trying to laminate some pretty leaves she liked and breaking our laminater in the process  A drunk who came in sat at a computer chugged a four loko pissed his pants while sitting in the chair and then just walked out laughing like hed bested us somehow  Lots of amateur porn including a gay trio who had me help design an entire month calendar of their own SampM pictures  I dont want to know why the three of them ordered  copies  Also a woman who was banned from the store for threatening another patron by picking up her miniature poodle and lunging it at them like a weapon  Ill stop here for now because these just keep coming

RealHealthier,166,181,1a1pm9,736,Im sure Ill post more stories of this guys incompetence but I figured Id go ahead and share a few with you since its Sunday I have some time and I was reminded of this crap so here we goI work at a highschool district idk if district is the right word but we have several campuses and recently they hired a new CIO  He frustrates me so much I cant even form a decent story here  Ill just give you examples  While giving a presentation going through documents in his Google Drive in IE opening each in a new window not a tab he couldnt figure out how to get from one document back to the drive view  We told him to just close the foreground window  He moves his mouse in circles looking around  Just click the red x moves mouse in more circles In the top right corner of the screen keeps moving mouse in circles in complete confusion  Finally I stand up and walk up to the screen and point to the elusive red x in the top right corner of the screen and he clicks it  The presentation continues  Someone was giving us a formal overview of our Citrix environment as basic as you can get and at one point he said and these published apps you see here are determined by the permissions we give the user to which our CIO asks What is an app  Could you give me an example of what an app is  After we realized he was serious we told him that Microsoft Word would be an example of an app  Back to Google Drive in another presentation were going over a spreadsheet  He decides he wants to center a columns text  He clicks in the top cell clicks the alignment downarrow and selects center  Then he clicks in the nd cell and clicks the alignment downarrow and selects center again  He does this on a touchpad for about  rows with an entire audience watching and waiting  Because god knows you cant apply formatting to more than one cell at once  We have a very high end network with segregated ports and wifi with repeaters so we can control who can have internet access and who can access network devices and such  Like you do  We had a misconfigured WAP in one room at a campus and we we couldnt access it remotely so we sent the guy on staff who handles that out there later in the week he was busy and our CIO asked why didnt you just send someone out and fix it  I can go to Best Buy and buy a  Linksys Access Point and have wireless up and working wherever I want  His trademark phrase is explain it to me like Im a th grader  During a presentation with the whole school he tries to ask the speaker a question by walking up to the projector and talking into it  When he couldnt figure out how to talk into the microphone next to it he just started typing his question into the computer the guy was presenting on hooked up to the projector  In our monitoring software we had all the devices named as their device name as seen in DNS  All very descriptive so anyone with a brain knew what they were looking at  This doesnt apply to him  He had us change the name of every device in the system to an English type description  Now we have to drill into every device to find its IP  name so we can do something if anything goes down  He also had us change the way it displayed how much RAM  disk space  CPU is being used into gauges like a speedometer from    instead of giving us actual numbers like GB  GB RAM used because its easier for him to understand when its pictures  Someone just got promoted to Help Desk Supervisor and he sent out an email to everyone in the address book informing them that this had happened  Except he misspelled the guys name  Then replied to all and said his name is actually spelled ltcorrect spelling  my bad  Hes foreign  my bad isnt in his vocabulary at least weve never heard him say it  We know this came from him though  Its crazyWe all just expect this behavior now and nobody corrects it Okay this is getting too long  Turns out I could go on forever but whenever I tell someone a story about him and they are like youre exaggerating nobody could do that  My grandparents are smarter than that I revert to these examplestldr Could you boost my bananas wifi signal  Im not generating enough sandals to drink my dog,The brightest CIO alive,917,TalesFromTechsupport

managerhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsqubvhowigotfridaysoffformymanager  Why its important to have More Magichttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsqukqbhowiaddedmoremagictouserslives  Now read on      So there I was in my job with much free time on my hands and Id used it to compile amongst other things a database of various user and system issues and errors along with their associated fixes Because I am a neat and industrious little bunny like that and also a little picky when it comes to quality documentationNow I had access to certain records by the nature of my position and I thought it might be an interesting venture to make a list of all the tech people at all the offices in my state along with their email addresses You never know when you might need such a thing after all So this I do These techs being much like myself were generally the only person in their respective offices who knew which end of a computer was up None of us were in an office team we were all singletons      And as things go and by and by I find myself sending the occasional email to some of the techs at the nearby offices usually on the occasion that a user transferred over and wanted a copy of their profile to go with them Fairly straightforward And as things would have it we would sometimes chat about various problems wed run into and swap or brainstorm solutionsGiven that I was overseeing one of the larger offices and given that I had more than my fair share of free time to devote to tracking down fascinating little bugs and weirdnesses it so turned out that out of those of us who bothered to keep records on such things I had compiled the largest and most comprehensive database in only a few months Not terribly surprising perhapsOnly once I innocently revealed the existence of said database during an email exchange one of the other techs wanted a look at it And being as how I didnt have any reason not to I sent it to him And in the course of things he told one of the other techs who also wanted a copy And so onEventually a large proportion of the office techs in the state emailed me and asked for this database and also for any updates And I was happy to share Only I thought as one tends to do What if someone at one of the other sites has knowledge that isnt in the database Wouldnt it be more useful being shared too So I set up a little mailing list with all these techs in it and mailed them updates and asked for their input And lo and behold most of them hit ReplyAll and we had ourselves the beginnings of a forum      Now this wasnt a problem in and of itself Although given that wed mostly never actually physically met each other and in general wed had no other techs to talk to since wed started the job the floodgates kinda opened There was a lot of backandforth and well some techs were waxing loquacious and others were kinda getting lost in the background Complaints were made And then I got An EmailThis particular Email with the capital letter came from the state helpdesk a bunch of techs in the state HQ we occasionally passed jobs to if they affected multiple offices It said in no uncertain terms that they considered themselves the only source of information allowed to techs in less exalted offices and that what I was doing was Propogating Potentially Dangerous Information to Largely Untrained Personnel      I may have made the mistake being high on youth and bravado at the time of welcoming them to OUR discussion which by the way had provided more training and solutions to the office techs than the initial single day of training at state HQ and subsequent deafening silence ever had Oh and Id also based it off a similar setup which was being run very successfully in the next state over to great acclaim Oh and our FPOC issue resolution statewide was significantly up meaning that we really didnt actually NEED the state helpdesk for anything any more      Yeah      Things did not go well after that Management became involved and I was banned from emailing any of the other technicians over their protests for anything other than my actual duties Some of us set up mailing lists using external email addresses to keep in touch but it petered out after a whileIt wasnt until I was transferred out of that position entirely that I later found out the resolution and training improvements had not gone unnoticed the State helpdesk had been severely reduced in both capacity and number of stuckup snobs and that office techs now got to have one day every six months where they could physically all get together and shoot the breeze in the same place the nowempty section at the State HQ      Then there was

CAFFEINE RUSH HOUR  IN WHICH USERS DONT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH  Right then Now that weve taken care of that little distraction we can continue with the rest of the previous storyhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsfleebyebyedhcprolestupidusergotanipadandlan Id do more but well ammonium triiodide is SUCH a volatile compoundAbout two weeks after the doctor went live with his remote desktop scheme for EMR access and remote clinic visits  which actually went off pretty smoothly much easier than I expected but that was because I dropped RDP shortcuts on every users desktop and at which time against my better judgment Id migrated their ECGs from the failing TB MyBook to the TB RAIDd LaCie device but theyd still had another TB MyBook containing archived studies from the previous year  I got another call from the practice manager this time at  PMBefore I picked up the cell I rolled over in bed away from my ladyfriend and doubleclicked on a script on my machine which kicked off remote diagnostics on her servers ping RAID check uptime et cetera I picked up her call and before I finished my greeting I got a report that everything on the servers were goodHello MXX I havent gotten any pages from the autonomous monitoring systems from your office so the UPS and switches and servers are okay and my diagnostics just confirmed that Whats upWell there are two things The doctor cant get into his computer from home Is he using the shortcut I put on his laptop or is he using his big desktop in the officeAs an aside I should mention that in a rare moment of altruism Id set up their home network on the condition that I would never be asked to support it and yes my documentation for it was SUPERBIts his desktop but I cant get into my computer at the office eitherWell the office connection is up if it wasnt Id have a page from my monitoring systems at my office Out of curiosity what does it say when you try to go to a web page on your computerIt has an ATampT logo and it says that the broadband link is not available Did the connection at the office die Its Time warner Why would Time Warner have an ATampT page on itMy eyebrow started twitching at that pointRemind me MXX what ISP do you have at home And remember I set you up I KNOW what ISP you haveUh we have ATampT DSLAnd when multiple machines in your home are offline doesnt that generally mean your connection at home is downNot necessarily it could be the rest of the  If you finish that sentence with its the rest of the Internet thats down I swear to god I will hook a volt Etherkiller into your shitty unmanaged port  switch and blow out every damn device on your network you vapid pennypinching bleachedblonde harpy I thought to myself but apparently the god of tits and wine looks out for children and stupid people and she corrected herselfOh youre right The DSL modem has a flashing red light on it I guess Ill wait for it to come back up The other reason I called you was that before this started the doctor was working on a study and Windows said the drive was inaccessible and that the file or folder was corrupt and unreadableFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU  What Id been warning her for ages had finally happened The LaCie was apparently as far gone as my patience and it like a drunk whod had too much spicy food shat the bedI will be down there in the morning MXX Do NOT let the doctor do ANYTHING with studies until Im there Period If he does Im not responsible for what happens Hell Im not responsible for what happens anyways since I put it in writing to you that that needs to be fixed  NORMALLY WED USE A CARD FROM SPONGEBOB TO SHOW THE TIME LAPSE HERE INSTEAD ENJOY THE MENTAL IMAGE OF BEA ARTHUR SMOKING CRACK WHILE LISTENING TO I WILL SURVIVE  Once I arrived at the clinic I walked over to the doctors machine and took a look at the LaCie Sure enough it resembled HAL   the light on the front was flashing red and everything pointed to a faulty drive or RAID failure Cursing my bad luck I called LaCie since it was still under warranty and got another sent out nextbusinessmorning as a replacementSince there was nothing else I could do I went back to Austin then came back the next day and sure enough the device had arrivedMXX look Seriously Youve had the MyBook fail one of these has died I am NOT going to deal with these things constantly Either we get a storage server or I will not warranty any of my work and I will put that in writing to both my boss and our insurance companyFine Ill run it by our accountant and see if we can afford itIf you can afford it Your house is worth four million dollars Your kids go to private schools and play bloody lacrosse with the best gear available YOU HAVE A BLOODY ESCALADE WITH SPINNING RIMS AND YOU SOMEHOW GOT AN iPAD MOUNTED TO THE DAMN DASHBOARD You can afford to drop four thousand on a storage server dont tell me you cantI told her that recovery from this would take all night if were lucky and that I wouldnt be out before midnightAs soon as everyone left I hooked up the good drive from the RAID array to a spare computer via an internal SATA port and booted the box to Ubuntu LaCie uses some arcane obscure file system for its arrays but Ubuntu reads it fine Copying the terabyte of data to the new LaCie box took about nine hours even SATA to eSATA will take a while to copy TB of data and I didnt walk out of their office before  AM Again I left a note on the practice managers desk saying that she needed to order a storage server ASAP and that the next failure would invariably be worse than that  CUE MORE SPONGEBOB  IF WE ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT SCENE CHANGES WE WILL NOW SUBSTITUTE THE IMAGERY OF A SWEATY CHRIS CHRISTIE IN A THONG DANCING TO HADDAWAYS WHAT IS LOVE ENJOY  About a month later I was sitting at my desk enjoying a sandwich from Jimmy Johns and browsing Engadget and I get a call on my cellHi Jack its MXX Do you have a minuteSure MXX whats up Actually call me back

university help desk Ive been there a while so I get to deal with the faculty and staff Anyone who has done university IT realizes that it is probably a miracle any of us who deal with faculty are able to function without a constant drip of alcohol feeding into our systemsOn campus you are provided an email account while you are actively affiliated with the university and  days after you are done with the university Poof no more email for you which is an incredibly difficult concept for so very many recent graduates to understandHelp desk on a Saturday is usually slow A my password just decided not to work today here and a My God what did you do to my email client I cant use it at all today and you need to fix it now there But every so often you get the most dreaded of calls a nemesis Now I know what you are thinking Youre thinking But Azar isnt that a bit dramatic Can your help desk really have a nemesis To which I respond Of course not A help desk does not have just one nemesisToday I have done battle with the Uneducated Elaborator Story Time I walk into work today and a soontobetormented colleague begins to tell me what he is dumping onto my day as he is walking about the doorSTBTC Azar this guy is going to be calling in soon Hes just trying to migrate his email off our server we need to connect to his computer and help him with it I tried but he had to hang up and put more time on his calling cardMe Alrightwhat was the troubleSTBTC We couldnt figure out how to setup his other email account to move the emailMe Should be easy enoughLo and behold but right as he is walking out the door I receive the call Within seconds a cold piercing chagrin set into my bones The Uneducated Elaborator has found my lineMe Thank you for calling the help desk how may I help youUE Ah yes hello I was speaking with your colleague but and we were trying to setup some email to move it from one account to another but I guess my phone has blocked your number as he was supposed to call me back to work on this issue I suppose hes just gotten so fed up with it that he cant handle it any more You see I wasFive minutes laterUEso can you help me get this email migratedMe Sure I actually wrote the instructions you were sent so lets see if we can get these worked outWe have a remote connection tool that gives us control over their computer and I walk him through getting connected I see he already has Windows Live Mail installed and running and his school email address is already added All we need to do is add his gmail account and move the email from one to the otherMe Alright sir if you can just fill in your gmail account information we should be able to get this taken care of quickly Showing him where to type with his cursorUE Alright where do I type nowMe Right here First we need your usernameHe types his usernameMe And here we will need your passwordUE My WhatMe The password for your Gmail accountUE I never was prompted for a password You see Ive never had a gmail account before and your colleague helped set one up He saidAnother  minutes laterUE And so Ive never set up a password on this accountI assure him he must have set one up before in order to use the account but we pull up a web browser just to see if it was automatically saved and if so we could just get his password EasyThe web browser was open and there was his Gmail account already logged inMe Alright sir the password we are looking for is the one you used to login hereUE I never logged in here I logged him out of Gmail hoping the login screen would jar his memoryMe Alright sir if you can just login to your Gmail account here we should be able to determine what password you should useUE Alright what is my usernameMe Its the name of the account we were just in The one you said you setup just a few minutes agoUE I never setup a username I never have used Gmail before Your colleague helped me out over the phone and I have this old email address I used before YKAn epoch passes I see the full life cycle of entire species crawl before my deadened gazeUE So I really just have no idea what this password could beI take him to the area where he can retrieve his password To save time I start filling in some of the information for him Then he drops the big oneUE and so I just have no idea how to get this all working Oh wait a minute That says Google there Is this a Google websiteThe entirety of Gmail is covered in Google logos but I hold back my desire to flip the nearest table I can findMeuhyes sir Gmail is a Google product The G stands for Google UE

 Work your cares away dancings for another dayhttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsreadhowiwentwildwithautomationandimprovements  Now read on      Well were getting towards the end of my time at this job  but this isnt the last post about it That comes laterThis post is about a stunt I pulled to achieve multiple things simultaneously for minimum effort  See Id gotten pretty much my fill of metaphorically kicking the office manager in the neck and had figured it was time I should be moving on But first there were a couple of things yet to do on my list These included Scoring some credentials for my CV and to wave around to make the inevitable transition to another job easier and more fun and   Having a chat to the CEO in person because I like doing that when Im on the bottom of the ladder and   Monumentally pissing off the office manager one last time in such a way that he couldnt do a damn thing about it        So I used my free hours to sit back and consider how to achieve all of this together And after a while the answer came to me I went to my section manager the nice one noted that I had a lot of vacation time coming to me and asked for a week off Given that this would decrease the amount of drama occurring when the office manager her boss was in my vicinity she readily agreed And I went back to my desk and made a couple of longdistance calls then booked a flightOn the day before my vacation I called up the list of all the innovations and ideas that staff had submitted to HQ over the preceding months Then I spent some time with an office printer and some thin cardboard and walked the results out to my car during the lunch break I was ready      The weekend saw me on a redeye flight out of the city and headed for the nations capital There was a friend there who was willing to cover accommodation and I didnt need more than a sleeping bag in a spare room  apart from a standard business suit all my props fit into a single clipboard and everything else was in my head  Monday I started You see the names of the controlling Board  the CxO people  were available on the office intranet As were those of their secretaries And there was a corporate phone book where you could look up extensions all across the country And it seemed that an awful lot of the CxOss secretaries had received phone calls a week or two ago asking politely for ten minutes on the relevant Board members schedule if they would be so kind  This included the CEO  So I spent Monday through Wednesday happily chatting with the UltraBosses about this and that having prepared some conversational topics relevant to their area and using it as an excuse to bring them up to speed on my home state which was the furthest away from HQ and pretty much never ever got visited I was the courier from the far frontier and happy to play up the angle that people at home would love to hear all about anything coming down the pipeline Thusly I gave myself a crash course in talking to CxOs and picking up relevant HQspecific jargon phrases and mindsets  Then came Thursday      Thursday I met the head of the Innovation and Ideas program As I suspected shed never actually talked to any of the staff who had submitted anything After all they were out in the publiccontact offices and state offices not in the National office  Well I told her I have an Innovative Idea Why not make a little award like a certificate for the person who submitted the most ideas in a year Itd give the program a little publicity a little boost a little legitimacy It might even encourage more submissions which had been tailing off  Why yes she thought this would be an excellent idea  Great I said Because according to the data of the first year of the program the person who submitted the most ideas in the entire country is me And as fate and an office printer which took thin cardboard would have it I coincidentally have here with me a fully designed and printed certificate stating so needing only your signature Of course Id be more than happy to provide details and assist the IampI program with any writeups it wanted  She signed it Stage One Complete      Friday was the big one Friday I met with the CEO Id managed to get onto her calendar purely because she was new she had been appointed from outside the Service she was interested in shaking things up and shed never before had a bottomrung employee ask to talk to her directly about something other than a complaint This made me oddly intriguing and I got my ten minutes  I spent the time rabbiting about a halfassed idea for rewarding employees who generated cost savings with either a percentage in cash or access to things like spare executive furniture and better coffee makers for the office I didnt expect it to go anywhere although if it had I would have milked that sucker like a dairy cow and was fine with having her shoot it so full of holes it could have auditioned for the Miss Swiss Cheese swimsuit competition It was all smokescreen anyway My real reason for being there was to be seen as a really nice guy A solid reliable dependable employee who really liked the organisation and was enthusiastic about the direction the CEO was taking it in Because as we finished up she walked me out past her secretary and at that moment I asked if I could get a photo of us together With this camera I just happened to have brought along with me  There was a loooooong pause I grinned brainlessly at the secretary who gave her boss a look which said Aw give the kid a break and something to show his friends And ten seconds later I had a photo of me and the CEO standing in the CEOs chambers in the heart of central HQ Stage Two CompleteI flew home with my certificate which Id laminated after photocopying it and its signature a couple dozen times onto other thin pieces of cardboard and my photo I spent the weekend having the photo blown up to A size and framed Monday I took it to work      Now what I hadnt mentioned to this point was that the desk I had been given was about fifteen feet away from the office managers little glassedin minioffice He could see me and everything on my desk every time he walked out his door  I put that photo of me and the CEO up exactly where his eye would fall whenever he looked my way And I made sure that everyone in my section and thus via gossip everyone in the office saw both that photo and the official certificate of excellence signed by the II board member where it was pinned up in pride of place EVERYONE knew where Id been and who Id talked to and it looked a lot like the Very Top Brass had taken something of a personal shine to me Stage Three COMPLETESoon after the office manager took his first vacation in over a decade And I launched my final and most Machiavellian plan of my time working in that place  and that is going to be my very last story  at this office anyway It would be eight years before I returned to the city      But that and everything that came after is a story for another time        tldr Im certified because I say Im certified Also screw you  INDEX EDIT  Next

ifrgtremember,189,173,yiv0h,679,I used to work in a place with lots of government employees When we moved to a brand new facility the decision was made to replace all the old desktops and laptops with brand new laptops with i processors plenty of RAM a desktop dock and a new  monitor There were maybe  or  computers in the whole facility where this wasnt going to be a clear upgrade this story is not about any of those computersI got to this gentlemans desk and began the short interview to ensure we captured all the programs that needed to be installed the user date was backed up and any custom configurations were noted Everything looked pretty standard for this guy so I finished the interview and proceeded to break down his old PC and get the new one set up I got everything set up nicely and had him log on to the new machine and make sure everything was working and that his programs and files were thereAn hour or so later he calls down to our desk and asks that my supervisor and myself come up to discuss issues with the new PC He starts to tell us about how his work is very intensive on the computer and his last PC had to have a new graphics card installed to handle it So I check out the old PC and wouldnt you know it it has a fairly nice ATI card installed a little better than the discrete graphics on the new laptop I was confused because nothing I installed on the new PC would need that So I begin to ask questions like are all your programs and files on the new PC and do they run properly He answers yesMy supervisor takes over and starts asking completely unrelated questions At this point I start to realize he is in over his head and buying into this guys story It turns out someone couldnt figure out this guys issue in the past so they just threw parts at his computer and told him he was some sort of power user that needed high end computer partsI asked him to walk me through what he was doing on his old PC Turns out he was opening an Access database that was over Gb in size His crappy old p PC had integrated Intel graphics and Gb of RAM stock That is when I figured out that all he needed was discrete graphics so the RAM wasnt fighting with the display for memory The new laptop already had this but he wanted to feel special againTLDR Guy thought he needed a high end D card for MS Access,This graphics card wont handle my work,852,TalesFromTechsupport
Plonkerby,118,169,v1dqp,677,I knew most of this yesterday but wanted to wait until I could talk to the IT guy in depth to get the full story and hear what E had said to everyone For anyone who missed the first installment of this amazing blunder  Infinite Backups Part httpreddituvurNow the news you are probably all wanting to hear E has been fired He will be leaving the company at the end of this month and is now coming in only to pass things on to his replacement He has been working here for quite some time and is the face of our company to a number of our customers so it was a tough decision for management to make Luckily sense prevailed and he is going to be gone WoohooThe boss who gave E the login info to begin with has been reprimanded not sure on the details and he will no longer have access to this information He put the company at a huge risk beyond Es stupidity so I guess they are handling it pretty seriouslyNow on to the juicy details According to E Apparently E never realized what he was backing up He never even checked He was under the assumption that he was just backing up his normal daily backup set When only a few in a row filled the backup folder he was shocked at how little space was available He saw it as a ticking time bomb of sorts  if only a few backups of his stuff filled the folder what was going to happen in a couple months when larger pieces of data ran out of space This was clearly a design flaw on the part of the IT guy The IT guy clearly couldnt handle such a simple task and was surely just going to blow E off if he tried to tell him about it as he had been blown off in the past when giving suggestions  surely this is a sign of his incompetence so it was just easier to take things into his own hands Staying logged in as root was a mistake He had planned to log out and use his own log in but forgot Oops  He hadnt intended to delete anything other than his oldest personal backups but again oops He thought it was just dealing with the size limit on his personal folder not the entire server That wouldnt have happened if the IT guy used UNIX instead of dumbeddown Linux Linux makes these kinds of mistakes easy which is why he keeps telling the IT guy to use UNIX but the IT guy just keeps blowing him off What kind of IT guy blows off suggestions from his seniors Not a good one for certain So it boiled down to If the IT guy had done it right in the first place I would never have needed to do anything at all and I use UNIX this dumbeddown Linux tripped me up on a few things All with the charm turned on full blastNow the boss vaguely remembered that he was only supposed to give that login out when  The IT guy could not be reached by any means and  a new IT leader has been hiredHis mind converted these to When the IT guy isnt around and When someone new needs to do something IT related  both applied to the E situation E had been part of the original starting team so he was trusted It wasnt like the boss handed out the information to just some random faceless employeeI have to actually put a good word in for our management They apparently listened to the IT guy explain what had actually happened how E managed to screw things up the poor security chain that allowed E to do this etc They apparently werent deliberating over who was at fault but more about the best way to discipline the boss and E The IT guy was kind of scared that they would flop the blame over on him as he has been working here for about half the time as E and the boss but they were actually sensible about the whole thing After reading through some of the insane stories on here I have to give them some credit They even praised the IT guy for getting it completely sorted out and back to normal over the weekend with no visible down time other than the hiccup on the first dayEdit  I forgot to add Apparently this isnt the first time that E had tried to mess with the network and servers He has been told several times to leave the IT work to the IT professionals So this wasnt the first time there had been a problem of sorts,Infinite backups update,846,TalesFromTechsupport

narelie,171,108,wrxfr,675,EDIT I have added the full story in links in a commentOk so bear with me I had to cut out some of the details to keep within limit Im also reposting this from TalesFromRetail at the request of a posterSo our story begins years ago when I was contracted to design a custom template for a guys website  total to cover the design I made and the guy the client hired on to code Yes I was a moron about pricing back then The Client well call him TJ threw a fit about the price but eventually agreed to it The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish but ended up turning out really nice The sites monthly profit actually went up by  after the new design was launched No Im not kidding thats how much of an improvement I did TJ however throws a massive fit demanding extra free work done and that we WILL do it because hes paying us so much As Im in the middle of trying to calm him down and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project he suddenly does a  personality change Hes suddenly extremely polite and nice and says he completely understands Im a bit weirded out but didnt think much of it Well that evening the guy who I paid to code calls me up freaking out His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night Considering wed just gotten paid by TJ to our Paypal accountsthis was odd Both of us checked Paypal and found out TJ had reversed the payments Coder in a fit of rage promptly logs in to TJs website and strips down all the files and leaves up a note on the website of TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder and this is what he got Not a  classy move but within two minutes TJ was calling me up screaming with rage He made all sorts of insane rants that we overcharged him that we scammed him now we have to give him the entire design for free and that if we didnt wed suffer I explain politely that the terms of the project that TJ agreed to clearly explain that in the case of a payment reversalnonpayment the files will be removed until receipt of the payment He rants a bit more about how this is illegal extortion but finally gives back the money Coder puts back the files problem solvedRight I guess coder felt like this wasnt good enough I had no idea but apparently TJ had done this sort of thing multiple times to some of Coders buddies and Coder had enough of TJs shenanigans He went onto a extremely popular forum for TJs industry and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited word got out Fast I heard about the post within half an hour and by the time I went to go check TJ and coder were having it out on the forums screaming at each other I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJs lawyer later found out it was his friend telling me theyre going to be suing me for slander extortion etc I tell Coder to cut it out and I get the forum thread locked downTJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my wayhes gonna track me down and beat me up hes gonna cut me hell find my familyI end up blocking him because Im not gonna listen to that After blocking himradio silence I thought perhaps magically this would all blow over  A few weeks later I get a message from TJ on an alt IM account Hes apologizing and asks how Im doing I said fine and he asked if my kids were nearby as they typically are Hm weird but I said yeah of course ones even sitting in my lap TJ is all kids are wonderful like that So I need to know if youll make a design for my new site and gives me a link At this point my kid was squirming so I got up put her down so she could leave and went back to see what he was talking about I click on the link and immediately hardcore porn floods the screen Im horrified and look at TJs im where hes laughing and saying how he bets thats gonna be one traumatic thing for my kids to try and forget Im furious and block him At this point I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problemsThis occurred a few more times over the next few months Id get messages from fake people wanting to know quotes asking me to look at their site and see what I can doand itd be some sort of hardcore or illegal porn The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on TJ went  and made a post about me with all sorts of insane claims Apparently I was a foreign Communist spy sent to infiltrate their industry and that with every project I stole my clients bank account numbers SSNs and their CC numbers Id had it and I unblocked TJ long enough to tell him that if he made ONE more move to harass me I would contact the police I was done with it and Id drag him through courts if I had to TJ flipped out claimed this is all MY fault I cut him off say Im serious and Im done Im blocking TJ again and if I hear ONE WORD Im going to the policeThat was the last I heard of him for a while a year in fact I later ran into his expartner from the website we did for them He was furious asking if Id heard from TJ Turns out he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny He contacted the buyer and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed Hes siphoned off something like  of his partners money and kept it for himselfThat wasnt all though as he was discussing this with the buyer he noticed in the sites activity feed someone withdrawing small amounts this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well and the new owner was like yeah come to think of ittheyre been withdrawing every day New owner checks the account and HOLY MACKEREL they have a  pending balance Thats literally impossible to pull offespecially considering that the account was created the day before the site sold Upon further digging new owner discovers a few accounts all created the day before the sale with thousands in their balance And all with payment details that belong to TJYep hed made fake accounts so that he could steal money from the buyer slowly over time He wouldve ended up making off with something like  if hed not been caught So yeah expartner and new owner were furious and trying to find TJ I just said Im sorry cant help you there and went back about my business Tthe next week I woke up to a huge amount of emails and messages Upon checking every single one of them was from a clientfriend of mine in the industry ranting about the same thingTJHed had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for But hed closed everything down and told everyone  theyre not being paid This is something now to the tune of k Several of my clients had already contacted lawyers and were in the process of setting up lawsuitsAnother year passes and I meet a new client and we end up becoming friends We chatted a few times about some of the crazier people weve dealt with and he suddenly blurts Well nothing tops this one guy TJTJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick One of which was my new client Neither would have any of it got their money back and told him to scram  So TJ tracked down their addresses and called the police in BOTH towns at about  am He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun and holding their family hostage threatening to shoot them if they movedYou can imagine the response that happened to thatFirst guy was woken up at  am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement He was surrounded by about five cars all full of screaming policemen with guns trained on himSecond guy wasnt actually home he was on a trip but his family WAS so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them outEverything got straightened out of course and then both guys pressed charges against TJ for what he had doneThe icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him and mentioned how this was his favorite way to teach people a lessonbut that the only one who couldnt have that done to her was that amp narelie Because Id been smart and it was difficult to track down my addressNew client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest recordIn the year since I last told TJ that if he didnt cut it out Id call the police on him his life had hit the downhill slope and gone to heck The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming hed been robbed of his TV and Xboxonly to have been found out that he was lying he traded them for drugs Afterwards he quickly got in trouble multiple times for drugs assault and then domestic violence His businesses all folded and with the lawsuits looming he moved to try and escape having to pay back the money he owed Didnt work from what I hear they still managed to track him downHowever he isnt done yet Hes shown back up recently attempting to schmooze some of the industry vets into backing him with a new startupsaying hes changedProbably gonna be really difficult for him to do that considering I just discovered that the arrest database now has a new entry for him as of last month Child Abduction Kids safe as far as I can gatherAnd it somehow may or may not have gotten out as a

Craptain,99,131,177a9c,675,Not sure if this story fits here as Ive always been a coder so it isnt really tech support Well see how it goesWhenever I needed our office address I would pull up the corporate homepage to find the address and zipcode of our office I make heavy use of tabs in my browser and since I use a vertical tab plugin I rarely close anyI had noticed that my browser would sometimes slow down to a crawl and I knew it was probably some shitty plugin in one of my many open tabs it was usually less work to just close the browser and reopen it discarding all open tabs and starting anewOne day I had pulled up the homepage again to copy the address and after that went to lunch An hour later I was doing some work that didnt involve my browser The door to our room openedThats him over there a coworker told some guy I hadnt seen before giving me somewhat of a stink eyeIt turns out that the corporate homepage was experiencing a DOS attack that originated from within the company more specifically my laptop Meanwhile some bottlenecks in our corporate network also got swamped with my laptops calls setting off all kinds of alarms and crashing stuff This is not a small company by the way it employs s of peopleI pulled up my browser and it was slower and less responsive than Id ever seen it So putting the puzzle pieces together I said ah so thats whats been slowing my browser down Guy said yeah thats really interesting would you mind closing it like right now sure So I closed the browser instantly alleviating a corporatewide IT crisisI wanted to know what exactly had happened though so a couple of days later I had some free time and pulled up the corporate homepage again and used the firebug net monitor It seemed fine at first but I started noticing a pattern pretty quicklyOne minute after I opened it it made an ajax call to the server I looked into it and it was to update the stock price in realtime that was displayed in a tiny area on the homepageOne minute later it made two calls to the same service Another minute later it made four calls next eight calls sixteen calls and so forth e after writing this Ive calculated that after an hour it would attempt to send  simultaneous calls I believe thats called a QuintillionIn Javascript a common way to repeatedly trigger a delayed execution is to use setTimeout at the end of the function you want to repeatedly trigger The problem was for some reason there were two setTimeouts at the end of the function so after a minute delay it would execute the function twice and both executions would hit two setTimeouts resulting in four executions a minute laterWhat makes this interesting to me is that anyone on the internet could pull up the homepage and cause huge problems by just doing nothing I wrote an email to the people responsible Didnt get an answer but it did get fixede Thats him over there is now TFTS quote of the day Thank you anonymous mod,How the corporate homepage brought our network to its knees,806,TalesFromTechsupport

rproofreading and TerminalPlantainhttpwwwredditcomuserTerminalPlantain for proofreading and editing   Previous ChaptersChapter   My first job in IThttpredditxtlhx Chapter   Store uniformshttpredditxyazr  I was happy to finally have a decent uniform to wear I had been walking around in questionable clothing for far too long My new shirt was light pink and had the store logo across it The only downside was the new name badge that came with it I dont like the idea of strangers calling me by my name and pretending they are on a first name basis with me The name badge was part of the second wave of the plans from Ron and Don to revamp the store In a second store meeting they had told us that they wanted to change the store even more It needed to be spacious and full of light with demos of our products on the tables for customers to try out They clearly had been to an Apple Store and thought we can do this they could notAfter about six weeks of planning arguing and having an even messier store they were done with the  makeoverThe result was what looked like an counterfeit backalley Apple Store The store windows now were completely free of the promotional posters that had been up there for too long The glass was  tainted with adhesives for weeks afterwards The tables were put in the center of the store and had refurbished notebooks on them The desktops were banished to the right side of the store with the software and accessories on the left New was the table full of iPod knockoffs that would be the new can I interest you in item The store still kept many of its old features The walls were still brownish they used to be white a long time ago and the floor was old grey carpeting that had had its time The bins containing all kinds of USBgadgets and promotional displays still were scattered around the store On the outside they did nothing the paint was still chipping off and the street was still dirty The store sign had changed by now but it was poorly secured and looked like it was leaning towards the left I am honestly still surprised it never fell off In the street we now had a poster board that detailed our special offers  special in the sense we didnt actually have any offers Just full prices disguised as discountsWith the store now having a full fledged identity crisis the attention fell on the back of the store Ron wanted it to be cleaned and to throw away anything that we did not need  the hoarding was over With my Saturday shift coming up he decided I could clean up the back I dont know why he picked me but I was happy since it beat working in the storeThe back was messy and looked old The walls were hidden behind rows and rows of metal bookcases storing inventory old computers and boxes full of parts On the right was Rons office a small kitchen and the toilet I never really went into Rons office unless there was a good reason I was afraid of what I would find there The part of the walls that were free of the bookcases were used for storing boxes The only thing that looked remotely new in this place was the light above the safety exit hanging next to the door They had it replaced before I came to work here under pressure from the fire department Otherwise it would have have been an archaeologically perfectly preserved s ITworkspaceIn the middle of the room we had the work benches  big grey tables with another on top On top bench we had all the PCs and notebooks we had to work on with their information sheet taped on the front Aside from the ungrounded extension cords it was actually a decent workplace Not knowing where to start with cleaning the mess up I looked around and decided to start with one of the blue plastic containers in the metal bookcases It contained all kinds different cables that appeared to be in the middle of an orgy I was not going to untangle that mess so I put it back and slapped a sticker saying Cables on itI then took out the next box and started looking through it mostly old video and sound cards I was ready to put it back and slap an AudioVideo label on it when something caught my eye I took it out and I could not for the life of me identify it at first It was an tennis ball covered with screws all of which were pointing outward You could have really hurt somebody with it I asked myself what it was for and moreover why we even had it Asking Richard a couple days later he told me they had played a match of pain ball Pain ball was a game they had played to see who could handle more pain He showed me all the damage they had done to the store with it broken LCD screens  carefully hidden behind boxes  and damaged wallsIt is about now that I should tell you more about Frank and Richard They were  to put it kindly  practical jokers They had a spirit of having fun around them and whenever an opportunity arose they took it no matter the consequences costs or ethics involved They treated everybody equally Them buying me an outfit was an opportunity to play a joke on me made possible by Don and RonTheir other hobby was doing imitations of Jackass and building things Strange things When I had put the pain ball away and went on with cleaning up the store I found many more of their treasures They later showed me how all their devices workedHidden between the CD and DVD drives I found the Stabber a repurposed slimline DVDdrive that instead of ejecting a DVD would eject a knife The Shooter was a collection of high RPM fans that been taped togetherWith part of their casing removed it worked like a waterwheel shooting away pieces of cereal What took the cake for me was the walking video card They had taken an old card and put  fans on it their casings removed Being hooked up to a small battery it would sort of walk It was surreal to see if totally pointlessHaving cleaned out most of the back I turned my eye to a pile of magazines wedged between two of the shelves They were old PC magazines  editions from  to the early s I decided to throw them all away and grabbed a container to bring them to the paper bin just around the corner While I was picking them up to put in the container my curiosity got the better of me I wanted to skim the magazines just to look at what was the must buy hardware at the time Computers were expensive back then I had gone through about three quarters of the pile when something came up that was not a PCmagazine It was a porn magazine vintage  It was unexpected but I wasnt fazed by it I had never actually browsed a porn magazine before and opened it up to quickly find out that the theme was barely legal It was really questionable What made me throw it in the trash right away was that  how cliche it may sound  the pages were sticky I did not want to touch it anymore I went to the kitchen to scrub my hands with soap and a brush over and over again till they were red from irritation It wasnt super effective and I still felt dirty I decided it was better to just leave it It was either from Ron or Don and I did not want to know whichLater that week I started working on about  orphaned PCs I found during the cleanup I had connected the first PC hit the power button and a well known beep was heard followed by a rattling hard disk busy with loading whatever ancient version of Windows would be on the PCWhat was missing however was the screen No input whatsoever  just a vague reflection of me in the glass CRT monitor I checked the VGA cable it correctly attached to the monitor and reaching under the desk I determined that it was attached as it should be There was a lot of dust though Already on the verge of sneezing my eyeballs out from all the dust I managed to open the side of the computer up It seemed to be working on dust everything was grey aside from the video card which was rather Cheetos orange Upon closer inspection I found that it was indeed Cheetos dust and smudges covering the entire card The heat sink had been removed and replaced by Cheetos Unsurprisingly Cheetos dont transfer heat well After cleaning the computer of dust and Cheetos I replaced the video card and tried to boot again The computer startedTwo or three computers without advanced Cheetos cooling down the road I encountered another computer that did not work I opened the computer up and quickly my jaw dropped There was mold growing around the CPU It was disgusting to look at Baffled at how it was possible I took off the cooling They had replaced the thermal paste with cheese probably in an attempt to make CPU grilled cheese Idiots TLDR  I discovered many

Lydious,228,181,19p4ex,659,I got a call today that just blew my mind This guy called me at Derp pro support saying that he had  systems with issues the first one was holding him hostage on his favorite games site with some popup that wouldnt let him close the browser From the start he was snippy demanding amp standoffish not the best way to start a call amp certainly not the best way to get any more than the bare minimum of service from me If youre nice to me Ill bend the rules like nobodys business to make you happy If you treat me like crap amp act like a petulant child you will get the absolute bare minimum of effort that it takes for me to keep my job He starts off bitching about having to talk to an Indian person last time he called in which pissed me off because I hate racists with a passion Then my attempt to confirm his service tag amp system type was met with I dont know you should already know that and every instruction I gave him was met with Im not a techy person what are you talking about By some miracle I managed to talk him through opening the task manager amp closing out IE and then he started talking about his other system which was locking him out I was already prepping my sorry we dont crack passwords speech assuming he had just forgotten his password when he began describing the FBI virus To begin with viruses are besteffort only for us and I rarely bother with them because theyre annoying amp a waste of my time because the cust usually ends up reinstalling windows in the end anyway But whatever Ill pretend to take a shot at it just to shut him up I had him boot into safe modewhich took  tries due to him ignoring my instructions but FBI was still locking him out in safe mode He was hosed I began to explain that if he cant even get into the system in safe mode there was no hope of me fixing the system amp that hed have to OSRI This was met with NO NO NO I am NOT reinstalling windows The last time I had this problem that Indian guy remoted in and fixed everything for me The last time You mean youve had this problem before amp didnt take precautions to keep it from happening again Oh what you DO have virus protection You mean that stagnant copy of Norton the least effective virus scanner available thats not even running in the background amp hasnt been updated in  years No no Im sure youre fine Totes not your fault that you keep getting virusesI told him Id love to remote in amp have a go at it if I could but since he could not even log on to the system we would be unable to get connected at all due to our remote access SW being webbased amp requiring handinput token codes for each connection He just kept repeating that the last guy had just fixed it for him amp that I should too I was beginning to get really pissed off at this point I have little patience for idiots and even less patience for belligerent rude idiots who wont listen to what Im telling them I hadnt yet pulled up the tag for this second system he had just launched right into the spiel without even giving it to me I got the tag from himafter again explaining what a service tag was amp where to find it and listening to him bitch about how much trouble it was to read off seven digits to me pulled up the account amp saw that he didnt even have a support contract on this system Score I was not obligated to help this douchabeefy at all anymore D I informed him of his lack of coverage amp explained that I could not actually provide any sort of support for this system at all It had been out of warranty for an entire year and the last  times he called in he had been charged for support The notes even said fee based support I pointed this out to him amp he yelled NONONONONO I paid to extend my warranty on October st of last year You guys charged me  and that was for a warranty extension Im looking at the sheet in my hand right now Ok sir since you have the order sheet right there can you read me off the order number so I can check to see if maybe theres been a mistake on our endThere IS no order number Its just a charge You guys charged me so you have to help me cause Im the customerOhhh hes pulling the customer is always right card Im gonna have fun shooting this one down gtDIm sorry sir but there are no active support contracts showing up on this system and unless you can give me an order number for this warranty extension theres really nothing else I can do for you today I replied my voice sweeter than Jewish wineWHY WOULD I MAKE THIS UP I PAID YOU GUYS Uhh you would make it up in order to get free service on a machine thats out of warranty DurrIm not accusing you of making anything up sir Im just letting you know our policy and that I am not able to help you unless you have a valid support contract with usHe began literally WHINING like a  year old having a tantrum over forbidden candy Come OOOOooonnnnuh You HAVE to help me The last guy helped me so I MUST have a warranty Im the customer and Im always rightIm sorry sir but it says in the notes that the last  times we helped you it was feebased support and you were charged for our services If we help you again today there will be another chargeTHERE WAS NO CHARGE THEY NEVER CHARGED ME LAST TIME YOURE LYINGIm having to mute him to laugh at this point and Im giving my greatly amused supervisor a play by play via IM Thats what the  charge was for sir That was not a warranty extension that was a service charge because your system was out of warranty the last  times you called in If it had been a warranty extension there would be an order number on the paper This is ridiculous you should just help me And I probably would have at least tried to if you hadnt been a total assmunch from the moment I answered the phoneI am not allowed to help you unless you have a Derp support warranty sir Im sorry Id help you if I could but those are the rulesYeah well rules can have exceptionsAt this point I could tell he knew he was defeated His once booming voice had become small amp weak He then asked how much it would cost to extend his warranty I told him Id have to transfer him to another department for that and that even if he did extend his contract it wouldnt cover existing issues I think he may have actually been weeping at this point because he just quietly asked without arguing how much it would cost to have us clean up the virus I transferred him to our feebased support department but Im not sure what they could do about it since he couldnt even get into his system to initiate a remote session But meh not my problemWhat a mook I dont know if he was trying to pull one over on me or was just genuinely too stupid to recognize over  worth of support charges on his credit card but he can have fun paying another  dollars to remove a virus that could easily be taken care of for FREE with a simple OS reinstall I will never understand what makes a grown adult think that throwing tantrums like a  year old is ever even remotely OK ಠಠEDIT OK forget I said ANYTHING AT ALL about the racism thing jesus I guess you had to actually be there and hear the way the guy was talking about the Indian rep he last worked with to understand why I feel he was being racist Trust me it was NOT along the lines of Gee I sure dont enjoy talking to people whom I have trouble understanding amp who have no power to actually help me it was more like God I hate talking to those stupid freakin Indians The rep had fixed his issue without any problems amp the customer did not mention any communication issues at all His only issue with the rep was that he was Indian amp had a foreignsounding name hence why I made the accusation of racism ,Tantrums dont work for children and they wont work for you either sir

DocOsten,59,163,xrmqw,654,A couple of years ago I used to work at a helpdesk that supported a family of hospitals scattered across the country  We were  of  helpdesks setup to support this group of hospitals with each helpdesk assigned specific hospitals to support  In addition to our level  support our particular helpdesk also did basic operations support such as monitoring application interfaces  We did this for all of the hospitals regardless of if they were assigned to us for level  support or notOne day an interface went down for a HospitalX  The error it was receiving was Fatal Client Died which was a fairly common error  it usually means theres not enough room for the log to continue growing  If left unattended it could cause larger issues so these are treated as priority issuesAt this point in the story its important to note that HospitalX was not assigned to our helpdesk  In fact the helpdesk well call them HelpdeskX that did support HospitalX was located at HospitalX and it was the only Hospital they were assigned to support  This actually was cause for a lot of resentment for the other helpdesks as the call volume was not evenly distributed but I digressSo back to the story we issued a high priority ticket to the appropriate team at HospitalX they address and resolve the issue and thats that   Or so I thought  Each helpdesk had their own team lead and I was the lead for mine  One of the duties of the lead was to review priority tickets for your assigned hospitals to ensure everything was going smoothly and address any issues  I get an email from HelpdeskXs lead with the subject URGENT HIPAA Reminder and the only thing in the body being Please remind your staff that it is a hipaa violation to put any patient information including status of the patient in a ticket  That was it there wasnt anything else for me to go off of as to what prompted this emailSo I call up HelpdeskXs team lead and ask what this was about  She said she had been reviewing priority tickets and came across one where we had put that a patient had died  Of course this was a serious accusation so I asked for the ticket number  Pulling up the ticket I had to supress the urge to laugh and spent the next  minutes trying to explain to her that the Client in Fatal Client Died was an application not a patient,If your patient has died please submit a priority ticket to the helpdesk via phone or email,817,TalesFromTechsupport

sheckles,84,150,1mvxjr,644,I worked for a relatively small remote tech support company It was kind of a halfscam boiler room telemarketing operation done with the use of encrypted VoIP and online merchant accounts but we provided inbound support for everyone that paid us money and recorded all conversations so we could provide proof of customer satisfaction to the payment gateways in case anyone tried to do a chargeback after receiving support Overall we made sure all existing customers were getting what they paid for and happy with our work and most were Only problem was that since we were avoiding chargebacks like the plague a lot of times we had to do extra stuff for our customers We had to make sure the customer was as happy as possible and that hisher satisfaction was crystal clear over the phoneMost of our customers were some very strange charactersOne in particular was this one woman named Lisa Shes around  Every time she called us she was wasted Most likely we think shes blackout drunk Its possible it could be something else Meth is a close runnerup Anyways we have no idea what shes like soberThis is a small snippet of what usually happens during a call with

babbling incoherently Me uh well give you a call back once the work is doneLisa Wait Listen I want you to sign me up on the facebook I want to start a facebook account Where do I go to get one and is

sure lisa lets get you signed up on ze facebookgoing through process of making facebook profile for her as she starts talking nonsense againMe ok Lisa youre all set with your facebookshe mentions something about her daughter having a facebook and how she hasnt seen her in yearsMe since I start to feel bad for her and also to show her how to navigate around facebook as if shell remember any of this tomorrow Whats your daughters name Well find her on ze facebookWe go to her daughters page and she goes into shock Apparently she has a  year old grandson and shes never seen him before There are tons of photos of this kid on her page She starts crying as Im navigating through all the photosshaquille ofeelBecause I know shell never be able to get pack to this page without my help I save all the pictures into a folder on her desktopShe tells me shell pay me whatever I want to have these pictures made for her and sent to her house She cannot understand that she can do this herself I tell her about FedExKinkos nothingI decided Ive had enough because not only do I feel conflicted about her proposal on one hand I do accept donations and I DID just help this insane person get her first look at her second grandson On the other hand holy shit thats just fucked up that I would take her money for something like this Anyways she was crying and thanking me and asking me to send her these pics She was also flirting with me and asking me if I could send her a picture of me It was getting way too weird at this point so I just hung up the phone I figured there was no way she would do a chargeback after this and if she did thats just something Ill gladly live withSo there you have it kids This is just a tiny fraction of a typical call with her Every moment is exactly like this Did I

PolloMagnifico,85,159,1fd7pe,644,Part httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsfbmztheflyingtechptPart httpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsfbxrltheflyingtechptkungfumanagerNames and events have been changed to protect the innocent And to appear more awesomeAct I In Which the Battle Lines are DrawnLet us not underestimate the love a man feels for his customers Especially the ones who give him money and dont complain To have a customer wrestled from his hands by the likes of those Scoundrels Wastrels Ragamuffins RoguesIt is unfortunate that the man at Worst Purchase who had wronged me so was likely only attempting to do that which was necessary as per the requirements of his no doubt monstrous suitclad overlords Yet such is war Two men may meet on a battlefield with no personal qualm over one another They are but two machines manipulated with the controls of paychecks and commissions from some cruel dictator in the backgroundI had endeavored to let it go I was to allow this infraction from a man I did not know who likely had no understanding of what he had done to pass by me unabated But soon a series of unfortunate events instilled in me the need to take immediate actionOver the course of the next few months I received three computers that came from that citadel of darkness The computers seemingly unrelated all tied together by the simple utterance of two small words Nerd PatrolThose two words made my skin crawl Was I upset for having to handle their incompetence Was I disappointed that people in my industry could fail so completely in their responsibilities Or was I merely jealous that they were on average paid twice as much as I wasAct II In Which Straw is Piled on a CamelThe first of these affronts to the technically competent was a customer who came into my store with her brand new laptop She was unable to access windows I began my much beloved bench diagnostics The system booted to its login The login name was Worst Purchase Passworded Summoning all my available resources and knowledge I was able to heroically crack the password the password was password and was greeted with the software reserved for a floor demo Despite my prowess I could not circumvent this insidious trap Yes not only had these hooligans provided a passworded unusable laptop to my customer but had also charged her for an initial PC setup I informed her that she was to return to the Nerd Patrol as my agent of vengeance and demand a refund for obviously not doing the job that was paid for I did a system wipe and reinstalled windowsThe second of these infractions was a customer with a custom made computer This computer had exactly nothing in it A midrange processor HDD ODD low end video card and two DIMMs at gig each That was not the surprising thing What was surprising was that it also had a basic watercooling system that only covered the processor ran to a radiator and back to the processor Aside from the insignificant airflow coming off the pump there were no fans anywhere in this case So was it any surprise that his computer was overheating Who did this to you I demanded dreading the answer But I knew the response before he even said it Nerd PatrolApparently his machine sat in his bedroom and he wanted it to be quieter so he could sleep at night The solution in the eyes of some quack with more knowledge than common sense was to remove all the fans and install this water cooling system To make matters worse the radiator was caked in dust and the fluid was over  months old No information had been given to him on the maintenance of this particular cooling system I demanded a name but he could not remember it no doubt due to the shock of finding out his s of work was in vain I installed two lowdecibel fans one on the side blowing onto the motherboard and another exhausting through the radiatorAs bad as both of those were nothing could compare to the third one The final straw I will begin explaining this with a single quote from the customer The man at Nerd Patrol told me that McAfee and Web Root both pick up slightly different things so I asked him to install them bothShe had arrived with a computer that would not connect to the internet Leery that it had worked fine before she took it to THE STORE OF LIES and not when she got it back she took it to us for a second opinion During the bench diagnostics I saw what had happened and after inquiring about it I received the above quote This will not stand I confirmed that not only had she paid for both pieces of software but she had also paid to have the Nerd Patrol actually install it for her at the insistence of the sales rep I had her sit around as I uninstalled both programs ran the removal tool for both and installed a free antivirus for her I felt sorry that she had purchased expensive software and the subscription for both of them I didnt charge her gave her my card and told her to come back to us next time she needed anythingIt was onAct III Excuse me sir Can you help meI developed a plan A cunning beautiful plan A plan so ingenious that I cant even remember what it was Because in all actuality the plan was something along the lines of go punch their tech in the dick But then fortune smiled upon meI was tasked with picking up a new HDD from Worst Purchase for a rush job with a corporate client Armed with a friendly smile an unwrinkled polo and a pair of jeans that screamed Im not a damn bit scared to crawl around under a desk I marched towards Worst Purchase On my way in I saw a woman carrying out a laptop displaying the infernal brand of the Nerd Patrol I stopped her merely handed her my card and wished her well I would see this woman later but that is a story for another time I took a deep breath and crossed the threshold into the very heart of villainy I made for the service counter and began to make my inquiriesSir I am looking for a new HDD to replace an old pATA drive on my computer Do you have any I could buy so I dont need to go to Mecca Nerd Mecca is a nearby computer superstore in a warehouse format I personally believe that every nerd is required to make a monthly pilgrimage to this store I was thanked for this with a blank stare I repeated my request and asked if he would please help meUm hold on sir Let me speak to one of my techniciansI heard them planning their nefarious scheme behind closed doors The technician was close to clockout and did not want to assist fearing I would be here for some time and hold him past his scheduled hours He also seemed to have a problem understanding what pATA was and I kept hearing him say Are you sure he didnt say sATA This idiot doesnt know what hes talking about I allowed my smile to fade The technician finally came to the front His name tag reads Techdouche and he is likely ten years my seniorHi Im the head tech You said you need a pATA drive Yes he put emphasis on the head techYes a pATA driveIm not familiar with that   a ribbon cableOh Um I think we have one lets take a look And with that we are away on a whirlwind tour of the most insidious place on earth Like Disney Land if the only attraction were the Its a small world after all ride After trying to sell me on a new PC and me informing him that Im not interested I just need a replacement HDD he finally pulls one off the shelf I think this is a ribbon cable he says turning the product over in his hands I clearly see the box marked as sATA I also take note that its the largest most expensive HDD they have on the shelf This repeats twice more and finally he finds one clearly marked as pATA I smile at the guy and ask the killer question Does this support ATAPIAct IV A Villain DefeatedTechdouches eyes glaze over as he realizes he has no answer to that question At this moment I believe him defeated But alas I was a fool for this was only his first form A change overtakes him A fire burns in his previously glassy soulless eyes He fixates me in his gaze Are you trying to make me look stupid I must admit I was slightly taken aback I had not expected our game of cat and mouse to so quickly dissolve into a direct armed confrontationBut in a game of wits I always pack overwhelming firepower No sir not at all You seem to be doing that just fine on your own Thus began his full on onslaught Though he kept his voice low to avoid spooking the herd he was able to instill the heated rage of ten thousand white hot suns into every word In these situations I tend to tune people out allowing them to fall upon their own sword of vitriol and ignorance This man had gone to college He had been working with computers for over five years He had worked in the IT department of three major corporations I was just some punk kid who didnt know the ass end of a USB portPeople had taken note The citizens were becoming restless Eyes watched cautiously from around lines of overpriced electronics Then I saw my opening He made the fatal mistake of asking Who the hell do you think you areSir I am also a PC technician I have been working with computers for over ten years Today I was looking for a HDD with these specifications to replace a HDD on a server that hosts a corporate firewallThe man stepped back in stunned silence A number of people had gathered around intrigued by the hushed yet angry tones coming from our direction I took the HDD my trophy from my vanquished foe My path to the register took me by the service desk where a customer was sitting awestruck I handed her a generic business card and suggested she might want to give that place a try She nodded quietly I purchased my HDD and returned to my storeThe war was far from over I made no attempt to get the man fired and he didnt seem interested in pursuing the issue He retained his jobBut this battle had been won and the seed of discontent had been planted That seed would grow into a majestic tree over the following yearTLDR Worst Purchase continually makes ingress into my

extra content Want to stay informed about the ebook Sign up for the email listhttpeepurlcomsvxX  I stayed with Sarah for most of the Sunday before I left her in the care of her family again I didnt go home straight away but went by Jeremy I had not spoken with him since the night before He was rather surprised when I showed up at his door he still expected me to be with Sarah or sleeping at home He invited me in and I didnt leave until the early morning we had talked all night I had not slept in  days I was tired but It was eight in the morning on Monday and school was starting soon I went to school while Jeremy went to the store Both of us were dreading it but we had to go I went through the day thinking about everything except what the teachers were trying their hardest to explain One of the tests I made that day must have had dreadful answers It was around four that I could leave and opened up locker to grab my wallet and cell phone I had  texts from JeremyHe told me Ron and Don had been informed by him about everything that happened Rons heart went out more to the notebook than to Sarah Was it really necessary Was the only question he asked that sounded genuine Don quickly intervened though Dont be like that Ill call the girl the see if shes ok He did actually follow up on it and called SarahMy next shift was a Friday again and well I didnt quit I had talked with Jeremy that Sunday night and he was planning on getting back to school again It was quite expensive and he would need another three months of work to have enough saved up to pay for the tuition and other school expenses He had asked me to stay with the shop for at least those three months to keep hit bearable for him some shifts I had been pushing Jeremy for months to go back to school and supported him in every step he had taken towards that goal It didnt feel right to not support him now when he actually had made the decision and the paperwork was filled in already We had compromised that my shifts would be with him It was only three months I could handle it It wasnt Ron amp Dons fault that this happened Was itWhen stepping in the store again after a week of absence it felt strange and uncomfortable  I put my jacket and bag in the back and changed quickly in the store clothing The shift would only take about four hours Jeremy quickly noticed my unease and offered to take care of the store while I would fix the computers in the back I gladly took his offer as it was something he seldom did He felt guilty about making me stayThe next Saturday was a full day and things started taking their usual rhythm again I was surprised about how quickly I picked it all up again I had been in the store for most of the day until we switched places I went to the back and started working on the computers for about  to  minutes before I walked to the cage holding the computer that stored the security footage and UPS It was a quality cage which was strange for a computer store that sold stuff that never should have had passed Quality Control I put my head against it I missed Sarah I wanted to see the footage of that night But I couldnt open the cageI asked Jeremy if he knew the code on the cage but he didnt Ron didnt share it with anyone not even Don knew I asked Ron if I could see the footage but he told me it was already deleted by now I knew it wasnt true He had boasted to the police agents who had come to collect the video evidence of Alex that he kept  months worth of footage He never lied about stuff like thatRon and Don had the meantime had become silent again and started withdrawing from the store again They would hire new personnel in the coming weeks You better do because the both of us are leaving as soon as we can have fun running the store with just the two of you was what I mumbled under my breath while walking away from them I wanted outhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvFjVSHjHvHkIt wasnt until three weeks later that I realised there were still other people that could know the codes Frank amp Richard I still had their phone numbers and called them I tried Richard first He didnt pick up I got a computer voice telling me it was a disconnected phone line I tried Frank The phone rang once twice three times it went to Voicemail I ended the call and threw my phone on the desk and smashed my head on my desk I stayed like that for a couple of minutesThe desk started vibrating The phone was ringing It was Frank calling back He was doing well and was very talkative I told him my story He was silent Despite the fact that Frank amp Richard could do questionable things they were still human and humane Frank told me he didnt knew the code either I was ready to give up asking nicely and blow the damn thing up when he continued but I know where it is likely to be kept He told me all about the second safe in Dons office It was hidden from sight in one of the cabinets along the walls It wasnt much of a safe really one of those cheap hotel safes He gave me the code and wished me luck With the code in my hand I went to the office of Don and opened the cabinet I had left the lights off on purpose though it made me feel even more on edge I tried the code on the safe and was surprised when it actually unlocked I tried took out the content It was a big stack of randomly sorted papersThe papers were mostly manuals warranties and invoices It took me a few minutes to sort through it before I found the manual for the digital lock on the cage The code was written on the back  I walked to the cage and tried the code The cage opened I was in I hit the power button from the monitor and moved the mouse around A windows XP login screen popped up I was prepared for that and started looking through the papers the password and login were on another sheet poorly written It took a few attempts before getting the password rightIt took me a while before I understood how the software worked and where the footage was located When I found it I watched it again and again It didnt make things easier for me as I had hoped The footage was hard to watch It was only one minute and twentysix seconds worth of footage Was that all it took to destroy someones sense of securityI closed the window and started looking around on the computer some more It only had the security video software installed on the system What caught my eye was the fact that there was a shortcut for remote desktop on the desktop I clicked it and it opened with the last used address It connected It was a Windows Server  and it was asking me for credentialsI was having a moral problem now I had seen what I had come for Would it be ok for me to also log in on this remote server I decided to try on log in It was hard for me to find the credentials and after trying the th set I decided to give up I went through the stack of papers again when I noticed random letters written on the edges of a page I tried that as password I was inI started looking around the server but it looked clean to me No out of the ordinary software installed or strange files on the desktop I wasnt familiar with the server editions of windows and went through the list of server specific applications DHCP Active Directory Routing and RAS Nothing of particular interest I didnt know what this server was for I decided I didnt want to know I closed the connection and logged myself out of the physical computerI was ready to close the cage when my eye fell on the UPS again Why does he keep that around It doesnt even work And locked in the cage I took a closer look and leaned over I lost my balance and landed on the UPS with my body The unit shifted I saw it had a network cable attached to it I pulled the UPS out of the cage making sure I didnt disconnect any of the cablesOnce out I tried to look in to the openings in the casing but didnt see much I put my ear to it I heard the rattling of hard disks This wasnt a UPS anymore It was a computer I put the UPS back in again and reconnected to the server Something wasnt right here I wanted to find out If they were doing something illegal I wanted to knowI started looking through the computer again While going through every program down the list It was then and there that I saw it This could be the key to understanding this strange setup,Chapter   When things fall apart Pt ,1094,TalesFromTechsupport

ithttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsrcyhowamanagersunkeverfurtherintoquicksand  Now read on      So I had time and quite a lack of supervision and access to both the government mainframe and its completely unregulated unsecured macro language I was also bored and looking for things which could be improved So I build  a macro which ran through all the government benefitissuing and reviewing interviews which were scheduled to be performed at the office in the upcoming week and would make notes where the interview had been canceled or rescheduled or otherwise moved out of its original timeslot Originally these slots werent checked by anyone until an hour or so beforehand and even then only by the interviewer so they could find themselves with a very patchy workday instead of the neat set of interviews theyd been expecting to use as an excuse to pass off their backoffice paperwork to someone elseOnly around  of interviewees actually turned up to their original times as it transpired Which meant it was taking around three days to do two days work and more to the point members of the public who actually wanted interviews in order to get their government entitlements before they starved to death were being booked in timeslots weeks awayI solved this by having the macro identify all the spare timeslots in advance phoning up the people whod been booked more than a week away and asking if theyd like to be fasttracked to a closer timeslot  like tomorrow or even today All of a sudden the time blowout on interviews is cut by a third interview days are more predictable and interviewees are happier because theyve been fasttracked Stress drops stats soar I write up the process pass it off to the section booking the interviews and build      a macro which speeds up the data entry of manually issued benefit checks Previously each one was punched into a set of slowtoupdate mainframe screens and then literally  got rejected three days later and had to be redone because the figures didnt match up My check reconciliation macro took all the check data for ALL of the checks at once compared it to the relevant records on the system and then entered it automatically Check rejection by the audit systems dropped to  overnight and I no longer had to spend hours every day slowly moving through the same workflow over and over Which meant I had time to build      a set of simple forms I could print out and attach to physical files which had been sent to us accidentally Such things were a problem as many of the files which turned up in the interoffice bag each morning had been sent by people at other offices who were unfamiliar with the actual rules and policies governing when to send a file and when not to The forms I created looked official and quoted the appropriate policies and their references and got attached to the front of the files which were sent right back to where they came from or where they were supposed to be  I combined this with a program which scoured the  customer records for our region and identified discrepancies between where a file should be according to policy and where it actually was This led to me purging the file stacks of an awful lot of files which we shouldnt have had at our site thus making it easier for the rest of the staff to find something in the archives when they had to go hunting I also used the opportunity to realphabetize the archives properly  noone had done that in twenty years and it gave me something to do when I didnt want to be sitting at a desk staring off into space And when I got bored with that I sat down and proceeded to build      a game of Arkanoid on the mainframe so Id have something to play with that would at least look like I was doing something with the keyboard if anyone glanced my way I mean hell Id automated everything else  Now while all this was happening someone in Head Office had decided to set up an Innovation and Improvements team Youd email them an idea for making things run better or faster or cheaper and theyd enter it in a publicly accessible database pass the idea on to whichever manager or executive was the lowest level with the authority to approve it and theoretically update the database eventually with a YeaNayMaybe as to whether it had been implementedI had a lot of free time and a lot of imagination and it wasnt hard to work my way to the top of the national list of contributors to said list I was also looking for a way to enormously piss off my office manager in a way he couldnt possibly retalitate to and I soon hatched a devious plan which would take me all the way to the CEOs office      but thats a story for another time  tldr Robots and aliens and robot aliens  INDEX EDIT  Next

Rhywden,119,113,1r99ob,632,This is another story from back when I was one of the admins for a mediumsized students dormitory  connected clientsPhysical layout consisted of  houses connected by fiber with every house sporting several Netgear managed switches thus providing  Mbit connections So one evening I was sitting in my room and reading when someone knocked on my door Internet is downFirst thing to check Local issue Tried connecting to the router remotely  no dice Not only is the Internet down but the whole network Went over to the server room and logged in locally and discovered that the router was alive and kicking also the uplink was fine but the connection to our network was borked Around that time a fellow admin showed up who forgot more about networking than Ill ever learnHowever he too failed to spot an immediate source of this error Uplink  fine No errors in the logs Blinkenlights on the switches in the server room are indeed blinking and showing not only connected ports but also active onesWe tried several things over the course of the next hour but did not find anything TCPdump didnt show any incoming traffic on our network facing cardUntil by pure chance or maybe desperation we rebooted the switches Because the network suddenly came to life again and ground to a halt mere seconds laterOkay time for another reset this time with TCPdump to watch whats happening And thats when we saw it A TCP packet which consisted entirely of zeros yes even the leading bytes which should include stuff like source and target port and just one single xF somewhere And it flooded the network for the short time it workedWe then worked out what had obviously happened Some computer in our network broadcasted those malformed packets which in turn caused our switches to freeze in such a state that they appeared to still be working I kid you not if you didnt watch them closely youd notice nothing  it was just that the pattern of blinking and steady lights didnt change over time as it usually would in a live networkThe solution was to pull out all the cables and connect them one by one until the switch failed again That way we discovered the culprit  who wasnt home at the time of course He later told us that he came home to discover that his PC which he had left on to complete a slow and huge download had bluescreened which obviously didnt agree with his NIC which then decided to retaliate against the cruel world in the only way it could,The TCP packet of death,745,TalesFromTechsupport

against the evil Worst PurchaseDuring the battle our intrepid hero managed to obtain an outdated HDD for his secret weapon  an old firewall with enough power to protect an entire networkYelled at by an unskilled technician he raced back to his store in his car custodian of the hardware that would eventually bring freedom to his entire careerCheck IthttpstarwarscomplayonlineactivitiescrawlcreatorcsrxzdmdcarwAct I Our Hero ReturnsI returned to my store with the device cradled in my arms like a newborn child and hand it off to KungFu Manager Many Bothans died to bring you this HDDMy manager turned to face me PolloMagnifico come sit downMy heart leapt into my throat As I have mentioned before KungFu Manager and I were on pretty friendly terms Even then he was still my boss and I was still his employee We had an unspoken agreement that when it was necessary we would shift back into that relationship deal with the official business that needed to be dealt with and shift right back into our friendship with no hurt feelings I had been spoken to on several different occasions at the behest of the company owner It always started out with him asking me to come sit down This would not be goodSo I talked to the boss about your raiseSo far so goodAnd he said that if youre going to get a raise then you need to start doing a little more I talked him into adding you to my contractWait whatSo tomorrow I want you to show up to at the DreamKiller Offices and help me install this firewall and meet some of the peopleThis this is finally happeningAct II FBIs most wantedBusiness slowly began to improve The store which was being funded by the parent company was on the verge of turning a profit for the first time Many of the new customers were former NerdPatrol customers who through word of mouth or sheer dumb luck had found their way to our door I had been given an admin account some training for exchange and active directory and a crash course on the network topography for the three DreamKiller offices I was officially doing helpdesk And it was boringWhile yes technically I was doing helpdesk now I was not given enough access to the important things Things like the PBX server Or the inventory Or the firewall Or really anything except active directory and exchange So my abilities were basically limited to password resets account creation and escalation Doesnt matter had techEnter the rich kid His parents were doctors He was probably  or  and was the poster child for every nerd who still lives with his parents Quiet stuttering lanky pizza faced He puts his very expensive custom made computer up on the desk and tells me hes got a problem This is the story according to himHe was spending his day doing the normal manchild computer thing when he decided he wanted to hack into some lowsecurity systems He said he does this all the time but THIS time he got caught The FBI hacked him back and installed a virus on his computer demanding he pay a fine within  hours or they would come knocking on his door Remember this particular story its relevant for the entirety of the rest of this recollectionI inform the kid that no thats not what happened I dont even need to boot up the system to know that the FBI would not demand you pay a fine for hacking They would come to your door and kindly escort you to the nearest holding facility where you would be given three hots and a cot until someone paid your bail So I boot up the system and confirm that the kid does in fact have a virus claiming to be an FBI virus and demanding he pay a fine of  The virus comes complete with an official FBI watermark and even has a place ready to input the credit card numberI tell the kid that I can get the virus off for our usual fee which is more than the cost of the fine Kid doesnt want it he would rather pay the fine I inform him that its just a regular virus and if he puts his credit card in there hes going to wind up with  additional problems and a bitch still wont be oneFinally he relents and I remove the virus When he comes back in the next day I give him my normal talk about being careful where you go on the internet this is your new antivirus and other general safety tips But when I mention downloads he dismissively says I never download anythingDude You have complete manga scans downloaded and saved in a file on your desktop Dont BS me But whatever I send him on his wayAct III Again dude ReallyTime clicks forward another month Ive settled into my role as helpdesk and have even learned a few tricks to keep from escalating everything Kid returns with another virus I clear it off for him and when Im done we have a short discussion about some of the games I saw on his desktop that I had recently been working my way through as well That leads to this gemHey since youve got it do you know why I cant play graphics intensive game at full graphicsI hook up the computer and get into the hardware managerI inform him nicely that he has a pretty shitty computer and the graphics card isnt very good either His response is that the computer was very expensive and new and actually had a pretty good graphics card in itNicely again I tell him that my computer at home which cost me  to build was at least twice as powerful as his and it still had problems hitting max graphics for this particular game But but but I have six gigs of memory Yeah but you have a dual core processor and a discount graphics card Seriously I dont even think they make this anymore Once again kid leavesAct IV The third times the charmNow were getting to the good part Flash forward another half a month Things are going quite well now until this kid walks into my door I nod to KungFu Manager Theres the guy that keeps calling asking questions that dont make any sense Why dont you go deal with himKungFu Manager Obliges I sit outside the door and listen The first thing the kid says is I think someone is hacking meKungFu Manager stammers for a second and finally responds whatI keep getting viruses even though I never download things I think Im being targeted by a hacker who keeps putting viruses on my computerKungFu Manager calmly explains to him that its not extremely likely that hes being targeted by a hacker as it doesnt fit with a typical hacker MO But regardless he would be happy to take a look at it Oh and viruses again KungFu Manager takes it in we remove the viruses and he goes over the firewall looking for open ports and a few other things hes far better at security than I am and cant find anything to indicate a problem While were doing this Im telling him about the previous two times the kid had been in and how you would think someone who supposedly hacks well enough for the FBI to take notice would know how to keep his system secure We decide to have a little fun with himWe hold his computer for a little over a week When he comes to pick up his system we look him dead in the eye and say the followingWe found some very interesting things on your computer You had several open ports and your local DHCP was configured to reroute all of your internet queries to a server in china through a network of proxies It was very hard to trace so we called in an FBI computer forensics specialist to help us He did some digging and found an extremely sophisticated virus that had infected your BIOS which is why the format didnt get rid of it He traced it back to a known server exclusively utilized by the Chinese military for spying on American systems He believes that you were originally a primary node in a chain of proxies used in a recent attack on the pentagon Your computer was confiscated as evidence in an ongoing investigation into that particular attack and he wanted us to thank you for being a good American CitizenKid was absolutely devastated He looked at us like he was about to cry and said ReallyWe place his computer on top of the counterNo we didnt find anything wrong with your computer aside from the virus Heres a list of places that we know are clean to get your manga from instead of using rapidshare If youre really worried about being hacked call your ISP and ask them to change your external IP address Have a nice day whats an IP addressfacepalmTLDR Had fun at some poor kids expense because he lived in a fantasy world where he was an elite

trn,75,136,1oknha,615,My last set of stories didnt get me downvoted into oblivion so I would like to share a couple more  Granted the stories I shared last week were true gems but there are a series of honorable mentions which I shall recount directlyThe EntityOne of our employees brought his computer in  It was of the notorious EMachines breed  Anyone who has worked on one knows that they are simply the worst computers sold at our fine establishment  Employee complained of fans dying overheating unexpected shutoffs  Wanted free service naturally  Thinking the problem was electrical I whip out the multimeter and pop the case  Powered computer on  STENCH  I powered through the smell and tested fan leads  V  Computer warms up over  or  minutes as I wait for a failure  No such failure  I see what appears to be a dense dust bunny in the bottom corner of the computer and suggest that we clean with compressed air  Upon further inspection the mass appears solid  Human nature takes over  I grab my screwdriver  poke  Ball turns from a ball into a writhing mass of insects  Ball disintegrates into what seemed like hundreds of little bugs scattering to cover the circuitry of the motherboard  Some are zapped when they become the path of least resistance  Computer becomes one big NOPE  We close the computer and entomb it in plastic wrap  Employee experiences eternal shame and never picks the computer up  It stayed on our shelves for months until policy allowed us to dispose of the unitLittle Head of HouseholdCirca PS heyday back when we handled all returns not just computers  Mother and child approach counter with a Playstation   Unit wont power on PSs are currently repair items that need to ship to a depot  One of the guys explains this  Because there is strength in numbers I walk over and tell her the same thing in different verbiage The mother understands and prepares to hand the paperwork over to us  Strike up conversation with the annoyed boy couldnt have been more than   I ask him what his favorite game is  GTA   I Laugh  Hes too young to be playing it  Humorchallenge him by asking what his favorite mission is  I dont do missions  I like running over hookers  Im astounded  Im waiting for mom to intervene  No such intervention  I need my game from the CD drive  Sure enough its GTA  Attempt to give the game to mom  Its mine  Child snatches it from my hand  Mom gingerly hands over paperwork and child performs the most insane thing Ive ever seen from a prepubescent  Im literally pausing for emphasis  Ready  Seriously ready  Child reaches up grabs mother by the CHIN  Pulls her down to his level and says with all of the seriousness of a serial killer  We will not be sending this off  We will be buying a new one  Looks mother dead in the eye  I mean just some straight up gangsta sht  Mother calmly waits for child to release her looks at us and says  Well just buy another one  Child and mother walk off  Read that series of sentences again  Ill wait  We were all disturbed  I know my mother would have inserted that GTA CD into my anus had I even attempted something like that then she would have slapped the teeth out of my mouth and then forced me to eat the PS  That was in  I can imagine where that kid is now  Hopefully in a supermax penitentiaryThe Chemistry LessonIt is a well known fact that waiting for a depot repair sucks  It takes weeks and half of the time your item isnt fixed because well depot repair guys care more about leaving at pm than fixing the things they fix  So for some nice customers we would ensure that the item being sent to the depot was unrepairable  Cue the DC Generator  Originally slated for supplying v DC to components for testing it led a double life as an assassin  Two seconds when connected across capacitors and such led to the release of that acrid magic smoke and the impending disposal of the host product by the depot team ensuring a replacement unit was in order  The electrical assassin was also used for fun  Frying circuit boards was a favored pasttime of bored employees  My coworker and I were partaking in said activity when we decided to see how badly we could burn out a PCI modem  After many minutes of frying components and spraying capacitor liquid onto the wall we employed our second favorite item into the mix compressed air  Not psi of air canned air  When held upside down a freezing stream of chemical is ejected and can even cause frostbite on bare skin  Its perfect for cooling down burning components right   a spray can later and its subsequent sublimation into a gas we cause a chip to arc and burn in an ember of awesomeness  The chemical in the canned air reached an ignitable fuelair mixture  And did it ever ignite  WHOMP  The entire table becomes engulfed in flames igniting the arms of my coworker and creating copious amounts of ozone  Customer on the other end of the department leans across the counter to enjoy the festivities  Coworker runs around the bench with flaming arm hair  I could only imagine Danger Will Ronbinson as he robotically attempted to wave off the fire  Entire department smells like burnt hair and spent chemicals  In the ultimate act of cowardice I conveniently notice that its time for me to clock out and I disappear from the premises knowing that I was probably going to get fired  I didnt and the accident became legend   years later I still catch crap for my exit stage right maneuver from my buddyvictim  ,My Classics Part Deux,751,TalesFromTechsupport

munky,136,165,yh2r4,615,I goto a customers site because their tape drive is basically pooched I took this server down and basically Im checking bios and post bios ctrlc type windows Stupid ibm servers take a billion years to boot up and then only give you  seconds to press any of these buttons Naturally I need to hit these immediately Now this building has  businesses and they are both customers The customer which I wasnt there for comes to me in the server room and is like I have a problem come fix it Im ask whats the problem She says Wifi is down and I pull out my phone and I have even connected to their wifi I surf to google Wifi is definitely up So I ask who is having problems She says no one its the laptop that nobody uses that cant get on wifi Im sure she saw me roll my eyes but i say Well this server is down so at least  people arent working at the moment and I need to get it back up running Then shes like This is very important and I think its your fault its down I say Well I cant drop what Im doing right now but soon as I can Shes says So youre not going to fix it now and I just say no Which she storms off and clearly is extremely mad Other customer walks over to me and says You know shes going to just call your boss immediately and I nodded That person then immediately sends an email to my boss explaining what happened which was extremely thorough Like  mins later I got to a point where I could walk away for a moment I hook this laptop up to the wifi and that was that and I go back to checking out the server Like half an hour later Im done the server and Im just standing in the lobby talking This woman comes back downstairs and sees im just standing around She gets even more mad and starts chewing me out and I just raise my hand like stop and she stops and I say I already joined the laptop to the wifi and the problem is fixed She then gestures to have me walk away with her and I follow to where nobody is around to hear us She says I understand that a server is down but those people dont matter Im more important and should get highest priority However you see what happened there right I called your boss and you immediately fixed my problem thats way it should beIn reality she called my boss and he didnt answer his phone because he saw caller id and she kept calling over and over and eventually went to my desktop support guy who basically was told that wifi was down and he said we wouldnt be able to fix it until we got over there anyway so she just has to wait until he can get someone on site He didnt know where I was Shes like Tell munky to go fix it immediately and he just said I dont know where he is and she hung up on himMy boss didnt even need our sides of the story he just read the email from another customer and gave her a call to set expectations and apparently she broke out crying again,Those people dont matter Im more important,780,TalesFromTechsupport
Hypnotoad,115,112,1m1gqq,621,A couple weeks ago I set up a new scanner for one of our Customer Service reps  She had paperwork from the client that asked for dpi so I set it to scan to that  She was also scanning small cards so I set it to just scan the card and ignore the whitespace around the cardFlash forward to last Friday  She had asked me several times as I was walking to another support case how she could send the  version to the client instead of the  version or how she could send the actual size to the client  When I stopped down there she showed me the scan she wanted to send  It scanned into adobe acrobat and then zoomed in on the file to fit it to the screen  She went up to the zoom settings typed in  and then saved the file but when she reopened it it still zoomed in to   I spent at least  minutes trying to explain to her that this setting was zoom and it only affected how the file was displayed on her monitor not the actual file  I even pulled out a magnifying glass and held it up to a card on her desk and told her this is how were looking at the file now but its not changing the actual file  It didnt stick she kept asking me how she could send the  version to the client  I even pulled up some of her old scans showed her how the computer had zoomed way out on those because they had a bunch of whitespace around the image but shown at actual size the cards were the same size as her new scansShe seemed to finally accept that this was the way she was going to have to send the images but I could tell that she didnt understand it at all  This is the same lady who keeps bringing me in stuff that she found at home and even on the street thinking it might be useful to me,How do I send the  version,733,TalesFromTechsupport

cobysev,103,121,wkrfz,592,I work for the US Air Force as an IT administrator  Now Ive noticed that most of the posts here are concerning idiotic customers you all have had to deal with and for the most part my submissions have been on a similar topic  However It dawned on me today that this group is called Tales from Tech Support and not Idiotic Customers from Tech Support so I thought Id branch away from the usual storytelling  Since being in the military puts me in a unique perspective from a lot of you Ive decided to tell you about an dramatic experience I once had while deployedIt was  and I was deployed to a base called Kirkuk in Iraq  The base was a joint Army and Air Force base  We had two separate networks set up for the two services since both had their own rules for governing their networks  However at some point some highranking Army General demanded an account on our network so he could access our resources  Then he decided his aides needed to have access as well  Then his whole office needed access  Somehow more and more Army guys got accounts set up on our network until it eventually became the standard that all Army personnel gets an Army and Air Force network accountNow I would like to point out that the Army is a little more lax than us Air Force when it comes to network administration  Wed get calls all the time from Army personnel complaining that they were blocked from certain websites that worked fine on their network  They would complain that they cant check out their Facebook or Gmail from work  The rule we generally go by is this if it isnt workrelated then theres no reason to unblock it  This not only promotes a professional work environment but it also ensures that people dont access malicious websites and expose our network to hackingviruses etcBlocked websites werent the only problems I had to deal with concerning Army personnel  It was like these guys had absolutely no network training at all  We had to enable port security on all our routers switches and a USB lockdown on all PCs because they would just walk in with a personal flash drive or laptop and just plug them into the network  Talk about a huge vulnerability  This of course meant that any time they fiddled with any of their cables wed have to head over to their side of base and reenable them locallyAny given day our ticket log was over  Army problems  We would practically be out of a job if they werent on our network  One of our head civilians in my office was actually fighting to get their Air Force accounts revoked  Let their own IT guys deal with their problems hed sayOkay enough ranting on with the storyOne particularly hot  degree day I got a call from an Army office  One of their computers had stopped running  I heaved a sigh and drove over to the Army side of base to track down their office  The office was just a small wood and sheet metal shack  My boss later informed me that it used to be our office before we moved to the Air Force side of base  The Army used it as a type of supply depot  There were only three Army guys here who inventoried and accounted for all the Army supplies  One of them greeted me and led me over to his computerIt wont turn on  I tipped it and some sand pours out of the back vent  This is a common issue in the desert  Sand gets everywhere  So I shook it out as best I can and then remove the side panel to blow out the insides and check for damageDamn I forgot a can of compressed air  I thought there was one in the truck I came in though  I went out to the truck and started rummaging through the toolbox in the backThe next thing I knew I was lying on my back with a ringing in my ears  It takes my eyes a moment to focus before I realize Im staring up at the sky  I tried to get up and found that my head was spinning and my body achedWhen I got my bearings again I realized that the shack I was in a moment ago had a chunk of roof missing and one of the walls was blown off  A mortar had landed right next to it  My truck was a little ways away so I was just stunned by the blast  I did a spot check on myself  No holes no blood  No searing pain just a dull ache all over like I had just finished an intense workout  I looked up to see people from a nearby building rushing toward the shack  I made an effort to walk over there myselfThe shack was relatively small  Two of the Army guys died instantly  The guy I was helping was still alive but missing an arm and parts of his legs  He was slipping in and out of consciousness and didnt seem to know whats going on  I wanted to help but I was still dizzy and it was an effort to keep my footing  There were already people standing over him trying to stop the bleedingA few minutes later there was an ambulance and fire truck there  Theres no fire but the Fire Dawgs ran around securing parts of the shack that might collapse  EMTs are getting my wounded customer onto a stretcher and then off to the hospital  A few hours later he died in the ER  I went to the hospital to get checked out and they just said I had a very minor concussion  They gave me the rest of the day off and sent me back to work the next dayAt Kirkuk the AntiAmerican groups offbase would try to scare us away by shooting mortars at the base once or twice a week  They never really aimed for anything they just pointed a mortar at the base set a really long timer then ran away  By the time it went off theyd be long gone  Most of the base was just open empty space but every now and then theyd get lucky and actually hit something  This was one of those unfortunate daysLate that night there was a sendoff ceremony for the deceased  Close to  military people showed up including me  We lined up silently on the dark flight line and rendered the slow salute as the caskets were carried onto the plane destined for home  I made sure to attended every sendoff ceremony after that regardless of what hour of the night it was heldTLDR  Provided IT

this is not techsupport related yet but kinda importantNow this bar was a dive and a failure It tried to be hip but it failed Failed on an epic scale I did not think possibleThe owner was a guy mid s His exwife wanted the bar and he cosigned the lease Some months later the women took all the money and skipped town So now he was stuck with a bar and two choices close it down and pay for the lease the next  years  or keep it open to recupriate some of the lossesFew more details neededAbove the bar were rooms for rent They were reasonably priced One of those in the rd floor was sort of an office aka a bed and an old PCThe music we played in this bar came from an Toshiba Vista NotebookSo I ended up working there I wont bore you with all the crappy stuff that happened there lets just fast forward to my last day I worked thereBoss came in and told me to follow him in the kitchen There a package from an internet provider was lying around as well as a new modemrouter AVM FritzBox with a few cables attached He proceeded to tell me that he ordered internet and asked if I could set it up so it can be used in the office since he knew I was interested in stuff like that he tried already but couldnt get it to workI told him that it will be hard since I diddnt think the wifi would get up that high and that he would in all likely hood need to get a wifi repeater for   eur so it would workBut for now I of course said yes I can and will set up the internet He took a beer and went outsideThis was around pm in the afternoon on a weekday no other customers and experience told me there wouldnt be any for hours and if there would be they would not cause much workSo I proceeded to look at the FritzBox which was hooked up It was all wrong so I reattached it correctly so it would get DSL and the phone would keep working when the boss came back and asked me what I was doingM setting up the internetH what who told you to do that now what if a customer comes in he was pretty anal about not slacking smokingsittingeatingdrinkingdoing anything besides standing at attention behind the barM well I assumedH no stop itSo I stopped thinking yeah he will leave soon then I can continueAnd he did Still I had no customers so I went back to work set up the FritzBox connected it to the music laptop per wifi gave it the providers info and had internet the next few hours no customers the laptop was busy getting updates and more updatesIn that time I set up a second box I found lying around in the box as a wifi repeaterAt around midnight I closed down the bar since I did not have a single customer the whole day I installed the wifi repeater in the nd story of the building and went to the office wifi was available I set up the computer and again lots of updatesI wrote down all the stuff I did and why the ip adresses the passwords put it with the bar related paper that we had to do every evening and went home It was amAt am I woke to the frantic ringing of my cellphone It was my boss demanding to know why I would write I worked until am when I closed the bar at midnight I told hom because I set up the wifi for his office even saving him  eur becauHe interrupted me demanding to know who ever said me that I would be getting payed for setting up the internetThat was the last straw All time slowed down I had to take so much crap in the last year from this unimportant ignorant posing penny pincher and there was only one thing I ever could doM Listen If you even THINK that you MIGHT find someone else stupid enough to set up your internet save you bucks by hacking a router to serve as a repeater and update your two computers for  eur my hourly rate  midnight to am I will come to the bar immediately rip out all the cables reset all the boxes and delete all the updates and give you your money backImmediately he tried to backpaddle well stammer it wasnt ment like that just  you know  we dont have money  I diddnt know M yeah rightH still I did not say I would pay you for it but its ok keep the money we will talk about this at your next shift in  days byeM I turned around thinking about my life this job and that idiot until I fell asleep again When I woke up and after the mourning routine I went there gave him his key back and told him I will not be coming to work in  days or ever again I quitProbably one of the best decisions in my life No  months later I had moved away and a better paying job with the best boss ever in IT where I am still todayI saw this guy at christmas again when  friends forced me to go to that bar since every other one was closed for the night already He had trouble with his laptop and asked if I could have a look I supressed my laughter turned to him and told him about our hourly rate and if he would be ok with that I will be happy to look at his problem tomorrow when I am sober He did not call me the next day And I was not sad about that Not even a bittldr  EUR is too much for setting up dsl wifi repeater and updating  pcs  according to some,who said i am going to pay you for that,771,TalesFromTechsupport

dotcom crash and was close to bankrupcy They did not have those parts on hand and had to order them Which took time And the angry printer called in Three to four times a day angrier and angrier to the extent that we all feared any kind of call with his regional code Other people who called in started to wonder why we exhailed with such relief when they brought up normal issuesTwo weeks after the initial report I got angry printer on a call The translation will not do his fury full justice but I will try againMe cringing in fear ISP supportAngry printer I am sorry for what I have to do now You

throwaway,52,126,vxjsp,569,I work for a software company with support centers in the United States that has begun outsourcing more and more of our phone and online tech support to India as is the custom  Entire departments have been hit with the axe on occasion over the past few years in lockstep with increased outsourcing support contracts in Asia  Its a thing people think about on occasion especially with mortgages and the other trappings of modern life in mind  Last year as part of what seemed to be a big initiative to get everyone pumped up about the work we do for our customers a series of tall cardboard cutouts were installed in welltraveled corridors representing customers holding up letters talking about how much our software helped them  Development had cutouts where the letters apparently real were about how their data had been saved or problem X had been solved by the program etc  Marketing presumably got cutouts with letters from stores talking about what a mitzvah the products had been to their bottom line etc  Technical support  got cut outs with customer letters describing amazing technical support experiences they had received  Not bad right  To paraphrase the general format I had a problem and Tech Support was able to get me up and running quickly and it was a very positive experience  Cool good to hear except  in each instance they called out the name of the tech support agent who had provided this amazing experience  Sriharsha and other very Indian names were always the agents who had been so great  Now Im happy for them  Our outsourced tech support folks do a good job and were all in this together and so on but  when you have a domestic call center full of concerned employees and you put up a bunch of displays that talk about how great the outsourced support agents are it sounds kind of like you may be sending some sort of message  Stress level in the office slowly increasing,Our company has passively aggressive demotivator cutouts staring at us each day,695,TalesFromTechsupport

dalgeek,79,105,124uj8,566,I used to do consulting for a company with rather paranoid management and most of that paranoia focused on the IT department  IT was the magical place where bits were arranged but no one understood how and since the CEO was a bit of a sleazebag himself he assumed that anyone doing something he didnt understand could not be trusted  Since I was the consultant I was often approached to deal with things with an outsiders perspective because I wasnt caught up in the daytoday politicsOne day the assistant to the COO comes running to me about a potential security breach and describes someone trying to hack into a computer  Its a typical hitandrun giving me just enough details to think WTF and leaving me to figure out the rest   I hit up the help desk guys who had been dealing with the situation already the initial complaint was erratic mouse behavior so they replaced the wireless mouse with a wired mouse  That didnt fix it so they did full virus spyware rootkit scans to no avail  However to upper management erratic mouse behavior is a clear sign that someone is hxring your company and stealing your dataz  Hey the CEO configured a switch once he knows these thingsThe whole hacking idea gets upper management spun up and they task me with locating a suspected mole in the company who they think is funneling customer data to the competition  Funny they ask me this since the guy they want me to investigate is one of my hires maybe they forgot  Anyway the mouse situation is on the back burner in my mind while I start digging into SQL and VPN logs looking for anything unusual  As Im neck deep in SQL audit logs one of the helpdesk guys runs over and says Hey its doing it again come lookI walk over to the vacant workstation and sure enough the mouse cursor is wandering around the screen  Its at a locked log in screen and the movement doesnt coincide with any elements on the screen so it definitely did not look purposeful  I stand up and look around noticing that the girl sitting across from the cubicle with the possessed mouse was vigorously editing spreadsheets clicking all over the place  Hey J move your mouse to the left  She moves her mouse to the left the mouse on the screen jitters to the left  I peek behind the computer and find that the help desk guys had left the wireless receiver plugged in after they replaced the mouse  Why Because the keyboard needed the receiver  And everyone in the area had the same  Logitech KeyboardMouse comboUnfortunately the avalanche that was started with the hacked mouse cursor had already broken away from the top of the mountain and was picking up speed  The DBA who was being investigated opened his mouth to the COO about something that set off the lawyers who were already on edge over the data breach so they fired him  And anyone who worked with him had drinks with him or said Hi in the hallway more than once a week  All told  people in IT were canned within the week  The only people left were the IT manager a handful of developers the help desk guys and one network adminThe most ironic part  The data breach was not perpetrated by the DBA or anyone else in IT with highlevel system access  Why would a bunch of people making near six figures risk getting fired or arrested  Nope it was the hour sales drones who were screenscraping customer data as they went through accounts and emailing it to their former coworkers who now worked for the competition the email trail was found later  There was some poetic justice though the company was being sued left and right for various reasons and they fired all of the technical people who could have bailed them outTLDR   hacker mouse starts avalanche of paranoia which culminates in  good IT employees getting fired while the sales drones who actually were stealing data are left unscathed,The mouse that roared and killed the IT department,671,TalesFromTechsupport

than the weekend we were summoned and told that the central building in HQ was rejuggling the internal locations of all its teams for whatever arcane reasons had drifted down from the politicosphere This meant that volunteers were being sought to perform the physical breakdown relocation and reassembly of approximately a thousand PCs across many floors of government offices over the course of a single weekend  Hell no  and volunteers would get double overtime bonuses  Hell yes    And so it was that I found myself and four other penniless bastards strapping volunteers walking into the workplace on a Saturday morning for a rundown on which computers in which locations were being moved to what desks on other floors where This was not so much a problem in the cases where the move was taking place on the same building floor and both sides of the floor were accessible from each other instead of there being a wall in the way even when the layout was somewhat mazelike Break the PC down into components wrap the cables tote the PC and CRT monitor of course to the other side of the building plunk on desk reassemble and remember to plug the network cable back in  We got started with these in order to warm up and because it was easy to keep track of each other  just yell across the floor And it wasnt too hard  the most annoying bit was lugging a desktop case and  glass tube in one go while trying to make sure none of the accessories got dropped along the way while making sure everything got to the right desk some of which were not labeled  So far so good We got through about  of the workload by lunchtime and considered ourselves on track  Then came everything else      It turns out that it takes a significantly longer time to stump across a floormaze with a doublearmful of IT kit juggle it in order to press the elevator button wait for the elevator juggle the kit again to press the floor button ride the elevator trudge across the other floor dump the gear and reconnect it and then walk all the way back We started to fall behind schedule By the end of the day wed done perhaps  of the total moves and were a bit discouraged We made our ways home thinking about what wed need to do tomorrow  Sunday we arrived back in the office and one of our compadres had had an Idea Hed found some goods trolleys in the maintenance department and uh borrowed them They werent anything fancy just giant skateboards with long handles on but you could fit maybe three four computers on them at a time Surely with this increase in productivity we could transport everything so efficiently wed be done by lunch      yeah      Lunch rolled around and we were still only about twothirds complete We were also slowing because wed been leaving the longest hauls for last and these were taking more and more time We werent going to make it  And then someone found the tubs  The plastic storagetransport tubs were apparently used at one point to transport large amounts of physical mail around the building These things were about three feet high about the same across and nearly six long If youve seen large plastic storage tubs you know what Im talking about We saw them and instantly realised that there might be a chance to make this work after all One blatant theft borrowing of the tubs later our new PC transportation regime went like this   Everyone showed up to the source location for a move We then proceeded to rip the PCs apart like we were looking for gold coins in the wreckage   The base units and monitors would get tossed into the tubs which would go on the trolleys Eight ten twelve at a time  a dangerously swaying tower of breakable IT kit Then a trolleywrangler a stablizer and someone carrying twelve sets of keyboards and mice would hoof it pronto to the nearest elevator   Everyone left behind would continue stripping PCs down or if there were none left at that location move on to the next one and start componentizing like they could sell the parts   Meanwhile the trolley squad unloaded all the PCs and parts at the destinations and left them in pieces One person stayed behind to manage reassembly  they would rejoin the disassembly team once they were done The other two took off at a run to the next location where there were piles of beige bits waiting snag one of the disassemblers to be their third and the process repeated      Effectively all of us were continually on the move or doing something whether that be pulling PCs to pieces putting partspuzzles to rights or booking it between those two everchanging locations with an unstable cartload of expensive things HUT HUT HUT  With fifteen minutes to spare we made it And come Monday we had absolutely no idea why a couple of people were ringing us to say their computers werent turning on or their keyboards werent responding or their screens were upsidedown still out of a thousand moves under heavy time constraints even our management acknowledged there were always going to be one or two which needed a little finetuning  It was we all agreed simply a mysterious coincidence that the affected people were overwhelmingly ones whod irritated the IT department in the last three months And at least none of them had to look at my latest invention which Id dubbed Cthulhus Desktop        but thats a story for another time  tldr Plastic tubs of user

the last exciting episodehttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentsuyeuweeklongrebuildsletmeseethat the weeklong workstation rebuild process at my employer had been cut down to  hours This did free up some time although of course the Helpdesk received absolutely no recognition of this improvement  It was about this time that musing on the rebuild process I asked myself why it was necessary at all to physically transport the PC away from its desk and building into the Helpdesk area crack the case attach a floppy drive and so on and so forth simply to rearrange the bits on the hard drive After all they all had network connections right  So I looked at the build disk images and of course they were pretty much shells around booting a PC establishing a network connection and then just pulling down the workstation software Pretty simple In fact there was really no reason to run them from floppy at all except that it was convenient when the hard disk got formatted  Now sure we could have simply stuck a twomeg partition on the workstation and bootedreimaged from there but management didnt want to do that Sigh Thus the whole debacle with floppies and the related schlepping of PC carcasses back and forth  However if for example the repartitioning and reformatting processes were separated out into a batch file of their own the entire rest of the build process sixty to ninety minutes could be run to completion from the hard disk      Hmm      Some slicing and dicing later I had an FDISKandFORMAT batch file which would also ask which OS to build to copy the relevant sections of a floppy build disk to CBUILDDISK kick off the build process and then clean up after itself And while we couldnt get approval for a keyboard stuffer capable of driving FDISK FORMAT was fully automatable from the command line  And yes I know now about FDISK lt inputfile but I didnt at the time      Workstation rebuilds now consisted of   stick a floppy in the workstation and reboot   choose an OS it would write a flag file to the floppy   fly through the FDISK repartition options   watch the workstation fastformat automatically and copy files down to the hard disk and   eject the floppy and boogie on back to the Helpdesk while the workstation selfbuilt      After a couple of process refinements sticking an A sheet over the keyboard saying DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE THIS endofbuild screenshot and turning mice upsidedown because the rebuild software used at the site was fragile and stupidly sensitive to user input this new method worked brilliantly Apart from having to hang around for the fastformat it didnt waste much tech time  and certainly less than having to crack a case attach a drive run upstairs to the server room each time etc  and we could GBTW in five or ten minutes From the user perspective a weeklong process which had dropped to one day was now almost entirely completable over a lunch break Scheduling most of the rebuilds for lunches or at the end of the day also enabled us to minimize disruption to employees and teams overall in cases where a PC needed rebuilding but was still moreorless running and being used    The best bit Users could now no longer play the old Oh the computer is busted time to report it and spend the next week doing buggerall at my desk until IT gets it back to me game Anyone pulling that stunt now got two hours max and most managers in the public service at the time would not assign your work to someone else if you were only offline for two hours  you just had to suck it up and work harder Particularly if one of those hours was your lunch break anyway  Funny how a lot of employees who had annoyed the Helpdesk over the years and were wellknown to be slackers suddenly found their best workavoidance excuse utterly destroyed in the weeks that followed I got a LOT of Oh God no looks when I cheerfully informed them and their boss that instead of a weeks downtime I could now have them up and running in ninety minutes flat and that they could use a workstation in the next section over in the meantime so they wouldnt miss a single minute of work      Of course all this extra productivity meant that the users also had more time to test the rather Swisscheeselike security around the government systems Thus leading to the incident I like to call The Alsatian Porn and the Executive Printer    but thats a story for another time    tldr No downtime for you  downtime nazi,Faster pussycat faster,731,TalesFromTechsupport
TollhouseFrank,100,109,1o5g4m,558,edit  confirmed by mod not moderated just caught in the spam filter because of a couple words I usedAnother story from my magical job at the now closed dialup companyThere are times where you just get calls that blow your mind  Ive already posted about some of the stranger ones like the cow eating the phone line or the illiterate drunk who wanted internet for Porn and NASCAR  This is another tale of mystery and action whereupon our intrepid hero once again is in shock on his way to victoryThis repeat caller was one that I got from my first day on the job almost to the last day on the job  He called in at least once a week  It was always the same story the same steps to fix the issue yet he never seemed to remember them  It even got to the point where I knew his wifes name his childrens names and even his pet dogs name  This gentleman was a nice enough fellow  A bit daft in the head from what he claimed to be a brain injury  probably why he couldnt remember things  but was polite loved to laugh and was in general someone that made the job well worthwhile  His problem every week was cleaning out malwarespyware  It was simple enough to walk him through how to update Malwarebytes and run it and since he had a nd phone line  and the queue was almost never busy  I didnt mind chatting with him for the halfhour to  minutes it took to download malware definition updates and get through the scan  Being as how I could see what websites he visited from my end  working at an ISP gives you access to things like this  I knew it was a porn addiction but didnt say anything as he was an affable fellow and decent enough on the phoneThis went on for those  years  Near the end of my time at the company when I told him I was gonna be leaving in a couple of weeks he was sad but asked me to be patient with him as he wanted to walk through the steps to clean up his computer one more time and write them down so he could do it on his own  No problem  I spent nearly   hours on the phone with him doing this  Then the phonecall was over  About  hours later it was nearing the end of my shift and I noticed on our Radius Server that he was dialing in over and over and over  I called him up to see if he was having issues  standard procedure for us at the time if they are dialing in over and over call them to help them before they call us all frustrated  It wasnt him I got when I called  I got his wife  She had no idea the computer was even attempting to dialon as it was downstairs in the basement and everyone but her was out of the house for the evening as her kids were at a friends house and her husband out with friends at a local college basketball game  Since that was the issue I told her it was probably a dialer for those that remember illicit programs designed to dial into long distance numbers to rack up huge charges that are hard to dispute  I advised her it would be a good thing to go turn off the computer and unhook it from the phone line until it was cleaned up of the malware  She went downstairs to check  Cue her suddenly breathing in loudly followed by an earsplitting scream loud banging and doors slamming and heavy footsteps the sounds of a gun going off glass shattering and then heavy breathing  She got back on the phone as I was starting to call the police to go to her house and the following is a paraphrasing of what happened after she explained the ruckusApparently her husband had lied to her about going out with his friends  He had snuck their neighbors underage daughter into their basement and was having sex with her while watching a likely illegal type of Porn  apparently the source of the dialer I had her go to check on  I have no idea why she had to point out the type of porn but she did  She got mad and in her rage shot her TV with her pistol while running the neighbor girl out of the house  She then calmly told me to stop dialing the police  I was in the middle of dialing her local police dept  and that she would call them and report him herselfTLDR  Porn is a poor excuse to break the law, years of friendship out the window,667,TalesFromTechsupport

stressful as the other two Level  techs had just been fired or had quit due to better jobs and the Level  guys hadnt been hired yet Therefore its me the buddy that got the job and two others on the helpdesk for a facility of over k usersFantasticThat morning should have been a warning to me What was usually a  minute commute ended up taking  Thankfully we have the first appearance of Former IT Boss FITB was a woman in her s with lines of stress in her face but an absolutely gorgeous figure Why do I mention that Because she did A lot Anyhow FITB knew the stresses of the IT grunts and would often offer to pick up Starbucks Her reaction to my mien when I arrived told her that it would be one of those days and with some playful jesting and flirting she went to go shore up the caffeine supply with a direct injectionSitting down at my desk and feeling just a bit better from the exchange I opened up my email Back then the facility was not using a ticketing system at all Rather users sent an email to a shared address and one of us picked up the incident As my email began to update I started seeing more and more tickets from one userAccounting DouchebagAD loved to believe that he was the most important cog in the company gears He also had an irrational hatred for IT as well as an overinflated notion of what he really did at the company He worked for a man who was sadly a good person but a bit meek AD and I had butted heads many times before but today was the qualifier As I sifted through his emails to the tech line I noticed that they were all the same issue but with increasingly hostile remarks I should note that the first email and most recent email from AD were only thirty minutes apartIssue User cannot print Easily stated in this manner and would be simple to start troubleshootingIssue as AD reported it I AM DOWN AND CANNOT WORK PLEASE RESPONDI mention to my compatriots that I was going over to Accounting to fix the problem As I rose my work cellphone

time my boss was an awesome guy and wed just recently implemented our Black List The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us with proof that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication We reviewed the case and as he saw the stream of insults and nearprofanities he pulled out the familiar black folder and said the words I had longed to hearBoss Granted Area you are released to execute on your own recognizance

print Fix it That will require you to move What happens when you try to printDC Nothing happens moron or I wouldnt have called you people God Who the hell hired you people DC Im not in the mood for your temper today Step out of your cube and Ill analyze the problemDC proceeds out of his cube where he begins to rant and rave to anyone listening about how IT is incompetent His boss gets an earful in particular but he didnt seem to mind Especially because we had sent to his printer a printout of all of DCs emails for this incidentAnyhow Im here to work right Well it turns out DC attempted to install a PDF Converter which would masquerade as a printer However without the proper access rights it had only installed so far As I checked Services I noticed the Print Spooler was off All it took was an uninstall of the Converter and a restart of the service before the test page spat out of the printer at his desk Wonderful But here comes another print joband the Accounting Xerox spins upand the General Office Xerox spins upand the CEOCEOs assistants Xerox spins upWhat in the I check the stupid proprietary print job program that weve got to see what happened Wed installed it to be doubly sure that important print jobs werent dropped and though it was coded inhouse it worked at least What it shows me is that when DC couldnt print to his printer he opted to send it to every printer within walking distance What was his most urgent of print jobsA coupon for a buy one get one deal at the local pizza jointAs the printing cacophony began DC managed to quiet his tirades long enough to look over at what had printed Snatching it up he yelled that it was about damned time IT did something right and nearly bowled me over getting back to his desk Had his boss seen it I would have laughed and maybe bumped into DC but his boss had headed for the CEO printer to retrieve the job As DC sat down ranting and raving I retrieved the print job from the Accounting Xerox Waiting for the boss I decided to start the conversation DC you told me that you were completely down and that lives were at stake Why did you say thatDC Shut up kid You dont know a damn thing about what I do here I know that you people wont leave your precious office for something minor Well I do know that you do absolutely nothing related to patient care and have no relationship with any department that does So no lives were not at stake You further stated that you were completely down no doubt a phrase you picked up from Hot Accounting Chick when she was and figured itd get you a response ASAPDC I dont give a fu Shut Your MouthI had just about had enough and I put enough of my real personality into the intonation that even DC stopped staring at me with a slack jaw Part of me thinks he knew he had screwed up but I cant be sure All I know is that I was tired of it Hed done it to me a lot and I could handle it but the tech who had quit had done so because of users like this With the authorization of My Boss and his position and backed by Director of IT I am notifying you that you are now on the IT Black List This means that you will not be permitted to submit helpdesk emails you will not be allowed to delay any updates and you will not be responded to in any form regarding an ITrelated incidentDC You cant possib Let Me Finish Furthermore all IT incidents will need to come through your supervisor The details of those incidents must clearly and succinctly outline what the problem is I leaned in closer Your treatment of myself and my fellow technicians is no longer wanted or desired Good dayAs I

PaintDrinkingPete,98,96,1k7scl,548,This happened about  or  years ago when our office was still running MS Exchange My boss at the time had previously been the head of the IT department but had several years earlier become the project manager of our entire support contract we provided several services including IT training financial analysis etc so he was no longer working IT on a daytoday basis and as time went by any knowledge he had retained become less and less relevant  This however did not stop him from completely micromanaging our IT department on a daily basis which really wasnt his job anymore often making our lives miserable  He would even often break things just to keep us on our toes testing us to make sure we responded correctly to the problems hed intentionally create usually these would be minor annoyances like stopping a print spooler but obviously it wasnt the best way to manageHe was also extremely head strong and would never admit when he was wrong even though he had little experience actually working with any of the current systems we had  One day hes in our office poking his nose around and notices that the free disk space on our Exchange server is getting a bit low  For what its worth it had been the way for quite some time and given its operational state definitely wasnt anywhere near a critical state plus we were in the process of setting up a new Exchange  server that we would migrating everyone to in the very near futureWell he about flips out when he sees this and rushes over to his office apparently Googles something then comes back on starts tinkering on the Exchange server again I dont remember why but at the time we could only console to our servers from a dedicated workstation in the IT lab  Then I notice my Outlook client suddenly says offline attempting to reconnectetc and heres our ensuing conversationme Umwhat exactly are you doing over thereboss  Im defraging the mailbox store to free up spaceKeep in mind this is a production system and its middle of the work dayme  What You should take the database offline first to do that and it doesnt even need to be doneObviously he was trying to use Eseutil to shrink the database but whatever it was that he did shrunk our privedb file from GB to about GB and no clients could connect to Exchange  As you can expect the phone calls start rolling in at an exponential rateIt became obvious we were going to have to restore from a tape backup however the last good backup we had was from about  days prior  Luckily all of our supported users about  total were using Outlook in cache mode so we had to go to each users workstation and make a backup of their cache so they could restore all their recent email messages  My other colleague and I ended up working through the night getting the Exchange server back online and everyones mailbox restored and all my boss could say to us was see this is what happens when you dont monitor your servers for free disk spaceThis is sadly only one of many stories I have about this now exbossIll try to share some more in the futureEDIT  spelling,IT Boss from hell kills Exchange Server,644,TalesFromTechsupport

wannabesq,119,137,1gn6gt,544,I was doing tech support for a church and there was an older member who barely knew how to use his computer  He was doing things very logically in his mind but the way they came out was funny  For example every email he ever sent had no subject line and no body  They all had attachments named Documentdoc with an ALL CAPS letter with what a normal person would put in the body  He was writing his letters then putting them in virtual envelopes and sending them out  I tried to explain how normal people do it with a parcelpackage analogy but it just went right over his head  ,Elderly computer user logic,681,TalesFromTechsupport
jackschitt,154,102,u4sk1,548,My unit also shares our office with the reigonal VP and his secretary  They have access to more confidential information than the rest of us and Im only allowed very minimal access to their systems  basically I cant do much above telling them to call the corporate IT desk and I dont have authority to do anything beyond the very basics without explicit permissionSo her computer dies  The VP puts a special order in to have the new one replaced overnight  My only role was supposed to be to take it out of the box set it up turn it on and call the IT department to finish the job remotely  FineSo Im setting this all up and the VP is sitting there making random small talk  The secretary makes a comment about Why cant Jack just do it himself  Going through corporate takes forever  The VP then goes on about how these systems contain highly confidential data and the security for them is airtight  He continues to go on for a good five minutes rambling on about data security as if we were protecting some kind of state secrets or something  So I turn the computer on and Im getting ready to call corporate and pass it over to their IT  The VP is still rambling on  Having dealt with their help desk and subsequently ignoring them  I swear their level  support is whatever custodian happens to be walking by the phone at the time I decided to try to log in by just typing Help Desk  No password  And it fucking worked  I was floored  Not only was I able to log in with no password the account had full admin rights  I proceed to remove the password for the secretarys account and logged right in  This caused the VP to stop midspeech and say Heyhow the hell did you do that  My reply  The topnotch security that you think is there is nonexistent  He insisted that the since he demanded the system be overnighted this was a onetime fluke and someone was in a rush and just skipped a step  I then walked over to his machine and proceeded to do the exact same thing  His jaw was on the floor  Anybody who had physical access to any computer could have stolen all the data they wanted just by typing Help Desk and going to town  Phone calls were made  Heads rolled   Needless to day the VP was particularly embarrassed by watching some lowlevel IT guy get into his system in seconds while he was talking about the security of the system  For the record at least they require passwords now  ,Greatest  Security  Ever,650,TalesFromTechsupport

limeybastard,78,76,1d184j,547,This is long but bear with me  I used to work in an unnamed big box store as a computer tech  Im not proud to have worked there I was desperate but am proud of the job I did  we were one of the few stores that actually did a reasonable job  You could bring your computer to us and get it back with the problem solved in a day and a half and wed never try to sell you shit you didnt need if you didnt want itOne day this unpleasant older lady comes in  At this point Id been there long enough to be able to smell the bad ones from ten yards and shes already huffy because shes incapable of reading signs waited in line at the wrong counter and was sent round to us but I greet her in my usual cheerful fashion and ask what I can do for hergtIm here to pick up the computer my husband dropped off  You guys have had it for ever but the guy finally said it was readyWell crap this is going to get worse in a hurry  we cant release a computer to somebody whose name is not on the ticket without a copy of the receipt for liability reasons  Shes already unhappy and shes just going to flip when I tell her Im going to have to call the number on the ticket and ask permission to release itSighing inwardly and putting off the inevitable a moment in the vain hopes that her name is on it somewhere in addition to her husbands I get the last name and go in the backIts not thereI check the completed section  I check the waitingforstuff section  Nada  Oh cockI go back out and verify the name  I ask if theres another name it might be under  I return to the back recheck all the shelves then check the bench  Nothing  I pull up our tracking system and try a few spellings of the name still nothingOK this is going to be a problem nowI go back out and say Im sorry Im having a little trouble tracking it down could I get your phone number so I can try looking it up that wayAnd with that she goes from  to murderousbitchfromhellgtWHAT DO YOU MEAN YOUVE LOST MY COMPUTER HOW COULD YOU LOSE MY COMPUTERMaam we havent lost your computer I just didnt see it when I looked  If I can get your phone number I can look it up in our system and itll give me a better idea where to look  Thinking possibly it got sent off for service for a hardware fault we couldnt do instore  Or at least Ill find notes on it saying its definitely completed or actually waiting for OS discs or somethingI finally coax her number out of her and plug it in Still nothing  Fuck  I ask if theres another number it might be under she says no and just gets louder and more obnoxiousgtYOUVE LOST MY COMPUTER I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN YOU GUYS ARE ALL INCOMPETENT AND YOUVE HAD IT FOR A WEEK NOW AND HAVE BEEN GIVING ME THE RUNAROUND EVERY TIME I CALL AND THE GUY FINALLY CALLED THIS MORNING TO SAY IT WAS READY AND NOW YOURE TELLING ME YOUVE LOST ITNow Im starting to get confused  Im pretty sure if wed had a system for that long Id know about it  as I said we typically had people back out the door in less than two days  Well theres one more thing I can tryI ask her if she has the receipt knowing she probably doesnt but that will have the ticket number on it and with that I can DEFINITELY track it ticket numbers are infallible  Of course she doesnt her husband probably has it at home despite our repeated reminders to customers that if they want anyone else to pick it up they HAVE to have the receipt  I have nothing else to go on though so I ask her if she can call him and ask him for the ticket number  She continues to call me incompetent and bitch about our awful service but she pulls out her phone anywayAfter a few words to him none of which were do you have the receipt for the computer more like these idiots have lost my laptop she hands the phone to me  HE then starts cussing me out for losing their computer  He slanders my competence and uses language I normally wont stand for but I need this damn ticket number from him  I finally get a word in edgewise to ask him for the info off the receipt  He wont give it to me he just keeps yellingThen something clicks  The guy said it was ready  I ask her who she talked to  She said I dont know I think Ryan or something  Well the person who did our calling that day was called Tabitha so something wasnt rightI say one moment let me check something and hand the stillsquawking phone back  In the back room I pick up our phone and dial the other bigbox store in the same shopping center that also services computers  I get my friend who works thereHi Nate do you guys have a computer there under the name of Dorner  You do  And its ready to be picked up  Great  Shell be in in a minute you might want to have it readyI go back out and say Maam Ive figured out where your computer is  If you go out and turn left and head over to our competitor in the next parking lot I already spoke to Nate over there and he has your computer waiting for youAnd in a blissful moment she finally stops yelling  She looks at me glassily for a moment but refuses to deflate  Oh she says he swore he dropped it off here  He must not have had his coffee that morning  And turns and walks out without even so much as a sorry I was such a colossal ctpuffin to you for the last  minutesAnd that is the story of the worst customer I ever hadTLDR Here we go gathering nuts in May on a cold and frosty morningEdit Wow QotD

Ormuzd,70,89,1iu1fn,544,Ive lurked this page for a while now and always thought about submitting a few of my stories but they all seemed a little run of the mill Until something that happened a few months ago that finally came full circle  I think I may have finally found my white whale  Prepare for a wall of text sorryToward the beginning of this year we moved into a brand new building  It is a wonder of modern technology that literally everything can be controlled via one of our central networking rooms  One room for building management HVAC lights elevators the works and one for networking and IT  I was one of the few people that got to spend a lot of the time in the building during the construction phase so I know where just about everything is  Generally I tend to be more a database and networking guy but I love to get my hands dirty and will play with about anything people will let me so my current job has expended to handling most of the minor problems we experience when moving into a new building read as shit breaks  And thusly I have been requesting a raise due to all the added job duties Ive been performing which management had been abruptly ignoringSo fast forward to about mid May as temperatures start to get over F C  I come into the office at about  about min before the normal crowd gets in so I can have my morning in peace just for a bit  Ive checked the network and nothing seems out of place and picked out my general task for the day then head over to the kitchenette to make some instant oatmeal  I hang out in the kitchen for about min talking to one of the mail guys who was passing though and start to head back to my desk it is about  at this point  As Im about  steps from my desk I can hear the phone ring and it cuts out just before I get there  I got to sit down and see who was calling when I notice my email has a lot of unread messages and my desk phone has  missed calls This is the point I feel a disturbance in the force  Well not really the force but my cell phone goes off and I do not recognize the number no one really calls my cell  I answer my cell with my general level of morning enthusiasm only to find out that it is the secretary of the head of the company there were no greetings or pleasantries from her only the opening statement We have a problem  It is currently F C in this office and no one is doing anything about it  I flounder for a minute as Im not sure why someone is called me about the HVAC system when I notice all my emails have a headline along the lines of AC not working followed by names of the Executives or their assistants  Before I can get out that this is more of a Facilities issue not an IT one I get told Neither of the HVAC guys are answering and youre the only person the guy at the help desk could think of who would know how to fix this  I ask her to hold just a sec while I try to scrape together some sort of answer eventually settling on There is nothing I can do from my desk here so Ill walk over to the facilities room and see what is going on then give you a call back  She hangs up and I start checking though all the emails that have piled up when I notice all of these people have similar office numbers then it hits me the AC handler for their part of the building which mostly consist of the higherups has completely stopped working  As I get over to the facilities room I hear the ominous beeping coming from one of the terminals  When I turn the monitor on the first thing I see is the red warning text saying Air handler X FAILED fault   I go looking for a phone to call back the secretary to tell here their AC is fucked when I notice a white board with  of the facilities guys name on it say they would be on vacation this week and for the other guy to have fun there are  people that normally work this room  I call the secretary back to inform her that the entire AC system for their part of the building has failed and  of the  guys that work on that system are on vacation and the rd is MIA to which she is pissed because apparently it has gone up  since I last talked to her who would guess ft glass windows with no way to block the light would cause a room to heat up like an oven if it didnt have a dedicated AC system  I inform her the best I can do is try to get a factory tech on the phone and see if they can get a repair guy out to us sometime today  That is unacceptable how can we be expected to work in this heat is there anything else you can do  Not wanting to say no because then my day would just get worse since I was already in the email chain I would be dealing with it either way at my desk I say I can go check the physical unit while I try to call the factory guys maybe they can tell me what fault  is and if it is simple I can fix it or maybe they can tell me how to reroute some of the cooling from another part of the building to you guys  It is at the point that I find out I was on speaker phone with her and the President was listening to what was being done when he speaks up thanking me for working on this for them  They hang up and I find the number for the manufacture prominently displayed on the screen of the computer with the error message and call them only to find out they are in a different time zone and do not open for  more hours  It is at the point I realize this day is going to be my own personal hell  I say fuck it and start walking up to the maintenance area because being anywhere someone else can contact me is out of the question at this point  When I get to the air handler room everything is dead quit and actually kind of peaceful  I stand in the middle of the room staring at this huge machine that Ive ever only seen once during construction when I was helping hook it up the network for the facilities guys  As Im walking around it I notice a piece  conduit lying in the middle of the floor completely out of place  I kick it up against the wall and look at the side of the machine where it was laying when I notice a white box about the size of a small computer tower with a small  screen on it that says Fault  Power interrupted with  options restart and view error log  It also has a nice scratch down the front of it that goes right over a few of the other buttons  That is when it hits me the  conduit was something some dummy leaned against the wall and it fell over hitting this box causing it to freak out and turn the power off  I press the button beside restart and after a short loading time the AC unit roars back to life  As Im walking back down to my area I decide to pass though the Executive offices just to make sure the cool air is making its way down to them  As Im wondering around the halls staring up at the ceiling with my hand raised to feeling for any airflow the voice from the phone stops me to ask what I am doing   I inform her I was the IT guy she talked to about the AC issues and I was just coming though to see if they were getting cold air  As we are standing in the hallway the first signs of cool air start to come out of the vent we are standing under  Her mouth drops open as she realizes the AC is back on hugs me while thanking me for performing some kind of computer magic and runs back to her office  I decide to take the long route back to my desk where I sit down and delete about  emails all complaining about the AC and go about the rest of my day  This all managed to occur before AM months go by and no other major issues have popped up  I managed to track down the missing tech that was working the facilities room alone that day only to find out he had been in the hospital with food poisoning  We had a good laugh over the story and he bought me a bottle of Jack as payment for my troubles  Mid July comes around which means the mid year awards ceremony which generally means a way for the sells guys and management to pat themselves on the back for all the hard work they do  All the tech guys and I are hanging out in the back making the usually crude jokes just waiting for the free food and drinks at the end when the President takes the stage and says he has one more special award he would like to present followed by a  minute speech about all the hard work this individual does that goes unnoticed  All of the tech guys are kind of laugh and I hear the comment Wonder which boob is getting this award  Then the president says Will Ormuzd please come up here  Dead fucking silence few people outside of the techs know who I am and all of them are too slack jawed to say anything  I make my way up toward the stage while he tells an abbreviated and kind of exaggerated story of how I had gone above and beyond to fix the AC for their offices  I accept the award and shake hands when he informs me this award comes with a bonus and the raise I had been asking for plus some  I just stand there kind of stunned when from all the way in the back my fellow tech guys burst into applauseTLDR Reset a computer and justified my existence to management  Got paidEDIT Fixed a few typos,Sometimes it is the simple things,633,TalesFromTechsupport

TalesFromTechSupport,196,657,ybkr5,537,Posting early this week EnjoyPrevious ChaptersChapter   My first job in IThttpredditxtlhx Chapter   Store uniformshttpredditxyazrChapter   Spring Cleaninghttpredditygz  I had been working in the store for a good half year by now and the summer vacation was just a few weeks away Working in the store had been good for the last few weeks The regular customers were finally accustomed to me and did not ogle as much anymore and uncomfortable interactions were at an all time low Not responding to the webcam offer probably had made its rounds and made the creeps give up hope and move to other thingsDon had a newfound love for playing video games and was locked up in his office for hours on end I did not know what he was playing but it was probably an MMO as I sometimes heard him talk and shout in his office One of our headsets was missing too Richard and Frank were in the back working on the computers at least that was what I wanted to believe they were probably browsing through peoples files and copying whatever they found interesting to their hard drives We had been sold out of ethics a long timeI was cleaning up the store which was slowly but surely recovering from its midlife crisis A poster had made its way on the store windows again and one of the tables had already disappeared to the backA middleaged woman came into the store She had an old IBM Thinkpad in her hands and I signaled her to go up to the counterWhen we both got to the counter she put down the Thinkpad and I asked her what was wrong She told me that she had bought the computer here over a year ago and was using it without any problems until yesterday She had been typing an email on her computer when it just died She had tried to turn it back on again but it did not work and neither did replugging the battery and charger I checked with a different charger nothing I tried with a different battery nothing again I now had to tell her the problem was probably with the power management on the motherboard To be sure we had to open it up and see for ourselves Repairs would probably run into the high hundreds for a motherboard replacement She did not like the estimation But I have a warranty she said with a somewhat threatening voice Only for the first  months I said Its a refurbished model She did not want to pay hundreds of dollars for repairs and honestly I could understand that Ill see what other options we have for you I checked the store computer if we had any comparable notebooks in the back that could replace the broken one We did the exact same model with a slightly better processor She asked what the price would be  I said and we will switch the hard drive so you will still have all your filesShe did not want it Knowing that we had another computer she tried to get that for free because she had a warranty Cant you just switch them Your boss doesnt need to know she said I was not going to switch the notebooks By now she had made enough noise for Jeremy to come to the counter as well Her face lit up Not thinking anything else of it I turned back to the PC to look up the price for the motherboard of her notebook Before Jeremy could even say anything she said I bet you can use some fun around this place I looked up she had pulled up her shirt and was now showing her boobs to Jeremy and me Get my ThinkPad replaced and Ill let you play with them She saw my surprised face and frowned Sorry I dont do girls sweetieBefore us now stood a something woman with her top off She probably was pretty back when she was my age but that had faded away from the large amounts of sunbathing she had done Her skin was orange and old looking like the surface of Mars Her breasts were saggy and wrinkled She had a bit of a weight problem but wasnt obese Jeremy quickly replied with what had to be his magnum opus The fact that I work with old computers doesnt mean I like all old things Her personality sphere malfunctioned it was a critical hit on her system Jeremy continued on please pull up your top and either pay for the repairs or leave the store I was laughing at this moment adding to her angerHer charm had not worked She demanded to speak to the boss Neither Jeremy or me wanted to deal with her anymore today We told her Don was out for the day and would be back tomorrow morning She left saying she would be back the first thing tomorrow morning I didnt care I wasnt scheduled until one in the afternoon When I came in that afternoon the first thing I did was to check the stockpile of notebooks The ThinkPad was nowhere to be found I did not want to know what happened this morning Dons office was closed as usual and I was not going in I went to work and had an uneasy feeling all day Jeremy had the same At around four Don came out of his office He was leaving early he had a date with somebody he met this morning Jeremy later went into his office to look at his internet history he had been looking up dating advice all day   So this next story happened about a few weeks before Richard and Frank got fired and may involve trace amounts of time travel So word of advice if you meet yourself reading this dont make eye contact I was working in the store when a father and son came in The father was a man in his late s and looked like a mix of a British lord and a crazy scientist The son was a perfect stereotype of a Hollywood computer geek with an extra dash of social awkwardnessThey were looking for a new notebook he could use for college He would be studying computer science in the fall his father told me The son remained silent and probably felt uncomfortable in the situation I noticed that he kept looking at me  he knew what was going to happen and he could do nothing about itMy son deserves the very best notebook to make his study a success the father said loudly as if he was proclaiming the word of God Thinking about it I should have said something along the lines of and thats why you chose our store you will only find the very best quality here However I know I could not have said that with a straight faceI tried to pry out some more information about his needs but the father kept insisting his son would study computer science and nothing less I gave up on trying to pinpoint what he would be specializing in and showed him a number of notebooks that would be suitable All the ports you could possibly need a good CPU and enough options to upgrade the memory and storage We actually had some decent notebooks in our shopThe father was a self proclaimed computer scientist himself as he had read all the computer magazines religiously since  He quickly dismissed everything I had said and looked at me with a stern face of disapproval before saying That notebook cannot be faster than the other one it has more gigahertz This was not going to be easy I tried to explain that the megahertz of the CPU were only part of the performance of a computer there were many other factors to consider He looked at his son and asked him if he knew about this Still uncomfortable with the entire situation the son silently said that yes I was rightThe father did not care to apologize for his stupidity and quickly changed the subject to one of the other notebooks  a rather old offbrand notebook This computer was from  and nothing special It was too late he was in love with it It was perfect other notebooks be damned I saw the look in the eyes of his son and tried to persuade the father to buy one of the ThinkPads instead They have a better build quality and are in the same price range He was having none of it We walked to the register with the notebook and a collection of the burning antivirus and firewall software that had been rated the best by his computer magazinesAt the register the father finally noticed that his son had been looking at me all the time He went silent for a few moments and probably arranged our wedding in his head His demeanor changed He now wanted to buy me too for his sonYou and my son seem to have a lot in common with computers and things he said in a rather over friendly tone I said We probably do Your total will come to  how would you like to pay He ignored my question Do you play any computer games He plays them constantly I looked at him and said I share a Gamecube with my sister how do you want to pay He ignored my question again and kept asking questions Finally he asked how much he should add to the  to have me go on a date with his son His son hid his face in shame he wanted to leave Can you stop asking these questions and just pay your total I asked Not taking half measures I added I have a boyfriend anyway He refused to believe me and now got a little aggressive demanding a photo of this boyfriend of mine before he was going to pay I was never going to get rid of him I had become more assertive by now standing my ground and about to cancel the transaction Suddenly Richard and Frank got out of the back and walked up to me putting their hands around me and kissing me on the cheek Richard from the left Frank on the right They looked at the father and son and said in unison We

trrwilson,56,104,1iq36t,535,Background  Field support for a large bank Until our recent VOIP conversion this included analog phone systems  Also some of the buildings I work in are old  Very oldHeres some history of the building I had to visit  When this building was first turned into a bank pair cables were run to each office and teller station  They provided a connections for the terminals yes terminals and phones in each office  Eventually they upgraded to BNC network connections for the PCs which required running coax for each terminal  The continued to use the pair cables for the phones After that they ran CAT for the PCs still using the pair connections for the phones  Some time in the early s they remodeled the place completely  New CAT was run for the PC and the phone for each office and teller station  The termination points on the pair cables and BNC cabling were cut off and stuffed into the wall then the boxes were covered with blank platesWhat they never did during all of this was pull the old cables out of the walls The pair BNC and old CAT were all still there in a huge rats nest in the corner of the comm room  The new cables were terminated very neatly on a rack right above this with all the new runs tightly bound together and disappearing into the ball of unused insulated copper below itOne day I got a call to check out a phone  No dial tone no power all the others in the branch are working  I grabbed a spare phone my phone tools and a couple cables then went out to see them  I arrived and verified what the user was saying  Yep dead phone  I replaced the cable going from the phone to the wall  Nope still dead  I replaced the phone  Nope still dead  I replaced the cable going from the phone system to the patch panel  NothingNow things get to be a pain  I reterminated the phone jack in the office but that didnt help  My last thing to try was reterminating at the patch panel  I didnt have a jack that fit the panel so I got a biscuit jack so I could just pull the wire off the panel reterminate with a new box and attach the box to the side of the rackIn order to move the wire that far I had to pull it out of the wrapped bundle  I started undoing the velcro strapping pulling the wire out then replacing the strapping on the remaining bundle  Finally I got down to the last strap stuck right in the middle of the rats nestAt this point I discovered it was a literal rats nest  I reached my hand down and heard rustling and squeaking and saw a large rat poke its head out at me then start climbing the cable bundle using the velcro strapping like rungs on a ladderI screamed like a little girl and jumped back and knocked my toolbox off the table scattering tools and connectors everywhere  The tellers heard this and one of them came running thinking I must have hurt myself  They sew me backing out of the room a mess of IT debris and a rat perched on the rack  After a few seconds of staring it scampered down the cable bundle and disappeared into the same hole in the wall as all the cablesAfter a visit from an exterminator and an electrician they figured out the rat had chewed through tons of cables mostly hitting dead ones until it finally bit through a live one causing the phone to die  Thankfully the manager was able to convince the electrician running the replacement cable to pull out all of the old ones that werent being used hopefully preventing future rodent visitationsTLDR  Remy the Rat is a good chef but a terrible electrician,If you arent using it get rid of it,639,TalesFromTechsupport

trrwilson,63,116,1k2gxx,532,Quick background  IT support for a bank were a rd party vendor poop always rolls downhill and were at the bottom of the hill  Oh and this is a long oneAbout our banking software it has two parts  A UNIX mainframe with terminal emulators on each PC a web based GUI which is easy to use and has some functions that UNIX doesnt have  The GUI feeds info into UNIX and UNIX actually runs the transactions   Each branch also has a unique number for lots of reasons  However not each branch number refers to an actual physical location  We have shadow branches that are set up so employees can still do banking transactions even if they arent an actual branch  This comes into play laterSecond bit of background info each physical branch has a check printer  They are named in such a way as to indicate which branch they are at ie CHKPRT  When a branch opens a print queue is created in  places  Theres one on the windows print server one in UNIX and one in GUI  Our company has no access to the GUI or UNIX servers we only have access to the windows print servers The banks internal IT department has to create the UNIX and GUI queues  Some of you can probably guess whats comingA few months ago a regional HQ in a city about  hours away was moving  Along with the move a shadow branch is upgraded to a full service branch Meetings are had plans are made dates are decided on  At this point the banks project manager lets call her Retail Moron or RM has to submit assorted requests to various departments  One request is to have the check printer be set up in UNIX and GUI because its an upgrade from a shadow branch to the real thing Any predictions about what happened yetWell the big day rolls around me and my boss spend all day Friday tagging and unhooking about  machines  Movers then haul the stuff to the new building  We spend Saturday hooking it all up and installing all the new equipment in the abouttoopen new branch  This included submitting the info for our new check printer our server guys set up the windows queue like theyre supposed to and successfully print a test page We left the building at  pm on Saturday with me staying through to Monday to do day supportSurprisingly there were no dayone issues except one lost mouse and one broken docking station  I take care of those few things and Im ready to leave when the branch manager BM comes up to meBM We cant print checksMe OK let me take a lookPrinter is pulling paper NIC is working the server team can print test pagesMe OK whatever problem youre having is with UNIX or GUI  The printer is working fine but some part of the banking software isnt seeing it  Youll have to call the help desk they can send a ticket to these teamsHer OKA week passes then I get an email from RM  My boss has been CCd as well as his boss the contract manager BM and our help desk supervisor Branch  the one that was just upgraded isnt able to print checks and no action has been taken  This needs to be resolved immediatelyI go through our ticket history and find out the user never called the help desk  BM went straight to RM and started whining  Because its high priority I have to load up a spare check printer and head out at am the next morning so that I can be at this branch at  amI show up and the printer is in the same state it was in before  The NIC is working it pulls paper and test pages from the server will print  Our remote support team and myself know that its a UNIX or GUI issue at this point  I email a person from each team explaining whats going on  They ignored us almost all day we put read receipts on our messages and they werent even looked at for  hours  They dont want to mess with anything unless I replace the printer  I replace the printer our server team sets up the print queue on the server  After all this Im back to where I started with the new printer behaving just like the old one  At this point its  pm and all the UNIX and GUI support teams are gone  I haul my exhausted self back to my home officeOur teams spends the next three days trying to get a response from the UNIX and GUI programmers  Were forwarding email from retail moron to the programmers but they just ignore us with the bravado of people who have too much job security  On the third day the GUI team coughs up some news  The printer doesnt exist in GUI  Theyll create it but it wont go live until their maintenance window which is overnight between Wednesday and Thursday every other week This is in  days Theyre actually apologetic about the whole thing but maintenance is maintenance and cant be rescheduledThroughout this whole ordeal Retail Moron is getting more and more shrill and threatening Shes fairly new to the job and has a HUGE chip on her shoulder because there was a lot of competition for her position when it opened up Accusations of incompetence are being thrown around mostly directed at our company  Were not giving this enough attention even though the bank internal IT is whats holding things upFirst thing Thursday morning after the maintenance window I call the branch  Still no check printing  It has to be UNIX at this point But no theyre forcing us to replace the printer AGAIN  I then drag my extremely grumpy self back to the branch replace the printer again and get a repeat of the previous events  The printer is physically sound its on the network the windows print queue is working and it exists in GUI  At this point were all screaming at UNIX to check the programming  Finally we get a break  The reason they wont do anything is because they site is still listed as a shadow branch  Because of assorted regulations and policies they need an official request before they can upgrade it from shadow branch to fullservice They also cant create the UNIX queue until the upgrade happensAt this point RM loses her head    She starts accusing people of trying to make her look bad and get her fired  Heads are going to roll  If she gets her way none of us will even be able to get a job involving any electronic device since we are that incompetent Im paraphrasing from various email and comments made during meetingsWe start going through project logs and find out that Retail Moron never requested anything to do with the check printer  The submission form keeps a log of visits  She never once even opened the website to submit the form  The b wind went out of her sails in an instant  She couldnt berate or lie her way out of a situation she had created At this point since the branch has been without check printing capabilities for over a month the request is rushed the UNIX group has to do an immediate programming change execute their testing immediately and push the changes into production as soon as testing is complete All this mean a fair bit of overtime for some highlypaid UNIX guysWe and the UNIX team billed Retail Morons department for nearly  hours of project work as well as travel expenses  Last we heard she was fired and is working as an entrylevel teller at another bankTLDR  Moron doesnt do her job creates tons of work and travel for others tries to blame others for her incompetence gets whacked with a  bill gets fired,Retail Moron and the Printer of Doom,648,TalesFromTechsupport

school Pt httpredditykkebChapter   Intermissionhttpreddit  My days as the vengeful wench of the east had passed and I was back to working in the store It had been two months of nothing and by now it was already November My trip to Sweden with  of my friends was only memories photos and junky souvenirs I was bored  really bored While I was mindlessly browsing on the internet behind the counter a customer came in He was only the th one that night Only  hours to go until closing The customer was dressed in a blueblack business suit that was  sizes too big for him It was actually quite the accomplishment as he would easily hit lbs kg on the scale He wore unmatching light brown shoes underneath the suit He missed the necktie and an overall sense of how a suit should be worn Girls do take notice of your clothes He stood in the store with a sense of authority I wanted to walk up to him but he quickly put his hand in the air and as if proclaiming the word of God shouted I AM JUST BROWSING No help Fine by me He started looking at the notebooks on display one by one and was shaking his head at each of them mumbling underneath his breath He turned his attention to me and again with a raised voice said WHY DONT YOU HAVE ANY MODERN COMPUTERS I dont know what he expected to find when he walked into his store we are clearly in the business of selling refurbished and lastyears models Staying behind the counter I looked at him and said Sir you can lower your voice I can hear you perfectly fine from here I paused slightly and continued we mostly sell refurbished notebooks but we have a few new Sony VAIO models in the back that have not been put on display yet Do you want to see them The VAIO notebooks were the newest models available in Europe Why and how we had them I dont know I went to the back to get one out and show it to him I got back just as he started furiously pacing around angry that I had taken so long I was away for a minute Why dont you have this stuff on display You are making a customer wait My time is worth a lot of money This is not how a business should work  I decided to ignore this comments as he wasnt attacking me personally I unpacked the VAIO and showed him the specifications This notebook had the best configuration of all the notebooks in the store but it wasnt good enough for him I need a better GPY  that is not a typo  I need to do important business work on this computer You mean a GPU I said Thats what I said he replied immediately with irritation in his voice I decided to ignore his comment again Why dont you tell me what you need the computer for and maybe we can find something that suits your needs I replied in a last ditch effort to get this man to stop complaining and actually work towards finding a fitting computer Its probably too complicated for you but fine if you want to know he replied It was around now that I started becoming agitated and started to lose my cool I handle import export and distribution for many big companies in Germany My company is worth millions Do you understand this Yes I do know what all those words mean when put into a sentence but I need to know what you want to use the computer forI need to keep important spreadsheets and contracts invoices and letters and copies of shipment papers and use websites for tracking He just needed an ordinary notebook with maybe a bigger hard drive for storing his library of kb word files I told him I felt that this computer would meet his requirements with a wide margin and asked him where he felt it did not He replied that it doesnt matter You are not helping me I want someone who knows what he is talking about not some GIRL He had played the gender card I raised him a Don With Don coming in his demeanour changed Maybe it was because Don was even heavier and bigger and it impressed him With Don taking over and repeating exactly what I had said the notebook was suddenly fine He wanted to buy it now The GPY was also good enough Dons work was done here A sandwich was waiting in his office I had to finalise the sale When we got at the counter the big important businessman wanted to know about our premium services While I still think that Ron and Don were intimately familiar with the offerings of premium services we never used that terminology We only sold some shoddy extended warranty and Chinese knockoff USBgadgets with our notebooks As such I told him he could purchase  year extended warranty that covers some of the hardware defects that the notebooks are prone for It must have been at the register that he finally started to register my face as his next comment was sudden and unexpected from a man that just minutes ago called me some GIRL I was hoping youd be a premium service he said to me I had been working at the store now for over a year now and had built up a tough skin I wasnt the shy easily flustered girl anymore I was the one that knocks I answered him with an air of arrogance  that would be quite a few levels higher than premium I paused slightly Howd you like to pay for your notebook What I hadnt realised with my new found savviness was that I was talking to the important business Gorilla that was worth millions I just gave him an opening to keep trying He was quick to react and started talking again about his multimillion company and how he would dominate the export and import for the whole of Europe in just a few years That I could be there with him was the underlying tone of his story  I quickly cut him off pointing out that I was not interested in any way that I was only  and that my comment was a bad attempt at a joke He did not lie about his persistence It was very much there After a few more misplaced comments from him about me I had had enough Please stop with this I dont believe you are worth millions and honestly no money in the world would make whatever you are fantasizing happen His grin changed into a frown Stupid girl you just dont recognise a true man when you see one He ticked me off I was done being politeI started yelling at him Do you know why I think you are not a true man For one you are in a second hand computer repair shop If you were worth millions you would be in a different store Two your designer suit isnt a designer suit Its a cheap black market knockoff from Hugo Boss The fabric is wrong the stitching are wrong the buttons are wrong He was getting angry Besides its  sizes too big its not even tailored He slammed his fist on the glass counter and pulled up his sleeve showing a Rolex watch Does this look fake to you Its a  dollar watch I replied to him simply I cannot believe that If your suit is fake why would your watch be real While I might sound cool now I sounded more and more like one of those awkward girl on those scripted reality shows from MTV Those that explode in rage and fail miserably in delivering the message By now Don had walked into the store again to hear what the commotion was all about He saw me and the  lb Gorilla shouting at each other He started calling me all kinds of names I kept on repeating calling him a fake Then out of nowhere and in front of Don he hit me in the face I dont know if he hit me because he felt cornered being called out for being a fake or the fact that a seventeen year old kid was insulting him Don dropped what he had in his hands and walked up to the supposed multimillion dollar Gorilla pushing him towards the door Don shouted at top of his lungs to LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK He gave another push The Gorilla became aggressive and hit Don in the face Don reacted with a headbutt The Gorilla took Don with him in his fall knocking over the tables and promotional material Two fat men were now wresting and rolling around on the floor I did the only thing I could do I called  It took well over a couple minutes before any police arrived and pulled them apart I was scared of what would have happened if Don had lost the fight They had been all over the store by now finally ending in the back the Gorilla with his back on the floor The store was a mess They were both bleeding Blood smears were on the walls next to the back doorWhen the police came they arrested both Don and the Gorilla They took a statement from me helped me close the shop and brought me home Don called me later that night apologising for what happened and asking if I was ok He gave me the next two shifts off Frank and Richard would clean up Don seemed to still be a decent human being under all those layers of saturated fat I was happy Don took responsibility and tried to get him out of the store instead of charging him extra for damaging goods The businessman was charged with assault but things never went anywhere He got off with a fine and the same happened for Don Ron wasnt too pleased about it all Jeremy told me that all he seemed to care about was where the cops had been in the store and if they had taken anything When he learned they had been in the back Ron exploded in anger to Don   days later when I came back to work again I had been working for over an hour and noticed something strange in the upper corners of the store We had stateoftheart cameras covering every square meter This was Rons work Security cameras in a store should make you feel safe to a certain degree but for me it just felt eerie knowing that Ron would probably be watching TLDR big gorilla with monopoly money comes into the store and shows his dominance He tries to hit on me and well things escalate pretty quickly,Chapter   Premium Services,1133,TalesFromTechsupport

Australian ISP We deal with both internet and emaildomain issues for domains hosted by us as well as general computer issues directly related to internet accessThe Story I get a call this morning from a dealer Basically a franchisestyle salessupport for our services who has this client that has recently set up his emails with our domain and is not able to send any mailI had just written up an Ultimate Guide to Domains and Emails for our team to use and am pretty savvy when it comes to domains so I think This will be easy enough and run through the basicsIs the domain with us Check Are the RegistrarName ServersMX records acceptable Check No glaring problems with the Domain Check Mailbox set up and working on the Mail Server CheckEverything checks out I tell the dealer to connect the customer through minute later the call drops Im weighing up whether to try and contact the customer direct or take a different call I decide service is a better choice and start hitting the contact numbers on the accountrd attempt I get through Lets call the customer JG Older gent in his early s I introduce myself and explain that I was supposed to be helping him out but the call dropped with the dealer He seems friendly enough but in a rush I ask him if hes ok with me just remoting into the computer and setting it up for him He gives the ok and I prep it from my endI get him to go to wwwlogmeincom no dice Try again nothing I send him an email direct link and it doesnt come through right away At this stage hes pretty upset since hes been having problems for a month and were roadblocking from go Hes gotta make a call overseas in  minutes and cant hang aroundI try and get him to call me back when hes done since our queue is fairly full right now but hes having none of it and wants a call back in  minutes I say fine I might not be able to in  minutes but Ill call back same day standard calls and an hour later the queue is low enough to warrant an outbound call I hit up his number and get through right away Btw This guy picks up the phone like he can hear me diallingHes feeling a bit better since he got his call through ok so we get started Try the website no luck getting through Send him  emails since the first one arrived but theyre not going throughFinally he mentions that he had some DNS problems the other day I think hes probably still having them

Figure may as well call Domain Admin while he does check to make sure the domain is OKCall them they agree its a weird situation but we cant make heads or tails of itGet back to JG and let him finish his lunch while I poke and prod the computer Hes done in a few minutes and we get back to general chitchat while I fiddle with it Coming up on  hours and Im finishing in  minutesNow thoughout this whole time the connection kept dropping out every few minutes I mention this and JG drops the bombshell that broke the case His previous ISP was a wireless one using a dishantenna on the roof and he got ADSL because it kept dropping out a lot especially bad weatherNoNo way its that simplewwwipchickencomIP does not match his static IP with usHes still using his old bloody ISP serviceCopy SMTP from his other ISP emailPaste into SMTP for our emailDone and freaking DONEEverything works Emails send ok Emails receive okWe laugh it offI get him to send an email to the dealer to get him switched

Bastard Part     To fully understand this we need to back to May  when I was sitting in my papersigning session with the HR rep from the HR firm that handled the hospital chains account I was sitting there signing and initialing various things in the standard form contract when I saw the intellectual property clause in it that said that basically the client owned any and all IP I conceived of that could be jobrelated even if I thought of designed and coded it completely offhours on my own boxenSure its probably not going to stand up in court but no one wants to face lawyers rightSo I crossed through that paragraph initialed next to it then wrote out the following very neatly in the doublespacing between the lines    REALNAME owns all intellectual property created by him in the course of his employment at CLIENTNAME     pursuant to relevant nondisclosure agreements and the applicable laws of the jurisdiction this agreement    was signed in the city of Austin Travis County Texas All code scripts software or other IP that     REALNAME may create in the course of his employment are his property and are simply licensed to     CLIENTNAME with a nontransferable nonrenewable license until such time that he or CLIENTNAME terminates     his employment at CLIENTNAME Should REALNAME for any reason cease employment at CLIENTNAME or     any facilities that CLIENTNAME owns or services

droid or lawyer worth their salt would have parsed that and thrown it back in my face going HA HA OH WOW GTFOMy HR rep who played up the stereotypical blonde HR rep act very well though she was quite good at her job simply flipped through the pages and looked at the bottom to see if Id initialed them I dont think she expected to see anything out of the ordinary and if she saw this she sure didnt let onShe gave me a copy of the contract filed it and left and I drove back to my previous job the one with the bleachedblonde vapid pennypinching harpy and turned in my two weeks notice on the spot    BUT ENOUGH FLASHBACKS     In the nottoodistant past Id been taken off my normal project rolling out eClinicalWorks to the multitude of clinics that my company owned and been placed back into the general project poolI loathed itI loathed it with every fiber of my being with the fire of a thousand gonorrhea sufferers peeing with enough rage to make rshitredditsays look like a glade of hippies stoned out of their gourds on highquality weed I was stuck on projects like the rebuilding of an ER which required me to be there at  IN THE DAMN MORNING the move of an OB  GYN office to new facilities and the support of the Derplesoft migrationEven worse I was rarely at my personal cube any more and was instead stuck sharing a storage room converted into a makeshift office on the fourth floor of Derp Childrens with four other techs none of whom even remotely had the drive or intuition I did and the PMs shared my sentiments on that and were amazed that two of them were even hiredId secretly begun looking for another job after thatMeanwhile my erstwhile PFY had been dutifully filling my role on the remaining eClinicalWorks projects he kept busy with them as well as other thingsIts these other things that drew my attentionI had opened up the eClinicalWorks installer folder on our DFS share to show another tech an example of good scripting  eg my automated installer and prep script  and I noticed a new folder inside there with the PFYs name on it Curious I opened it and what was inside nearly made me go SephirothonNibelheimgrade angryThe folder contained scripts  several scripts all of which were MY codeWithout credits attachedAND WITH TYPOS IN THE ECHOED TEXTHe even left the lines of code Id had in that uniquely identified my scripts as mine in eg specific file paths that Id set up with nonsense words and file names and commands that he didnt understand and the variables unedited too what kind of coder unless theyre a wee bit mentally unstable  or like me  would use userderp or passderp as a variableSee I can tolerate people taking my scripts if they ask me or if I post them publicly The version Id posted up on Reddit wasnt the newest in fact it was version  and the newer versions had TONS of things that Id improved or changed due to license key changes  GPO edits  redundancy Hed taken the newest version of the script without asking me trimmed out the credits audio notifications safety  integrity checks and added Fucking TYPOSTHATS what pissed me off more than anything He took my work passed it off as his and then didnt even have the decency to make sure everything was spelled correctly for example Windows Update was spelled Windoes Updaet similar typos were spread throughout the scriptIf youre going to do something shitty at least DO IT RIGHT and hope that the people who can call you on it dontThe project managers for eClinicalWorks knew about it Hell the one who was my former boss even CONDONED it and said he didnt care Youre off the project what do you careIts MY work and I replaced the IP clause in my contract with something I wrote Youre too damn right Id care about someone passing off my code as their shitty work ESPECIALLY when I have changelogs and the original source to back up my claimsI immediately yanked my scripts  ALL of them  from the shares and moved all my workrelated documents into a GB Truecrypt container on my laptop AES  Twofish  Serpent with a sixtycharacter passphrase Id bet against Fort Meade on that one Revenge  nay JUSTICE  for something like this was not something to be meted out lightly This was something I had to think onAnd as I sat back with the four other techs in my converted cramped storageroomcumoffice I loaded up Super Mario Crossover on my rather tiny

voice I do not suffer fools lightly IsaacHe obviously didnt get it and informed me of the situation though delicately no doubt to avoid offending my sensibilities haThe firm had a suite of inhouse coders and all but the lead developer had quit en masse over the week The lead developer had turned in his immediate resignation this afternoon but the stupid bastard thought he had locked his machine beyond what we could do to get into it On top of that theyd all taken their code and started a rival firm one specifically dedicated to doing what the original firm did but they hadnt made the modifications to their contracts that I had and the lawyers were soon to get involvedI sighed and packed up my kit then drove through the beautiful Austin hillsides to reach the firm in question The last remaining developer was there in his office with the incompetent head of IT looking on frantically and a huge shiteating grin was on his faceThe head of IT pointed me towards the developers two machines and with a slight smirk I powered them on noticing the huge grin on the devs faceOh a BIOS password Well Its not as if I havent seen these since I was in high school I ripped the jumpers off the machines motherboards resetting the BIOS passwords The developers face fell a little going from total elation to mostly lolwutjpg and I booted to TuxPE off my USB key shameless plug since I wrote the damn thing and removed the local admin password via NTPWEditAfter a quick reboot followed with a login session as local admin I added the Domain Admins group back to local admins aww it was cute he thought he could beat me then rebooted the machine and started a disk imageI turned to the lead developer whose face had suddenly developed a thousandyard stare and smirked And that my good man is why you dont bet against a Bastard Operator I made special care to emphasize the capitals and his jaw dropped when he heard the term Chuck care to escort him out and call the lawyersThe portly head of IT used his considerable bulk to escort the lead developer out and with a grin I RDPd to the domain controller I built it into TuxPE and reset the lead developers password then shamelessly looted a few shots of the highend whisky Glenfiddich I knew that the head of IT kept in his desk drawerA short drive later I was back at my desk and able to tell the story to my coworkers to their infinite

jfiaff,58,92,10vt1o,517,So this past summer I worked an IT job at a company that owned and operated restaurants night clubs and hotels all over Los Angeles and Hollywood  This was a really cool job because I got to go to all of these high end nightclubs for workAnyways one day I realized we were running dangerously low on loaner laptops we were expanding and hiring a lot of new people who all needed laptops  I do the logical thing and draft a few purchase orders for five new laptops for each department restaurants nightlife hotels events and corporate  Each purchase order has to get approved by the VP of each respective department as well as the CFO of the entire company  The CFO goes ahead and approves all of the orders and so do all of the VPs with the exception of the nightlife VP this guy is kind of a prick  Anyways I go ahead and place the orders for all of the laptops except for the nightlife ones A few weeks later I get an email from the VP of nightlife saying that his laptop crashed  I go through some general diagnostics with him and eventually I tell him to bring it in and I would back up his hard drive and reimage it  Then the following dialogue takes placeMe  The reimaging process takes about three hours and seeing as its already pretty late in the day the soonest I could get it back to you is tomorrow morningVP  That is unacceptable There is an event tonight at insert nightclub name here and I need a laptop tonight  What about one of those He points to the bin on my desk labeled loaner laptops Me  Well unfortunately those laptops are reserved for other departments and there are no spare laptops allocated for the nightlife departmentHe then starts cursing at me and telling me that I need to a better job of fairly allocating technology  I kindly remind him that I tried to order five spare laptops for his department earlier that month and he was the one who denied the purchase order  He starts yelling again saying that hes a VP and he should be able to just borrow one of the corporate laptops for the night  I explain to him that I cant just give out laptops to people in one department if they came out of another departments budget and that I could potentially lose my job by doing so He storms out of the IT office and slams the door behind him The next morning the PO for the laptops is signed on my desk TLDR  VP of department is too cheap to buy laptops and then yells at me for not having spare laptops ,Why dont we have any laptops,609,TalesFromTechsupport

On  So we had this Netware network running Windows  and Win workstations over BNCconnected Token Ring and like all government systems it was a bit behind the times and not terribly well planned One of its problems was that due to the significantly preregistry age of the workstations they stored most of the user and application configuration in INI files and the logon and logoff processes including the copying of these files down to the workstation on logon and back up to the user home drive on logoff  The problem arose because as in so many other environments whoever wrote this process didnt stop to think about the issues which could arise from thousands of users who used different workstations from day to day Yep thats right there was nothing in the INIcopying function which first removed existing INI files from the destination Partially valid as there were half a dozen ones vital for the running of the workstation but even so  The result User A would log on to a PC Their INI files would download to that PC Theyd log off and their INI files would remain on that PC as well as being copied to their home drive User B would log onto the PC Their INI files would download Theyd log off and their INI files plus those of user A would copy back up to their home drive User B would then log on to another workstation where both sets of INI files would copy down to the workstation and when they logged off they might pick up INI files from users C D and E whod been using it before  not to mention that the workstation now had INI files from C D E B and A on it and would be passing those on to users F G and H in the following week  So while a new user to the department might have ten or so INI files which belonged to them as soon as they logged onto a workstation they would pick up another eight hundred or so Some workstations had as many as two thousand INI files on them mostly because staff tended to install against the AUP lots of little shareware games which used them Logging on and off now took thirty minutes or more as the machine tried to copy thousands of these things over the ageing network particularly during as almost everyone in the multiple buildings had the same schedule and so arrived and left work at the same time    On top of this there were problems where the few actual valid INI files would build up enormous amounts of junk in their subsections because some of the logon processes would merge the user settings into the existing workstation copy of the file And on top of that all it took was for one copy of an INI file to have the readonly flag set and it would not be overwritten but instead would copy up to a users home drive on logoff If a user logged on to a PC with one or more of these and the wrong interface settings came up their first instinct was usually to log off and log back on and then try another PC  meaning that the readonly INI files were now not only on the original PC but on the users home drive and the second PC too These vampire files were ridiculously difficult to kill as they could be exterminated again and again by the Helpdesk but would keep popping up as long as there was a single copy anywhere on the network It didnt help that the executives tended to fly around the country a lot and log onto random PCs in our other city offices meaning that any exec who came back from a visit was almost guaranteed to have a bunch of these vampires sitting in their home drive starting the whole process all over again  Something had to be done However as my previous scripting experience had largely been limited to batch files I needed something a little stronger  I sat down with a copy of Perl for Dummies and wrote a script called Buffy      I built Buffy to kill vampires It was designed to patrol the network servers at night whereupon it would scan through all user home drives wipe out the unnecessary INI files pull the guts out of the necessary ones and rewrite them remove the readonly attribute from whatever was left and generally act as guardian of user settings preventer of the spread of vampirism on the network and allaround watchdog  It was threequarters documentation and comments in excruciating detail It logged every single thing it did It took backups verified the backups checked that any changes it made conformed to correctness restored from backups if something had gone wrong and was generally hyperconservative in its work I tested it on some test accounts using horrible messes of INI files copied from live users and it worked perfectly All it needed was access to the servers which I being a lowlevel peon did not have This is why I had written all the documentation and use notes so that I could give it to the effectively Level  server team for implementation  I had written Buffy in spare moments gleaned from the unrelenting waterfall of incoming tickets during lunch breaks and government tea breaks and otherwise largely in my head while working on other items I would arrive early and pore over Perl syntax stay back late and run regexes It was my very first Perl script of any length and a labor of love I worked on it for weeks polished it until it shone and then went capinhand to the Level  team  Guys I said I know were having a problem with network response in the morning and evening and with INI files being readonly and copying themselves around the network I know its causing problems with service levels and the ability of staff to do their jobs I have here a script with full and complete documentation which I think might be able to help Would you have a look at it  And the Level  team said      No      And that was the end of Buffy    Next time I don my black hat and tend to The Server Which Didnt

offended to say the least I was here to meet a client and if Mr Johnson liked watereddown synthahol and cheap smokes then he could save money for my payoff I sat down in the booth across from Johnson who indicated that our meeting would take place in the Matrix My avatar a shining robohumanoid from the s stood face to face with the bars generic avatar resplendent in its logorich clothingThis is your target Once the evidence is obtained go loud Onsite procurementPiece of cake I nodded accepted the transfer of my perdiem and jacked out Ten seconds later fresh air curled around me and I stepped into an alleyway and was goneHello fellow TFTS patrons matrons and genderneutraltrons  here with another tale of that most blessed of lists the Black List For those not in the know one of my previous positions had this idea implemented At this time my boss was an awesome guy and hed listened to my idea of The Black List had me get the numbers together and pitched it successfully to the CO level The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us with proof that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communicationWe last ran into Heavylegs when she was removed from the list two months prior to this incident It had been an interesting two months Her relationship with LesbianTech had devolved into some very catty attitudes both at work and away from work LT and I had become friends and I got to hear all of the details whether or not I wanted them This culminated in their breakup roughly a week before this incident and LT took some time off to get her life in order Amazingly shed grown a backbone but shed also developed a distaste for IT and took a vacation to see where her head was atOne more bit of information as it was necessary I had also befriended Heavylegs She and I managed to forge a friendship over a mutual practice of the martial arts Roughly a week after her inclusion on the list we started meeting up for sparring sessions every Monday Wednesday and Friday These were great for getting the stresses of life out of our minds and some frustration out of our bodies I had no idea what this would lead to in the future but for the first two months it was purely friendship I used this time to encourage her to work towards the communication goal of the Black List removal process and she started to come around over that two month periodOn to the story Heavylegs worked in a part of our company that was wellknown to be something of a meat grinder grueling work tons of overtime necessary to keep up and people washed out quickly Heavylegs actually enjoyed the work and the challenge and she would often rise to the top of the Employee of the Month lists only for her conduct to knock her out of contention As she worked to change her attitude however she finally gained the coveted parking spot and gift card to Large Bird grocery storeThis absolutely infuriated The Mistake The Mistake is so named because she delighted in telling each and every person who spent more than five minutes with her that she was precisely that a mistake Her parents hadnt meant to have her she said The abortion had failed she said Whatever I made sure my techs stayed far away from her and dealt with her myself The L guys had far too much to deal with already they didnt need this particular ball of crazy mucking it up for themThe Mistake had heard about Heavylegs and her Black Listing and thought it was a perfect reason for her to be disqualified from ever holding the title of Employee of the Month for their department We didnt care HR specifically excluded the Black List and its participants from any sort of harassment meaning someone could be Employee of the Year if they wanted regardless of whether or not we had them on the List The Mistake didnt care for that and campaigned for justice in the easiest and most noble way that anyone ever coulnope Cant even finish that with a straight face She was passiveaggressive to the extreme To anyoneWell as this incident rolls around shed been collecting signatures for people who believed that ITs Black List was enough of a reason not to be EotM It may have had a few signatures I dont care What did bother me was that her submitted ticket metrics quadrupled during the month that she was going to war These werent all completely stupid tickets but neither were they things that I would suspect were happening by coincidence  We replaced the batteries in her wireless keyboard and mouse no less than five times during the course of one month The batteries we had lasted far longer than that were rechargeable and were tested before being deployed  Her monitor cables suddenly stopped working three times When I tracked this I noticed that the nonfunctional cables were actually damaged and were likely damaged intentionally by someone pulling a pin out of place in the connector  The computer would randomly shut off restarting and needing to run CHKDSK Upon inspection the power cord looked like it had been manipulated away from the wall plug in such a manner as to bend it This was replaced twice Thats ten tickets per month not including tickets for email being lost and other stupid things on our proprietary system Maybe a bit excessive but I like to be absolutely certain so I rocked on down to the L room ordered some Chinese for everybody and went desk to desk Tell me about The Mistake and your interactions with her I would say and they would respond Oh did they ever respondThe Mistake was a needler She would constantly belittle the techs when they were on the phone with her or in person with dozens of little phrases My favorite was actually Why do they pay you people to do this when a nutless monkey could do it when it came to installing batteries One of my Ls had a healthy and robust fear of the woman because she apparently found him attractive enough to flirt with He described her as a Glaad bag filled with oatmeal and beaten with sticks and having fallen from the same ugly tree as Honey Boo Boos entire family Both techs would be forced to spend  minutes for the simplest of tasks because The Mistake would block the way out of her cube until her inane questions or disgusting flirtations were answeredChinese food was had drinks were promised and I told them to pass me her next ticket They did so eagerly not one hour after our lunch Another battery failure Id instructed the techs to check the batteries when they went down but theyd eventually just replaced them in the vain hopes of getting out quickly I picked up a pair of dead batteries that had yet to be recharged and headed on down to her desk As I approached The Mistake was standing at the entrance to her cube and waiting She deflated a bit when she saw it wasnt her Tech In Shining Armor but that didnt stop me Our Hero Kamen Rider IT TM The Mistake Like The Voice but without Christina Aguilera Or talent Or devoted fans Morning Mistake I hear your batteries are dead in your mouse againTM You people should just replace the fucking thing Knock off the swearing or Ill give you a wired mouseI enter the cube while The Mistake grabs a sheet of paper and blocks me in I mime the act of replacing the batteries instead just reseating them This takes about fifteen seconds due to wanting to give the right impressionTM You need to sign my petition Its to stop people from being awarded gifts by the company if theyre on your list I dont need to do anything Our list is excluded from that sort of consideration Its our list not the companys listTM What do you mean We made sure HR knew what our plans were with this list and it isnt considered part of the companys strike policyTM So So your plan isnt going to work People can still be Employee of the Month Theyre on our list because of how they treat us and our policiesTM I dont care sign this Itd be the first useful thing you do all dayIve now finished Its that sort of attitude that led us to establish the list By the way your mouse is

hoinurd,84,99,1ehjtr,512,This happened a few years backI work for a small manufacturing company with limited IT resources  We had at the time an inhouse Exchange  server with about  mailboxes  Well eventually the size of the store was getting too big we were running out of hard drive space  So my bright idea was to move the Exchange store to a temporary external drive after a couple good tape backups of course shove bigger hard drives in the server then move it backSo Saturday morning I hooked up an external drive and started the move process within ExchangeI dont know how many of you have ever tried something like this but once you start moving the store there is no cancel option  So it starts moving  And immediately I see a BIG problem  And then two seconds after that I realize what the problem is  And then one second after that my life flashes before my eyesThis old server an HP DL G or G series cant remember has USB  ports  Its moving data to the external at an incredibly slow rate  And like I said theres no cancel so I have to let it goI started that process midmorning Saturday and it didnt finish moving the store completely until pm Sunday  At this point Im screwed I cant start moving it back or people will be without email for two business daysMy only choice was to run the Exchange store on an external USB drive for an entire week  It worked there were a few glitches along the way  I had to restart the store several times due to IO errors but it made it through the weekIn the interim I purchased a USB  addin card for that POS server  Finally when the weekend rolled around I installed the USB  card and moved the store back to the internal RAID drives  It took  minutes to move it backPretty scary deal running a  gig Exchange store on an external USB drive for a weekEDIT  Some pictures for fun First of all the server itself  This is as it stands today  httpimgurcomnUjWVThis is the addin USB  card that I eventually got working  httpimgurcomztbRPUCant really see it but the builtin USB  port is under the iLo port  httpimgurcomEVHndtAn email  on May   explaining whats going on to boss at a remote location  httpimgurcomKTLCEmail conversation between myself and a coworker during the week as I was trying to get USB  cards to work its important to keep a sense of humor during times of disaster  httpimgurcomJdFPAHF,Exchange oops,611,TalesFromTechsupport

takes place in EastGermany many people have been confused about this American conventions for aesthetic purposes onlyPosting  hours ahead of schedule Yay would have been  if Reddit actually posted it instead of trying to fool me into thinking it was posted instead of not Anyway had a rough day at work so be nice The store was still doing well with selling Chinese knockoff items but the sales were declining each week Obviously it was because people started to notice that with these devices you get what you pay for Ron and Don however didnt think so it was all about service and the distance between us and the customerThe atmosphere in the store was still bad  months after the store outing and mainly the tension between Jeremy and Don and Ron was at an all time high Jeremy who could be so indifferent at times now had strong opinions whenever it concerned meHe did not really like the store all that much anymore He had never really had to much of a problem with it but started dreading going more and more every day He wasnt unhappy in his life or developed any desire to get a degree higher than college dropout He just felt like leavingI had seen Ron and Don during the week interviewing a lot of new people subjecting them to the same assignments I had gotten when I first came here I saw a few people I recognised from school and was a bit surprised about it since all of them knew my stories about working hereIt took another full two weeks before we had another team meeting I was getting sick of these things Aside from the usual folks we now had two new people Marcel and Johan  These are our two new employees to make sure that the store is staffed while you guys are out on the road we were toldExcuse me was the first thing Jeremy shouted What is this aboutWell we are going to offer service at home for our customers We all pausedSo this will mean that most of the time Jeremy Frank and Richard will be on the road with our new staff joining in as the new daytime store employees We already have a few reservations for our service for tomorrow so youd better be on timeThey quickly ended the meeting and said goodbye as if we werent allowed to even say anything about it I now had Marcel and Johan looking at me I grabbed Jeremys hand and left quickly I was not going to deal with them too  When Jeremy went to the store the next morning he had gotten a bike from Ron with the stores logo printed on the crate in front of it Its healthy for you and good for the environment Ron said rather cheerily and you have an appointment in  minutes so you better hurry He put a list of all the addresses in his hand and closed the store doorJeremy didnt like going to other peoples houses to fix their problems He was happy fixing their computers but not dealing with the people standing behind him yakking on about them He tended to get all kinds of questions as to whether he could look at their TV and vacuum cleaners as well as they are all electronics anywayPricing for the service was premium to say the least Easily  times more expensive than bringing the computer to the store However many customers didnt know this and lost their calm quickly after Jeremy told them the price He really did not feel comfortable doing this  Meanwhile I had to work with Johan and Marcel on a Saturday shift so as learn them the ropes as Don called it Hopefully it would not end like it did with Alex I quickly learned that Johan and Marcel were in their thirties and had worked in a couple of other computer stores but their resumes were rather empty when asked about them Work experiences were few and far between it seemed to me It wasnt too hard to figure out why this was they were hard to get along with Johan and Marcel tended to know it all better They werent stupid but smart was another story and social even more so They found themselves to be managers because of their age and infinite wisdom about computers I can understand why they were hired Ron and Don saw their younger selves in themMy shift with them was rather strange I knew just about everything about the store how to work the systems how to best stock the store how to make best use of the space and most importantly how to deal with the customers But somehow they knew it better then me and were glad to show me my mistakesA customer came into the store while I was explaining to them how the register worked It was a customer I knew and actually really really liked He looked like James Randy and loved old computers  the older the better He didnt come here because he liked the store that much but because we often had old stuff lying around that I sold him on the cheap He had invited me once to his house to see his collection of computers and it was simply amazing He had been working in computers all his life and had designed circuit boards for many systems throughout the years He had taken the time to explain to me how the systems worked and how complex they could be If I had to give my reasons as to why I am a hardware designer these days he would be on the list When he saw me in the store he walked up to me to say hi He didnt however get the chance as Johan and Marcel were fighting each other as to who was going to help this old man find a new computer He was overwhelmed at first by the insistence and aggressiveness of them both but quickly recoveredI only want to be helped by Leila as she has helped me countless times before Please go do something else instead of harassing me he said calmly pushing both of them aside He walked up to me and asked for the old Pentium processors I had called him about Meanwhile Marcel and Johan gave me an evil look while I walked away to get the processorsAfter that shift I started working less at the store doing only Saturdays and some weekdays at night I did not want to work with them Working with Richard Frank and Jeremy could be tiring at times but at least it was fun and we didnt make each other feel like shit  Meanwhile Richard and Frank were having the time of their lives going to their customers together They had convinced Ron to let them handle all the appointments and scheduled them to their benefits often going together to the same customerYou could tell they had even more fun browsing around peoples computers and finding out what dark parts of the internet they visited when they were actually with the persons in their house Getting free drinks and food from the people wasnt too bad eitherJeremy however was finding it harder and harder to go to work every day It wasnt something for him He really did not like it It was about  weeks in when he came across the prototype of a bad customerThe customer had the vague problem that his computer didnt work He never gave any specifics about it so Jeremy went in without any idea The computer was old and fragile It looked like the computer was a victim of domestic violence or at least was dropped a couple of times from the concrete stairs of the flat it was residing in The keyboard and mouse werent in any better condition and the screen had what looked like a couple of bruises Jeremy tried to talk with the customer as to what was wrong with the computer but no matter what question he asked the computer was always just not working Giving up Jeremy went to work and tried to start the computer It didnt work When he checked the cabling he found that the power cable had been completely torn apart He replaced the cable and tried again The computer turned onHearing the startup chime from Windows the man rejoiced and quickly pushed a huge list of poorly described problems into Jeremys hands saying he should fix those problems as well Somewhere around an hour into this process the customer started becoming angry and started shouting at Jeremy calling him a slow and worthless He also wasnt going to pay anymore because he was taking so long on purpose just to rip him offWhen Jeremy tried to calm the man down he started throwing books and other stuff at him Jeremy stood up and left He didnt care about the money or his job or anything He just wanted to get out of that house and to quit his job if they were going to keep making him do house callsIf it wasnt for Richard and Frank he would have Richard and Frank had secretly started their own business in a business They kept two agendas one from the store and their own one Reservations would be distributed around a  ratio on the agendas Easy cash and noone was the wiserThe scheme had been working brilliantly for some weeks and Ron and Don did not know anything about it That was until they got greedy They had been called by a old couple that had trouble with their TVs settop box Given they could earn a quick buck and the problem would not be difficult to fix they took down the job details in their second agendaWhen they were at the old couples home they found the issue quickly The settop box just needed to be restarted and the only way to this was by taking out the power connector and putting it back in It worked again To keep suspicion to a minimum they fiddled around with the setting and doing some other non relevant stuff for another  minutes and declared it fixedThey charged  euros The couple paid Two weeks later the couple had the same problem and they charged  euros again It was now that the couples son found out about this and went ballistic in the store at Don Don didnt know anything about it and called Frank and Richard They tried to keep the situation under control but the sixth sense of Don must have picked up on the missing money They were forced to show their secret agenda and it was now Ron who went ballisticFrank and Richard were fired right there and then It was mostly about the money that never reached Don and Rons pockets but also damage control to keep the rightfully outraged customer happy But it was too late The damage was already done,Chapter   Better call Don,1015,TalesFromTechsupport

slapped on the familiar IT Driver and drew forth the Antivirus Memory My partner opted for the Defrag Memory a good option in case we were dealing with a fragmentation caseAntivirus DefragHenshinGreetings fellow tech support gurus  here with another tale of that most blessed of lists the Black List For those not in the know one of my previous positions had this idea implemented At this time my boss was an awesome guy and hed listened to my idea of The Black List had me get the numbers together and pitched it successfully to the CO level The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us with proof that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communicationI have an absolute hatred for people who use whatever buzzword happens to be popular Sure there are times that such words are useful but other times they are more of a hindrance than a benefit Thishttpwwwredditcomrtalesfromtechsupportcommentskchjwtheblacklistaccountingdouchebaggery was an example of someone who knew what to say to get IT to respond immediately and it got him in deep waterMy least favorite word is urgent In any capacity of IT this word is seldom used properly URGENT can range from a keyboard with a stuck key to a massive citywide power outage At FirstAid we made sure to stress how much we loathed seeing that word and encouraged better classification of issues No one listened Including the microbiology and testing facility Everything was urgent to them and not just urgent I could filter out URGENT from our ticketing system and find no less than  hits All from this department whose RampD nature made them think they were the most important group at FirstAid The day in question was no differentA new tech had recently joined the group and I shall nickname her Girl Power Why GP was outgoing social bubblybutnotbraindead and most of all smart as a whip A box of whips A crate of whips on the USS Whip Gp knew her stuff but hadnt yet had the chance for practical experience beyond a Tier  helpdesk position She was my first hire and I was immensely proud to show her the ropes To this day shes like a kid sister and accompanied me on any rounds I needed to make I arrived one morning with my frequent armload of caffeine and fried sugar for the L techs and noticed that GP had brought them a case of Coke that morning A tear threatened to break past my defenses but I sucked it up and distributed the doughnuts as best as I could remember Several Ls mentioned that GP and The Boss were looking for me so I squared everything away and headed for my desk Nearly immediately after logging in I was pulled into a threeway IM conversation by The Boss It turned out that there had been a bit of a disagreement with the microbiology and testing labs regarding a series of computer issues that they were having They thought we should devote  of our resources in IT to fixing their computers and my Boss disagreedThe first message after The Boss explained things made me giddy with excitement You see GP had not yet been hipped to the Black List and while shed known we were hiding something from her she hadnt yet figured it out So when we were sent The Boss  time to brief your shadow on the listI may have peed a little Boss explained that three of the seven primary lab computers were experiencing slowdown of a degree that could not be remotely determined L techs had failed to placate the labrats complaints and cries of URGENToneone and someone had decided to fill out a ticket for the issueevery ten minutessince AM that dayIt was currently AMThe Boss released us to execute on our own recognizance and I swung by GPs desk to pick her up Armed with our wits and our skill we headed for the facility I briefed her along the way and I swear her eyes took on a glow that could only be described as PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER I then described the itty bitty living space part and also told her what to expect at the facilityAny of you who have done time near any sort of medical testing or waste will know that the smell is abysmal It smells like Godzilla took a runny shit on a bloated corpse added jalapenos and then cooked it all for a few years Between this and the nature of the work anyone entering the facility was required to wear biohazard suits after checking in We did so and entered the facility making our way quickly to the affected testing area What we found was no less horrific than a library with collapsed bookshelves Im no biologist or biochemist but the state of this particular lab went against every fiber of my being GP choked on what I can only suspect was bile as we took in the scene while I deftly stepped in front of her to meet the onslaught of researchersAlpha Douchebag decided to step up first and declare that we were hours late I raised a hand and cut him off Dont care Lead us to the affected machines More sputtering and cursing ensued and I raised my voice Ill call the board and have your team shut down if you utter another syllable Lead OnStunned silence shocked face and then finally blessed movement We were led to three machines in the back of the room near some of the dirtier sections of the room The machines in question were filthy and indeed sluggish I logged each user out and shut the machines down a nagging suspicion in the back of my head Instructing GP to disconnect the other two machines I unplugged mine and put it on its side Opening the case confirmed my suspicionsWhat could best be described as a growth of bacteria had crept into the motherboard It had started at the bottom and found a power line snaking its way towards the processor fan and the primary hard drive The former was I can only hazard a guess protected by the fact that it was moving blades that somehow kept the monster at bay The hard drives board however was covered and to this day I have no idea how this gunk hadnt made it INTO the drive itself and fried it  I immediately dropped the drive into the case and reached for one of the phones to call The Boss A similar clunk behind me told me that GP had found something similar in one of hers Boss you really arent going to believe what weve found hereAD IS THAT YOUR BOSS PUT HIM ON SPEAKERPHONE YOU IDIOTS NEED TO LEARN THE MEANING OF URGENTBoss I heard that Dont bother What did you findGP and I described the scene in excrutiating detail all the while keeping AD at bay I eventually handed GP the phone to tell her share of the story and squared off with AD Explain to me whyAD SHUT YOUR MOUTH I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR MY BOSS IS middle management person name AND SHE WILL NOT BE PLEASED AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS Perhaps then you should go ahead and call her downAD I WILLAD trundled off to call his boss and I turned back to wait for GP to finish She did and handed me back the phone The Boss authorized the Black Listing even before I asked about it but I wanted to make sure we had this one nailed down Boss is Matcha watching the camerasBoss He can be Do you need evidential backup I do Plus I need you down here AD is pulling his boss down here and were going to have a serious issue on our hands If you can bring HR Girl You arent going to believe the state of this roomBoss I believe you Were on our wayHanging up I informed GP of what was about to go down and she actually wrung her hands with anticipation We stood back and I moved the machines to give the cameras a somewhat better view but I knew better than to try to get pictures myselfIn came The Boss with HR Girl and both began to inspect the room When The Boss came down to us and looked in the computers he actually gagged Words never do this sort of thing justice GP and I agreed and HR Girl was positively green in her suit AD and ADs Boss arrived next and were stunned to find GP and I with backup AD barely entered into his tirade before his boss started walking toward us The Boss held out a hand to indicate that she should inspect the computers She did so with that trained calm that most researchers in movies are portrayed as having and looked at me then GP and finally my Boss before speakingIm a computer idiot and this looks bad even to me Are these machines broken because of this biohazardThe Boss looked to me and I shrugged I cannot be certain I refuse to work on this machine however due to this biohazard I refuse to let any technician under my umbrella work on this machine for the same reason and we do not have a safe room prepared for this sort of instanceMy Boss nodded his assent and ADs Boss nodded as well She turned to HR Girl and my Boss I formally apologize for this breach of containment for this bacteria I will get to the bottom of this immediately and accept any sanction for our team that is necessary as well as providing information on which bacteria this isAD was furious The Boss grinned and nodded at me and I delivered our favorite line to ADs Boss regarding her workers We have a list of several people who felt it necessary to submit tickets every ten minutes this morning about this issue neglecting to inform us of the state of your lab These users also decided that it was necessary to use words designed to make this problem our top priority In hindsight it should have been everyones priority Due to their conduct with our ticketing system with the authorization of Director of IT and backed by Director of Operations as well as supported by HR Director I am notifying you that your techs names here are now on the IT Black List This means that they will not be permitted to submit helpdesk emails they will not be allowed to delay any updates and they will not be responded to in any form regarding an ITrelated incident HR Girl is here to witness this as well as to take evidence for FirstAid as necessary for conduct in this labADs sputtering obscenities could be heard behind all of us making sure we knew that we were all morons and that their very important research was being ruined by our carelessness ADs Boss was red in the face either from anger or embarassment She nodded with my statement and apologized again and we took our leave For the next week L techs were treated to lunch by the Microbiology and Testing Department as an apology for flooding the queues GP was a bit shaken from how disgusting everything was but caffeine set her straight We decided to completely destroy the hard drives since they were little more than OS drives with shortcuts to various network programsdrives anyhow rather than even attempt to clean them They were disposed of in accordance with state and federal lawsOh and AD was fired and I think sued The litigation would have left his asshole in ruins Turns out he was the main perpetrator of the labs conditionI never stepped foot in the labs againTLDR Shepards Biotic Charge

sezzme,104,113,1gy4bx,503,EDIT dang this turned out longer than I expected  My apologies A TLDR has been providedThis dates back from back in the days before Pagemaker gave way to Adobe InDesign  So there I was younger version of me working away in a print shop when an order came in from the local cable company office  They had some x pages that kinda looked like a spreadsheet with text inside each box cell whatever the heck you call it  This was a lot of text in very small typeWhat they wanted seemed simple change some various bits of text in certain cells and send it off for printing  Copy a block of text from one column and replace the existing text in another column  Seemed easy enoughNot quite  Whoever originally created this graphic file had decided that the best way to format the text was to type something in a cell hit the spacebar several times to end up in the next cell type that text rinse and repeatThis text was not in column format to start with So when I tried to change or cut the text whatever text was below that cell just went kablooey  YikesWhat we needed was to convert this word salad into pretty much one looooong column  Then I could easily format it back into proper multiple columns in PagemakerAfter pasting the text into whatever word processing program I had at the time I started copying and pasting by hand to try to transform it into that long column timing the work as I went  I then did some math and realized that completing this job asis would take about  hoursI called my boss over to look at it and tell him the bad news  After some discussion he was about to break the news to the client when I had a brainwave and told him to come back in a couple of hoursI immediately called a fellow geek and said  Email me a copy of Word Perfect  NOW   Ill explain laterI used to create newsletters in Word Perfect  back in the day  One thing I loved was the macros  you could do some pretty neat complicated things with WP macros  You could take a bunch of spaces and turn them into a single semiobscure character such as a  symbol   Then you could create another macro to notice the  and do something cool with it such as copy whatever text was below it and paste it wherever you wanted  Too many years have gone by for me to remember the exact macro sequences I created to accomplish what happened next  All I know was that I started by having it change the damn spaces to some obscure character then used that obscure character as the beginning of a series of macros to have WP cut and paste each bit of text into one sweet long column which I could easily format properly in Pagemaker   This included deleting the obscure character as it went from one bit of text to the next  Total time   minutesI showed the boss what I did  It blew his mind  He praised me in an employee meeting later that weekSome experienced coder later told me  Sezzme you think like a programmer  You were doing real programming right there  That compliment felt even better than the boss bragging on me TLDR  Desktop publishing environment  Dragged Word Perfect  back from the dead to reformat a bunch of badlyformatted text into a sweet convenient clean column format changing  hours of work into  minutes   Took advantage of macro capability that only this ancient DOS version of WP had as far as I knew   Got compliments from the boss  Some coder later told me I should be a programmer,Ancient DOS version of Word Perfect saves the day,616,TalesFromTechsupport
munky,115,170,yt3gl,505,This is from my first ever IT job I got a job for a small ISP as a linux and network admin I found routing problemsnot fix I maintained the dns and mail services and I did commercial intertube installs Now something that is common is that ISPs provide a relay host for business mail servers The purpose largely is to keep your owned ip addresses clean from any lists That way if  customer leaves and you give their IP to someone else theres going to be no problem of RBLs for the new customer So naturally lots of businesses are doing this and just about every IT place would immediately blame the ISP mail serversWell back story is that there was this one customer who spent loads of money and was constantly spending more and more They had  mlppp internet connectionsused at most like  dsl connection and other services we were selling and they were in line to buy our future products They needed basically none of it The part however is that the IT person at this place was a  and she always got her way She also had a very large budget but she didnt have the first clue about what to do in her job however everyone bent over backwards for her because she was very flirty and hotSo I get a call from her saying no emails are being sent out and i check postqueue I see nothing stuck I check maillog and grep for their domain I tell her I am seeing here that I am getting emails from your business and they are being delivered for example so and so sent an email  minutes ago with subject of blah blah I then check and see nobody else is having problems I send a test email to her to see if she received it and she could reply According to her she never received it So I check maillog and follow the transaction Their mail server absolutely did receive the email I ask her to tell me what email they were trying to send to and see if theres something I get told and I send a test email explaining the situation briefly The person gets back to me within like  minute I also check maillog and I can see my email I can see past emails from lots of other businesses I never see a single attempt from anyone at this applicable placeSo I basically drew the line I said that their mail server isnt my responsibility and Im much too busy to do a back and forth with her That their exchange server must have some block or their antispam is blocking it or smtp connector is pointed the wrong way I didnt know what was wrong but it was certainly not at my end She counters We have an SLA with you guys and for every second we are down this is costing us millions we are going to sue you if you dont fix this Which mind you theyre a nonprofit which had only been open a few months and theyd gotten ridiculous cash from the government to open their doors I reply Well we dont have an SLA with you and nothing is actually down that we are responsible for so theres really no point in threatening a lawsuit Plus the only way I could fix this would be to connect to your server and fix itShe liked that answer Well you better connect to the server now and fix it and I reply I cant connect to your server without a contract and indemnification of liability and I dont even want to fix it so this is pretty unlikely for me to fix for you However I gave you some ideas why it might be down and really the question you should be asking is what changed and that will tell you why its not working She then admits Well I was just on there changing settings and then it stopped working I just stayed silent for a good minute and she would say are you still there and I would just say yep and after about a minute of basically silence shes like so have you finished thinking about how to fix it and Im like No I was just waiting for your words to sink into your own head You did something and now it doesnt work just undo what you didShe was angry again I dont remember what I did I changed lots of things However if you dont fix this for me Im going to go to your boss and tell him how terrible you are and cancel all our services if he doesnt fire you Well I happened to want to quit at this point so I reply would you like me to give you my boss phone number now of note here my boss absolutely hated when we gave his  to customers because he would chill at home doing nothing and would only have to work when a customer called him and hed be extremely mad that we gave his  out However in this case I already knew she had it and thats exactly what she saidThen I basically was like Well is there anything else I could help you with today and you could hear papers being tossed and then you could hear her cup her phone so nobody could hear her and she whispered I want you to fix it for me or Im going to get you fired and I respond Sorry but this isnt going to happen if you want I can tell you some phone numbers for some local IT businesses that could help you out You could hear her typing angrily and shes like Ive already racked up  in bills this month from IT businesses in the city Thats why I need you to fix it before my boss finds out and questions whats going on Im was taken aback by that number and say nothingI think she was starting to realize wtf was going on Fine Ill call one of the IT businesses and if we find out that it was you all along youre done and she hung up I go tell coworkers about what happened and send email to my boss because I know he might care I then find out how we got them to buy so many of our products apparently anytime theres a problem like this we would just have her buy this new whizbang thing that they were pushing that month and while we installed or did that work wed fix her other problem on the downlowI never did hear from her again as I quit that job not that long afterwards but my next job after that I had heard about how she would get them to do work and then shed have another IT place go in find any problems and use those problems to not pay for the other The IT places started to clue in and play hardball right backTLDR Woman got a job as IT and loved to tinker with things she didnt know Spent too much money with IT outsourcing to get things fixed Started threatening me the ISP to get free tech support,Fix it for me or Ill get you fired,675,TalesFromTechsupport
