Psychotc,641,1200,13gnjm,4005,"Like most sane individuals, I am on my countries national do not call list. Unfortunately, a few less than scrupulous companies didn't get the memo. This is the story of how I provided ""tech support"" to one in particular.

For the past few months I have been receiving calls from telemarketers asking if I want %voiceSpammer%'s services. The first few times I politely told them to respect the do not call list and do not call again. When they kept on ignoring that I figured it was time to use my VOIP support abilities for some fun.

So one evening, I was hanging out with my family, raising my kids and such, when I hear my phone politely inform me that there is a long distance call coming in. Looking at the caller ID, I see the number of someone who legally should not be calling me. Being slightly bored I answered and prepared to have some fun.
This telemarketing company gave away alot of information about it's system within the first few seconds of a call. By having 5 seconds of silence followed by the unmistakable default [asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) Conference join sound, I already know what software they are running, how they manage their agent queue and quite a few ways to forcefully ask them to not call again.

Once I heard the conference connect beep I have to work quickly to set my trap, hoping that they would take the bait.

 
 
me: ""Tech support, can I have your agent # please""

Spammer: ""........ Um hello, I'm calling from %company% and""

me: ""I'm going to stop you there. Your system has detected that there is a issue with your workstation and has automatically sent you through to tech support. Can I have your agent ID please""

Confused spammer: ""Is this Mr Psychotc I'm speaking with""

Me: ""No, your system is still displaying the last expected connection on the screen, however you have been connected to tech support due to the issue which your system detected. Can I have your agent ID so I can help you with this?"" *I'm obviously making a guess about what type of setup they might have, hoping that I'm close enough to completely lure the prey into the trap*

Sheep: ""Oh, ok, my id is %probably a default setup value incremented by the number of agents%

Me: ""Ok, thank you now I just need some info while I pull up your system. Can you take a quick look at your phone? Does it say ""polycom"" on the front?""

Sheep: ""Yes""

Me: "" Ok, I'm showing a potential issue with your phone. I need you to run a diagnostic on the phone. Can you let me know when you are ready?""

Sheep on the ramp to the abattoir: ""Ok, what do I have to do?""

Me: ""Ok, on your phone I need you to press 4, 6, 8 and * at the same time, let me know when you are done

Sheep: ""Ok, it's asking for a password""

Me: *hoping their voip admin left things at default* ""Ok, now enter 456 as the password then press the button marked enter.""

Mutton: *unjoin conference sound*
 
 

And it has been a few months since I last heard from them.

Some technical details for those who do not work with VOIP and polycom products. The sequence above is the reload firmware and reset to factory defaults hotkey and the default password to allow the reload. Most polycom phones take about 5-10 minutes to reload the firmware, reboot and reload settings. More if they didn't setup DHCP properly.

**TL,DR:** I know more about your phone system than your company does

phlogiston,489,2178,trffn,3892,"I thought I'd share one of my proudest moments as a bench tech.  I suspect most of us who are interested in this type of work frequently encounter customers with lost data.  Usually the issue is resolved with a simple undelete application, of which there are many.  Sometimes we have to roll up our sleeves and image the disk and attempt to recover readable files.  No matter the method, it's the best feeling in the world to be able to call the customer and tell then you did recover their wedding pictures or important school work.  The look on their faces when they come in to pick up the freshly burned DVD with their critical data makes you forget all the mouthbreathers with their insect ridden e-machines (almost). 
 
But then there's that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you plug in the customer's PC and hear the ""click BANG"" or ""BOING whirllllll"" of a failed HDD while the BIOS reports no bootable drive.  You have to look them in the eye and tell them you are already 99% sure the drive is dead and there is nothing you can do about it.  You hand them the little card with the number to DriveSavers or similar professional data recovery and warn them it's going to cost a lot of money.  You are kind enough not to scold them about their lack of a backup, that would only cause pain now.  They already know. 
 
Flash back to 2007.  One morning I get to the shop to find a customer standing outside the front door with one of those ubiquitous claim-shell Dell PCs under an arm.  The look in his eyes alone tells me all I really need to know about the situation.  I tell him to come in and put the PC on the counter.  We exchange niceties as I plug in the monitor and keyboard and turn it on. 
 
We encounter the message he told me to expect, the PC can't find a bootable drive.  I open it up to make sure everything is plugged in and notice the drive is not spinning.  Not good, but there could be an innocent answer.  I pull the drive and try it out with a known good power supply.  Unfortunately with the same result. 
 
I tell him ""(Customer), it seems you have a failed hard drive.  Since it won't spin up I can't really help you.""  His exact words: ""It doesn't matter what it costs, please get my data back!""  It turns out this guy is an office manager at a local veterinary practice.  It must be a fairly big organization as they employ about 10 vets and about 40 other folks including cleaning staff, etc.  This PC under his arm contains the entirety of their accounting everything.  Payroll, tax stuff, accounts receivable, everything.  He explains that they will go out of business if they can't get the data on that drive. 
 
I let him know that data recovery from a failed drive takes specialized skills and resources, neither of which we have in this mom 'n pop computer repair outfit.  I give him the DriveSavers card and tell him to be prepared for a bill in the $1000's if they are successful at all.  Considering the importance of his data I thought it was a no-brainer to go this route.  $2000 is nothing to a medical office likely billing out over a million dollars each year.
 
Well, I would not be writing this if the dude had any sense. 
 
He's like: ""$2000 for data recovery?  And it might take weeks?  I don't know... Can't you do it?""  I tell him the truth:  If I try to recover his data and fail there is a huge chance I'll make it worse and less likely for a professional data recovery specialist to get it.  He really needs to go to the specialist.  Yet despite this, he continues to talk me into it telling me they can't possibly go weeks without this PC.  They need their data by tomorrow for tax reasons. 
 
So I told him to give me his number and I'd do some research and get back to him.  I call in my fellow nerds and we research (our Google-Fu was strong that day).  We end up with a list of about 8 or so things to try to order them by risk.  We even manage to find two of the same model drives from the junkyard downstairs to look at.  By early afternoon I think we've learned what we can and I call the customer. 
 
I tell him I'll try it, but it's foolish.  He describes an office in pure chaos and says they are willing to take the risk.  I tell him I'm going to charge $75 / hour for my time successful or not, to which he agrees.  I also tell him to bring in any other Dells they purchased as the same time as the broken one as I want more drives from the same batch if possible.  My boss prints out a unique addendum to our usual waver all customers sign, something to protect us from the consequences of potentially (likely) destroying this data and the other PC drives as well. 
 
Guy shows up 15 minutes later with sweat on his brow and three more clam-shell Dells.  We're lucky, the serial numbers on these drives are close enough be the same batch as the broken one.  These are a better match than the drives we already found.  So we now have the one failed drive and three good ones.   I go shopping to pick up items needed for the potential data recovery methods.  I purchase some dry ice, a couple of torque bits and eyeglass screwdriver to fit, ziplock bags, and microfiber gloves from a photography shop.  I try to make arrangements with a buddy who works in a chip fabrication plant to use their clean room if needed.  That was impossible but he was able to get me a couple of those dust free bunny suits and face masks.  Unfortunately they were pink.  But this was war so I did not complain. 
 
The first thing I try is swapping the PCB between a good drive and the failed one.  The good drive works fine with the failed drive's PCB, but the opposite is not true.  Next we tried putting the drive in a USB enclosure and plastic bags and cooling the drive with the dry ice.  After 1/2 hour we tried again, again without success.  I then tried powering the drive and kinda spinning it back and forth hoping to jump start the motor (or something?).  Needless to say that was not working.  We needed to open the drive up and see what secrets might be inside.  We took apart one of the three good drives to see if it was even possible to do a platter swap.  I've taken apart many drives and knew the most difficult part would be not damaging the heads.  Sometimes you have to remove the arms holding the heads to even get the platter out.  But luck was on our side!  The arm in these particular drives could be pushed down and would not get in the way when we pulled the platters!  Even better they smoothly went back onto the platters without hanging when you carefully pushed it back.
 
I dawned the bunny suit, much to the delight of the other nerds, and took the drive and tools into the bathroom.  I set an audiobook playing and started scrubbing wall to ceiling with wet rags to collect all the dust I could.  I taped over the air vent and along the door frame.  Then I collected hot water into a trash can and added the dry ice.  That much dry ice in that small room made quite a bit of fog which supposedly helps bring any dust out of the air.  I don't know if this actually works, but I was concerned about adding that much CO2 into a small sealed room.  I made it a point to hold my breath if I was reaching down to the floor.  After the fog was gone I noticed no ill effects and proceeded to phase 3. 
 
The actual platter swap went without incident and hardly warrants description in this story.  Just a few screws and aluminum spacer rings.  I just tried to line up the two platters so they were aligned the same way relative to each other in the new case.  Obviously I could not get nearly the same level of precision at the physical scale of the data on the drive, but I did the best I could. 
 
We held our breath while we booted up the bench PC with a Linux data recovery live CD.  It found the drive!  I started to read an image from the drive, which seemed to work fine.  I did a typical data recovery on the image and I FOUND FILES!!!  I actually recovered that data!  The customer was thrilled and didn't blink an eye at the bill (something like $700) or the fact we destroyed the other drives in the other PCs.  I even got a $100 tip for risking O2 deprivation and the ridicule of my peers. That evening we had pizza and Mountain Dew paid for out of the register.  I kicked butt at Counter Strike.  My wife called to say my Mother in Law was not able to visit after all.  It was the perfect day.","It doesn't matter what it costs, please get my data back!",6070
ronearc,416,1613,wc6gr,3644,"I was working graveyards, about a decade ago, doing Wireless Networking support for a major PC manufacturer. 

I get this call at about 2am. It's a woman, fairly young (early 20s maybe), and she can't get on the internet. She is getting connected to her router wired and wirelessly, but no internet. 

I walk her through some standard steps, but the router is still acting kind of funky, plus I think she had Comcast (we had a lot of trouble with them). 

Finally, in the troubleshooting steps, we get to the point where doing a manual reset on her router is the next best step before just replacing it. 

So I told her to pick it up, turn it around, find that small, recessed button on the back left, and use a pen to press and hold that for 10 seconds. 

After a brief silence, she asks, ""Where is this hole again?""

""On the back of your &lt;brand&gt; router, where you plug the cables in, it's on the far left.""

""Hmm, I don't see it back here...""

I'd done this many, many times before, and I knew the mistakes customers usually made, so I said, ""Move your left thumb, you have it over the hole.""

""Oh!...I'll be right back."" 

The phone click-clacks as it hits the desk, and the pattering of feet walking off in the distance can be heard. 

About 30 seconds later, the footsteps are back and getting closer. Then she picks the phone up again. 

She says, ""Ok whew, I'm ready now. I just had to put a robe on, I didn't know you had cameras on these things. Sorry for the free show.""",I just had to put a robe on...,5257

Circa 2003.

Week 1 Saturday, calling regarding ridiculous ping to the outside world (400ms+). After 45 minutes of music.  
**Tech 1**: &lt;Speech&gt;  
**Me**: &lt;Account Info&gt;  
**Tech 1**: How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have been having a very high ping to the internet after about 4pm till about 9pm everyday since I got your service installed. I have tried restarting the modem, the router and my computer.  
**Tech 1**: Please restart your computer.  
**Me**: OK. But, I have already done that. [I actually had restarted my computer, but I did it again anyways.]  
**Tech 1**: I understand but we need to make sure that this doesn't fix it.  
**Me**: Well, I get these high pings from all five of my computers, not just the one I am working on right now.  
**Tech 1**: Um, how do you have five computers using the internet?  
**Me**: With my router.  
**Tech 1**: Uh... A what?  
**Me**: A router.  
**Tech 1**: Sir, we don't support non-standard equipment.  
**Me**: Excuse me?  
  
10 more minutes goes by as I disconnect my router, directly connect my computer to the router and power cycle the modem twice such that my PC's mac address would get registered with their system(relevant). The high ping remains and I eventually get the tech to say the magic words:  
  
**Tech 1**: It looks like we are going to have to send out somebody.  
**Me**: Thank You.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Next Monday the tech arrives and we go down to the drop. I had not been present for the installation. The drop was in a locked basement inside of a locked cabinet, both of which will be relevant later. The /r/CableFail was truly astonishing. The single RG6 line that came in from the street was split 48 times. None of the lines were labeled. There were 9 splitters involved. We spent the first 15 minutes yelling at each-other, 4th floor window to exterior basement door, to figure out which line was mine through the process of disconnecting one connection at a time. Mine ended up being the forth split down. RJ6-&gt;6Way-&gt;4Way-&gt;3Way-&gt;3Way-&gt; Me, which I had split again with a 2Way. One for cable, one for internet.  
  
**Me**: Well, what can we do about it?  
**OnSite Tech 1**: I dont know.  
**Me**: It works in the morning and late at night.  
**OnSite Tech 1**: It is probably because when people get home in the evening they turn on their tv/internet and you are getting interference.  
**Me**: So, what can we do about it?  
  
The OnSite Tech closes and locks the cabinet.  
  
**OnSite Tech 1**: Nothing. It is a wiring issue on the premises. We are not responsible. Talk to your landlord.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
My landlord was more or less a slum lord (Oakland). The building was falling apart and was in serious need of repair. The landlord, to put it mildly, didn't care. I was frustrated. By the time I got done playing phone tag with my worthless piece of shit of a landlord I had decided that I needed to talk to Comcast again.  
  
Week 3, Thursday. Still have a ping of 400ms. After 30 Minutes of elevator music. 2:00pm.  
**Tech 2**: &lt;Intro&gt; What can I help you with?  
**Me**: I have had a very high ping to the outside world between the hours of 4pm till 9pm rendering my Internet unusable. I am interested in obtaining a partial refund for the time.  
**Tech 2**: I am sorry to hear that sir. Would you please reboot your computer?  
**Me**: This is not an issue with my computer. Comcast does not have a large enough drop for the apartment building I am in.  
**Tech 2**: I am sorry to hear that sir. We need to go through these basic troubleshooting steps to see if we can alleviate the issue.  
  
For the next twenty minutes I play repair man. Eventually the tech once again says the magic words.  
  
**Me**: Can I schedule the tech to come between 4pm and 9pm?  
**Tech 2**: Very well sir. You will have to wait until next Thursday if that is the time slot you want.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 4, Thursday. OnSite Tech 2 arrives around 4:30pm. Perfect. After explaining the issue and what the last tech had said he checked the signal in my apartment.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Lets go look at the box downstairs.  
After unlocking the basement and the cabinet he lets out a low whistle.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Which one is yours?  
**Me**: This one.   
I point at the line that goes to my apartment.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Alright, so here is the issue. You have way too many splitters between your line and the drop coming in. I am going to replace the ends on your line to ensure we can get the best possible connection and then I am going to check the pole. We can run a new drop but that could take up to six months.  
  
At this point the tech looks at me.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I am not allowed to reorder these splitters because they are the owners property and other customers utilize these lines.  
  
And now I realize he is staring deep into my soul.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: The customers with these [things](http://www.cabletechtalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/trap_filter-300x182.jpg). Do not have internet and only subscribe to basic TV.  
  
Here he gestures to several of the lines. He lets his hand come to rest on a filtered line. I blink. It is connected directly to the first splitter.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: They require much less signal. It is going to take me 5 minutes with my 7/16 wrench and crimps to replace this tip. Then I will be on the pole for twenty minutes. Then I will come back to your apartment to check your signal again. I am sorry but I am **NOT** fixing this for you. I simply **can't**.  
  
I blink again. Twice actually. The tech turns his back on me and starts removing my line from the splitter to replace the tip. I back out the basement door and bolt upstairs. I pull out my wrench set and grab my 7/16. I run back downstairs just as the tech leaves the basement. He doesn't close the door. I wait until he walks out the front gate. Inside the basement I find the cabinet is closed but unlocked. Quick, quick, quick I am taking my line and switching it with the filtered line on the first splitter. After everything is tight I close the cabinet and run back upstairs. The tech, true to his word, showed up at my door twenty five minutes after this all started. I had already reset my modem and had a 15ms ping to Google. Success. After testing, my line ran with acceptable numbers.  
  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I am glad that replacing the tip on your line improved the signal to such an extent. I am going to go lock up the cabinet now.  
  
  
And he was gone into the night. I really, honestly, truly wish that this was the last I would have to see him. But it wasn't. No. It can never be simple with Comcast. My connection had improved considerably. A vast majority of the time I was receiving my advertised speed. I could download/upload/torrent to my hearts content. The only problem I had was when I would attempt to connect to a server in Southern California. You see, anytime between roughly 4pm and 9pm I would have a ping of 200+ms to any server south of San Jose. This wouldn't normally be a problem for average web browsing, but I also happen to be a gamer. And for online gamers, latency can be the difference between life and death. How did I know that the problem was in San Jose? Traceroutes. Tons of them. Automatically generated every minute, every hour, every day. The issue appeared to be that the peering between Comcast and Level 3 in San Jose consisted of two 56k modems and smoke signals. Graphs of average latency times over the course of the day showed two bumps. A small one in the morning as people woke up for coffee and internet and a longer one in the evening when people got off of work and decided it was time for a good wanking. I decided to do comparisons with some friends from around the bay area. Apparently Comcast routed everything from the entire Bay Area through that L3 peering arrangement in San Jose. This was confirmed by OnSite Tech 2, the third time I met him.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 7 Friday. 5pm. Cannot ~~play~~ ~~win~~ enjoy any matches due to higher than average pings. 30 Minutes of music.  
**Tech 3**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have an issue where when I connect to some servers south of San Jose I get high pings and it is difficult to enjoy my games at those pings. It is only during high traffic times and I have the traceroutes that describe the issue.  
**Tech 3**: Will you please restart your computer.  
**Me**: Look, I know what the issue is. It is not with my computer I can demonstrate that it is a problem with Comcast's network.  
**Tech 3**: I am sorry sir, but we must go through these steps to ensure that it is not your equipment. Often times restarting your computer will fix many problems.  
**Me**: I know. I have restarted my computer many times. Trust me. I have traceroutes that identify the issue.  
**Tech 3**: You have what?  
**Me**: Traceroutes.  
**Tech 3**: Uhh... I am going to elevate you to Tier 2.  
15 Minutes of music.  
**Tech 4**: &lt;intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: &lt;Explains the situation&gt;  
**Tech 4**: Can you please restart your computer.  
**Me**: No. Look. I have traceroutes that identify the issue. &lt;Explains about San Jose&gt;  
**Tech 4**: Sir, after reviewing the network status board it does not appear that there are any issues on our network. This is most likely an issue on your end.  
**Me**: Look, can I send you the traceroutes?  
**Tech 4**: The what?  
**Me**: &lt;Growling&gt; Traceroutes. They show the path that your connection travels between your computer and the server you are attempting to reach.  
**Tech 4**: ... I am going to transfer you to another tech. Please hold.  
30 Seconds of music.  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: I have traceroutes that identify a connection between the Comcast network and Level 3 in San Jose as the source of an exceptionally high ping that makes it difficult to play games online.  
**Tech 5**: Interesting... I am going to send a tech out to your location to see if it is in relation to your earlier support tickets.  
**Me**: ... I can plainly see that I get a sub 10ms ping to everywhere else in your network before the San Jose hop.  
**Tech 5**: How about Monday at 10am?  
**Me**: ... Really?  
**Tech 5**: Yes.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 8, Monday, 10am. OnSite Tech 2 shows up and smiles at me. I try to tell him everything that is going on.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Let's go down and look at your line again.  
I am worried he is going to say something about the fact that I moved my line. He opens up the cabinet and smirks.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: I *forgot* which one was your line. Which one is it?  
I identify my moved line. He comments on the fact that it seems to be in an advantageous position and shouldn't be the issue. At this point he says he is going to go up on the pole and do some monitoring. For the next two hours his van sits outside the apartment complex. He comes back and informs me that he will be unable to fix the issue at this time because he cannot identify anything other than the fact that the lines in this area are old and need to be replaced. He said that might happen within the next two to ten years. As he leaves,  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Keep calling.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
For the next two weeks I call every other day and get the run around. They are refusing to offer to send a tech out because the last report identified no issues. I am not willing to pay the eighty dollars to have a tech come out if I request it. Every time they insist that the network is operating normally and does not have any issues. Finally in the middle of week 11 I get escalated and after what feels like the hundredth time they tell me everything is fine.  
**Me**: THE FUCK IT IS. I CAN PROVE IT ISN'T.  
**Tech #20 something**: I am going to transfer you.  
**Me**: To WHO? Nobody you transfer me to listens to what I have to say or understands what I am telling ...   &lt;Immediately music cuts me off&gt;  
15 minutes of music later Tech 5 answers the phone.  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt; How can I help you?  
**Me**: &lt;I attempt to explain everything again&gt;  
**Tech 5**: We are going to send out the field tech again.  
**Me**: Again? This isn't going to fix it.  
**Tech 5**: I know.  
**Me**: What?  
**Tech 5**: After he is done, call this number ###-####.  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Week 12, Monday, 4pm. OnSite Tech #2 shows up. We talk. He goes up on the pole. He sits in his van. He wanders around the neighborhood and checks various other drops. Eventually he comes back to my door.  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Were oversold.  
**Me**: How much?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: All of it.  
**Me**: What?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Bay Area. All of it. Six months until the money people will even talk about buying more bandwidth.  
**Me**: Six months?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Yup.  
**Me**: Why, when it impacts everyone?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Most people never notice. Most people don't care.  
**Me**: What can I do about it?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: Keep calling.  
**Me**: Why?  
**OnSite Tech 2**: They only spend money to fix things if there are enough calls logged about an issue.  
  
  
The number Tech 5 gave to me turned out to be the number to his line. For the next two months I would call him every week and OnSite Tech 2 would come out and sit in his van for two to three hours. Then one day the call went a little differently.  
  
**Tech 5**: &lt;Intro&gt;. How may I help you.  
**Me**: I am still having the same problem with the high latency out of San Jose.  
**Tech 5**: I am **not** going to help you with this.  
**Me**: Excuse me?  
**Tech 5**: The network is *working* as it is *intended*.  
**Me**: Uh...  
**Tech 5**: We do not officially support 3rd party devices like your router. &lt;He has never brought this up before&gt;
**Me**: Um... Why not? &lt;Getting suspicious&gt;  
**Tech 5**: 3rd Party Devices like yours are able to change their mac addresses and we need to know that your mac address will not change to verify that you are the correct customer. &lt;This is obviously bullshit... but why?&gt;  
**Me**: I don't understand, but ok... What should I do about this issue with .. &lt;he cuts me off&gt;  
**Tech 5**: I am **not** going to do anything to address this. The network is working as *intended*. &lt;Someone must be listening into the conversation.&gt;  
**Me**: Ok.  
**Tech 5**: Please call the help line at 1-800-###-#### if your issues persist. &lt;And the line goes dead. Not like he hung up, just dead.&gt;  
  
10 to 15 seconds later there is a dial-tone. I check my traceroute logs. Just about 30 minutes before my call I see that my connection is no longer being routed through San Jose. I have 10-30ms pings to every server I can try.  
  
  
tl;dr ISP's are corporations driven by greed but there are always technicians at these institutions who know what they are doing. They know the situation is fucked up. They know the ridiculousness of the problem. Sometimes a problem is a problem because of the poor ethics of the people in the suits. Sometimes good techs have to work at scummy corporations to feed their families&lt;I intentionally left this out for anonymity purposes&gt;.

staticfactory,355,2727,w1o0s,3314,"Back in 2001 I worked the phones for a call-centre that provided outsourced tech-support services for an industry giant in the realm of ""American multinational computer technology corporations"". 


My average-handle-time numbers were never very good, and I was constantly being told to bring my call times down from the 20-or-so minute mark to under 16 (as per the service agreement with said corporation). 


While most of my co-workers had no problem dumping their callers as soon as possible (earning a big pat on the back from the floor managers) I was not able to just push my clients back into the endless cycle of 40+ minute wait times. My first-call resolution rate of 90% or better, however, was always at the top of the chart. Nobody gave a rat's ass about that, though.


For anyone that has been in my shoes, you'll agree that trying to actually *fix* a problem in under 16 minutes is pretty difficult. Add the fact that most customers vent on you for about 10 minutes before you can start to help them and there isn't much that you can do if you are in the business of actually supporting the system. So, I made the decision to ignore my AHT (as much as the managers would let me) and just try to fix everything as quickly as I could. There were times when they would just hover and stare at me if they saw that my timer was over.


One particular day, I end up on a call with a nice elderly woman. She was 75 and had received her computer as a Christmas gift from her son, who had put the service account in her name. What her son neglected to do, however, was get her a warranty that included service to go along with her replacement parts. 


In scrolling through the log of her ordeal with our ""technicians"", I find  that I am her 16^th call to support in 2 days. She had originally called to ask about error messages that she was receiving and had been taken through driver/app re-installations, system restore, the dreaded 6-call format/re-install (Windows ME, no less), and finally a motherboard replacement. How she was not filled with rage and fury is still beyond me.


Instead of the profanity-laced tirade that I had come to expect, Muriel was very pleasant. 


""I just received your parcel and I am ready to go!""


It took a moment for it to sink in, but it wasn't long before the realization hit. I had to walk this lady through a motherboard install.


While it occurred to me that most of my co-workers would have gone as far as to just dump the call by hitting the RELEASE button on their phone, I felt obligated to put an end to this saga. 


""Muriel, we are going to need a Phillips screw-driver for this. Do you have one handy?"" 


""I have one right here!""


She was ready to rock. While she was waiting in the queue, she had managed to unhook all of the external cables and get the case onto her dining room table. I opened my 3^rd extra-large triple-triple of the shift. It was on. 


She followed every instruction with precision and passion, as if she had been preparing all her life for this moment. I could hear her grunting and occasionally cursing under her breath as her crooked old fingers fumbled for dropped screws in the bottom of the case. 


I could mark the end of most steps with the signature ""plunk"" of a card or cable being pried free of its slot. Others she would confirm with a simple ""OK, got it! What's next?"" When the PCI cards went back in I would add ""Make sure it's seated nice and securely!"" to her refrain ""It's in there!"" 


45 minutes later, the tower was back under the desk for the first of what I figured would be many attempts at getting the system to fire up. The managers were circling nervously, trying their best to signal me to finish the call. I smiled and waved.


""OK Muriel, let's try the power button. Be sure to let me know what you see on the screen."" I listened closely and prepared to count the POST beeps. 


One beep.


""What do you see Muriel?"" 


""There was some white writing on a black screen but now it says WINDOWS ME.""


""That's a great sign! Is the light on the floppy drive lit?"" In the thousands of times I had re-seated a floppy cable, my success rate at getting it the right side up the first time had to have been less than 10%. 


""It was for a second, but it's off now."" 


*Windows_startup_music.wav*


One boot. Impossible! 


I had her look through the device manager for conflicts/""bangs"" for which there were none. I had her launch her office applications and open a few of her documents without any issues. Play an audio CD? Check! I even went as far as to have her test her internet connection (AOL dial-up) which required I call her back. No problems there either.


I was in awe. We had just completed an entire motherboard replacement with 100% accuracy in 45 minutes. Sometimes it would take users 15 minutes to find the My Computer icon. ""Muriel, this has been the single greatest call I have ever been a part of. You can now tell your friends that you have assembled a computer from scratch.""


She cackled. ""I had a lot of fun, but I hope you don't take it the wrong way when I say that I hope to never have to speak to any of you ever again."" 


**tl;dr: I walked an old lady through a motherboard replacement in 45 minutes.**

vonadler,296,1590,16jmmg,2923,"I worked tech support abroad, and we had a boss that was something out of the ordinary.

We did 1st and 2nd line helpdesk work in our respective native languages. Our teamleader, BBBBB (for big bad badass bastard boss), did not speak our language, so he was useless for day-to-day operations, but man, was he ever godsent for handling the internal troubles.

The man was in his 40s, fat, short, red-haired and bearded. He was so cynical that he could make vestal virgins cry. He was blunt, honest, straightforward and called bullshit when he saw and heard it. Naturally, the management hated him. He had, however, saved their collective arses more than once, and with his complete disregard for their opinions on him, his knowledge and experience, they could not get rid of him. He also had the smoothest silk tounge I have ever seen from a tech guy. Small, ugly and fat and balding, he still chatted up the most beautiful girls on account of his tounge and being the most confident bastard ever.

I still aspire to be like him (not completely, but in many things) and I learned a lot from him.

Here are some war stories from the 18 months I spent at that god-forsaken place.

**Team meeting.**

BBBBB brings up a powerpoint presentation with lots of animations, sound, colours and short snippets of text.

BBBBB: ""Whoops, sorry. That was the presentation for management.""

BBBBB brings up another presentation with lots of text and acronyms.

Me: ""You have a different presentation on the account for management?""

BBBBB: ""Yes, you have to. Management is retarded. Consider them drooling sheep to be herded in the right direction. And if they get this presentation, they go 'Oooh, pretty colours!' and I can get what I want. If I show them your presentation, they'll get bored and annoyed that they don't understand and decide against what I reccomend out of spite.""

**Doorwatcher**

Collegue: ""Hey, do you know that your boss is staring at a door?""

Me: ""What?""

Collegue: ""Yeah, he has spent at least 10 minutes just staring at a door.""

Me: ""Really? He must be waiting for someone.""

Collegue: ""He's standing a metre away from it, staring at it.""

Me: ""I am sure there's some explenation...""

Collegue: ""Who knows. Ask him when he comes back. Anyway, I have work to do. See you.""

Another 15 minutes pass, and then BBBBB shows up.

BBBBB: ""Hi [vonadler]. What's up?""

Me: ""Trying to get a hold of customers that wont answer their phones, as usual. What about you?""

BBBBB: ""I just spent 45 minutes staring at door.""

Me: ""What? Why?""

BBBBB: ""I wanted to talk to the manager inside. I knocked, he told me off, saying 'I'M BUSY!!!"", so I waited outside until he came out, pointed at him and said, 'Now you're not busy, now we deal with this.' Poor guy probably just wanted to use the loo.""

Me: ""..."".

**Stealing our own equipment.**

We worked 2nd line helpdesk, and as a part of our instructions, we were to have dual screens, one to remote take over the customer's system on, one to have our own systems on (this was standard on all help desks, even 1st line in our native country, but not where we were working now). We got brand new flatscreens to replace our CRT screens (in 2005!) with and started fighting about the graphics cards. BBBBB thought we could just open the computers and put in a new one (stationary ones, so it was easy). Asset management threatened that we would lose support. We said, hey, we are 2nd line windows support, we can support our own computers. Asset management then said we would void any hardware warranty if we opened the computers. So that was that. Instead, we purchased silly expensive crappy USB graphics cards (at least 20 times the cost of a basic graphics card capable of having two screens) and stashed them in our lockable drawers, waiting for our second flatscreen. And waited, and waited.

After several months, BBBBB went more or less ballistic. New equipment was arriving every week, but we did not get anything of it. Instead, it was used to replace old CRT screens at the sales department.

So, he went after a manager about it.

BBBBB: ""So when is my team getting their second screens.""

Manager: ""Well, we have other needs to prioritise right now.""

BBBBB: ""So, you are saying we are not getting them?""

Manager: ""It has worked fine for two months already, has it not? I don't think you really need them.""

BBBBB: ""We have the budget for it.""

Manager: ""Well, going under budget is a good thing.""

BBBBB comes back, furious, and hatches a plan. Using his silk tounge, he chats up the girl in the reception and gets her to agree to call him before she calls asset management next time there's a delivery.

BBBBB: ""Come on you vikings. Time for pillage and plunder. Follow me!""

Me: ""What? What are we doing?""

BBBBB: ""You shame your forefathers - I would have said pillage and they would have had their axes out. We're stealing our second screens, of course.""

Me: ""Very well.""

So, we went there, took screens off the pile of delivered equipment and ran back with them. As we are unpacking them, the manager comes running.

Manager: ""What are you doing!?""

BBBBB: ""Installing our second screen.""

Manager: ""You have not been assigned this equipment!""

BBBBB: ""Oh, I did not know that. Well, we have the budget for it, so you can just order some more screens, right? No harm done.""

Fighting BBBBB over this, when the screens were already in place, he had registered them in the asset management system, they were in operation and we had the budget was too much for management, so we got to keep the screens.

**Tolling, it tolls for thee.**

The country we were working in used the euro, and we all got lots and lots and lots of useless 1 and 2 eurocent copper coins (commonly called brownies) and change everytime we bought something. I managed to use most of mine when I was riding the bus. You could only use 5 eurocent and bigger in the softdrink machine, so the smaller ones were useless, and lots of people assembled large amounts of them. So, for fun and giggles, we started paying roadtolls to each other as we passed each others' desks. Basically just dumping whatever brownies you had at hand when you passed, to the curses of the one sitting there.

Then a poor guy went back home for an extended weekend, came back and found his desk COVERED in brownies. Most of the building had seen them accumulating on his desk, and took the opportunity to dump their change there as well. There were easily 1000-2000 coins on his desk. He sighed and cursed a bit when he got back.

Then he got a really slow case - some of the users on his account wre local admins, and now and then they would get a case with a computer completely filled with spyware and malware. He told the user to go home after lunch, connected to his computer and started the cleanup. Being bored just watching the status bar millimetring its way through the cleanup, he started sorting, piling and pyramiding the coins on his desk. After a while BBBBB passes by, sees on the screen that he is working, nods and keeps walking. After a short while, he returns and points to a small pyramid of coins.

BBBBB: ""That is one euro, isn't it?""

Collegue: ""Yeah, why?""

BBBBB throws a 5-euro bill on the desks and proceeds to rake in five piles of coins with a devilish smile.

Collegue: ""Nice. But what are you doing with the coins?""

BBBBB: ""The girls at the cafeteria fucked with me yesterday. I'm going for a coffee.""

**Learning well.**

Me and BBBBB are part of a documentation group. Management recently changed the document standard for no real reason at all, so we need to lift everything we've done to the new format. Manually, as they don't provide any kind of automatisation with the new format.

BBBBB: ""Management. I swear to god, if I could see their inbred genepool...""

Me: ""They don't have a genepool. They have a cesspool.""

BBBBB: ""...""

Me: ""What?""

BBBBB: ""I have taught you well, young padawan.""

**Exactly what we want.**

A team meeting discussing the latest ideas of re-organisation from management, trying to mitigate the disaster it would bring.

BBBBB: ""...alright, then we have a good plan.""

Collegue: ""Yeah, then we get EXACTLY what we want!""

Me: ""Salma Hayek covered in honey?""

Collegue: ""No, I..."" he goes silent for a second, thinks, and then breaks up in a big smile. ""Yeah!""

BBBBB: ""I really like how you think, [vonadler]. Let me google that. Ooooh.""

**Wow, that is WoW**

We also had a software distribution team that was over-staffed due to organisational changes. It also continued to work together with the team in the home country for several months, since they had a long notice time. So, there was work for 3 people, and there were 8 persons doing it. One of the guys at our place got bored, got a new job and gave his 4 week's notice. Since there were so little work, and the other 3 guys were not fully trained yet (as they got too little work to do to properly train), he and them agreed that he would not do any work for the 4 weeks' notice time. So he installed world of warcraft on his machine and sat there playing for 4 weeks.

BBBBB, who knows the situation, walks by and spots the collegue playing WoW.

BBBBB: ""What are you doing?""

Collegue: ""Playing WoW.""

BBBBB: ""What level are you?""

Collegue: ""32.""

BBBBB: ""Haha, I am better than you.""

He then proceeds to walk off.

aveilleux,841,2385,w79zp,2905,"This happened about ~~an hour~~ two hours ago. (Man it took a long time to write this up.) Sorry for the wall of text.

After working hard setting up the Cub Scout summer camp I work at seasonally, I come back home and unpack my stuff. About ten minutes later, the house phone rings. It's never a good sign when the house phone rings -- I only hand out my landline to services and such who need it, like my ISP (who handles my landline) and bank and so on. So, I pick up my phone with an ounce of dread.

""Hello, this is aveilleux, can I help you?"" (Old retail/support habits are hard to kick)

(Thick Indian accent) ""Yes, hello, is this Mister &amp;lt;my first name&gt;?""

""Yes, this is he. To whom am I speaking?""

""This is... Jason... from Microsoft Support. We were doing a routine scan of networks in your area and noticed that your computer may be vulnerable to viruses and other malware.""

At this point, my sense of foreboding instantly turns into a shining beacon of glee. I'd read about these kinds of scams before, and had prepared an unpatched Windows 2000 (yes, *that* Windows 2000) virtual machine for such an occasion.

""Oh, that sounds serious. Is there something I can do to help?""

""Yes, thank you Mister aveilleux. Are you in front of your computer now?""

""No, but I can be in a moment. Hang on a second, please.""

I set the phone down on my desk and stand up, stepping loudly on the uncarpeted section of my floor. After a few minutes and some Facebooking on my cell phone later, I take a seat again.

""Okay, Jason, I'm at my PC. What now?""

""Is your computer on?""

""I'm sorry?""

(Louder, with more enunciation) ""Is... your... computer... on?""

""Oh, is it on? I don't think so. Lemme just find the power switch real quick...""

I set the phone down again and start rustling things around on my desk, knocking my cup of pens over and yelling ""Oh, shit!"" and so on. I muck about for another minute or so, before launching Virtualbox and starting up my 2k VM.

""Okay, it says 'M... My-krow-sssssoft. Winnnndowssssss. Two thousand. Pr... Pro-pr. Proffesssshhhionalll.' Oh, shit, it's gone away. Oh, wait, here's my computer now."" (Referring to my desktop.) ""Okay, it's all booted up. What now?""

There's a pause where I think ""Jason"" didn't realize he was still muted, probably talking smack about me to a coworker.

""Jason? You there?""

""Yes, sorry aveilleux. Now, in the corner of your keyboard, in the bottom-left, is there a key with a little flag on it?""

""...Keyboard?""

""Yes, your keyboard.""

""What's a keyboard?""

I can hear the facepalm. ""The device attached to your computer that you use to type, aveilleux. That is your keyboard.""

I start banging things around on my desk again. ""Sorry, I think I've lost it under all the shit on my desk, give me a second..."" I crinkle a wrapper in the trash bin and rustle around a bit. ""Alright, I've uncovered the thing I type with... the keyboard?""

""Yes, aveilleux, the keyboard.""

""Okay. And I'm looking in the bottom-right for a key that looks like a cloverleaf?""

""...No, Mister aveilleux, look in the bottom-left for a key with a little flag on it.""

""A flag?""

""...Let's try this, In the bottom-left of your screen, do you see a button with the word ""Start"" on it?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Click on that, then click 'Run'.""

""Okay, I clicked on it, I'm looking for 'Run'? I see"" (picture the remainder of this sentence stumbling through pronunciation, I don't feel like typing it all out again) ""Set Program Access and Defaults, Windows Update, Programs, Docu--""

""It should be at the bottom, aveilleux.""

""The bottom?""

""Yes, 'Run' will be at the bottom of your Start menu.""

""...Ohhhh! I see it now! Sorry I wasted your time. Okay. I clicked on that. What now?""

""A little box should pop up in the corner. In that box I need you to type in,"" (he spelled this out) ""'eventvwr'. Okay?""

""Okay, I typed in 'event viewer'. Is that good?""

""No, aveilleux. I need you to type it in exactly as I spell it."" He repeats the proper spelling.

""I hit Enter and it said 'Cannot find the file 'event' or any of its components...""

""I need you to go back to the Run box.""

""I'm sorry?""

Go to Start, Run again.""

""But I already did that.""

He sighs. ""Please, Mister aveilleux, I need you to follow my instructions exactly or else your computer could be at risk for viruses from the Internet or other malware.""

""Oh, right, yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, so I have the Run box up again."" (At this point my ignorant facade starts to slip.)

""You've typed in 'eventvwr' into the box?""

""Yes I have. e-v-e-n-t-v-w-r.""

""Good, now click OK.""

""..Okay, this box that says 'Event Viewer' came up. Is that good?""

""Yes, aveilleux. Look on the left, do you see three menu items that say 'Application', 'Security', and 'System'?""

""On the left? No... wait, I was looking on the right. Yeah, those are there.""

""Okay, now in the center box, do you see a few messages with big red 'X's next to them?""

""Oh, yeah, Jason. Those look pretty bad. What are they?""

""Those are warning messages about potential viruses from the Internet.""

""Oh, oh dear. There certainly are a lot of them.""

""Okay, Mister aveilleux, you can close out of that.""

At this point I'm cracking up. I've wasted almost ten minutes of this poor sap's time just trying to load Event Viewer, which he apparently doesn't even *need*. I guess he was just trying to scare people who don't know what the Event Viewer is (which is, let's be honest, most computer users) into believing him.

""..Close out?""

""Click on the 'X' in the upper-right of the window.""

""I don't see an 'X'.""

""...Okay. Well. That's okay. Can you get the Run box up again?""

""How was that again?""

""Start, Run.""

""Where's St-- oh, right, bottom-left. Okay, I've got the Run box up again.""

""Now I need you to delete everything in the box we typed in before, okay?""

""Just, like, close the box?""

""No, Mister aveilleux. Select everything in the box, it should still say eventvwr in it, and press the Backspace key.""

""The box closed.""

""You wh..."" I can hear the click as he mutes himself. There's a pause.

I'm losing him! I don't want him to hang up!

""Jason?""

""Yes, sorry aveilleux. Could you please get the Run box up again?""

""Sure thing, Jason. It's up and there's nothing in it. What now?""

""Okay. Now type in (Web address omitted). Can you repeat back to me what it says in the box?""

""Okay, it says '(Web address)'. Is that right?""

""Yes, now you can click 'OK'.""

Jackpot. Executing a Web address in the Run box opens up an IE window (or whatever browser you have as default). I run a quick WHOIS on the site and, obviously, the information is forged to look real.

""Okay, it's loading up. The little spinner thing is going off in the corner.""

""That's good, that means it's loading. Just let me know when it's ready.""

The Web interface for LogMeIn 123 loads up. Hooray! Time to screw with a remote user.

""Hang on a second, my cat's doing something."" I put the phone back down and wander away, muttering, ""Kitty..."" I quietly return to my desk and start downloading as many pictures as I can from r/spacedicks, tossing them into a zip file on my desktop called ""passwords.zip"". I then go find a Flash drive I have lying around... it's covered in red electrical tape with the word ""VIRUS"" Sharpied on the side. It's a massive 7z archive of computer viruses, all ready to be unloaded onto a target system. I unpack it into the VM then re-zip it, fiddling around with the autoexec flags of some of the files. This is ""bank_data.zip"", naturally. It's ready.

""Okay, Jason. It's loaded up. I'm at a LogMeIn prompt. It's asking for some kind of password?""

""Very good, Mister aveilleux. Now, just enter in the code 215807. Can you repeat that back to me?""

""2-1-5-8-0-7. Is that right?""

""Yes. Now click 'Connect to technician' and we'll be connected to you, so we can make sure you are protected.""

I click OK. It prompts me to allow access to LogMeIn's support software. I allow it, then the screen flashes as my system's taken over by the remote technician (probably ""Jason""). I see the cursor wiggle a little.

""Uh, Jason, my mouse is moving.""

""Yes, that's normal. That means our support technician has connected to your PC and is now examining your system to ensure that it's safe.""

""Oh... okay.""

""Now, we're going to take a while, up to an hour. Is that okay?""

""Well, I mean, I guess if it'll keep my computer safe.""

""You can walk away from the computer now, and we'll call you back when we're finished. Thank you for your time, aveilleux.""

""Thank you, Jason, for doing this for me."" He hangs up.

Naturally, the guy at the other end of the line grabs passwords.zip and bank_data.zip and uploads them to a fileshare server. (Why he didn't just use the LogMeIn VPN is beyond me.) I make a note of the deletion links. This takes maybe 45 minutes (I have a fast connection). After that's done, he snags some files from \\WINNT\\ (to grab registration info and such; of course, the system's data is all incorrect). I get a call from Jason.

""Okay, Mister aveilleux. We have all the information we need and we'll be back in touch with you if we need anything.""

""Thanks much, Jason. I hope you enjoy my data as much as I did.""

""I'm sorry?""

""Never mind. Goodbye!""

I'm still waiting on the follow-up. I promise I'll update this once it comes in.

**Ed:** Wow, thanks guys. Self-post, no karma, etc. etc. but [holy crap I'm in the header](http://i.imgur.com/Tsc71.png). I didn't think I'd done anything so worthy of recognition.

**Ed2:** Yes, still waiting for ""Jason"" to call back.

**Ed3:** Welcome to the visitors from the future! It's been over 24 hours so I can assume ""Jason's"" organization has placed me onto a do-not-call list. Sorry, folks, but it looks like this first chapter is also the last one.",I got one of those scam calls today.,5290
jon6,392,3451,1aqr2l,2578,"The next couple of days seemed more irritating than usual with Angie taking any opportunity to shadow work from almost any ITS engineer. For me, there was a notable visit to the desk occupied by the HR Tank. Angie appeared mere seconds after my arrival as I walked HR Tank how to switch off ""those stupid red lines under everything I write"" in MS Word. Thinking she was just up there to see HR Tank, I mostly ignored her while I explained what those stupid red lines were. When I got done, Angie corrected my imminent departure by with ""Now, ask your customer if there is anything else you can do for her today!"" 

Barely time to react, the HR Tank rolled herself back in front of the monitor almost steamrolling me out of her path. ""Actually yes there is! I want to know why I can't change the text on this button here"" she bellows, pointing at the Start Menu.

After two tedious hours of this sea creature barely able to muster the muscles in her head to stop dribbling as she spoke, it was finally time for their regular Starbucks visit. Never have I been subject to the most inane lines of questioning and constant corrections by Angie. 

After taking note that HR Tank ""really needs a faster computer"" I take shelter in the canteen, kept company by the sole remaining cheese and pickle sandwich they had left. Did I ever mention, I really do not like pickle? It was either that or starve!

I returned to find BHIT pacing around the room. His ruffled jacket and red face added to his now urgent stance; the few hairs that seemed strapped to the side of his head for once looking windswept despite their nominal length. He immediately pounced. ""Margie from legal affairs needs her machine back. Are you done with it?"" 

After racking my brains and my ticket list for several minutes, I found his solution. ""That was one of the machines removed by you and the third line guys from the meeting room...""

And so begins the epic hunt. We first visit the third line guys who profess innocence. Our next stop is facilities, who again have no idea what we're on about - the Facilities manager takes great pains to point out that they want nothing to do with IT and are getting annoyed with being implicated.

A two hour whistle-stop tour of the building with MAFG in tow shows up nothing, even the IT Cupboard is untouched. 

On returning to BHIT, Angie who is fully tanked on coffee has now just been made aware of the missing machines and is scouring the ticket systems for evidence of my failings. Sometimes it pays to be an astute record keeper; on several of the tickets I noted ""Machine in hands of third line/facilities"". Angie is her usual helpful self, demanding to know why I informed nobody of these machines' importance or even questioned where they were off to. It's nice to have a policy one moment of Facilities looking after the whereabouts of IT kit, yet when it goes wrong it goes back to the nearest Support Monkey!

I took great pleasure on relaying the reaction of the facilities manager and also that each machine had been clearly labelled with a ticket number and name! 

After growing weary of Angie's bitchy comments, MAFG and I spend the final hour of the day searching out any nook and cranny we come across for either the missing machines or even the facilities guys who did the clear-out. It seemed my inspired plan of doing my job and gaining an ounce of vengeance was quickly backfiring as the day grew dim. 

On our way to one network riser room, we passed Margie from Legal Affairs. She couldn't help but stop me to ask for progress and relay the updates she'd gotten which amounted to, ""Apparently you managed to misplace it and still can't find it?"" Nice one Angie, way to pour salt in the wound!

We had given up. In a purely flippant move, by pure chance MAFG opened the door to a janitor's cupboard. Sat behind an industrial-sized bottle of Domestos Bleach and providing gravitational support for a mop and bucket was our Ghost Server. It stood almost majestic; it had seen many an ITS engineer through the worst of conferences and the coldest of late nights. We rescued the discolored HP Proliant from this murky cesspit and carried it back to ITS. We relayed our voyage to BHIT, as Angie stood stony-faced, glaring disapprovingly at our failure, the ghost server standing as testament to their managerial apathy.

BHIT saw no alternative; he commanded that Margie's machine must be replaced by tomorrow morning, even if we take another one from stock. The other missing machines would have to be queried with the Facilities department to determine their location! 

After clarifying a bend in the rules was OK ""just this one time"", I duly began the process of getting the Ghost server back up and running to image a brand new Optiplex from the IT Cupboard at my desk. I set to work.

8pm rolled around as the drone of people leaving and passing me by grew steadily to silence. I sat illuminated by a single monitor, prepping the Optiplex with all manner of legal type software, domain configurations, etc. As I was the only soul left, the auto lights had dimmed most of the office, only to be activated in sequence by the cleaner, almost like a searchlight dancing on the stage, illuminating some actress performing against the backdrop of the hoover motor. 

After visiting Margie's desk and reconnecting her new PC, I fired an email off to BHIT and Angie. It read: ""It's 8:30 and I'm done replacing this machine. Surely this is a testament to how ridiculous it has been for Support lately. We have asked several times for a permanent out-of-sight build and repair area in order to perform our duties after the one we had been using - and had been in use for several years - was summarily decided to be unsatisfactory! This matter needs resolution immediately"".

Feeling authoritative in myself, I hoped that demonstrating dedication to resolving these matters would help score points with anyone in the chain who mattered. I reached for the monitor switch to sign out for the night. But, as if big brother were watching, Outlook's ""new mail"" balloon popped up with it's accompanying self-important boink. Angie's name adorned the balloon like a warning label. I opened it, addressed directly to me, were the ominous words, ""We will discuss this tomorrow!""

ibrewbeer,321,1333,17fns6,2526,"My firm uses a web based ticketing system for all of our support requests. We've been using this system for years, but just like the rest of you, we still have users who refuse to use it. Some of them are VIPs in the company; bigwigs that can do whatever they want. So when they email one of us individually or use the group email instead of creating a ticket, we just let it slide. Others like to think they're as important, but are nowhere near the level where they can disregard long standing company policy and skirt the ticketing system. This is the tale of one such user.

Aside from not using the ticketing system, my other pet peeve is users who give no description whatsoever of their problem. They just say ""broken"" or ""again"" or ""fix it."" Today's email simply said ""help"" in the subject line and it was sent to two of the four of us on the support team. I make eye contact with my fellow techie who was also lucky enough to receive it and said, ""I got this."" 

Before we get too far into this story, you should know that this particular user and I get along famously. She's one of our ""special users"" for sure, but she's a great person and we give each other crap all the time.

Her office is 3 floors up, and normally I take the elevator. I decided this time to take the stairs. And I ran. I ran as fast as I could. By the time I got to her office, I was out of breath and a little sweaty. She's sitting there filing her nails, looking bored. I reach deep back to my high school days and find my inner actor.

Me: ""Oh my god, are you ok?!""

Her: *blank stare*

Me: ""Your email only said ""help"" so I came as fast as I could! Can you breathe alright? Did you fall? What's going on??""

Mind you, I am not being quiet about this, so the commotion starts to attract some attention from her nosy coworkers. Chairs swivel and necks crane. She starts getting self conscious as all of her coworkers are now not-so-subtly looking.

Her: ""No, no. Umm, my Outlook icon disappeared. I found it in the start menu but I need it back on my desktop.""

Me: ""But you're ok? It's just about an icon on your desktop?""

Her: ""Uh... yeah?""

Her coworkers start to chuckle quietly.

Me: *deep breath and sit down at her computer* ""Oh, well why didn't you say that?""

Her: ""I didn't really know how to describe it.""

Me: ""Your icon is back on the desktop. If you'd like to avoid throwing us all into a panic next time, please use the ticketing system and maybe try using your big girl words to describe what's going on. I may show up with building security to make sure there isn't a hostage situation or something equally embarrassing. Lunch today?""

Her: *icy daggers stabbing into my face from her eyes* ""Yeah, sounds good.""",How to deal with the one-word email,3859
jon6,282,2796,1ao78b,2368,"Monday morning finally arrived. I slightly congratulated myself that I managed to get through the entire weekend without wasting a single further thought on Angie. With no let-up in the weather, the early shift seemed to be of little comfort with the snow beating down as hard as it could. I was, however, brandishing a new set of gloves and a can of ice dissolving fluid.

Surprisingly, the day went off without a hitch. The snowy weather had landed most of the team off with ""colds"" and, notably, Angie hadn't made it in. Myself and MAFG managed to pile through a bunch of tickets when Balding Head of IT came in. He asked me if I could attend a meeting later which I obliged. Fairly sure this was ""the meeting"", I began to mentally prepare my defense.

I was again pleasantly surprised that this meeting was not one in which my ass would be summarily served, but rather a meeting of several heads brandishing a new project. It seemed that there was to be a conference in the not too distant future and the marketing, sales and product reps had worked hard to secure a vendor for a new medical CRM product to replace the aging creaky FileMaker based system. They also wanted to work in a complete laptop refresher programme, replacing any laptop over 2 years old. BHIT made particular mention of a desktop rollout I performed last year - it was actually my initial 3 months contract, but as I'd proven myself worthy, was taken on full time. My job was to be responsible for managing the physical delivery of the new hardware/software as appropriate.

I set to work on the task with glee, querying Active Directory for a list of machines, users and specs. One thing I always made sure of was to carry on my predecessor's good work in maintaining a super-clean active directory: a place for everything and everything in it's place. Every audit we had, although occasionally revealing some discrepancies, everything was up to date and reports were reliable.

After collating my results, I determined that 170 odd laptops would require replacement and approximately 250 builds would need to go on across three different hardware types - two already in use in the field and could continue and one for the new laptop specs. As soon as I could get the final signed off software from the vendor, I could go about getting images prepared, QA'd and rope in some of my friendlier reps to pilot the new builds before the big day.

My analysis done and sent to BHIT, I wrapped up for the day. All thoughts of that coffee swilling stick insect were thoroughly out of mind.

My smile was demolished Tuesday morning. Angie had made it in and was busy setting about the task of undoing anything that looked like progress. The instant I appeared, she demanded my attention in the dungeon. Sure enough, this was it. She now required a full explanation as to my actions the previous Friday.

I say explanation, after my defense of our security access to the IT Cupboard had been withdrawn was thrown straight back at me for failing to understand proper protocol, she just ripped into yet another Starbucks latte-fueled tirade about leaving a VIP high and dry for an hour while I blithered about. She then also ripped me a new one, asking what I was doing taking apart a PC in the middle of the office? It seemed that some of the Fat Finance wenches had ratted me out as well and claimed I'd caused such a loud commotion, they were prevented from working! I wonder if it's the same finance hag that is in her coffee group? This dressing down seemed to last forever, and it did... this was a good 20 minuter! 

Dressing down fully received, I decided to retaliate once more. I mailed our BHIT and CC'd the rest of support, questioning why we were no longer permitted access to the IT Cupboard for equipment, where we should go if Angie is not around to give her approval to retrieve gear from the cupboard and, most importantly, where are we supposed to work on machines or hardware? These were things which worked perfectly fine a few weeks ago were now suddenly were not fine. 

The reply from BHIT was as usual fairly impotent and full of noncommittal statements. His response that he was unaware the IT Cupboard was being used as a build area for hardware came as a shock to us all particularly as he was the one who got the Ghost Server off the 3rd line team in the first place. He concluded by requesting that we should seek clarification of suitable build areas from our manager, Angie. I could see we were going to get nowhere on this path.

The water deepened. I held my breath, cited 15 odd tickets in my queue which would require extensive dismantling and imaging time, none of which could occur at my desk and none of which could even happen as the build server with all our images had been thrown in a riser room, which of course none of us could now access anymore. Added to that, with the conference project looming, exactly where were we meant to image these machines? And how would I be able to access our build server for the task at hand - my nightly WhatsAlive script reporting it as the only machine missing in action?

As a demonstration of the extent of his ineptitude, instead of formulating a reply, he simply replied to all and inserted Angie's email at the top with the words ""Angie, can you please direct Jon6 appropriately? Thanks.""

You can guess the next conversation. ""What conference is this and what makes you think you have anything to do with it?"" Angie demanded. As BHIT had truly dumped me in it, I had to relay all about my task for the conference. She would find out anyway, the train was in motion. Of course, this was now something new she could micromanage to the nth degree, but not without a scolding first. She first demanded to know why she was never informed. 

I responded, ""BHIT had been present in the meeting, too. Given my handling of the XP Rollout and Desktop Replacement project last year, this is why BHIT and several heads asked for me by name! That said, as it's a major project, I find it difficult to believe that you were not in the loop with this one already?"" (whoa... saucer of milk, meeting room 7... could it be score 1 to Jon6?)

In reality, I already knew that Angie was already plotting. If I was a betting man, I'd have said the plan was already made in her mind; she was too sharp to not have planned all the fine details already. All she needed was the time to put it into effect. What the plan was, I have no idea, only the future will tell. But I did know at that moment that this process won't go well. It will either be mired in micro-managementism... or I just won't do it at all.

So, I managed to get my digs in that one time, but I now have a fight on my hands. On the one hand, I've made enough of an impression by some heads to have been asked for by name to drive this forward. On the other hand, I had the bitch manager from hell, bent on thrusting her dagger of incompetence into the beating heart of anything resembling efficiency.

And there was still no response about where hardware/builds should be taking place. 

One thing I was sure of... if we're going to play this game, let the games begin!

bd504840,278,867,182tmd,2342,"While working in IT in Iraq in 2007 I was taken hostage. (see IAMA: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/125ukc/i_am_peter_moore_the_longest_held_hostage_in_iraq/)


While I was a hostage one of the militia came in and asked if I could sort out his commanders laptop as it was running slow and he could not install the cracked game he had just purchased from the market.


Not feeling in a particularly helpful frame of mind, what with being chained up and fearing death and all that, I spent a few minutes looking over it and concluded that I could not help.


About 15 minutes later the guy returned and asked if I could try again as his commander was giving him some verbal over it.


I spent the next hour uninstalling adware and stopping programs from running when windows booted, and did a general cleanup. Also managed to get his cracked copy of Medal of Honour working, which seemed to make everyone happier.


Feeling somewhat pleased with my achievements, in what only can be described as extreme circumstances, I returned the laptop. 


The commander left and his subordinate came in to see me. He smacked me over the head with a pistol, causing my head to bleed, explaining that next time he asked me to do something I was to do it the first time around!

HeZlah,1027,1083,1i56z8,2272,"So, this just happened. I am eagerly anticipating the response, however i feel compelled to share what has happened so far.

Back story: A couple weeks ago I was contacted by a friend of an acquaintance of mine who runs a very small business and wants to set up a web site where potential clients can see services, prices, contact information, etc. Now, I am a 4th year Mechatronic Eng student, so although web site design is not my forte - I do have a functional understanding of php/Javascript/html and it is semester break so I agree to set this up.

I go to meet her, she shows me some drawings of what she wants the site to look like and we agree on a price ($150 pretty sure that is a good deal) $50 to be payed now and $100 upon completion.

Fast forward to last Friday. I'm all finished, website comes online - I call the client and tell her its all up and running, she checks it out, loves it, its exactly what she wants. I give her my account number for her to transfer my payment, she thanks me and the call ends.

Now this morning (one week later) - payment is still not in so I send an email to see whats going on. The reply:

&gt;I have not yet transferred funds. And dont hold your breath. I signed no written agreement and you have no proof that I aggreed to provide payment. Let this be a lesson to you.

&gt; Thanks for the web site.

Really? Took me a couple minutes to process what I had just read. I should be mad - but I'm not. Armed with a cheeky grin, a chuckle and PuTTY I ssh in:

    scp -r /var/www hez@&lt;my servers ip&gt;:/home/hez/company_name
    rm -rv /var/www/*

On out first meeting she said she was getting business cards made up with the web site on it. Hopefully she doesn't notice for a while and hands out these cards that point nowhere :p she seems like the kind of person that really wouldn't check. You know - the mentality of once its there its there for good. If she doesn't get back to me in like a week I might redirect somewhere ... inappropriate.

Tl;DR: PAY ME

By the way, I do expect to be hit by all the reddit flak GET IT IN WRITING. Well I will save you the trouble. I'm an idiot, I know - its all that has been drilled into me for the last 4 years so i should know better. But she seemed so nice I really wasn't expecting it :/ That and I'm really not too bothered, I have been wanting to find an excuse to build a web page just to refresh my knowledge.

________
**UPDATE:**

So interesting morning. 9am I just received a call, quoting the call verbatim would mostly consist of [expletive deleted] for sfw reasons. But the gist:

Her: Your useless, the site is down already. Lucky I didn't pay you I want my deposit back!

Me: I'm sorry but the site you saw was just a demo site to get your approval. I took it down and it will remain down until I receive payment.

*I was going to say until I receive full payment of the $200 that we agreed upon. But that's kind of extortion, she can sink to the level of changing the deal but I'd prefer to take the high road.*

Her: [Some horrible language that I don't have the patience to listen to] I'm paying you this monthly charge to keep the site up now put it back up.

Me: I'm sorry but that monthly charge is for the web server which hosts the site.

I used a billboard analogy, where you pay for the billboard for a period of time, but its up to you what you want to put on there. I think she got it. In hindsight, most billboard companies probably put up the add all in one package deal... but most analogies fail bearing close examination.

Me: And even if that money was coming to me -*click*

A short time later I receive an email:

&gt;What is the login to the account that I am paying for?? You dont have the right to keep that from me becaus I am paying it 

&gt;my son is doing computing at tafe and he copied the site before you took it down so he can rebuild it so there.

At this point, I'm thinking whatever - I have had enough. I am compiling a credential inclusive smart-ass reply about how there is no way he has the server-side scripts that give most of the functionality, when I get another call.

This time from her son. He is so much more irate, however I really can't hold that against him. I'm sure that he has heard a biased version of the story and I can sympathize. Cross my mum and I will rip your head off and leave you in a shallow grave.

Again, summary of the call. Too many [expletive deleted] be readable:

Him: How dare you refuse to give us the access to a payed account, I should ----ing come over there and kick your ----ng ass you ----!

Me: Wow, settle down I was just replying to the email with all the credentials you need to access the server. She didn't pay me so I took the site down and it will stay that way.

Him: I do this stuff for a living I am the top of my python class you think you can keep the site down well I have news for you I copied the source before you took it down so I can just put it straight back on there I win ----er!

(note I used no punctuation in that sentence, because he didn't. I could picture him turning blue on the other end of the line, also add about 20 expletives in there to get an idea of how long he was talking)

Me: Look you do what you want I don't care, I will send you the credentials and I don't want to hear from you again. All emails will be forwarded to trash and please loose my number.*click*

ssh into root account...

    rm -f /usr/bin/sudo 
    rm -f /bin/su
    find /bin -not -name ""cd"" -not -name ""ls"" -not -name ""mount"" -not -name ""chmod"" -type f -exec chmod 000 {} ;\
    chmod 000 /bin/chmod
    passwd -l root

Petty. Yes. Unprofessional. Yes. But in the heat of the moment, and after hearing what he intends to do (or thinks he can do), there is no professionalism left in this deal. They can call the provider and have the OS re-installed after they figure out whats wrong. They can even choose something easier than debian, you know with one of those things ... desktops I think they are called. 

And compile the email:

&gt;Username: admin

&gt;Password: admin

&gt;I have forwarded further emails from you to the bin folder. I do not have a call blocking feature on my phone, but I can install one with ease. Don't make me.

&gt;Goodluck. Goodbye.

And that's it. Will it be the end of the story? I hope so.

**NOTES:** NO, the password is not really admin.

For those who don't know what the commands do. The two commands su and sudo allow non root accounts to run commands as root (the highest admin). The first two lines remove these from the system. (Yes I could have done this more elegantly by changing sudoers, but meh)

The third command finds all files in the /bin directory aside from cd (for changing directories) and ls (for viewing contents of a directory) and mount (for mounting drives) and then execute the command chmod 000 on each file. This removes all read, write, execute permissions - making them inaccessible. (maybe an expert can tell me, if i chmod 000ed mount, would that cause boot issues?). And the /bin directory, well lets just say the stuff in there is important.

The fourth command removes all permissions from the chmod command itself. Permissions are gone and aren't coming back :)

Finally, passwd -l root deactivates the root account. Which itself is good practice, in fact the only reason it was activated in the first place is so I could log into it and run these commands.

**ADDENDUM** 

I get so many comments saying WHY ARE YOU BUILDING WEBSITES FOR $150

Well the answer is because its not my business, I wasn't out to make a profit. Someone contacted me and wanted some help building a a site. I have the skills at my disposal along with some spare time so I agreed. I was in it to learn and help someone out. It was my intention to refresh my memory and get some experience in a skill remotely relating to my future profession, because let be honest - its a very useful skill to have. As a skint student I just quoted twice my weekly budget. Seems fair to me we are both benefiting.

Turns out I learnt another valuable lesson. Cant complain, I got experience in what I planned to AND some bonus experience. Its like when you finish a quest on some game and the reward is some experience, a little money and a mystery treasure chest that when you open, contains a little bit more experience crystals.

The teachers were not happy about this because they HATE change and made up excuses why they couldn't complete it. Then I started to get the calls about issues, my favorite was non-existent errors that went something like this

jon6,546,3314,1asyxi,2183,"It was a typical Spring day in Britain: unnaturally cold yet the sun shone with retina-piercing rays. It was the kind of weather where you need a few layers of clothing but with sunglasses as well. In fact, it was on this day I pondered, ""When people are cold, they wear shirts, jumpers, cardigans, jackets... why never anything on the legs? Why has nobody invented jumpers for legs!?"" This eureka moment kept me company all the way to the office that morning, pondering this conundrum!

A week had elapsed since the Jon6 vs Angie showdown. We were playing Angie's bluff, abiding her new court rules to the letter and sought permission for every single visit to the IT Cupboard. Sometimes it was a stern and sharp no! Other times it was a reluctant yes but only after waving a ticket number in front of her face.

Such a cupboard-bound session would always be followed up with her dropping in at intervals which appeared to be so very desperately random. The mindset was obvious: we were obviously skiving, shirking responsibilities and up to no good! Her grand entrances into the cupboard where the handle was turned even before her security card had finished triggering was as if to catch us in some red act that she could grow fat on!

For me, given my near permanent residence there, I devised a rather fun game, trying to estimate when these visits would occur. If I could time it right, I would make a visit to user's desk-side, machine-on-trolley, just in time to pass her in the corridor on her way to the IT Cupboard so I could nonchalantly whistle a happy tune, just going about my business! I managed to pull this off a few times. She would have her stinking coffee in one hand, handbag poised for another session of studying me as I worked, reprimanding anything she felt like, only to be caught out because I was on my way out! Those few times I'd pass her in the corridor like this, her soulless grey eyes would stare straight ahead, shrouded by her forehead wrinkled after many years of just abjectly hating everything, just as if I just didn't exist.

This eventually stopped being fun as I would often find she would just sit and wait for my return to the IT Cupboard, her presence just a grim spectral shadow in the background like a precariously balanced rock perched on a cliff-side as in those cartoons. She would come and go as she pleased, seemingly annoyed in my indifference, occasionally bursting into fits of sharp conceit where I couldn't do right for doing wrong!

The sad reality is, it wasn't all fun and games. Angie's frequent verbal attacks, accusatory questioning tactics and consistent throwing of spanners in the works made for a very stressful working environment for everyone in the team. There were many occasions where her actions and whims would cause a ticket to go wrong in some fashion, leaving the team to try to pick up the pieces. 

In one incident, QBG had a traveling sales rep due to see her about a USB hard disk he was having trouble with. She had correctly diagnosed most likely a failure of the actual hard disk and had requested a new USB disk to await his arrival where she would transfer any data he needed. However, one of my tickets was a simple request for a new USB Hard Disk which I had duly placed on the purchase order list. Angie, knowing that QBG had the last USB drive in stock, had MAFG complete my ticket using the same USB drive QBG had waiting in her desk drawer! MAFG was unaware of QBG's ticket, I was aware of QBG's ticket but not that MAFG had been told to go and action mine using QBG's hard disk. When QBG found out, the rep was already at her desk waiting to pick up his new drive. 

Little things like that seemed all too commonplace now. Even though Angie had caused it, it would just look like our own incompetence, orchestrated by this total bitch! I was particularly reminded of the Omen soundbyte, ""...turning man against his brother, until man exists no more!"" I think what irritated Angie was that in the face of this deviousness, I always stood up and appeased customers. In the above case, QBG was close to tears with an angry rep on her hands - this had been agreed between them for at least a week. Angie sat happily clicking around TouchPaper while the rep blew up. I waded straight in and simply took liability, claiming an administrative oversight. QBG and several others on the team were juniors, they looked to me for mentoring, advice... who was I to leave them in the lurch? I managed to appease this rep by offering to run out to the local PC World and grab one up for him. Just one of the many incidents Angie seemed to orchestrate!

Added to that, my held-together-with-tape Nokia was suffering frequent call drops. I missed my Blackberry.

Tuesday came - our 40-string epic induction session arrived fresh from Birmingham. MAFG and I stood by the training room windows as hoards of lads and lasses from ""oop north"" stepped off the coach. We knew full well that they would be in no mood for sitting straight down for a stuffy IT session. It appears that my inspiration to order fresh tea, coffee and bacon rolls for their arrival was a good one! 

As the delegates stormed the sanctity of the training rooms, armed with smiles and northern accents galore, all lunged hungrily at our offering of breakfast! There was much joy to be had. I couldn't help but notice Angie's indomitable presence at the back of the room as she sat, piercing-eyed and miserable, waiting for us to start. One of the new ladies quipped at me in her Birmingham accent, ""Who's that sour-puss at the back?"" After explaining she was my manager, she instantly empathized with a cheerful laugh and ""Blimey, ya poor sod!""

MAFG and I split the groups into two manageable pieces. I thought that this may throw Angie the dilemma of having to balance her disapproving looks between two rooms, closely monitoring and judging our every moves. It seemed, however, she was perfectly happy to sit motionless at the back of my session, at every moment fixating her eyes on me. She would ensure her comments were delivered at every coffee break, which seemed like orders and reprimands over every minor detail. Her opportunity for managerial admonishment was stolen from her again; one of the delegate's new laptop had suddenly failed at the start of the session. Angie motioned, about to take control and give me a solid dressing down until she was stopped in her tracks when I produced one of the three spare laptops, always prepared in advance just in case such a circumstance ever happened. I swapped the machine over, had the delegate log in and noted the new asset number for changing on AD later. Angie's fingers were red as they clutched her coffee cup. She was almost pissed that I hadn't slipped up!

Yet again, there was no hope of lunch as Angie ordered me to go and see HR Tank with her ""slow"" PC. Again it turned out HRT had simply decided waiting 10 seconds for a newly inserted CD-Rom to spin up was far too slow and was causing her severe heartache - nothing to do with all that cholesterol then?

After pulling several late nights the week previous to get laptops finished, phone contracts organised and hardware charged, the whole session went off without a hitch. Of course, there were the usual attacks of Angie's bitter comments. Through it all, I did my best to ignore her and instead maintained a flirtatious joviality with my inductees. 

About 2pm, Angie skulked out of the room. She looked past me as she walked out, as if she had gathered everything she needed to know and was off to put some other part of her devious plan into operation. Her departure sparked a brief conversation about what a sour old woman she was and how they could never work for such a wench. I resisted the temptation to spill my guts, break down and tell this group of happy individuals what hell we were going through. I simply chose to leave it as, ""Yes, she is very difficult!""

The afternoon ticked by to its conclusion. Eventually the last delegate left the training room, armed with laptop off to make their way in the world. MAFG and I sat drinking the last few drops of weak tepid coffee from the cafetiere looking out of the same window where we first saw the delegates arrive. We could see their coach driver perched on one of the front seats, reading a newspaper and drinking from a thermos flask, looking totally relaxed in the world. We sat quietly comparing observations on the delegates we had just met, congratulating ourselves on a job well done.

I had left the door open; neither MAFG or I noticed Angie's skeletal figure appear in the doorway. Our discreet musings of the day were cut short with her vociferous shriek, ""Exactly what is the meaning of this? Who gave you permission to sit around, what is this a playground!?""

We both startled upright, her voice almost shattered the glass. As we began clearing up equipment, powering down projectors and clearing desks of discarded wrappers, Angie unleashed a full force critique of the day. ""I don't see why this whole process had to take so long. Maybe if you'd had stopped chinwagging, talking rubbish and making jokes, this whole thing could have been a lot quicker!""

We knew that no comebacks would have worked with Angie. She continued to berate us for another 20 minutes as we cleared the room down. Just as we were ready to close up, we couldn't help but notice that another figure had appeared in the room. She was about 20, outfitted in a dress-to-impress suit and couldn't help but exude the fact that she was new to the company. She stood with trepidation and meekly knocked on the door. ""Excuse me,"" she said. ""Is MAFG in here?""

After acknowledging his presence, she gingerly pirouetted up to MAFG and handed him an official looking envelope, his name and address on the front. She left the room just as abruptly as she had arrived, making sure not to make eye contact with anyone, not even to the near-approving look from Angie. MAFG and I, with a box of bits and projectors in hand, looked perplexed at what had just happened. Angie left with the snipe, ""I want you both back downstairs in 20 minutes after you've put that stuff away! And I want all your tickets reviewed by the end of the day!""

We made our way to the sanctuary of the IT Cupboard and returned the gear to its rightful shelving space. MAFG opened the letter, reading it aloud as his eyes sunk into his cheekbones. There it was. The letter was from HR, garbed with every official looking signature and stamp that you could possibly throw onto such a document. It stated he was to attend a meeting tomorrow with HR, Angie and BHIT. It also stated ""you may choose to have a representative accompany you..."" This was it... Angie had made her first move in her new game. And it certainly seemed that the first casualty would be one of my closest allies: MAFG.

This terrible moment was mocked at the sight of the delegates re-boarding their homeward-bound bus. They were escaping the brutality of this situation, off to their lives of freedom and futures to look forward to. A clear contrast to ours, mired in the darkness of some hateful hag who it seemed had only just started!

MAFG didn't return to ITS that day; I agreed to do his late shift for him allowing his escape at 4pm to go collect his thoughts. Angie had just upped the game. And we felt powerless to do anything about it!

jon6,249,3431,1aws5e,2177,"Roland’s amalgamation to 2nd line was arduous. His physique, just as pious and wretched as Angie’s, slithered over MAFG’s old desk space in exultance, his mannerisms and movements unnervingly similar to his Mother’s. His keyboard and mouse glistened as though he would secrete some sort of mucus as he worked, as if to chemically claim permanent ownership. Roland’s voice, though weedy and undeveloped, bore all the same neurosis and vile overtones which Angie would spit out on a daily basis. His eyes almost serpent like, as if they would pierce the skin if he stared long enough.

I had just spent a glorious week on annual leave, putting finishing touches to my band’s album. The ugly situation at work had been far from my mind as I enjoyed every minute of my creative freedoms. 

Sunday marked the penultimate day of my freedom by bringing with it the feeling of impending doom. By Monday morning, my commute to work seemed ghostly as my attention was constantly attracted to the clock in my car. It ticked by the minutes towards 9:30am and my arrival back in this gloomy pit where Angie stood Lord and Master. My foot barely wanted to touch the accelerator pedal; these thoughts did something to my subconscious which I felt forced to fight.

My entrance into ITS was barely noted by the inhabitants whose faces seemed fixated on their own screens, as if to break for a moment would feel the wrath of some frosty dominator. Roland’s bleak personality radiated throughout the small department like a bad smell, only amplified by Angie who sat mere meters away. Fighting through this black air, I sat at my desk. As Outlook churned into life, the email traffic of the previous week waterfalled down my unread pane, the main view providing snippets of what had transpired my absence. The hard disk ticked and tocked, the LED flashing in sympathy in its race to return to life after a week starved of power.

The unmistakable apprehensive walk of the Balding Head of IT came into view as he arrived at my desk, desperately maintaining as dominant a pose as he could muster despite his triviality. He voiced his usual brand of pleasantries as our exchange turned to the important business of the rollout project. All appeared to be well in BHIT’s world. The machines from Dell were on order, to be delivered in batches, the pilot group had been well informed, the software vendor was communicative and the relevant sales managers seemed to enthusiastically thumbs-up all round his every action.

I started discussing finer details, “I want to get at least one of the builds done today as a first draft. It’s better to get it done early so there’s more time to rectify issues and build machines.” BHITs expression altered as if to purposely show confusion. “Oh,” he mused. “I was under the impression the first draft build was done?”

I hadn’t heard the shrill of Angie’s voice in a while, but its tone was just as familiar as if I had endured it all my life. Without even turning around in her chair to face us, her words showered us with all the same bitterness, “The first build is done! Someone else did it while you weren’t here!” Angie’s tone was mired in the suggestion that my well-earned week off had proven me negligent, another spit in the face from this diseased rat. Roland took his cue as if they were both reading from some psychic score, “Yes, I did it. It wasn’t that hard really, just install everything and domain register It.” His simplistic insight into my carefully honed art was if to mock all that I had worked for and write it off as if he had found it unchallenging and inconsequential.

“There’s far more than that!” I disputed. “You need to add the office wi-fi, VPN, antivirus, etc…”

Angie’s retort was sudden and venomous. “It’s been dealt with. Roland is doing the builds. You would know that if you had read the revised project plan in your email! You said yourself that junior members need to have training as part of the project! He will consult you as needed!”

It seemed Roland had been furtively promoted again, this time within the echelons of his own team. I was now Roland’s bitch! BHIT seemed as if he would have done anything at that moment to disappear into a cloud of smoke as the rest of ITS still sat motionless with their eyes cemented into their PC screens, pretending not to hear this firework going off around them. 

My hint at checking Roland’s work was again sharply rebutted; Angie this time turned her chair to face me, her eyes like stilettos garnished with her down-turned, drawn-on eyebrows. Her skeletal pointy chin moved in harmony with her bark as she added finality to this conversation. “You have other things to be getting on with. Read the project plan and get back to work. Roland will consult you when he needs you!”

Knowing there was no win here, I returned to my screen, Outlook waiting like an obedient dog with 173 unread emails. I looked at BHIT with a silent sigh, expecting him to interject in some way. Instead he just shuffled away, obviously completely ill-equipped to properly deal with what had just happened. He uttered some empty promise of catching up with me later, but this was drowned out by the sifting sound his suit made as it transported him away. 

Angie had been busy in my absence. An email forwarded to all the major players in this assignment was emblazoned with a send date of 10pm Sunday evening – two days after I was last in the office - as if to prove Angie’s so-called dedication to the cause. It was a carbon-copy of my well-thought-out and scrupulous project plan, except my involvement in almost every developmental stage had been written out, like a poorly written character in some novelist’s prose. Roland’s new found sole-command of the technicalities seemed all too purposeful. Angie had painstakingly placed me in the back-end of the entire rollout, promoting our newest arrival, her son, into the most delicate of tasks. The rat had risen to a position of power!

I hated what had become of the project. My considerable and enumerated planning had been cast aside like a cheap newspaper as Angie lay claim to its proficiencies in her bid to establish herself at the top of the food chain, ensuring that any credit traveling up would end with her. In a last ditch attempt to fight back, I emailed my concerns to BHIT. The time scales of the project and Angie’s apparent and purposeful transference of my responsibilities meant that the rollout was now very susceptible to failure. I fine-tuned my words for nearly an hour, striking a fine balance of concern without appearing confrontational. 

Finally, after much deliberation, I took an all or nothing stance. I added a personal addendum in which I vented about Angie’s disruptive nature within support, her constant criticisms and micromanagement, her fork tongue and angry, terminal attitude; BHIT needed to get involved now and reign this beast back in. 

I couldn’t help but notice Roland fawning over one of the new Dell laptops, his prize that accompanied his birth right. No expense had been spared on these machines, attested to by the fresh, sleek black appearance. It was now being painted with Roland’s clammy, greasy hands, the slimy fingerprints unnaturally obvious underneath the incandescent office lighting. I felt a sense of jealousy, like my obvious experience had been made irrelevant against this vassal creature’s ignorance. 

Silence followed as the email disappeared from my outbox. The feeling I had was that this had either sealed my fate or marked a major turning point for the better. Ten minutes went by, still no response from BHIT. I sat, eagerly awaiting the Outlook balloon which would at least acknowledge BHIT’s reading of my plea. Instead came the unmistakable sound of BHIT timidly rising from his chair, the rustle of his suit seemed signatory as it served to fanfare his escape out of the office towards the main stairs. I was alone, in hell, with Angie, her spawn, and several demoralized, broken and burned out ITS engineers.

PhatDaddy420,314,676,149flb,2181,"This happened two years ago, but I will never forget this, it was quite a memorable call. For accuracy, this caller was a middle aged, Filipino woman from Toronto.

Background: I did tier 2.5 tech support for ISP (Tier 2 plus direct access to scheduling and talking to the technicians) in Canada.

This is around 8PM, this woman calls, very upset, her internet hasn't been working properly for 3 months, and she was getting silly issues, all the departments would give her the runaround, nobody would actually sit there solve the issue. The call gets escalated to me, and I see the list of tickets, and her issue was clear, her profile was set too high, and the modem was just not able to hit those frequencies and would constantly drop (DSL), she also seemed to have a bad filter. No biggie really.

Now, to make this clear, this is the 9th call she puts in to us, and 3 months that she's getting frequent disconnects and constant slow downs.

So I get this call, going through the regular process, making sure that everything has been checked before continuing with the fix (procedure), and I could hear the TV and her 5 year old in the back playing (she told me her 5yo daughter was there), and after 10-12 minutes, I hear the woman say Spit it out Spit it out!!. I asked if everything was OK, and she said, not to worry. I continue.


3 minutes later I hear the little girl say, momy, my stomach, and throat are burning. My mouth feels strange too. Again, I was a little worried at this point, as the woman was already emotional with this ordeal of not fixing, she pressed for me to continue with the fix.

But this time I asked what happened as her daughter was clearly in trouble, and she said, I shit you not.

""She drank some of the bleach I had in a cup over there.""

Then proceeds to tell her daughter to go and try and throw up.

Me, having done WHMIS the week before, and having a little common sense, knew that that was NOT the right thing to do, tell the woman

""NO! Call poison control! You can't make her throw up, you're just going to make it worst!""

So she tells her to go drink lots of water.

At this point, I'm ready to shit myself, this woman, stressed out cause she kept getting the run around, finally found somebody that seems like he can solve her problem, tried to press forward.

At this point I stressed again, ""CALL POISON CONTROL!! CALL AN AMBULANCE! THIS IS YOUR CHILD!!"".

And then she said (this is Saturday night btw) ""We're going to church tomorrow morning, God will take care of her""

I fucking lost it. Having all her info, I tell her I must terminate the call.

I hung up, already having googled poison control for the area, run to the staff room and call poison control.

The guy on the other end thought it was a joke, some dude from tech support, calling from 5000KM away is freaking out telling him that a customer's child just injested bleach. I give him my name, and all her details, phone number, address..

At this point, I was stressed out, bummed a smoke from a co-worker (I don't smoke, but BOYS that was a fucking amazing cigarette), and afterwards went back inside, and called the woman again.

She's hysterical! Crying, freaking out, she thought it was the emergency services again. But no, it was the internet tech support guy, the guy who made the woman realize that she could of lost her daughter.

She thanked me, and hung up, as she was waiting on the ambulance.


The following Thursday I call the woman back, her internet still not working, started crying and telling me how great it was for me to care so much in a time where her thoughts were shadowed by her problems. Her daughter ended up being fine, and needed her stomach flushed and stayed in the hospital for a few days as she digested a bit.

I solved her problem, and that was that.

That there is my most memorable call.

TL;DR. Called poison control for small child that drank bleach because her mother was too worried about getting her internet finally working again after months of issues.

Later on I'll post about my second most memorable call if you guys want.. Internet Tech Support, AKA Suicide prevention line.



Edit: WOW! Thanks for all the great comments guys, I really didn't think it was a big deal. I just did what I felt was right, as my parents taught me. If you want to thank somebody thank my parents for giving me good values and common sense.

EDIT 2: As promised, here is the (long) story about the suicide prevention tech support call I had a few months before this.

QA_Avenger,293,948,1i7szz,2171,"This, dear Reddit, is is a story of justice. A tale of evil clients and knights in shining QA departments. &amp;nbsp;

**The Setting:**  
Our company runs a set of databases with a light website for managing reports on data, all of which is used as a customer management system for a large number of large clients that want to host websites but don't want to manage a database to sit behind it.   
  
**The Heroes:**  
I work as a lowly QA Tech in a QA department of about 8. I've been working in this place for about 5 years now and I'm frequently asked to sit in on calls with clients. They trust me enough now to leave me to get on with things and communicate with the client directly if there's anything I want to ask about.  
  
My boss is a certified legend with a degree from the college of How To Earn Respect. The guy lets me get on with my work and takes care of all the business side and interdepartmental politics. Great boss.  
  
My good friend (who we'll call Greg) works as a fairly senior member of the Customer Support department. Greg's got my back and I've got his. If he has something come through that he needs help with or looks serious then I'll help him out.  
  
**The Villain:**  
The client's project manager (who we'll imaginatively call... Douche) was tasked with being the gateway for all communication with us and was either extremely vague or mathematically incompetent whenever he discussed the requirements for what would be delivered. When paired together, these things often mean that bad things will happen. To make things worse, this guy was intentionally insulting because he could get away with it. After all, he is a paying customer.  
  
**The Pledge:**  
The client paid us for a piece of work where we made a custom API which we expose on our SOAP interface. It was a good feature, and one which our sales representatives had probably been told to try and get a client to fund for quite some time. Implementing it was a nightmare because they had added some complex functionality in their requirements document just before they signed it off. All my best attempts to try to resolve inconsistencies and make it work logically fell on deaf ears and eyes that refuse to read emails. One exchange with Douche on this topic went thus:  
  
&gt;*Me:* Hi Douche, its Derp at &lt;Company&gt;. Just calling abou...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh hi, yeah, the slacker at &lt;Company&gt;. Hows it going?  
  
It should be pointed out that we were slightly behind schedule because there were a number of outstanding issues in the database procedure behind the call, hence why this was obviously MY fault.  
  
&gt;*Me (biting my tongue):* I'm... I'm OK... thanks. Just calling about your requirements on the API which you sent throu...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh this again? Haven’t you finished that yet?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Well, no. You'll remember that we've delayed it due to some issues with the procedure which you've been infor...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Oh for the love of.. Why is it taking so long?  
  
&gt;*Me:* That's what I wanted to ask about. Requirement 6.5.12 says its supposed to calculate X but lower down it states the maths you want it to use. The problem is that this equation doesn't actually represent that val...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Look, you're supposed to follow the specification I'VE written, so just do it! I don't want to hear about this again until its done!  
  
The next day my boss tells me that Douche complained about me to his account manager, saying that I was being offensive and was questioning his competency. (He can read minds?!?) I then completed this piece of work, ensuring that his specification was followed to every exact instruction.   
  
**The Turn:**  
After the best part of 6 months, and the client is about to go live with their site. They've been trying to sort out their own internal testing teams and third parties for such a long time that we ended up completing the work a full 5 months before they were even able to test it, and at this point they were going live in 3 days because that's when their marketing campaign said it would. Because of these tight deadlines, they signed it off in our Acceptance Testing sandbox and we considered the work to be complete. I had all but forgotten that previous conversation with Douche.  
  
About 3pm Friday afternoon, Greg from CS calls me up says he's got an issue with Douche. Greg now knows first hand how douchy Douche can be. This is because after our work was completed and promoted to our live system, any issues they had integrating were not development issues, but customer support issues.  
  
I make my way over to CS land and this is where things get fun.  
  
&gt;*Me:* 'Sup Greg? (sipping my coffee because these usually involve a long conversation about the functionality of features)  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Hey Derp.You ever worked on this new API that went up for &lt;Client_Name&gt;?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Yeah, I did the verification process on it. What do you want to know?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* The Client seems to think it doesn't work.  
  
&gt;*Me:* It was implemented to the letter. Plus other clients have been picking it up and using it since it went out, haven't they?  
  
&gt;*Greg:* Yeah, that's what I thought when I read the documentation. Ok, leave it with me and I'll let Douche know.  
  
I head back to my desk and start pulling out all the documentation I have on this feature because I know exactly what's coming next. After not too long, Steve (the account manager for Douche) storms into QA and straight into Boss' office. There's a lot of shouting and raised voices and eventually I'm called in.   
  
&gt;*Steve:* Would you care to explain this?  
  
Steve points at an email on Boss' screen. I go in for a closer inspection and it's an email from Douche claiming that their launch is probably going to be a disaster because the API has “obviously not been tested at all”. I'm surprised Steve believes this because he knows me and I've worked on various projects for him in the past.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I was firmly told my Mr Douche that I was to implement it to the specification.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But the reporting section of the response that comes out is utter nonsense! It doesn't make sense!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Derp, what did the specification say about this?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I can grab the documentation from my desk if you like.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* I think that would be a good idea.  
  
I go and fetch the documents and all the eyes in the department are on me, wanting to know what's going on. On the way back, I see Boss trying to calm Steve down.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Here it is.  
  
I slide it across the desk and take a seat. Steve and Boss scan through it and find where it talks about these reporting figures and wait to be spoken to. Steve turns a little pale and Boss smiles.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* But that makes no sense!  
  
&gt;*Me:* I know.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Why didn't you raise this with the client?  
  
&gt;*Me:* I did. I then was accused of insulting the client’s project manager and calling him incompetent.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Who wrote this specification?  
  
&gt;*Me:* Douche over on their side did. I'm pretty sure you two would have been CC'd on the email when it came across.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Well what are we going to do? We have to fix this before they go live on Sunday! (it's now 3:45 Friday Afternoon)  
  
&gt;*Boss:* No chance. We only release new code on Monday or Tuesday unless it's a priority 1 issue. Even then, this is an API that multiple clients are now using and we'll have to be careful not to break their integrations.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Steve, You might want to look at section 21 on that document.  
  
Steve quickly flicks to this section of the documentation where the final clause states how any modifications to this constitute as a change request and chargeable work. Steve is much more calm because he knows his ass is covered. That and I've made him some serious commission from clauses like that in the past.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* OK, wait there.  
  
Steve now stands a chance to make a considerable amount of commission. The client wrote the requirements, signed off the requirements, signed off the work in Acceptance Testing, and have only 32 hours before they launch. They will be willing to pay a significant sum to fund the overtime required from personnel to get this straight.  
  
**The Prestige:**  
It's 4:45 and I am considering what I'll spend my weekend doing. Boss walks out of his office and comes over to me.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Can you just join me on a conference call?  
  
&gt;*Me:* If it's quick.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* That's up to you really.  
  
Intrigued, I follow him into his office where I can hear a much more humble sounding Douche on the phone, explaining to Steve what needs to be done.  
  
&gt;*Boss:* Steve, I have Derp here, do you want to explain what the plan is?  
  
&gt;*Steve:* Derp, we really need to get this sorted. You worked on the original feature so you'll know the best way to test this. We're still working on getting someone to develop the change but we'll be willing to pay you triple time this evening and tomorrow to work on this for Sunday. We reckon we can do this patch without any impact to our other clients.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* I really need you to help me out here mate, otherwise it'll really hit the fan over here.  
  
I pause and enjoy this brief moment of pure justice.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I've already made plans for this weekend and...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Derp, seriously, you HAVE to help me out here.  
  
&gt;*Me:* I don’t really feel like it.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* WELL SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX THIS!!  
  
&gt;*Boss:* It's 5pm on a Friday. Most staff are on their way home or out the door. Sorry Steve but it looks like it'll have to wait until next week.  
  
Douche rages down the phone and, once this torrent of abuse subsides, Steve lets me go back to my desk.
I'm packing up for the end of the day and my phone rings.  
  
&gt;*Me:* &lt;Company&gt;, Derp spea...  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I need you to do this.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You need to sort this out and calling me won't help you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please, I'm sorry, just help me out.  
  
&gt;*Me:* You have been extremely rude to me and insulted me whenever we've spoken. Your failure to listen to me is the sole reason you're here right now. I did exactly what you asked and you have treated me with contempt every step of the way. I am not helping you.  
  
&gt;*Douche:* Please...  
  
He's actually crying. You can hear it in the way his voice is all shaky. So I hang up and leave for my weekend.  
  
**The Reveal:**  
Monday rolls around and Steve introduces me to a new project manager for the client who's organising the fix to the API.  
  
&gt;*Steve:* So, Derp, this is Herp. Another project manager for &lt;Client_Name&gt;.  
  
&gt;*Me:* Is Douche not working on this project?  
  
&gt;*Herp:* Douche no longer works here.  
  
Tl;DR: Douche PM for client writes Spec for API. SPROC logic makes no sense, PM thinks he's infallible. QA Tech questions logic, gets reported for being insulting. Client doesn't test the API, signs it off anyway. It hits the fan, release date is ruined. PM is in DEEP and pleads for help. QA tech hangs up and enjoys weekend even more.",The Only Acceptable Use of 'I don't feel like it.',3119
wonderweirdo,241,905,16vvh6,2165,"I'm still not sure exactly what went wrong here, but this crazy woman called me up to have her boss fired.  I'm not talking about her supervisor, by boss I mean the OWNER OF THE COMPANY.  First some background, I have this client that we don't get too many calls from because the company is pretty small, and to keep costs down the owner mandates that you have to know how to use a computer before you're allowed to work on one.  So most of the calls we get are for actual computer problems.  The whole company is owned by one single man, and he's an okay person, I've talked to him.  Then yesterday I get a strange call.

Now this lady who called is, shall we say, expressive.  I've tried to recreate they way she says things in order to give you an idea of how it went.  Despite that I haven't gotten it all in there verbatim, not that I'd want to. 

**ME:** Helpdesk, this is wonderweirdo

**CRAZY LADY:** This is [Crazy Lady], I just fired [Boss] and I need you to delete all his passwords.

**ME:** Excuse me, you just fired [Boss]?  

**CRAZY LADY:** I haven't told him yet, I want you to kill his passwords so he can't get on the computer or get into the building.

**ME:** (Confused) Uh, ma'am, for any termination we need a termination notice to be sent to us by HR, and that may be a tall order for him, he owns the company.

**CRAZY LADY:** He doesn't own jack-shit.  That useless motherfucker just had my brothers car towed out of the parking lot.  His ass is fired, delete his codes now before I come upstairs looking for you.

**ME:** (Sends IM to manager to listen in) Hold on a second, I can't just delete his access over the phone, besides he's the owner of the company, he signs the paychecks.  

**CRAZY LADY:** Fuck you, pussy motherfucker, you're fired too!  Get your ass out of here before I come upstairs and fuck you up!""

**ME:** You do realize this is a recorded line, you may wanna take a deep breath there.

**CRAZY LADY:**  [Lots of profane language and threats]

Just then my manager signals me to end the call.

I just hang up and my manager tells me he's pulling the recording and sending it up.

A half hour later I'm just derping on my PC when I catch a call that gets transferred over to me

**ME:** Help Desk, this is wonderweirdo

**BOSS:** Hi wonderweirdo, this is [Boss] over at [Client], I was told you got a call from [Crazy Lady] today and I wanted to hear from you what happened.

I explain to him the gist of the conversation and that the recording should be available through my manager.

**BOSS:** I just wanted to let you know that [Crazy Lady] has been removed from the building.  I haven't heard what she said to you yet but she made such a huge scene we had to bring the police in, HR is taking care of the rest.

**ME:** It's not a problem, I didn't think she was really going to come after me, but it was obvious she was kind of unhinged there.

**BOSS:** Yeah, she's in the hands of the police now, she threatened a few more people around here.

**ME:** She said she was firing you because you had her brothers car towed, how was he involved, did he work there too?

**BOSS:** No, there's been a mystery car parking in our lot for a couple weeks now.  No one here seemed to own it, I decided to have it towed from our lot since we don't have enough space as it is.  I think that she might have been allowing him to park there so he didn't have to pay for it else where and she just wasn't reporting the car.

**ME:** Reporting the car?  Wait what did she do there?

**BOSS:** She was the security guard at the front desk?

**ME:** Are you serious?  I hope she wasn't armed.

**BOSS:** No, but I'm gonna call that agency about screening their people.

**ME:** Hold on, how did a security guard at the front desk think she can just fire the owner of the company.

**BOSS:** (I could hear him shrug over the phone) I have no idea.  

**ME:** Right.  Well if you need me to do anything else let me know, but I'm pretty sure the recording is on it's way to you already.

**BOSS:** Thanks, I'll be in touch.  

**UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE**

Okay, I've done a little digging since I posted this.  Though this didn't make the news, through certain online sources I was able to find the arrest record.  I was tempted to post it but that could have lead to a violation of privacy I'd have been on the hook for.  This client is not in the same state as I am, it's all over the phone.  I looked up the arrests in the city where the client is and found her.  Even though she was arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal threatening, those charges were expanded to include possession of crack-cocaine.  Which explains a great deal.

jon6,334,3099,1aspaf,2149,"Monday came to see the fruition of my power move. Facilities were present and correct at the IT Cupboard, busy fitting brand new desks and trunking. On completion, MAFG and I replaced the Ghost Server in its rightful setting on top of a 12u comms cabinet, as though a rightful leader was being returned to the throne. 

There wasn't much time for moonlighting as there was a massive backlog of builds to get through and only a week left until possibly the largest induction session I'd ever run. Our Birmingham satellite office had a recruitment drive and were busing down 40 delegates the following Monday for new gear and IT training.

It felt good, like we were back in business. I expected some sort of a backlash from Angie. Obviously I had caught her off-guard and she needed time to regroup and plan her strategy. All I could do was wait for the strike. But for now, we all reveled in our little victory.

Several laptops were busy building on the build desk as I clicked away making some new AD accounts for my incoming party of inductees. Having received sign-off previously from BHIT to replace the missing desktops Facilities managed to lose with brand new machines, I had them all loaded on a trolley, ready to roll them out. MAFG was busying himself with an inventory of mini keyboards and mice, taking stock for an urgent purchase order. We chatted casually as he made his way up and down the isles; it was a full-on powerhouse of progress.

Our short-lived freedoms stopped dead like a body dropping in the middle of a busy street. The electronic lock trigged and the door opened; Angie's familiar musk of coffee and old woman perfume festooned her appearance in the doorway, her scowling face writing a thousand words of bitterness as she surveyed our veritable cave of tech. She said nothing, averting my eyes as I looked expectantly for a few seconds as I greeted her with a ""Good Morning!"" expecting some request. After a few seconds of uncomfortable silence, I ignored her again and placed my tickets sheet on top of the trolley and started to wheel out. ""Just a minute!"" she said extending a single boney finger in my direction, her tongue whipping against the top of her dry mouth. ""What are you up to in here now?"" 

A rather curious question I would wager, one which I would have thought obvious. After explaining the current goings on, little did I know I was jumping head-first into her trap. It had been barely a morning gone when she had already planned her counter-offensive to the letter. This was the scouting mission, this is where she would sew the roots of her plot. She came straight out with it: ""Where are the tickets for these 40 laptops you're supposedly building?""

Supposedly building? Tickets for induction users? Never heard of such a thing! MAFG appeared from behind the racking as if to leap to my defense. ""We generally don't log them for inductions. We usually get a fair number of requests for new machines, so we just use an AD container to build the machine and move them to live when we're rolling them out.""

Shit... MAFG really knows how to put his foot in it sometimes... ""What is AD?"" Angie demanded. I could feel the life force draining out of me as Angie realized yet another scope for micromanagement. ""Why don't I have access to it?"" her stern face looking like we had cheated her out of some mythical prize, the lines on her forehead scrunched together. Realizing his mistake, MAFG kept quiet as I tried to work around it. ""We don't generally hand out that sort of access out. If someone didn't know what they were doing, they could cause a lot of damage and the potential mess that can occur. Only MAFG and I have access to it in 2nd line as we're the only ones who administer accounts!"" 

OK, it wasn't the best work-around I could have said, but there, it's been said now!

Angie threw around some more micro-managerial criticisms before taking her leave. She also left me in no uncertain terms that she expected to see active tickets for each and every machine I was building for inductees before the end of the day. An hour out of my life for no purpose! Sigh...

Angie's final email that day made her feelings on the IT Cupboard clear; no engineer was to be in the cupboard without a ticket evidencing their need to be in there and not without the express permission of Angie first. Another typifying trait of Angie's hardline stance against ingenuity: control a person's ability to conduct themselves and create the illusion of importance by demanding constant permission seeking! 

The clever bitch had laid the foundations for her new play, there was a new ball to throw out on to the court! Tickets for every machine, permission from Angie to use the IT Cupboard! And what would she do with her new-found knowledge of AD's existence?

I contemplated these things as I drove home, sat in the traffic jam from hell. As I drew up on the accident, the gaggle of other motorists gawping at the overturned 4x4 which littered the inside lane of the motorway seemed to exemplify the futility of each day's passing as firefighters scuttled around the wreckage, feverishly confronting the mass of metal as if finally overpowering a once vastly-stronger enemy.

As I passed the scene, sure enough, the traffic started moving at it's prescribed 10mph over the speed limit. It was as if we had all just escaped some fatal consequence and were now running away for dear life.

For me, tomorrow was another day; another opportunity to dance in this fascicle struggle, conceived and birthed through the actions of this shriveled character whose aroma seemed to besmirch even the most jovial memory.

jaxmagicman,358,853,1ln41w,2138,"5 years ago I was hired at my current position to help bring the financial institution into the 21st century.  My first step was getting them a mobile platform.  Check.  My second was to take them from paper loan files to paperless.  I implemented the product one year after being hired and to this day people still don't use it correctly. 

They use the old way and then SCAN the paper into the system.  Which is the hardest way because you can send everything directly into the system without ever printing a piece of paper.  But you know, people have to hold their paper.  I have given each of the loan officers single page scanners for items that our members bring in, but they use those single page scanners to scan WHOLE entire loan documents.  

So for the last 4 years the loan officers have been complaining about HOW slow the paperless process is and how much faster the older process is.  My response has always been do it correctly and it will be faster.  I have showed them and showed them and showed them how to do it without printing and scanning.  And they have all responded for the last 4 years that their way is quicker and that I am not a loan officer so I don't understand. And I can't tell them how to do their job.

SO comes today.  I made a deal with them. I would take on their fastest loan officer and that person could do it their way and I would take a loan and do it my way.  If I finished first, they have to learn the way I want them to do it.  If their loan officer finishes first, I will never again bring it up and I will get each branch a big multipage scanner.

They picked the person who complains the most.  The person who gives me the hardest time about how fast she is with the old way and how my scanning PAPERLESS is causing more headaches than it is worth.  

We sat down and they started the clock.  I am sure they thought that with me not actually being a loan officer I didn't have the experience.  The goal was to get everything into the system and the person who got it done first would win.  

It started out as a small competition.  Everyone was watching.  She got off to a fast start because she knows the boxes.  She can type without even reading what is coming up.  I was still busy typing in the data into the system as she started to print.  I was just finishing up entry of the information when she started to scan.  I hit my button to send everything over into the system and there was stunned silence when I said 'DONE' and she was in the process of scanning 35 pages still.

They didn't believe me at first.  They all said I probably didn't do it correctly because she was way ahead of me in the process.  I showed them my completed loan in the system and they all went over it with a fine-toothed comb looking for a mistake.  Telling her to keep going that if I made a mistake she could still win. 

I had made no mistake.  I just didn't have to spend 10 minutes scanning single pages of stuff JUST to scan it.  They can now all shut-up and learn the system like I have been begging them to do for 4 years because I beat their best and I don't even know their job.",I come to you guys glorious!

TollhouseFrank,510,1168,1nzgin,2137,"Another story from my magical job at that now closed dial-up company.  
*****

I had been at the company now for a year and a half or so (was there slightly over 2 years) and had become good friends with some of our 'regulars' - aka repeat callers.  If you have ever worked at a small company and have regulars, you know how it goes.  You see their phone number on the caller id and you know who it is and what the problem is before picking up the receiver.  Some of the regulars were not so nice and were not friends - they were more like enemies to be treated politely so as to get them off the phone as fast as possible with as little stress as possible.


One of these repeat enemies - errrr... callers - claimed to be a professor at a local college in it's engineering department and all the time talked about the 'boost in spending' after it got paired with a much larger college near the northern panhandle (if you are from WV, you already know which college it is).  He was very snooty, and because he was so smart, had a ""Doctorate"", and taught a 'real discipline', not a 'fake industry like IT', that he was better than me and all the other techs.  You could hear the disdain in his voice everytime he called.  You could tell he thought we were beneath him, and should service his every whim.


Well, after dealing with him for months, and his disdain over everything - even calling me a liar when I explained to him how noise on the phoneline interfered with the signal - I finally got the ""shocker"" of a call from him.  As an explanation of the ""lie"" about noise on the lines - being an ""Engineer"", he was too smart to fall for the lies of interference and instead kept telling me how noise on the line wasn't possible because it was against Electrical Physics Properties or some such thing. 


Anyway, he calls in one day, and claims to have a bought a new computer and wants us to walk him through setting up the connection - aka ""the only useful damn thing you retards can do"".  That is an exact quote from that call.  After doing the usual steps, and being ready to get him off the phone, I tell him he will have to hang up to then dial-in and try the service.  


But WAIT my friends, he is an ENGINEER!  He thought ahead!  He was on his brand new Portable Mobility Enhancement Device!  Crying inwardly, I went into robot mode and waited as he tried to dial up.  1x.  2x.  3x.  by the 4th attempt, it was obvious he was getting no dial-tone.  I asked him to double check to make sure the phone cord was connected at the wall and at the computer.  He got mad and cussed at me, but then 'confirmed' it was.  I even had him unplug/replug both ends until he heard the 'click' just to make sure it was firmly seated.  


After he tried again, still no dial-tone, I concluded his pc had a bad modem from the factory (it happens, modems were throw-away devices and had terrible failure rates) and as I was starting to suggest this, he cut me off, and stated the following gem of wisdom:
*****
""I don't need a modem.  This new PC has a Universal Serial Bus port.  I just flattened the end of the phone line with a pair of pliers and jammed it into that port.  It is Universal, so that means it will fit and use anything!""
*****

I was stunned.  Beyond stunned.  He was a self proclaimed ""Engineer and Useful Member of Society"" and I was a ""Useless IT Retard"".  Yet to hear him admit to purposely mangling and misusing a phone jack and USB port (I have no idea how he fit it in there, even squished with a pair of pliers) just floored me.  


At this point, I just started laughing.  It was all I could do.  I laughed hard and long.  The more he got mad and yelled and cussed at me, the more I laughed.  After a few minutes, I calmed down enough to tell him to take his brand new computer to his IT Department on campus and have them explain to him why what he did wouldn't work.  


Later that month, he sent a 'strongly worded' letter to us asking us to disconnect him from the service because our dial-up did not work with Universal Sandwiches - Yes, a direct quote from his letter.
*****
TL;DR - USB will work with anything, even if it doesn't fit.

jon6,343,2512,1anqmu,2139,"My attempts at garnering moral support from my girlfriend had failed. After recounting the day's events, she thought my overreaction was simply the male chauvinist in me speaking out against a woman who was just struggling in a man's world and in her eyes doing it well! 

Arriving for work, I had three video conferences to get set up planned for exactly the same start times. After working diligently to get them set up, I finally set off for the ground floor, the home of IT Support. This time, having grown smart of Angie's disposition for anyone drinking coffee, I swung by the kitchen first.

Oh yes, Angie's still on form today. I sit at my desk and fire up my machine. Angie glares at me, whatever I'm learning to ignore it. ""Anything to say?"" she sniped? OK, I wasn't quite expecting it to be that open-ended... ""No?"" came my reply, accompanied with my best ""What's going on 'ere then"" look.

Off we go to her meeting room which appears to have become her favorite place to dress down her troops. Half expecting an array of torture weapons to now adorn the walls, she slammed the door behind us. ""Why were you late?"" she demanded. Confused, I informed her I wasn't late; I was in fact 15 minutes early! I had arrived at 8:45 to get the video conferences set up for 9:00, despite the fact that my shift wasn't actually due to start till 9:00 anyway. However, due to a slight technical issue whereby sound from the American side of the video conference had failed, I was working with a counterpart to resolve the issue, thus arriving at my desk at 10:20.

I'm sure you can imagine how well my explanation was received. I may as well have made up a story about having to perform a few impromptu acts of lion taming after some had escaped from the zoo and found their way into the building, trapping me for 20 minutes. It would have been just as well listened to.

She then proceeded to have me calculate with her on the white board that, if I was 20 minutes late every day, how much I would effectively cost the company over the course of a year, which worked out to approximately 12 working days. She then demanded to know why I felt it was OK to cost the company12 days and what was I going to do to make amends? Despite offering to refer her to ticket numbers requesting video conference set up, evidence of my keycard accessing the building 15 minutes before my shift, the end result was I was 20 minutes late for work, it'd be added on at the end of the day and that was the end of it.

She then demanded, ""I called your work mobile. Why do you not have your work mobile?"" Aha - one I can win :) ""You had me give it away to a new starter in Monday's IT Induction!"". Angie demanded to know why I hadn't ordered another one from Vodafone. Sadly, Vodafone have already distributed our contracted quota of Blackberry smartphones, the Nokias we have are basically junk and don't integrate with email - kinda crucial for our work - and until the new starter feels like swapping back my Blackberry for a rubbish Nokia, I would be without. Not a very likely scenario as you can imagine!

Sadly, no... I didn't win. Ordered to retrieve an old Nokia and new SIM card, she demanded to know if other members of 2nd line were also similarly furnished. I knew where this was headed; no more blackberries for anyone! We'd all be on the rubbish parts-bin Nokias by the end of the day!

This made me wonder about the subject of the rat. On the one hand, given I had now inadvertently ratted my team twice now, frogmarched into cul-de-sacs of inevitable verbal doom by her spitefully clever wordplay, I just wondered if the rat was indeed all of us who, at various times, had fallen foul of her twisted bent nature. But no. Someone showed her how to use a printer; someone retrieved ticket logs from TouchPaper; someone put her onto the IT Cupboard... the thought bothered me.

An urgent call awaited my attention when I got back, coffee now cold and bitter to the taste. It seemed a PA had a non-functioning PC. Rushing up to the scene, it seemed that someone had attempted to help the PA out prior to her calling support. The 18 year old work experience kid they had up there diagnosed a RAM problem and tried to reseat it. However, this had failed to do the job and the PA remained with a beeping machine.

After trying a few rudimentary things, it was apparent that there was no quick fix. I unplugged and picked it up, promising to return moments later with one of our spare stock machines by way of a temporary fix. Not ideal, but at least she could get to her profile data (we used roaming profiles) and use standard services. 

A b-line made for the IT Cupboard, I found my card failed to open the door. I tried again, no luck. Defeated, I made my way back to the desk, PA's machine in hand. I returned with MAFG whose card also failed to unlock the door. The reason became clear upon our return to ITS. One of our number who had hit a similar problem had found out that Angie had also demanded our access be removed from the IT cupboard. From now on, access was to be via facilities and only after her approval! 

Great! Especially useful as Angie had already left the office with her drinking group to experiment with yet another of Starbucks' many offerings. Running around like a madman trying to find anyone from facilities who wasn't already changing a light bulb or driving a fork-lift and was willing to bend the rules slightly. A few 3rd liners tried their access cards to find that they too were now ostracized from our precious bounty. Our actions were similarly stunted when pleading our case towards Balding IT Head who simply responded that he supported Angie's decision and that undeployed hardware was technically responsibility of facilities! OK, maybe technically, but this is stupid!

30 minutes later, still no Angie, still no facilities. The PA's umpteenth attempt to get news on her machine came through from Helpdesk closely followed by a call from he dept head, demanding to know why we were stopping his PA from working.

OK, nothing for it, lets see what we can do with her machine! Already receiving glares from three fat Finance ladies as I begin tearing the side off her machine, we set to work. After various tests, MAFG and I agree that the power supply sounds like the culprit. Kicking my machine off as they're the same model, I can only think to try mine.

15 minutes later, armed only with a knife stained with old jam which had been liberated from the canteen at some point and found in someone's drawer, I managed to remove PSU screws from my machine's PSU and the PAs machine. A quick hodge-podge to exchange the PA's PSU, we hastily hook back up the cables. A quick power on test reveals the glorious Windows XP boot screen, problem solved. We shut it down carefully, reattach the bits and pieces and I make for the elevator leaving my own machine stranded on my desk like a recently-sacrificed chicken, the murder weapon with most of the jam scraped left adjacent.

I've reattached PA lady's machine, but it's all too late. Her boss is chewing me out over there now being an hour lost of her time. Despite my best attempts to calm the situation down, citing a problem with security access, he vows to email my manager immediately, going so far as to demand names! PA lady thanks me anyway for my efforts in as an apologetic way as she can. 

The day plays itself out to conclusion. It takes me until the afternoon to find anyone from facilities to let me into the IT Cupboard. I retrieve a power supply for my own machine and reattach it in the same caveman like style as it had been withdrawn. Angie passes my desk as I finish up, pointed at the knife and demanded ""What is that?"". I got 1/3rd of the way into the first sentence of explaining its role in reattaching a new power supply when she snapped ""Take it back to the canteen right now!""

I spent the rest of the day on desk visits, guiding users around various windows issues, doing a desk move and I finish the day up with mentoring a guy on the virtues of active directory. 

I knew I had an Angie moan coming. I was expecting it at any minute. But, to my surprise, Angie left for the day... what... no come back? No dragging into the meeting room of doom for another lesson in stupid? That PA's boss was very definite about laying the smackdown? Where is it?

Driving home, it bothered me that Angie had said nothing about this complaint. Had she realized she was wrong? No... I dismissed that very quickly! Total bitches like that are never wrong in their eyes! It usually means that people like me failed to understand properly and need a shouting at to get it through my thick skull! But where was the backlash.

I was stopped at lights watching a mother scold her child as they crossed the road. This made me realize. It was all just another spiteful orchestration by Angie. She knew that I knew there was a complaint. She knew I'd be expecting her to smack me down over it. But what she knew and what I didn't think of until now, was that there was no sense on doing this on a Friday. It's the weekend after all! She wants this exact situation... she wants me wondering what sort of smackdown awaits me Monday morning - and she wants me to think about this all weekend, just anything to make sure the stress builds up.

Oh Angie... clever! VERY clever!

",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt7: One Friday to rue them all,4651
quantum_anomaly,268,955,1mhz9j,2135,"So in the past 5 years, I've been aggressively trying to get myself in the IT industry. I went back to college full time in a great Networking Technologies program, but then the wife at the time hung divorce over my head. Dropped out of out college to work on relationship, still ended up getting divorced.

I felt like my chance at having a professional job in the IT industry was gone. I used to day dream about having the chance of being that guy, where the boss called you of a critical issue and needed you in ASAP. IT/Networking has always been a passion for me, and I was dedicated to having a job where I wake up and look forward to work. 

Fast forward 5 years.

Those day dreams became a reality. Two months ago, I was very fortunate to have landed a data center admin. position. Even though I was not able to finish my degree in networking, I was able to some how make the cut out of the 65 applicants, who probably had better credentials than myself.

Last weekend was when the day dreaming became real. I was at a friend's house BBQ'ing, and it was around 8pm that night when I got the call. Boss says ""Hey quantum_anomaly is there anyway you can come to the data center? I know you're BBQ'ing but we've had 3 servers go down since 3am. We're not understanding what the Network Engineers in corporate are asking, and we need your help.""

I immediately accept and head into the DC wearing shorts and a tee, along with 6 beers in the belly. I got on the phone conference and got the low down of the issue. In the 2 hours that I worked that evening, I was able to resolve the issue and bring the servers back online that were down since 3am. I went back to the BBQ after that late night IT encounter and finished my 12 pack of Warsteiner Dunkel.

Turns out that my boss's-boss was on the conference call and I scored some hardcore brownie points. The whole team thanked me up and down for helping them restore the servers on a short notice. I left the office that night with a massive smile and a feeling of accomplishment. I got a little teary-eyed too, because I was once told by the ex-wife's parents that I would never be successful in obtaining a professional IT career. Don't ever let someone or an event prevent you from doing what you love doing. My fear after the divorce was that I would become a depressed old man by not living a wholesomely-fulfilled life, and I refused to let that happen.

tl;dr ex-wife wanted a divorce while in college for IT career, so I dropped out. Wife still left and I still landed the IT career I always wanted, even though her parents stated that I would never obtain my dream job.","It finally happened, that big time IT feeling.",3090
jon6,314,2831,1aq69v,2123,"I walked into the office Tuesday morning, brandishing a Starbucks latte with a ginger shot. It was my little way of celebrating my minor victory of no customers waiting to tear my face off for lack of machines. OK, there was a little part of me happy about getting just a little win over Angie. My mind was already on the task of prepping up some laptops for the next round of inductees due in a few weeks. At this rate, I may even get time to reimage my own machine as it badly needed it.

Into the office I go, exchanging light pleasantries with the security guards. Now, I'm not sure why I didn't expect it. I thought the battle was won, this round was done and dusted and, more importantly, the meeting room booked for the week. 

MAFG looked at me in sympathy as a crowd rallied around Meeting Room 6. BHIT, with two facilities guys and several third line guys were gathered in what seemed to be some sort of epic teardown, akin to one of those American cop shows exercising a search warrant. 

I walked straight up to own my actions, nonchalantly still brandishing my victory coffee. BHIT seemed to ignore me at first, issuing orders to some of the third liners unplugging my gear. Turning his attentions to me, his usually weak and ineffectual voice had now transformed into an authoritative bark as he demanded, ""I don't know what you're playing it, but this is not on! You cannot turn a meeting room into a comms room."" Add in more bleating with health and safety concerns, my explanation of complete lack of build space and subsequent apathy by both him and Angie was why I took matters into my own hands, rather than annoy several customers still waiting on machines.

I was ordered back to my desk. The thirdline monkeys tore down my man-cave which I had lovingly pieced together in as temporary and easily mobile a fashion I could. The familiar green t-shirt clad facilities guys wheeled away my contraband as I watched, the rest of my now tepid coffee disappearing down my throat as evocatively as my victory. 

As it would seem, this would eventually serve to complicate matters wholly as the customer machines which had been imaged or were waiting for imaging were taken off to some mystical third-line hole where I was unable to get at them. In fact, as it would later transpire, I would never see those desktops ever again.

All the while, Angie sat with her back to me, presumably trying to get to grips with TouchPaper. I knew she was everything to do with it, but at the same time, it was only BHIT and facilities people up there. 

My answers were provided moments later when BHIT came for another chat, telling me in no uncertain terms that booking a meeting room to perform IT work was totally out of bounds. Right at that moment, Fat Finance Bint appeared by his side. She was aching to get her say in too! Suddenly, this was making sense!

In her finely tuned ultra-moralistic vocal tone that could have only been honed over an extensive career of patronizing anyone who crossed her path, she pleaded with me that my actions were selfish and wrong; ""You can't just take over meeting rooms, we need those rooms all the time for legal purposes! You can't just take one, they aren't there for you to just ""use"" as you please!"" Her rising inflection that completed every sentence drove through my skull like rusty nails on a blackboard. 

Amazing! In the time I've been there, I don't think I've ever seen finance use one of the meeting rooms once. In fact, there were eight of them and two were used as archive storage and not locked either! Most of the rooms sat unused day in, day out. But now I see the path of treachery. Angie didn't like the fact she'd lost; Fat Finance Bint complained on her behalf to her manager; he called his people; they called their people; they eventually called BHIT who immediately agreed with his higher ups.

I threw down the gauntlet. ""We used to build all the time in the IT Cupboard. That was suddenly disallowed. We cannot build at our desks, we cannot use any of the server rooms as there's no space and now when I book a meeting room through the proper channels to get some work done, this is suddenly out of bounds. Exactly how are we supposed to do our jobs"". I followed this up by fervently clicking through several open tickets, pointing out several tickets requiring build time.

BHIT stood mute, as impotent as ever. He didn't have the answers or the means to get them. He just simply retorted, ""Well this is the first I've heard of any problems! You need to communicate with your manager more!""

How can it be this difficult to just do your damned job?

That day I happened to lunch with one of the third line guys. I relayed to him our tales of woe following Angie's arrival. He was almost stunned. He did mention how he's been unable to access the IT Cupboard for a while but when he was 2nd line, the IT Cupboard was always the build area.

Nevertheless, I had to admit defeat. I'd already made so many positive impressions up the ladder, being cited as a troublemaker was not something that would have been useful. I returned to my desk to the first of many emails from a customer, dutifully CC'ing their managers in a typical passive-aggressive style: ""Where is my machine? You took it three days ago and I'm still having to use the spare laptop you gave me?""

It seemed I was now more behind. Work was piling up, inter-team tensions were getting high and all the while, Angie sat and clicked around various tickets not saying a word. Fearing a further reprisal, I took finger to keyboard and again demanded Angie and BHIT work out where our build areas should be.

As the afternoon grew darker, I carried on desk visits, refusing to take any more machines away. Angie rose from her desk at 5pm and in an unnatural tone, just said ""Night all!"". 

She had managed to win the entire battle without lifting a finger, nearly vindicated in her arrogant yet chanty swansong. Clearly, this beast of hell was more learned than me in the art of war - and it seemed she held all the cards too! Was there to be no retribution for this?

",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt10: ...and one step back for ITS,4954
jon6,145,2475,1annxl,2117,"As I closed the door on my cozy warm house on a bitterly frosty Thursday morning, clutching my car keys in one hand and a small plastic scraper in the other, I immediately regretted my decision of not purchasing gloves the previous night while shopping. My car bellowed smoke as it churned into life as my red cracking knuckles powered the scraper into the solid ice on the car windows. The fact I had purchased a Ford for it's clever quick-clear windscreen technology just seemed to mock me more as the damned thing was had failed to operate at all over the last few days.

I made it to work and felt rather disappointed with the turn-out of animal rights protesters - the promise of an impending and very visual protest outside the gates of the center as emailed by HR seemed rather overkill as I spied a single figure waving a poorly legible placard from near the gate, being carefully watched by two security guards. It seemed a rather poor effort!

I duly parked my car in the usual spot next to a brand new looking Jaguar. I admired its sleek lines and somewhere in the back of my head, thought that one of these days, all this toil will be worth it!

Exchanging early morning pleasantries with various security guards, I arrived at my desk and removing my jacket, the cold radiating outward. I couldn't help but notice a familiar stern sniff. Jesus... Angie was here before me!? There I was hoping for at least an hour or two of recovery from this morning's voyage before having her in my face.

Mere moments had I sat down to get my machine warmed, I reached into my drawer for my coffee cup only to find Angie standing right next to me, her stature akin to that of a Hitchcock serial killer. Armed with her coffee cup, she placed it on my desk, dragged over a nearby chair and sat with notebook in hand. 

""Can I help?"" I politely inquired. ""I want to see what you get up to in the morning!"". I motioned towards my empty coffee cup, but she meant business! ""You can get your tea later! I want to see what you're going to do first; open the paper program!"" (She meant TouchPaper...)

The next two hours was like being dragged over icy knives naked! I had started the day with eleven open tickets, six of which I knew were long ones and had already made appointments to service that day. The other five I could knock out easily while waiting for builds to finish thus leaving plenty time free to pick up anything new that came in. 

Angie's plan was for me to pretty much assign myself almost every open ticket - even those not to do with 2nd line Support. My colleagues started to arrive one by one and on seeing this spectacle, shrunk into their seats, trying to root out any ticket which would mean escaping their desks and the vicinity of Angie. 

By 11 o'clock, my queue looked like a ticket-bomb had gone off. 47 open tickets! Crikey - what was I meant to be doing this morning? Angie had retreated back to her lair as Middle-Aged Family Guy sent me a quick communicator message, ""Do you want me to have a look at some of those cases for you?"" I duly replied whatever he fancied doing, go for it. 

After taking a couple of password resets, Angie's snarl came from her desk... ""Jon6, I did not tell you to make others do your work for you! MAFG, if you have nothing to do, I am more than happy to GIVE you something to do!"" MAFG quickly retreated back to his own call list without saying a word. 5 motionless minutes elapsed, until Angie walked up to MAFG and ordered him to accompany her. They disappeared into the murky depths of the corridor, swallowed by the blackness to some horrible fate.

I decided to keep to my plan that day. I retrieved five machines from leavers' desks and made for the IT Cupboard to get them re-imaged for some imminent arrivals and replacements. I sat in the dimly lit room as the unattended scripts did their bit; I had a rep's laptop in several bits to replace a faulty screen before he would leave for a flight. 

The sound of the security badge failing in the electronic lock, followed by the sincere knock on the door, thrice performed, meant it could only have been one person. Up until now, although she knew it existed, Angie had no idea how to get to this place much less have access to it. Putting on my pro-face, I duly opened the door. Immediately, Angie went for the neck, a starbucks tall firmly clasped in her bony fingers, eyes like a spear!

""What are you doing in here? Why aren't you at your desk? What is going on in here?""

I politely showed her around the IT Cupboard, though what I really wanted to do was batter her with bits of Dell laptop and bury her somewhere in with the junk P133 Viglens, kept only for laboratories and their outdated gear. The prospect of me attempting to fit her bitter bony body into a fullsize tower also crossed my mind. Not happy with my explanation (there's a surprise), she ordered me back to desk despite my protests that the rep was expecting their laptop back before leaving today for his flight to whereeverthehell, and the fact that the machines I was imaging needed to be on desks by close of business.

Planted at my desk, she left me there with a ""Now get on with your work and don't let me catch you again!"" I felt impotent. Time for a reaction. I figured, if the above work doesn't happen, I'm in it with several department heads. If I go back, I'm in it with Angie. So, I fired an email to Balding IT Head, CC'ing in Angie, asking for direction. It read, ""I have work going on in the IT cupboard which requires resolution. Angie has made it clear that I am not to return to the IT cupboard. Can you please provide direction as to how this work should be completed?""

Mere seconds after I signed my fate, Angie frog-marched me and some spotty helpdesk kid back to the IT Cupboard. She ordered us complete the work as she watched and verified every step. Of course, spotty helpdesk kid had no idea what any of these 2nd line processes were about and questioned nearly every stage. An hour later we were finished and went our seperate ways to re-deploy our efforts. As I walked away with two machines and a laptop bag slung, she said ""I want you back at your desk in ten minutes, don't let me come looking for you!""

That afternoon, Angie sent us all an email! We couldn't help but imagine it read aloud by her razor sharp tongue, each paragraph almost lyrical in its context. Her order was that the IT Cupboard is no longer to be used for any sort of maintenance or work; it is for storage of computing equipment only. Having recently learned that her circle of ""bitter women in positions of power that drink too much Starbucks coffee"" also included some oversized tank of a HR Administrator, the icing to the cake was present and correct citing health and safety violations and that any further activities would be referred to management for disciplinary.

A few of us held vigil over our lost IT Cupboard as we watched several burly men from facilities tear down our nest. The glorious ghost server which held all our builds slammed onto a trolley, ready for its trip back to the server room; our beautifully installed network cabling and network switch was unceremoniously ripped from the wall and tossed into a rubbish old box; our carefully ordered and neatly packed away toolkits were also in a box, it seemed that they had been claimed in the name of facilities; our electric kettle, together with a tin containing our hotel and restaurant liberated packs of tea bags, coffee, sugar and dairy creamers were tossed into a black bag headed for the skip.

We discussed the predicament in depth. How would we image machines with a three-item limit on our desks? Where would we go to dismantle machines to replace or upgrade hardware? These sentiments were later echoed when one of the server admins asked ""I notice the ghost server is on a trolley in one of the network riser rooms; I thought you guys needed that for building machines?"" Yeah... we did too!

My shift ended and I made for the sanctuary of my car, again a thick layer of ice and snow serving to only impede my progress. I again noticed the brand new Jaguar which had miraculously seemed immune from the effects of this brutal British summer. You can all predict who was behind the wheel. Angie glanced as she noticed me approach over her black leather steering wheel, no smile or acknowledgement. She reversed out of her space as her shining black Jag powered her away from my presence; her work for the day was done.

Thorougly deflated, I clicked my Ford Mondeo's remote key. Strange, the remote wouldn't work. I put the key into the lock and the central locking groaned into life. Sitting into my ice pit, realizing the water that had leaked from the roof onto my seat had now frozen, a quick turn of the key also revealed that it also wouldn't start. A few more tries and there could only be one culprit. My reward from the day's toil was one flat battery and an hour waiting for the RAC Recovery person to arrive and give me a jump start. Bang goes my early leaving time.

What a day... ",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt6: Marking territories,4592
jon6,221,2666,1apz9g,2089,"The week came to its natural conclusion over several bottles of spilt milk and the mandated amount of crying. Several more instances of Angie's managerial style being put into action came and went. However, I still had tickets building up which needed build area time. Realising BHIT was ineffective in offering a solution, I tried and failed to sweet-talk third line into segregating some of their server room space for machine builds. I turned my attention to our so-far more than amenable post-room guys. But it seems I was slightly pushing it at the prospect of wheeling our server in there. The request was met with more displeasure at our storing new laptops and bags in there already.

The answer flooded towards me one day when Angie, Fat Finance wench, unnaturally skinny finance wench and the HR Tank took off for their near twice daily trip to Starbucks. I heard them gossiping about their new coffee related discovery on their way out. See, they have to take baby steps otherwise HR Tank will break out in tonnes of sweat. But, so I hear, ginger shots in lattes are simply gorgeous! 

Angie's seemless change in personality between her dealings with us and her friends still resonated around the team with astonishment. It was just odd to hear this scorpion do nothing but treat us like shit all day, but then with friends actually smile and be human. But, my time came to put my diabolical ""fuck you"" plan into action!

Like batman with a purpose, I ran round the office building like a thing possessed! I had a third liner retrieve our imprisoned Ghost server from the network riser room and patched up some network ports. I finished phase 1 of my mission with an email to Angie requesting several parts from the IT Cupboard just as she returned, stinking of coffee and biscotti. She accepted my request with a disinterested but reassuredly managerial style.

Monday morning. Car defrosted, it's time to get the hammers on! I'm at work early for phase 2.

Quiet Blonde Girl (QBG) always seemed to fly under Angie's radar. I did initially suspect her to be our rat as she has a tendancy to be popular with higher up types. Though I would say a lot of that would be hormonal. Her arrival in Helpdesk was a little perplexing as nobody - not even the helpdesk manager - had even interviewed her. Similarly, her record quick transfer to 2nd line was equally enigmatic. I think we were just lucky that QBG was actually a decent worker and learned quickly. Underhandedness? Personally, I think more cleavage-related! 

All suspicions of her being a mole were slightly dispelled one lunch hour when she launched into a seething verbal attack about Angie; the sort of stuff that had it ever been heard by anyone with power would have definitely landed QBG with her P45 (the sack). However, Monday was to be her day. She had done some extraordinarily terrible thing and it was time for her to feel Angie's wrath. And, female to good looking female, Angie was in no way going to let her off lightly! 

But, I was ready and waiting for Angie.

Angie, with QBG in tow, opened door to her dungeon of dispair with an angered and authoritative fling. She stood in the doorway sideways, motioning for QBG to enter. 

Her attention was soon diverted. There was I, several machines imaging on top of the file cabinets, two further machines lay dissected on the table and a studious and official amount of paperwork lay with my blue ballpoint nestled neatly on top. 

I said with a slightly officialised and victorious tone, ""Can I help you at all?""

Angie's face turned red as a small vein on the side of her temple bulged; leaving QBG outside, she closed the door and turned her attention to me. Her sharpness was echoed in the warming meeting room amidst the blur of machines. ""Who gave you permission to do this?""

My short simple reply amounted to ""Nobody; I used my initiative. We have no build areas anymore, customers are waiting on their machines!"" Knowing that there was nothing she could do, she left the room with ""I'll be checking on you later!"". 

As the door closed, it was obvious QBG had returned to her desk, assuming she had escaped capture. No such luck. Angie's venomous streak played out as she called across to her in a way one would talk to a 5 year old with a simple ""Hey you! Here!"" as her bony finger pointed downwards. QBG obliged with this demand as Angie simply stated ""This one is taken; come with me""

The door closed completely, leaving only me and my machines. I felt like some sort of mad professor finally alone in my domain.

Angie was usurped. I relaxed in my new man-cave, all manner of industriousness going on. MAFG even swung by minutes later for a victorious high-five, the smiles from other team members shining through the open door like lighthouses. 

I think I just further angered Angie more when I came out to the team that ""The room has been booked all week, but there's plenty space. Feel free to use it, back to business as usual!"". I think it was the last part. Angie's hand froze as she amateurishly moved the mouse around the screen in her attempts to find the Outlook icon again.

In a way, I did sort of feel sorry for Angie. My girlfriend's hypothesis of a lone female trying to make it in man's world resonated a little. That was until she turned around and demanded we kept the noise down, people are trying to work! Her snap only reaffirmed her brittleness.

Though something told me that I hadn't heard the last of this. One thing you will learn too about women in positions of power who aren't cut out for the job. They always win. No matter how much you think you've had the upper hand, they still win. 

I returned to my desk to reply to some emails, leaving my machines image in my cave, claimed in the name of man! I couldn't help bu wonder if this would eventually be QBG's fate; socially promoted as guys in positions of power like the eye candy until she gets to a stage where she is truly out of her depth, only able to rely on her position of authority to motivate her staff.

As it happens, I was dead right. My moment of victory was surprisingly cut short...

We have one office in Mexico with a half dozen spanish-only users.  Usually a manager who also speaks English can assist us in tech support, and the users know enough to enable remote support and usually enough English to describe a problem.

I had this amusing exchange over instant message:

**Mexican user:**  No print. 


I attempted to fix the problem and replied:

**Me:**  Print?  :-)

**Her:**  Print :-(


I tried another fix and asked

jon6,224,2798,1ashkr,2077,"The inevitable consequence of heading to bed the second you get home is that the morning tends to come quicker than you expected. I arrived bleary eyed not truly knowing what fresh hell Angie was about to concoct that day. My fate was postponed as Angie was busy providing a critique of every detail as QuietBlondeGirl rearranged her desk to Angie's preference. It became apparent that Angie had taken issue to some typical girlie deskwear and was ordering it be suitably secreted in desk drawers or disposed of.

A grim reminder of another of yesterday's ordeals came in the shape of an email from HR Tank demanding to know when her ""new faster"" computer would be delivered. Not only was HRT's computer perfectly fine, it was only 10 months old and not due for replacement for two years. This, I knew, was an argument I would have to save for later. I logged a ticket and moved on.

BHIT arrived in just after me and made a pit-stop at my desk. He must have felt it his duty to appear interested over my late night last night. His pale head seemed to silhouette against the dimly lit office lighting. I grabbed the opportunity like a child with a new toy and demanded that we resolve this build area problem immediately. With Angie trapped in her reprimand of QBG, I knew I was stealing her thunder!

""This is getting just stupid now. Customers are complaining about us doing hardware replacements and rebuilds at the desk side, what's more they're taking longer as we've had to use USB Hard disks for builds since the Ghost server went missing; we have six machines now that nobody knows where they are; the networking gear has also gone missing; What annoys me is that all this was working perfectly fine while we had our build area. So the fact remains, you need to sort this out now. We have a major rollout project coming up, sort it out!""

My concern echoed with my vocal severity; BHIT was well and truly put in his place. I could feel Angie wincing as I had beaten her to the punch. BHIT's bald head nodded as he claimed he understood. With every nod, a ceiling light just slightly came into view as he stood over my desk, almost cowering behind the green partition. It was about damn time he took this on board! BHIT walked away with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He knew I was right, he knew he had to step in. 

I sat at my desk uncomfortably, the newly recovered bleach-smelling Ghost Server had found temporary shelter home under my desk where my legs should go; the PSU fan blew hot air, almost providing some relief from the cold - a small yet powerful offering from the inanimate object almost thanking me for its rescue. The prize was doubly exciting as for first time in many weeks, my overnight WhatsAlive script proudly showed Ghost Server as now being rejoined to the network, like a soldier's homecoming. It's location? Switch 303B, port 19, area ITS.

I busied myself that morning by staying rooted to my desk, firing out responses to some of my tickets. In part, I wanted to make sure BHIT was doing his job, but I also wanted to see how Angie would react to having the rug pulled out from under her again! 

An hour rolled by and Angie was still busy reprimanding the team. She had worked out - or been shown - how to properly use TouchPaper and its accompanying stats screens! The evidence of an inter-team rat was all too clear as Angie, who could barely use Outlook, could never have worked out TouchPaper to this degree. Nevertheless, this rat would have to be discovered at a later date!

Tea in hand, I rolled up to BHIT's desk for progress. Finally, he had some news. I was to report to facilities so they could show me some rooms. I picked up my Napalm Death fleece to embark on my fantastic voyage. But, the familiar loud rattle of Angie's keys disappearing into her small leather handbag accompanied her bony figure as it stood up to place a black and grey shawl around her veiny neck. 

""Right, let's go"" she proclaimed, as if to usurp leadership of my mission. BHIT cowered behind his computer screen rather than face confrontation. What could I say? I felt the next hour of efficient decision making suddenly hampered as Angie set off to Facilities, as if dragging me by my ear like a scolded schoolboy!

After the Facilities Manager had led us to our third room visit, it soon became clear what Angie thought constituted a suitable room. She wanted something near to the main office so she could check up on us regularly, difficult to work in and not much space. Ironically, the meeting room would have fit Angie's specifications exactly!

I wanted something near the IT Cupboard for supplies - access was another battle I was soon to wage - plenty space and somewhere away from the freezing cold Aircon vents. 

We finally came upon Angie's ideal. The only access was a flight of stairs - just short enough in number to appear inconsequential, yet just ever so slightly add enough inconvenience to keep this bitter woman happy. Add to the annoyance of not being able to get a trolley up them, they were just narrow enough to ensure scraped knuckles in the event of anything bulky! This would be enough for Angie to know that this place would be a last resort - no longer a fort of solitude when the outside world became too much!

The room itself was just about big enough for a couple of desks and right above the door hummed the icy cold draft of the Aircon vent. ""This is totally unsuitable! Any one of the first few rooms would be fine!"" I protested. Angie completely ignored me as her bitter face spat out, ""This will do!"". The Facilities manager looked perplexed at Angie's decision. Rather than argue it, he just agreed and muttered something about arranging access and desks.

I knew this would happen. I relayed our adventure to ITS as Angie disappeared off for another Starbucks run with her Menopause group. Their faces looked angry. Calls of ""Out of all the rooms you just saw, Angie picked some shithole that's basically gone unused for years?"" Rather than offer an explanation, I merely motioned in the direction of BHIT, still cowering behind his monitor. 

I could see none of my colleagues were going to speak up. It'd have to be me again. Fine. ""BHIT..."" I started. He almost winced behind his monitor - he knew what was coming. ""Can you come and join us for a second?""

After regaling yet again what had just transpired, BHIT seemed like he was mustering all the courage that he could. As I continued let loose on what a stupid decision Angie had made, together with her obvious attempts to prevent the team actually working, he dug deep one last time. With a quivering yet determined voice, he said ""I thought I told YOU to get a new build room sorted out? Well, which one do YOU want?"" I looked back at my crew and just said, ""Well, actually, the IT Cupboard was perfect! It's got a window, it's worked fine for years, there's plenty storage; In fact it's only called a cupboard because there's racking and shelving in there! I also have an email you sent to Fat Tony from 3rd line when he was on 2nd authorizing the use of the Cupboard and having facilities convert part of it for workspace...""

Sometimes, the odd swift half after work with monkeys in other teams can pay dividends ;)

""Leave it with me!"" said BHIT as he made for the doorway. ITS smiled at me, but deep down I shat a brick; I've really done it now. If I wind up getting BHIT to relinquish the chains on our beloved cupboard, I can only imagine what sort of games Angie will play with that one. But I was pleased. For once, I was up where she didn't know I was up! She was out with a bunch of menopausal women, blissfully unaware, sipping her insipid Starbucks Coffee, somehow providing life support for her scrawny architecture...

I decided I didn't care about Angie's reaction anymore. I'd won a major victory. Now, to just let the day play out. I wonder what Monday Morning will bring?

Craysh,427,570,119n3q,2066,"So I came into work today and I had an email marked **urgent!* in outlook.

It seems that the ""End Of Fiscal Year"" inventory is due at the end of this week and they need some information.  

We use IBM Tivoli Endpoint Manager (purchased from a company called BigFix) for our inventory stuff (and patching, etc) so I ask what information they need.

&gt; We just need all the boxes that run websphere and their versions...

Well, that information isn't just sitting in a text file on the servers. A batch file on each box will output the information for us, and we can just pipe it into a text file, but that would require us to touch each box or push out a fixlet to do it (we obviously decided to do the latter).

After that text file is generated we can parse the information from the text file and put it in web reports (another IBM purchase from BigFix). It should be easy. (I never should have said that).

I tell them that this won't be a problem. It will take me an hour or two to set up the fixlet and the analysis for web reports, but it will probably take a day for Tivoli to gather all the relevant boxes, another day to push the action to them (we have 150k+ endpoints), and then at least 4 hours for the analysis to parse the text files and pull the version information.

Well, this is unacceptable. Their part of the report is due by End of Day and they only need some ""quick and simple"" information.

I inform them that there really isn't a way to push it any faster even if I babysit it and I do not have access to these boxes so I can't just run the batch files manually.

Well, at this point they decide to have a chat with my boss and it precipitates a meeting.

We're all sitting around the table and they tell my boss: 

&gt; Craysh has been willfully unhelpful in helping us get some easily accessed information. He gave us an eta of 2 1/2 days before he could even get to it, and this is important!

He asked me what was going on, and being familiar with Tivoli himself (as well as our environment) he understood exactly what would take so long.  He turned to the inventory group and said:

&gt; This is how long it will take to get this information parsed out. He's not stringing you along, it's just how our infrastructure will work. Once it's in place it will take at most 4 hours between updating the versioning information and it will be available to you any time you need it.

They respond:

&gt; That is totally unacceptable. We need this information in be the end of the day!

My boss responded: 

&gt; Your lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on our part.

I got chills.

dresdenslade,240,864,17xlr3,1992,"I was recently hired by my university as a tech support drone. Answer phones, trudge up the hill from the IT department to the academic buildings to plug things in, that sort of thing. Since it's a university, I have to deal with tenured professors. The worst kind, really. 

Last week I got a call around 2pm:

Me: ""Hello, IT, have you tried asking one of your students to turn it off and on again?"" Prof.: ""Yeah, hi, I'm having some issues with the ribbon, could you come take a look at my machine?""

Helpdesk policy: if a professor asks you to come look, you go do it. I'm actually glad about that one, it usually saves me from trying to interpret what's going on. 

I assumed, blindly, that the professor meant the Microsoft Office ribbon. We upgraded to Office 2010 at the beginning of last semester, and some people don't adjust well to change. 

We all know what happens when we assume, right?

Yep. Turns out ""ribbon"" meant ""typewriter ribbon."" Professor Selectric was having trouble replacing the ribbon and type ball. Lucky for him, typewriters are a hobby of mine, and I had the Selectric humming away in a matter of minutes.

MrWally,174,547,15japq,1985,"Today at the Helpdesk I was helping get an old professor set up on his new computer after a complete data transfer. He opened it up, logged on, and immediately brought up Finder and started frantically searching for a file. I noticed he was holding his breath. Then, he located a particular video, and let it out with a long sigh, pressing ""play"" and entering full screen. It was an old woman wired up to a host of machines, breathing heavily, looking right at the camera. The professor turned to me and said ""This is the only file I wanted. It's my last conversation with my wife before she passed away from cancer.""

After he left I had to take a few minutes to compose myself. Gosh. 

EDIT: Wow! I didn't expect this response at all. I'm glad you all like happy stories :) I think that everyone who works tech support agrees that it's what keeps us going :) If anyone wants to read something from the complete opposite end of the spectrum, I also just wrote this up: [Linky.](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/15jhjw/frustrating_client_calls_our_it_department/) /Shamelessselfpromotion","Today, I almost cried at the Helpdesk.

trrwilson,112,555,1b5f6x,1980,"I do onsite tech support for a large bank.  My co-worker (we'll call him Bob) and I cover an area that includes 72 locations, some are really close, some are about 3 hours away, the rest are in between.

One Sunday, a really bad thunderstorm rolled through our coverage area, a few of our locations lost power, so Bob and I were expecting a fair amount of calls on Monday.  We get to the office Monday morning, and over the course of the day, we end up with about 25 calls in four separate branches for equipment that got fried by the power outages.  We spend the entire day loading software on PCs, unboxing displays and local printers, and calling our various branches to let them know that we would be out on Tuesday.

Tuesday morning rolls around and we meet at the office and load up our cars with equipment for the day.  We leave going in the same direction, after about 45 miles, he was going to go south and get 2 of the branches, and I was going to go north and get the other 2.

About 10 minutes after leaving the office, Bob calls me.  ""trrwilson, meet me at that gas station up the road.""  We meet, and he tells me that he has to go 2 hours in the opposite direction to replace a down switch; tickets like those take priority over any others.  We transfer his equipment into my car, I wish him luck and we part ways.  While he was on the road, he called his 2 branches and let them know what was going on and that I would be out in the afternoon.

I get to my first 2 branches and things go OK.  I head south to go to the branches Bob was supposed to visit.  I get to the first one, and it was a mess.  One of the replacement PCs wouldn't come up, so I had to Frankenstein a working replacement from all the bad ones we picked up.  I finish up, and realize that I'm not going to get to my last stop before they close; not a huge problem since I have after hours access.

I call them up and tell them what's going on, and they're cool with it; then I ask them if they can mark the bad equipment for me so that I don't have to stumble around in the dark trying to figure out what I have to replace.  Again, no problem, they'll have them marked when I get there.

I arrive at the branch about 30 minutes after the last person has left; I carry my equipment into the foyer and then I see it.  There is a fun size candy bar laying on the floor of the foyer.  I figure someone had just dropped it as they were leaving.  I go through the doors into the branch lobby and then see another tiny candy bar right inside the lobby.  I look down and see that the users had made a candy trail leading from the front door into the offices with damaged equipment.

I follow the trail into the first office.  Taped to the monitor is a picture of the user fake-punching the monitor.  I pull out my copy of the ticket and check the asset tag that is listed, and sure enough, the monitor was called in; so I replace her monitor.  I follow the trail further and the next office has a picture of the user fake-stomping on their PC.  I take the hint and replace his PC.  The last stop on the trail had a picture of the user fake-kicking his printer, so it gets replaced.

Before I left, I took a picture of me giving a cheesy grin and a thumbs up and taped them to each replacement.  The next morning when I got to the shop and checked my e-mail, I found that each user had send me a picture of them hugging their new equipment.  They really managed to brighten up a long and annoying day.

",Sometimes I love my users,2535
jon6,454,3303,1b2hp0,1972,"Journeying to work that day, I knew there was to be plenty bad noise. Despite this feeling of ensuing doom, it was an oddly upbeat kind of day. The morning sun was subdued as it accompanied the first warm day of the year and seemed to fill the office with naturally warming UV light. News of our remarkable failure flurried around the office as eyes stalked my path from the lobby to my desk. 

As my Outlook churned into gear, it presented several new emails to look at; I was only waiting for one. The ominous calendar entry from our eminent Sales Director was present as expected, decorated with the high-importance flag. I spent the morning glancing through my tickets, though I really had no intention of doing any of them.

Angie appeared around her usual 10am. Her pace was rushed and the lack of her signatory Starbucks cup distinguished Angie’s obvious apprehension. “Care to explain what happened yesterday?” Her condescending vocal tone was different this time. Before, harsh and snappy like a loathsome strict teacher, a faint quiver existed somewhere in the background. “I don’t know!” I responded. For once I seemed to be in the power position. “I don't feel I was involved in this project!” She pressed for further information, her voice taking on her signatory snarl and gripe.

HR Tank, accompanied by an anonymous administrative orderly, unexpectedly appeared to relieve me of this interrogation. She demanded the immediate presence of the entire ITS department in the nearest meeting room. Again, our walking pace to the meeting room seemed exaggeratedly slow, a homage to HR Tank’s slow purposeful walk. I stood in the corner of the room only finally noticing the distinct lack of BHIT. 

HR Tank began to speak through her reddened face, fatigued from her trip. Her drained voice read her palpably pre-prepared and rubber-stamped statement from a sheet which seemed to also serve as a barrier of defence. “It has been decided,” she began “that due to incongruences that have arisen in the department of late that BHIT is no longer able to fulfil his duty as Head of IT; He will therefore not be returning to the business!” Her statement droned on with all the officialdom you would expect from such a legally exacting statement. Her statement ended with “I am authorized to answer any questions at this point”. 

The ITS team shuffled out, dazed and wounded. For his spinelessness, BHIT had evidently had all our backs somewhere along the line. We took our seats, like a pack of wounded animals returning from some failed hunt. Angie remained with HR Tank discussing an imminent Starbucks trip as Roland stood guard in her absence. We all sat still and silent, in one way to mark the demise of BHIT and, in the other, we felt that the slightest motion would be recorded and later used against us as evidence. The fact that BHIT had evidently taken the fall for the whole thing just seemed unreal. Angie’s consistent belittling and hateful nature just seemed to be the only outlook, we were shellshocked that she had apparently won!

The post-rollout meeting time came up. As Angie, Roland and I made our way to the top floor in the elevator, the air grew thick with scorn. The silence bellowed like a thousand years of social indifference, as if the slightest word could ignite the situation like a megaton bomb. It seemed like ages until the lift doors finally opened. Angie and Roland obnoxiously barged out of the lift, though I had yielded to them anyway.

This was my first time in front of an official board. The room layout had changed. The Sales and Marketing managers sat in a row along the centre line of the arranged desk, flanked by the conspicuous presence of HR Tank and another woman who it seemed was there to take notes. Cantering the congregation was a man whose obverse mannerism exuded the confidence and exterior meant he was someone of importance. 

Angie, Roland and I took up position in front of this jury of VIPs. Our plastic chairs clanged and noisily bent into form to exemplify their cheapness, an extreme contrast to the leather-bound pews claimed by the panel. The central character, who it soon became apparent was the division manager, opened with a speech akin to that of some great dictator. His appraisal of the utter failure intensified as his voice raised in volume, yet remained controlled and collected. It was like he needed to say everything he needed to say like some pre-interrogation tactic.

The panel would interview us one at a time. I remained sat outside the office with Roland as Angie pleaded her case as ITS manager. Memories of sitting outside the school principal’s office at school seemed came flooding back. Though I had never really been a bad kid, I found myself winding up outside the head’s office a few times - a Catholic warden clad in black whose manifestation was intended solely to scare straight. Roland sat with a smirk, apparently unconcerned with these on-going. His motionless gaze made me think that this guy had far more experience explaining himself to school principals than me.

Roland was up next. Angie sat in the seat Roland vacated. Her arrogant indifference mirrored Roland’s posture with eerie exactness. I began to grow worried; Angie was always one step ahead of any game currently in progress. Thoughts of explaining my job loss to my other half, thoughts of having to job-hunt made me nervous.

After an hour of waiting patiently, my time was finally up. I sat central to the panel trying to remember every interview technique that had ever been drilled into me by any chance I’d previously had to take such advice on board. I made sure to look at the person who was addressing me, back straight, shoulders back. Here we go!

The panel had their tactics down. It seemed no one person would ask more than one question at a time. The questions came slow, strategically calm and collected. The lady on the end of the panel appeared to note everything I said as the panel would wait for her silent OK to continue. At this moment, I was ready to hang Angie and her bastard youth out to dry! I just waited for my chance.

After the initial questions, largely surrounding who planned what, the director placed his pen in front of him. He placed his elbows on the table as he leaned his hardened chin on his first and second fingers, mirrored and extended to provide support. As he leaned in, he said, “Tell us, in your own words, you account of what happened”.

I relayed my entire saga, from Angie’s commandeering of the project plan, Roland’s inauguration to being responsible for the images, our flawed and hapless manner of couriering laptops instead delivering at the conference – all of it. I finished, almost spitting out my words, exercising this demon called Angie. One of the sales managers enquired, “Why didn’t you check anything before you built them?” I defended “There was no time to do that. They had been built and QA’d by Roland who apparently knew what he was doing. We had 200 machines to build and no means to verify anything!”

I couldn’t tell if I had impressed with my answer or not. The thick silence felt like a poorly performing job interview. “Why did you believe Roland fully equipped to manage this implementation?” The weightiness of their questioning became stronger. “I didn’t!” responding inadvertently with a tone similar to Angie’s impertinent and self-aggrandizing sneer. “I followed the direction of my management. I was told to leave him alone, I did!” The MD passed me a copy of my rollout plan. “Was this the rollout plan you followed?” I picked it up, glancing through the already familiar pages I had spent several days perfecting, re-enumerating before my final presentation. 

I looked up and said, “No! Angie altered the specification several times. The final version was signed off, I believe, by everyone here!” I felt like I had delivered a blow to everyone in the room who could even slightly have been rooting for me, as if I’d had twisted the knife in the very same way Angie had done to claw her way to the top!

After 30 minutes of grilling, I left the room. Angie and Roland had long vacated leaving the empty seats, their emptiness like some satirical congratulatory prize. HR Tank had concluded the meeting, thanking me for my time, ordering me back to my duties.

ITS was silent for the remainer of the day, juxtaposed against the now brilliant developing sun, obviously out of place in Britain’s Spring but seemed to invite action and good times contrasting against our office-prisoner mood. Angie and Roland were stealthy silent against the humanistic blur and shuffle of the ITS inhabitants as they adjusted their postures to comfort. The only reprieve came from Angie’s regular group ushering her to their second of their Starbucks trips, this time joined by Roland. The escape of my 4pm leaving time couldn’t have come quickly enough; I made for home, wondering if I would ever set foot in ITS again.

The crystal clear night sky gave birth to another sunny day. The grime and dirt that incrusted my car seemed to beg for a good washing and detailing session. It was relieving to have at least one thing on my list to occupy my time on the end of a dole queue. As I approached the car park gates of the pharmaceutical giant, I wondered if security would deny access to their fortress. I envisaged ramming the gate in some movie-like attempt to exact my revenge to dance on Angie’s decrepit corpse. 15 months of this woman was too much for anyone to deal with.

As I uneventfully descended the giant lobby stairs towards ITS, I expected to be bundled to the floor at any moment by all manner of burly security guards to the approving look of Angie. I was convinced this woman was far too street-smart to be outdone by anything! Almost disappointedly, ITS remained unmolested in its usual ground-floor spot. My Windows login worked, as I began to prepare for the day’s work.

I arrived back from lunch with several members of third line and our previously borrowed helpdesk guy, still licking his wounds from the onslaught of sales reps. QBG met us on our way down. She smiled wryly, excitedly yet softly declaring ""Angie’s packing her desk! She’s history!”

I didn’t believe her. I had to see this with my own eyes! 

I sat down, maintaining as detached an outlook as I could, pretending not to notice as Angie wrapped her scaly neck in the familiar black and grey shawl. Roland’s desk, surprisingly, also lay vacated. Angie disregarded the looks from ITS as she picked up her leather clutch bag and made for the exit. 

“Is she gone? Was she fired?” A fervour of questions engulfed our modest team. As we excitedly theorized and conjectured, we eventually realized that there were only questions - no answers. This tumultuous turn of events did nothing to allay my own fears. I tied myself to my desk, waiting for someone – anyone – to order me into a closed doors meeting.

But, nobody came that day… nor the next…

jon6,332,3131,1auvm9,1967,"A month had passed since MAFG's passing. Morale was at a low point and apart from Angie's bipolar temper, things seemed to slog along as they were, each day proving to be more and more difficult to get through. The IT Cupboard slowly relinquished its isolation as Angie seemed to track our movements with animal-like instinct, imposing ridiculous policy after policy. The battery indicator on MAFG's mouse had at some point faded to nothingness having spent its remaining energies fruitlessly lamenting its master’s disappearance.

MAFG sacrifice was guarded in its reasoning. Many theorized the lost machines from the meeting room had made it to his car; some theorized he’d wronged some director in a drunken moment of sincerity; there was even a rumour he had put Angie in her place in some magnificent fit of comeuppance, bathed in the flabbergasted stares of twenty faceless onlookers. The reality was far more boring and told to me over a weekend pint of fine ale. 

MAFG’s wife had previously worked with the company in their research division. She had left under explosive circumstances for a competing pharmaceutical company. Management felt that MAFG’s continued employment was incongruous and had compelled him to take a PILON agreement to end his tenure. It seemed odd that MAFG’s wife had left the company over six months ago; we felt that this discrepancy stank of Angie’s involvement.

For a while though, a specific date had shone brightly in my Outlook calendar. It had acted as a target, representing a reprieve from the mundane trivialities support had to offer. I had prepared for it arrival with jubilation. It finally arrived and my audience with several heads of sales/marketing, BHIT and the software vendor was mine to shine in. The purpose was to set into motion the plans for their large-scale laptop rollout. Armed with my carefully crafted number-work dutifully outlined on several handouts, I set off for the meeting, three floors up in the swankier part of the building. In my mind, I was Alexander the Great, sword raised in hand, off to conquer in what seemed to be an inevitable foregone conclusion. OK, I don’t know much about history, but all I knew was my sword was huge and I was about to go kick some ass!
 
My arrival at the meeting was met with the usual pleasantries and shaking of hands. The meeting room was perfectly air conditioned with several pieces of foliage standing elegantly in large ceramic plant pots. The large window welcomed the sun in vast quantities into the fragrant room. Underneath the heated rays of light was the ominous shape of Angie, sat at the far end of the room, away from all human contact. The sunlight seemed to darken and blur Angie's outline, like some satanic aura, but her bent, bitter frame was just too familiar and imposing to ignore.

The meeting began with the usual round of round-table identification. Angie’s snarled introduction was only suffixed by the words ""I am in charge of Support!"" Her declaration made an instant impression on everyone as they hastily moved on. The software vendor rep was a techy through and through. He stood for his presentation, draped in what was obviously a brand new suit purchased for the occasion. It seemed to contrive him as he awkwardly passed around his company endorsed paraphernalia; pens, cards, product sheets… there were logos on everything as if he was clearly instructed to embark on this endeavour but try to hide his obvious geekiness.

My segment came. I eagerly handed out my carefully crafted mission statement, adorned with pie charts, Gantt charts and technical jargon made just basic enough to empower even the most IT-illiterate of sales managers. I explained my intentions with a well-rehearsed speech which lasted several minutes: 212 new laptops and 57 to remain in the field. Across three hardware types; several primary targets were to be used for pilot testing; each user would receive an extra 100MB on Home drives and be responsible for their own backups; each rep's laptop would be first imaged for any later data retrieval and each rep would be re-furnished by the end of the day. 

Angie's eyes remained focused on me throughout the session. I felt odd as she hadn't interjected once. Our vendor's rep nodded in anticipation as rep after rep smiled in anticipation. They liked what they heard: new toys for everyone and all they had to do was give the all OK!

My moment of triumph at an end, Angie finally spoke up. ""What sort of manpower do we need for this?"" Her voice was rather different; she spoke as if I were part of her Menopause club, all harshness had dissipated into a normalized vocal tone. I retorted, putting aside my stunned silence, that I expected to prepare the images myself and builds would be used to train up some more junior members of staff in the absence of MAFG. She nodded in approval as she made notes. Her lack of typical Angie-style anger perturbed me. Nevertheless, the meeting ended in what appeared to be a climactic sense of collaboration as the Balding Head of IT smiled proudly, sharing all manner of manager-speak with his congregation

As the vendor techie and I exchanged pleasantries, Angie left anonymous in her wake without saying another word. I knew this move by now! Her silent departure was signatory of her underhandedness; she was up to something. It distracted me momentarily as I asked the vendor guy to repeat what he had just said… what was this devious cow up to?

I was not left in suspense for long. That afternoon, ITS were summoned to a meeting room where Angie wanted to discuss the rollout. I knew Angie was cooking something and I knew it was a clear move to usurp my finely laid plans. My only consolation was that I had the backing of BHIT and several higher-ups, what could she possibly do?

Our entrance into Angie’s meeting was made strange by the unexpected presence of a spotty urchin who had previously been chained to Helpdesk. His sharp eyes and pointed, thin facial features seemed disturbingly familiar, his unbranded shirt and pale jeans seemed to be a desperate attempt to look normal. Angie began the meeting by introducing the urchin, returning to her familiar intense vocal tone. “This is Roland. He is joining 2nd line today” she hissed as her eyes danced around the room as if to highlight her claim. 

The meeting continued with Angie’s voice droning my exact words, complete with inaccuracies one could only attribute to someone whose obvious depth had long-since been surpassed. I think at some point, the only thing keeping us awake was Angie’s voice, shrill and bent in character. She had finally finished when I decided to speak. I knew my interjection would further madden the beast, mainly as it would actually be of technical relevance and accuracy which Angie could never possibly dream of. But I had to stake my role in this project. 

“We’ll have the majority of the machines built prior to the event, so most will only need booting up and profiles loading. There will also be a ghost server, file server and we’ll have a connection back to the office. All out-of-field laptops will be backed up later back at the office, any laptops that are staying out will have to be backed up and loaded at the event in one hit. We’ll also keep ten spare new laptops just in case anything happens.”

The ITS crew hung on every word, as if I were mandating a life or death situation. Angie fired corrections in as much as she could, though mired in technical incompetence. “You will have to back up EVERYTHING you get!” her accusatory vocal sneer hinted that we may do anything different.

We had a mission, we had our tasks, I had a rollout to deliver. 

It was getting towards the end of the day. Roland had picked his spot next to me, taking MAFG’s spot. He was not talkative, he barely acknowledged anybody’s presence. A few banter-like quips intended to embroil him into our team didn’t get so much as a raised eyebrow. His body language was eerie in its familiarity.

Brandishing my purchase order, signed by BHIT and bearing Sales &amp; Marketing’s stamp approving the project with every endorsement that one could ever hope to see on such a document, I headed to the elevators to scale the heights to the Procurement department. I was joined in the elevator by QBG who seemed eager to have a word. It seemed QBG had some sort of big secret she would have burst if she hadn’t let out.

“Roland! You know who he is, don’t you?” QBG spoke softly, as if the lift were rigged with some manner of bugging equipment. “That’s Angie’s son!” Her words were difficult to believe… but Roland’s mannerisms, posture, familiar sharpness… it all rang out clear as a bell. The thought of this woman propagating seemed unnatural! It conjured images of some monstrous carnal act between a musty stick-insect and some hapless male donor entangled in her web, held prisoner for his seed. 

But, it all seemed too obvious now. Like a slow head-on car accident, everything started to make sense. There had to be someone who had shown Angie how to access TouchPaper; she was clearly still struggling with it a month on! Someone had to show Angie how to use the printers! Someone had to have fed back to Angie anything and everything we’d complained about her! Someone had to have kept Angie informed of our whereabouts – how else could she track us with such animal-like accuracy?

There he was - in the background the whole time, as enigmatic and as slimey as the bitch that spawned him. That same spotty 1st liner who Angie demanded I cleared down the IT Cupboard with so long ago, the insignificant shadow which seemed to appear every so often, as if every photographic memory which flashed into view had his image super-imposed somewhere on it… standing by a printer, walking through the ITS area, sitting nearby in the canteen… her spy, invisible to the naked eye!

As incredible as it seemed, there it was… our rat… Exposed far too late to be in any way wary, he was now closer than we could have ever imagined. We had allowed him to creep up on us like a ninja - Angie’s inside man!

jon6,244,2909,1auof4,1960,"ITS had a full compliment of staff the following morning. There was work to do - but nothing seemed important enough to leave desks for. We were all were gathered for one purpose. One of our soldiers was in trouble. Though we were powerless to do anything other than  offer moral support, we felt glued to our desks. Angie was palpably absent, her familiar black and grey shawl being the only spectral reminder of her presence somewhere in the building. MAFG was quiet; assurances of help to find other work and amending CVs came and went like splashes of water.

Soon, Angie and HR Tank arrived at MAFG's deskside. The scene, brief as it was, seemed as if they had taken him into custody short of only handcuffs. They led him to Angie's special place of solitude, situated somewhere far beyond the familiar dimly corridor just barely visible from ITS. A bulb had gone in that corridor some time ago, it just seemed that nobody had ever replaced it. 

I had seen Angie lead a few people down this corridor when they had hit the height of her displeasure. Today though, they moved artificially slowly. MAFGs limbs moved uncomfortably as if to not let on their progress was impeded by HR Tank's inability to keep up with normal walking pace - a walk that Angie had seemed to perfect. As the figures shuffled around the corner at the end of the corridor, the dim lighting served as a poignant landscape of some mysterious doom, the shadow of Angie's tall thin figure casting on the yellowing walls like some fairytale ghost. 

A few minutes of disbelief followed in ITS. The team stared at various spots on the floor of our square work area, trying to explain things in our own minds; not even a breath was audible. This two minutes silence was terminated only as MAFG's monitor emblematically entered their sleep modes and faded to black. As quickly as the images faded, so did any sense of hope or morale we barely clung onto, and so did our moment of stillness. We promptly turned to our own desks to work.

Angie and MAFG returned two quick hours later. Accompanied by two security guards, they stood sentinel to Angie's familiar sharp tongued leadership of the situation. HR Tank was nowhere around, I could only presume that her weight disallowed her making the return journey.

MAFG added personal items from his desk to a small cardboard box, his lips dry from lack of saliva, his throat obviously lumpy. Angie's stern face stood expressionless. The silence in ITS was broken only with Angie's snipes. ""Where is your USB disk, you can't take that"" she barked; MAFG coiled the USB cable around his impeccably well taken care of Freecom drive. She snatched it as he offered it to her, her eyes still now showing even a grain of benevolence.

""We need your phone too!"" Her growl seemed to antagonize MAFG, but he couldn't react. His slow purposeful movements were fighting every urge to succumb to the lump in his throat. MAFG duly handed her his trusty BlackBerry refusing to make eye contact. It instantly brought back memories to me of when we had first been issued these phones. MAFG and I had spent a good week exploring their potential, loading on useful utilities and configuring them for maximum IT Support effectiveness. They had been the formation of a good work-based friendship. It just seemed this memory was torn now, trampled on by this monster.

Angie took MAFG's BlackBerry and extended her arm in my direction,  clad in a heavy black cardigan sleeve as if to contrast so heavily with her pale skin. Her emaciated hand ushered it in my direction. As I took it from her, it felt like I was taking a gift from some devil. She said with a bitter tongue, ""There, now you have one"". I sat stunned as MAFG looked at both me and Angie.

The ordeal was nearly over - but not quite! MAFG picked up his cardboard box of meager possessions, old pay slips and desk candies. He motioned his completion, but Angie again extended her hand to block his passage. Springing into life, one of the security guards broke from his uncomfortably official-looking stance and took the box from MAFG. He placed it back on his desk. 

The guard started digging around in the box, almost neanderthal in his movements. His grey security shirt stretched over his fattened arms as he bent over for his task. He removed several company branded pens and an unopened pack of MAFG's business cards. On their discovery, each piece of contraband were cast onto the desk surface, their respective rattles and thumps a soundtrack to whatever wrong-doing MAFG had done to earn this punishment. After nodding towards Angie and refolding his arms, the security guard took his rightful place next to his colleague, both mustering as much energy as they could to maintain their stern postures. Beads of sweat ran down the guard's face; he was not used to standing this much.

The funeral march shuffled away towards the main staircase. The procession led by Angie, MAFG carrying his own cardboard coffin and the duo of security guard pallbearers seemed to have the attention of the entire floor. The only evidence of MAFGs existence was now reduced to four pens, a pack of business cards and the wireless mouse whose flashing red battery symbol echoed the loss of its user. The only noise was from Finance, callously ignorant of the situation as they loudly discussed their day-to-day.

",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt15: Bring out your dead,4869
jon6,51,2250,1am1be,1950,"Obviously, fake name. Anyways, a while ago, I was working a contract for a rather significant pharmaceutical company. It was your standard run-of-the-mill 1st line maybe 2nd line type role, with a clear difference!

Our manager was great. Attentive, offered good career advice when you needed it, always had your back when the proverbial hit the fan, guided us through some difficult times with lunch on the company card or the odd tin of Quality Street. The guy was excellent - one of the few times I could hand-on-heart say it!

However, good things don't last and as higher ups decided that Support was way too happy, decided to dispose of our erstwhile leader, much to the cue of ""Oh Captain My Captain"" upon his departure. 

Enter Angie... there are few words to describe Angie. We'd heard tell of her actions and personality through her previous subjects during our morning coffees around the campfire. Apparently she would snipe and shout at you for merely existing and applied the logic of a 3 year old suffering major attention deficit disorder at a lecture on string theory. 

Angie had been in charge of drug safety for about a decade. To put it into perspective, if you took this company's product and turned into a blue Octapus that shot fire, the authorities would contact her department for advice. Now, from what I could tell, these guys seemed to be very well versed in everything from chemistry, biology and some were even former doctors. None of this sheer brilliance washed with Angie; she merely treated them like tools that she had no idea how to use and would bang with a hammer when they worked her way - even if her way was clearly stupid.

Still - judge no book by their cover and all that!

Angie arrived in Support a day early mere moments after our former hero had walked the long mile. She immediately proceeded to command facilities to join her at her desk, where she chewed out a 17 year old girl mercifully due to there being dust on her desk and grit in her drawers. This relentless torture went on for a good 20 minutes while Angie inspected every inch of the girl's effort to appease her whims, even re-cleaning several spots more than once. Afterwards, she walked away red faced, eyes to the ground and with a lump in her throat after just about getting the words to indicate she will have her drawer pack replaced with a brand new unit.

We all knew it was to be a new world order with Angie's arrival; we would have thought her showing up a day early was to meet and greet the troops... it was very apparent to me that she was just a vicious troll marking her territory, showing everyone who was boss!

Suffice it to say, we finished up the day typing up CVs and comparing layouts.",The B**** manager from hell Pt 1: A new world order,4200
jon6,96,2239,1am2p3,1941,"Angie arrives in tech support and starts work. A few tech support underlings had moved her machine down the previous evening but, from what I had heard, she had had another chewing out session as she preferred her monitor on the left hand side as opposed to the right. OK, a simple mistake to make and one which is easily rectifiable - not without a lot of noise and assurance of stupidity. I did wonder why I found our resident work experience kid close to tears in the mensroom.

I sat down and began my day. At 10:00, my first interaction with this hellhound was imminent. I was busy tapping out a response email to a remote worker about an Excel problem and she beckoned me over. Well - I say beckoned, she clicked her fingers and with an impertinent commanding tone, she scowled ""You! Come here!""

Thinking I couldn't possibly have had enough time to annoy the woman yet, I assumed this was just another vulgar display of power (sorry, been listening to Pantera this morning). However, she then demanded I showed her how to access her email.

Now, I'm used to running IT inductions and showing new users the jig, but someone who's been here for 10 years? Hmmm.

So, I managed to show her where Outlook was amidst the utter blur of icons on her desktop, adorned with a background of her several pitbull terriers - figures! As Outlook ungraciously churned into gear, she immediately snapped ""Why does it take so long?""

OK, in fairness, this was taking ages! Her disapproving sighs as I attempted to determine the cause was all the signal I needed to know that I really hadn't impressed the boss from hell. Task manager showed Outlook knocking on 97% CPU and the hard disk was going nuts. Until I noticed that network packets had also rammed up.

Musting up the voice to break through the blackened icy air, I politely enquired ""When is the last time you opened Outlook?"" This was met with a sharp stare and ""Don't be stupid. Why would I ask you how to use it if I had been using it already?"" 

After waiting several minutes, the cause eventually became clear. Angie was presented with approximately 5 years worth of completely unread communiques - an unsettling amount of them marked urgent, or with subjects implicating fatal consequences had occured totally without her knowledge.

As I said, Angie had headed drug safety for a decade. In that time, she had never seen a single email, nor did it seem had she ever any cause to question why.

And now she was in our realm - infecting our happy little team with a blackness mired with incompetence and only a tongue sharpened with the stones of hell to act as her only contribution.",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt2: Safety first,4180
jon6,96,2307,1amnc9,1943,"1330 rolls around. Angie is already sat in the stale meeting room waiting for me. Obviously, given the events of the day before, I knew I had essentially caused this impromptu ticket review. To me there remained two choices. 

I could head in there, a subservient professional, plead for my sins and be managed. Yep, be managed by Angie. As she had already minced three of my colleagues into vegetative states, I realised this tactic was doomed. However, my heavy metal spirit prevailed; I took a cue from Dee Snider and instead presented myself as just me. The guy who will still smile and offer professionalism with a light hearted stance even in the face of a total bully.

I walked into the meeting room brandishing a pint glass of red fruitjuice which I happily placed on the desk. I honestly don't think Angie was expecting this one. I jovially sat down and acted like I was eager to go through any concerns she had with my tickets. 

She came straight out with it, ""I want to know why you close the lowest amount of tickets out of everyone in the group? This isn't good enough, you are consistently the lowest score in every single stat I have!""

My case revolved around the fact that we were never ruled by stats. Ever. We maintained a low open-ticket count and concentrated on mentoring junior staff and leading by example. I was hired as a senior simply as a representation of my experience and it was not uncommon for me to accompany junior staff on their calls.

As you can guess, as well as a frosty stare, this was met with a single-worded writeoff: ""Rubbish!"" she sniped. She tyraded for another 10 minutes, scribbling all over her prints in red pen like a crap maths teacher and proceeded to throw me ticket after ticket and reasons why she wasn't happy.

That's OK, I don't stop there. After she finishes her rant, I decide, I can play your game. I turn her stack of redenned paperwork over and begin to go through them in depth, one by one, to answer her concerns.

""This ticket here, "" I started, ""you were unhappy as it took too long to resolve. I admit, three weeks is a little out there. However, this PC is running some bespoke medical software and as it happens will only run on Windows NT. The department is not willing to shell out five figures on a new XP-compatible version so they asked us to source a replacement motherboard instead.""

Now here's how I knew we had a rat. Angie has no idea what NT is - or even a motherboard. However, her tyrade this time seemed more bitter and twisted. I was really stirring the hornets nest here!

I insisted on moving on after ""I can take your comments on board"". I started into the next ticket. ""This ticket resolved around a new vendor requiring set up of several Oracle databases..."" Angie stopped me mid sentence. She reiterated bitterly my low call count; if I didn't shape up, she would have no option but to seek disciplinary steps.

OK so I didn't win. But at least the playing field has been set. I don't back down, though I know I won't win. But at least now I know what her prize is. Why, I don't know. She can't be after everyone's job, surely? That makes no sense. 

**Epilogue** Angie left for the day. I was alone watching a new HP laptop complete a Windows install, ready to fine tune and install, later to sysprep. The balding Head of IT wandered over to ask what all the meetings were about today. I adopted happy-mode and shared my thoughts in as diplomatic a manner I could. I expressed how I was the lowest ticket closer and Angie isn't happy about that. 

Initially, Balding Head (BHIT) tried to plecate me, asking how I could do better. Blimey, I'd forgotten higher ups were meant to ""help"". However, he soon discovered my tickets for what they were; all mine were the complex issues. Internal wifi dropouts, preparing master configs for different models of routers the sales reps had, troubleshooting legacy Windows NT and MSDOS 8.3 systems...

And then I landed everyone in it. Compared to some others, it seems the bulk majority of calls assigned by people to themselves in the mornings were password resets.... I guess that's one way to boost your stats...

Ooops... did I just self-rat my team?",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt5: How to make friends and...,4250
jon6,460,3072,1az9o3,1939,"The IT Cupboard had transformed into a veritable hive of activity. Boxes of laptops littered every available crevice in the IT Cupboard. Some boxes contained freshly built machines, signified by their address labels, destined for their new homes. Others lay brand new, yet to be called to command. Our efforts were meticulously presided over by a flickery Samsung monitor which recorded our every move in a single excel spreadsheet. Names, addresses, serial numbers, asset tags - all required recording.

Despite the obvious pressure QBG and I were under, Roland seemed content with doing the bare minimum. He took his position in the only seat left in the room. Our demands for action seemed to go unnoticed as he idly fiddled with his phone, occasionally breaking his concentration to scroll up and down the excel sheet, his arm outstretched to reach an old mouse and keyboard we had rescued from a junk box for our purpose.

Roland indolently looked up his phone, ""What one are you doing now?"" QBG's response was evidently irate in tone as she read out the serial and asset numbers. Roland duly tapped in QBG's response, barely even taking the effort to capitalize his text. The keyboard, old, yellowed and not even built with the Windows keys, clacked loudly as he typed.

Roland's attempt to permanently affix himself to his throne and rule the roost had grown weary. After this exchange, while unwrapping a fresh laptop, I decided enough was enough. ""Roland!"" I started. ""If you're not going to help, could you kindly go back to support?""

""I'm busy!"" His snide response grated on me. As if to exemplify his uselessness, QBG dragged the keyboard away from towards her as she entered another row of data into the spreadsheet. Her body language exuded bitterness towards Roland's unyielding lethargy in a stereotypical way that only the female of the species can perfect. I knew how she felt, though! 

Roland sat without a single reaction. He seemed to silently shrug off this display of discontent, as if it were of pure meaninglessness. For the next hour, we worked around Roland uncomfortably, as if he were a cold and jagged heavy rock, inconveniently situated in the center of the room. 

We had expected Angie's inevitable visit. Her arrival intensified the high feeling in the cramped environment as we shuffled around box after box of Dell laptops. She discussed our progress with Roland loudly, taking great purpose to exclude mine or QBG's input. Roland dutifully furnished Angie with our present number; we had imaged, repacked and addressed just under 40 laptops.

The fact is, Angie could not bear to leave any situation without imposing her sense of authority; it just wasn't even in her vocabulary. Angie especially liked imposing her authority onto QBG more than almost any other engineer. It was though QBG represented everything that Angie was not to the letter. True to form, Angie directed her attention towards QBG where she was loading a trolley of outbound boxes. 

Angie's voice drowned out the whir of the imaging laptops and the groaning ghost server. ""Are these laptops supposed to be finished?"" Angie's loaded interrogation was not intended to garner any real information. QBG duly provided her response, knowing that Angie had simply just opened her line of questioning to find fault.

""These postage labels are entirely too small. You need to redo them all in a larger print!"" This condescending request lashed QBG like a whip as she winced at the proposition. QBG declined Angie's proposition, instead offering ""We'll do the next ones bigger, these are fine as they are!"" Angie's insistence was delivered over a lambaste which seemed almost infinite as she constantly picked up more and more trivial matters of discontent. Not enough tape; this box is slightly damaged; there are too many boxes on that trolley. 

Angie, satisfied with her instruction, retreated back into the ether of the office. Roland remained motionless on his pedestal, smugly smiling as he reclined back into the chair where he stayed for the next hour.

4pm slothed into view. Roland donned his dark grey duffle coat, each popper irked us more and more as their echos disturbed our frustrated silence. He left for the day without saying a word, leaving QBG and me to continue our work. His departure was suffixed with our in depth symposium of the situation. As we offered one another further anecdote of why Roland and Angie both should be buried in shallow graves, we seemed to further agitate each other.

""Right, you know what..."" I started, ""this isn't happening another day. Let's go see BHIT!""

Our mercenary strut through the hallowed halls towards ITS seemed to gain in speed the closer we got; it was tantamount to a race to reach BHIT. As he sat, blissfully unaware of the onslaught we were about to deliver, his balding reflected the ceiling light with a dull shine.

QBG and I tag-teamed our way through our complaint as BHIT listened. Our frustrated accounts grew louder as we described in depth what the first day of builds had brought. We spilled the beans on Roland, Angie's micro-management and how the duo were jeopardizing our attempted rescue with their banality.

BHIT pondered our predicament as he noisily scratched the side of his unshaven head. He finally leaned forward and said, ""OK, leave it with me. Get back to work!""

germandoerksen,260,586,ypr4s,1930,"So, I'll keep this short as I'm at work... But this really teared me up earlier. I work for a company that manages networks for many different companies and businesses in our area. I was on a service call, working away on one of the servers when one of the custodians approached me. The custodian looked to be about 55 years old or so...

me: ""Can I help you?""

custodian: ""Yeah, um... I have a laptop here that I brought from home. It's been having issues, and won't start at all.""

me: ""Okay, can i look at it?""

I usually don't do stuff on the side, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to help.

custodian: ""Well, I know you're busy. Are you sure you can?""

me: ""'Course, just bring it here I'll see what I can do.""

About ten minutes later he shows up with a pretty new HP laptop. He tells me he just purchased the laptop about a year ago, and the warranty was expired so he didn't know what to do. He then tells me he brought the laptop to a local computer shop and they said the motherboard was fried, so he'd be better off purchasing a new laptop.

I tell him just let me look at it and he says he's going to finish a job, and to let him know when I was done. So, out of interest I boot the laptop up. It shows BIOS screen, beeps, then restarts... over and over. Hmm...

I turn it over and open up his RAM cover. I take out both sticks and put one back in, trying each on individually to test them. Lo and behold, one of the RAM sticks is bad and the computer boots fine with the second one I try. 

I actually had just ordered new RAM for my own laptop, and had the old ones in my car. I run out to the car and grab them, and install them as well. Boots up fine, with two more GB's of RAM mind you.

Custodian comes back and I tell him what I did, and let him know I put in two sticks of RAM and he need not worry about it. The look on his face was stricken... he looked taken aback, and I'm not sure why.

He then tells me he's been using Skype to chat with his son who is in the military and his grandson from across the country, and would never have been able to afford a new laptop to continue the chats. 

He looked like he was going to hug me, and had tears in his eyes when I let him know the computer was fine and I wouldn't be charging him. It's like he never knew kindness from another human. His voice was even a little choked up... I hate seeing grown men cry, cause I can't help but feel choked up as well.

Either way, I sent him on his way and told him to let me know if any issues come up. Makes me happy to be in this job...

tl;dr: Helped older man with laptop that was deemed ""Dead to world"", bout made me cry when he told me what he used it for.","So, I don't have to buy a new computer?",2516
Warlizard,921,830,1ps0ae,1923,"If you're not familiar with it, the Cryptolocker virus encrypts your files and shreds them if you don't pay them $300 or so. 

This accounting firm got it, got the threatening letter, wiped their server because they knew they had a good backup via carbonite.

The tech decided to use a privately managed key instead of letting Carbonite manage it, presumably for extra security.

He can't remember the password.

The number of ways he fucked up is truly astounding.

The owner has been blowing up my phone, desperately hoping there's some way to crack the 1024-bit encryption.

All I can suggest is that she tell the NSA that Edward Snowden sent her these files and ask what should she do with them.

Edit: OMG. Ok, so I got some more information.

1. Right when it happened, the owner asked the tech if it would be a good idea to clone the drive, then pay the money and that way the person who would supposedly log in and decrypt the files (not sure if that's how it works but that's what she said) wouldn't have access to the server. He (the tech) said it wasn't worth it.

2. Right after it happened, they started to restore files from the Carbonite backup, one by one. It was taking so long that the tech said it was inefficient. That's why he wiped the server to get the full backup.

3. He has apparently spent the last 8 hour or so trying every password he could remember with no luck.

4. I'm going to try to throw hashcat at it and see what happens. I have a couple of GTX680s so hey, maybe we'll get lucky. I don't actually know how to do it yet, but I'm researching like a fiend. I don't need to crack the key, I just need to get his password from it. This might be a total dead-end, but Jesus, I feel like I need to do something.

5. This company does my company's payroll. I feel like I should throw that out there, just because it makes the situation so much funnier. Or not.

6. I wish I could tell you the name of the company. I really do. The irony is so thick I could cut it with a banana.

Anyway, I'm off for the night. I can only take so much of this in one day so I'm going to head out and drink myself into a stupor with a good buddy.

Oh, and last, but not least, I posted here that I liked getting snapchats of random things from random people and holy fuckballs, my phone exploded. I got snaps from all over the world, with the strangest, oddest, most bizarre shit, and it's great. One guy had a chicken hat on and sent a snap-video of himself nodding to the Chicken Dance. I even got an epic set of boobs and a few from women too! So with that in mind, if you're bored, add Warlizard and snap me stupid shit. I'm a snapping fiend, nothing of real interest, but I like taking pics and sending them out to the world. 

Laterz.

Shit. I forgot one thing. I said to the owner, ""Well, it sucks, but at least you can go to your email and get the files. I'm sure your Outlook PST wasn't encryped.""

""I don't send anything through email because it's not secure.""

I had to mute the phone.

Ok, last edit from my computer (I may update as I get more lit as the night progresses). 

I'll update as this progresses, but the funny thing is I've only been back doing the store stuff for 1 month. Three times in one month I've seen something that in 20+ years of IT I've never experienced.

So while I have great sympathy for this owner and the firm, OMG, there isn't enough butter for the popcorn.

EDIT: Someone snuck in last night, shit in my mouth and put little socks over all my teeth.

Hungover Edit: I'm REALLY enjoying the snaps. What's really amazing is how good looking the people are who are snapping me. Maybe it's a self-selecting pool, but the stereotype of the nerdy neckbeard is not being supported here. ",TL;DR - Accounting firm gets Cryptolocker Virus. Tech wipes the server to clean it because he has Carbonite backups. He can't remember password to the privately managed encryption key file and can't download the firms backup. Everything lost.,2753
jon6,507,3308,1ax63o,1917,"The following morning, I waited at my desk, primed for a showdown with Angie. Roland sneered and snorted loudly as he worked on some inscrutable task. Angie, fresh Starbucks cup in hand, barely made eye contact as she approached the ITS area. My opportunity to loudly demand satisfaction was at hand. As she placed her cup on the desk, I armed myself with a copy of her project plan. I stood up to metaphorically remove my glove to slap Angie’s face with it. Just as I began talking, I was stopped in my tracks as Angie barked into gear. Her scoff trampled my incursion with a strident whine, “Why hasn’t HR Tank’s machine been replaced?” she demanded. 

I defended with “there’s nothing wrong with her machine at all, it’s barely a year old and is one of the highest spec machines we have deployed! Anyway, I…” Angie dismissed my petition with a stony faced ultimatum. “I want that machine replaced before you go to lunch today! Reopen that ticket and get it done!”

Still brandishing Angie’s project document, she retrieved her cup and stormed towards the lair located somewhere beyond the dimly lit corridor which had seen many an engineer walk to their deaths. I was left immobile, the duel won before I had even drawn my weapon. The emptiness of BHIT’s desk offered no sanctuary in this moment. I left the project plan on my desk, skulking away towards the IT Cupboard to furnish HR Tank with a new OptiPlex. 

After enduring yet another hour-long session of unintelligent questions, garbled, half chewed up and spat back out by the HR Tank, I escaped her deskside with her old machine and yet another list of demands she felt inhibited her capacity to perform as she otherwise would. At the top of the list, she required a colour printer placed near her desk. I guess having to walk half way across the floor to the communal printer may have burned vital calories necessary to plug the real-estate offered by her 80-inch wide trousers. In reality, I was aware through the rumour mill that an apprentice she had appointed in the guise of being mentored in all manner of HR and Legal duties had left some weeks prior citing the need for an actual career. HR Tank had instead used her as a dogsbody to fetch printer output, deliver files to various unsuspecting recipients and, on the way back from such voyages, procure various canteen supplies for her.

This morning’s diversion of Angie’s insistence became all too clear. BHIT had finally gotten word of what had happened last night – most likely the tip off was my email sent to him just prior to my leaving which complained vehemently about Angie’s actions. It seemed he had grown an impromptu pair of balls and demanded Angie’s explanation via email – which of course Angie was all too eager to give! Remember, this power woman had a lifetime’s experience of deviously plotting her rise to the top! Attached to Angie’s response was yet a new project plan, now detailing my newfound responsibilities as technical delivery engineer. What’s more, the handover of machines would no-longer be carried out at the conference; instead all machines would ship next week directly to their recipients. This lunacy has been given the eager thumbs up by all middle management who welcomed the fact that Angie would deliver the project apparently ahead of time.

Opening the PDF, I scaled down to the procurement section only to validate what I fully expected to see anyway. Against the parchment-coloured background of the branded company document, my 50-at-a-time proposal had been replaced by a single line, “252 machines to be ordered from Dell”. The statement, rubber stamped by all and necessary, seemed to vindicate Angie completely. The ball, it seemed, had bounced clandestinely into my back yard. 

BHIT rushed to my desk. I knew what he was going to ask before he’d even asked it. Even though Roland, Angie’s eyes and ears, sat in close proximity, I let my true feelings known to BHIT. “So, you’re telling me there is one week to image 250 odd machines? So, in reality, that’s 50 machines per day?” BHIT nodded, hoping I would concede and provide some magical way out of this new found emergency. “This is stupid! Whoever planned this needs their ass handed to them!” 

My claim had now garnered the attention of the rest of ITS; no longer were their eyes transfixed on their screens, scared to move. They were intently watching the spectacle as it unfolded in front of them. I turned to Roland, demanding “Are the images even ready?” Roland’s familiar ratty vocal snare simply retorted with a shrug, “The images are ready whenever you want them!” 

Angie returned to ITS and immediately interjected my exchange with Roland, as if something deep inside her had fired up and manifested into some sort of primal trait of a mother defending its young. She started, “You told me it would take a week for the laptops to be imaged!” Her obviously incorrect statement seemed a purposeful twist of words on my initial claim. “No! I said that each batch of 50 would take a week to build and QA!” Refuting my claims, Angie’s stern voice still sought to overshadow any offering of reality. 

Delving deep into her PDF, I demanded “Why are we now couriering the laptops out? Why aren’t we delivering at the conference as planned? What about the 50 or so that are staying in the field that only need reimaging?” I felt confident - for once I felt that BHIT had my back, albeit ever so slightly blunted by how easy he had historically caved in. Angie’s abrupt answer seemed to be the line she had used to sell her project amendment with, “I will not disrupt an entire conference just to give out laptops! It is better to present the face of IT by offering a support drop-in service as people need it instead of disrupting an entire event!”

There was no way we could now argue this round now. Angie had landed us in it. She had played her cards, now it was an all-or-nothing game of seeing where the chips would fall. BHIT was powerless to do anything other than hope for a magic-wand solution. Angie was golden in the eyes of the upper management who had rubber stamped her new proposals all the way. There was only one card left to play. I hadn’t expected things to go off to this magnitude – I was inexperienced in this sort of corporate espionage. If I failed to deliver 250 built laptops, Angie could easily pass the buck down, my name made synonymous with total disaster! If I delivered 250 built laptops, Angie would get the glory and I would remain a nameless entity. For me, neutrality or bust! For Angie, glory or neutrality!

“I dunno how we’re going to do this…” I said rising from my chair. Leading the procession, QBG followed closely behind me as Roland wheeled the Ghost server towards the IT Cupboard. BHIT watched us disappear; hoping we would indeed find this desperately needed magic wand!

Craysh,279,553,q15i9,1921,"Sometimes fellow techs that makes you want to smash your keyboard. (all names have been changed to protect the incompetent). 

I used to work in a Service-Desk/Triage capacity (lovingly dubbed Tier 1.9) where we would monitor, ticket, troubleshoot, and escalate as needed (we were expected to have a 90% self-solution return).

One thing that we never were allowed to touch was network issues.  Our area telcom team had lost their extremely competent team lead some 18 months earlier and their team had quickly degraded to people who didn't really seem to care about their job.  They were also secure in the fact that the telcom system had degraded enough to be sufficiently obfuscated enough where it would take considerable resources to figure it out by a competent replacement.  This made them act like they were untouchable.  As such, I had learned fast to start recording my phone calls to them (thank you Google Voice!) so they couldn't pin anything on us.

Anyway, one day around 6PM the network dropped out. As such, I called the Telcom On-Call.  

**Me Leaving Voicemail:** Hi, this is Craysh from Tier 1.9. It looks like the network is having issues again.  Internet, communicator, and email are all unresponsive. All three webfarms are unavailable. Trace route to the gateway has failed. Ticket is unavailable as the ticketing system is inaccessable due to the issue. Please call back to confirm your taking ownership of the incident.

15 minutes go by and SOP dictates that I call back before escalating to their manager.  The on-call answers.

**Tech:** On-Call Phone, this is Steve

**Me:** Hi Steve, have you gotten my voicemail? We're having issues with the network.

**Tech:** No, I haven't.  Tell me what's wrong.

**Me:** Repeats what I said above.

**Tech:** Ok. Wait 20 minutes and try again. *Click*

I had assumed that by 'Wait 20 minutes' he meant that he was taking a look at it and that it should be back up in 20 minutes.  20 minutes go by and the network is still having issues (The network has now been down for the last 40 minutes or so)

I call the On-Call phone again.  No answer.

**Me Leaving Voicemail:** Hi, this is Craysh again. The issue is still ongoing. Please call me back as soon as possible.

15 Minutes go by so it's time to call again. No answer. Time to call the acting supervisor. 

**Supervisor:** This is Aaron

**Me:** Hi Aaron, this is Craysh from Tier 1.9. We are having issues with the network and the On-Call has stopped answering their phone.

**Supervisor:** Stopped? You mean they initially answered?

**Me:** Yes, he said to wait 20 minutes.

**Supervisor:** OK, he's probably working on it.  Call me back in an hour if the issue persists. *click*

At this point I'm calling my supervisor and apprising him of the situation.

For the next hour, I continue to call the On-Call every 15 minutes (as is procedure). No answer.

I call the supervisor again


**Supervisor:** This is Aaron

**Me:** Hi Aaron, this is Craysh from Tier 1.9 again. We are still having issues with the network and the On-Call still has not answered his phone.

**Supervisor:** OK, I'll take a look at it.

Turns out that Telcom had pushed a policy to the Junipers that had scrubbed the white lists (completely blocking all access to all ports). 

All in all it took 5 hours to get everything back up and running.  I documented the ticket extremely thoroughly once the system was available again.

The next day came the fall-out.  Telcom was claiming that I had never paged them, and they said that a customer ended calling the supervisor to find out what was going on.  They even showed zero calls on their cellphone (they had removed the calls and messages).

As such, we had a meeting to 'discuss Tier 1.9's failure to report a severe incident'.

I walked into the room filled with extremely pissed off big wigs, including Aaron and and Steve.  They demanded why I hadn't contacted the on-call, and I stated that I had and that they had lead me to believe that they had been working on the issue. 

Nobody believed me because ""The On-Call phone didn't have any messages or call logs from Tier 1.9""  Their excuse for having a completely empty call log was that they cleared it daily so they could keep track of the calls made on the phone.

I calmly walked to the overhead projector, logged into Google Voice, and played each consecutive voicemail/conversation.

They no longer work here, and I've had three promotions since.

-----------------

**EDIT:** Someone expressed an interest for the actual meeting.  Here goes:

I was working the 2-10 shift at the time and I had stayed an hour and a half late to 'own the incident.  A little after 8am I'm woken up to be informed that there is a meeting I need to be at for 9am concerning the 'Issues that Tier 1.9 had alerting proper individuals in a high visibility incident'.  Running on 3 hours of sleep (I usually went to bed around 5am and got up at 1PM) I figured ""Great! It's about time Telcom got reamed for never answering their On-Call phone!""

When I walked in to the meeting I pretty much knew that the Telcom guys had decided to screw me. They wouldn't look me in the eye (alarm bell one).

We sat there while management had a little pow-wow before hand outside the meeting room (including the acting supervisor for Telcom) and I heard phrases like 'separation procedures' (obvious alarm bell two as I knew that they would not get rid of any Telcom guys as of that point).  My supervisor was not a part of this meeting, he was sitting next to me (alarm bell number three, and he was pretty sure that they were planning on letting him go too).

They came in the room and sat down quietly.  They asked my supervisor if he had been apprised of the situation last night and responded in the affirmative. We went over the procedure that I had followed, and my supervisor acknowledged that I had called him and told him of the situation.

They then asked Telcom their version of events.  They essentially said that I had never called the On-Call phone and that the Supervisor had been contacted by a customer 'friend' of his who asked in passing why the internet wasn't working.  They took out the On-Call Blackberry and showed that there were zero calls and messages last night.  The acting-supervisor 'forgot' his cellphone that day so they couldn't check his (I so wanted to call his cellphone in the middle of the meeting and watch him explain that away. He was one of those people who had their Blackberry attached at the hip). 

The 'Contracting Officer's Technical Representative' or COTR came in to the room and he was fuming. Asking me pointed questions, and kept repeating 'why didn't you page out?' and 'There are procedures in place that you should have followed!'

I couldn't get a word in edge wise, and the Telcom guys had very smug looks.  I pretty much didn't care anymore at this point so instead of trying to explain further I stood up (which pretty much made everyone tense up a bit) and I walked calmly to the overhead projector. Logged in, turned on the [screen](http://i.imgur.com/C4f78.jpg) and started playing the voicemails. 

Nobody really said anything at first, but the Telcom guys definitely had priceless faces. The COTR told me 'Please excuse us Craysh. We have some business to discuss.  Feel free to take the rest of the day off with a $50 per diem.' I think I ended up seeing Prince of Persia.

My supervisor was told not to tell anyone what happened in that meeting after I left.  All he would say was that they were very lucky that charges were not brought up against them since the documents that they filled out with the false information was a government document and what they did was technically fraud against the U.S. government.  The only reason he told me this was because I had to help file an amendment to the incident report. ",Wait 20 Minutes and Try Again or How I Almost Got Fired... (Wall of Text),2474
jon6,208,3053,1ax0bd,1916,"I graciously admitted defeat in the face of managerial apathy. I accepted my diminishing responsibility as I set about my regular duties, visiting desk sides and dealing with the various whims and fancies of the user base. In one way it was a relief to detach myself from any view of the perpetually turning cogs of the rollout. I engrossed myself in some other issues which had come to plague the user base, most notably a problem visiting reps had experienced with their laptops and smartphones failing to maintain a stable WiFi connection in the office. I made my way past some familiar faces as I strolled around intrepidly, laptop in hand, waiting to catch the moment when the Wi-Fi would drop. 

Just as the signal dropped, my investigation was put on hold as one of the Sales managers caught my attention. His artificially whitened teeth seemed to surrender every line of imperfection under the light as he smiled his well-practised salesman smile. As he casually enquired about the rollout, I deflected his attention towards Angie as the new go-to person. I was only in a consultant capacity as needed. His smile took on a slightly apprehensive expression; I knew full well that BHIT had sung my praises right from the start. To hear this dramatic change in events appeared disturbing. Maintaining a professional demeanour, I simply assured him of my belief that the project was in capable hands… the first time I’ve ever flat out lied on the job. He disappeared back into the hustle and bustle of the office, leaving me to my WiFi investigation.

An oddly airy Wednesday afternoon surged into view. ITS felt clean and clear. We could at long last breathe a hearty sigh of relief. Angie and Roland had disappeared off for what seemed like ages. The absence of their black auras had left a dramatically spacey vibe, like we had all just surfaced from some colossal ocean depth, finally able to drink in some of the bountiful fresh air. Its taste was like a cool breeze amidst some arid summer heat wave. It was a relief to actually hear our own voices again! The drone of insipid chatter from the Finance wenches had been the only aural accompaniment of recent days. Their meandering discussions on male pop sensations 20 years their junior, various coffee recipes and deeply particular insights of certain male employees that these aging, portly women found attractive made for a percussive din, the only moments of reprieve as Angie’s led her Menopause group for their twice-daily Starbucks fix. Of course, she would leave Roland on guard-dog duty!

Still, we now had an opportunity to let our guards down. With a secretive half vocal whisper, QBG was eager to catch up on the latest rollout-gossip. Her face contorted in disbelief as I confided Angie’s actions. I was just barely loud enough to be heard outside our conversation, but just loud enough so to ensure BHIT was in earshot. He barely flinched while I concluded my full update to QBG. In one way, I didn’t care who heard me anymore, so long as BHIT did. But it felt good to get listened to, as if my account needed to be heard by someone. “There’s only a month to go… shouldn’t something more be happening by now?”

As the week trundled towards its closure, Angie and Roland made frequent trips to the higher floors for rollout meetings as ITS beavered away in their duties. I waited for consultation requests from Roland, sometimes even publically inviting him to check anything he wanted with me, through as an agreeable manner as I could muster. Roland refused to ask for help, but in reality, I think I was happier without having to endure this pair’s attitude and negative manner. My working life seemed basic and simple again, just the way I like it. Well, of course with the regular admonishments of Angie! Morale was long gone, but there were our own little private worlds to disappear of to.

The biggest casualty was the Ghost server that MAFG and I had acquired, built, loved and later valiantly rescued from its janitorial doom. It stood poignantly next to Roland’s desk – the three-item to a desk rule apparently mute given Roland’s status. It was now clearly being held prisoner, like a hostage whose captivity had broken them down, sympathising with their kidnapper and taking on a new persona to mirror the evil twisted nature of its jailer. The beige box was coated in the alienesque slime and goo that oozed from Roland’s skin, like Spiderman’s evil doppelganger shooting acidic goo from his palms. The Dymo label which had so proudly identified the Ghost Server by its hostname, “ITSGHO01” had been forcibly removed as if to eviscerate some evidence of its history. It left a white rectangle, obvious against its discoloured skin, with scratches and scrapes surrounding it akin to an animal’s claws. 

Two weeks passed by, all news of the rollout went untold. Roland appeared to be busily toiling in another part of the building – we were quite happy to be relieved of Angie’s underling. Monday morning, I was training QBT in the fine art of replacing an old ATX Pentium 133 motherboard in an desktop that she had retrieved from a research department. A donor Packard Bell from the rear of the IT Cupboard had already been looted for some other parts previously, its casing battered and bent. However, luckily, an entire motherboard and CPU remained. It was this we were transplanting to the distressed research machine, its rare and irreplaceable exclusivity commanding the utmost care and attention. The anti-static wrist bands seemed to complicate the procedure as its plastic-coated coil snagged on various parts of the metal chassis. We were happily bonding in our moment of isolation, catching up on each other’s hearsay; it had been the first time I had been able to relax with someone at work for a while, QBG it seemed could make a suitable replacement for MAFG!

Our mother’s meeting was almost at a close when our a stony faced Facilities monkey, clad in dirty green jumper which seemed to evidence hard toil, appeared in the doorway with an aged disapproving look. “Jon6?” he mumbled. “There’s a truck turned up with loads of laptops. Where are we meant to put ‘em?” His Manchester accent echoed from the hallway through the opened IT Cupboard door, his frame slightly obscuring the overhead lighting. His accent clearly demonstrated the fact that he was far from home, like a lone warrior holding his own in some foreign land. “Right here I guess, there’s some space at the back!” I said, motioning to an isle MAFG had previously emptied towards the end of his tenure. His told-you-so smile accompanied the shake of his head, “What, all of em? You know there’s about 250 of the things?”

Convoyed to the scene of the crime, the Facilities monkey purposely shuffled me towards the articulated lorry that had arrived in the yard, standing like a bruised battle tank just returned from war. Its rear doors were flung open to reveal box after box after box, adorned with the familiar Dell logos, as a team of Facilities workers scrambled to unload them. “You better figure out where we’re going to put these double quick” he commanded, thrusting a manifest into my hands. I could see my name planted firmly at the top of the document’s recipient list. I knew right then that my evening had just been squandered by whoever’s administrative oversight had caused this turn of events. Of course, I knew full well it had to be only one person’s doing!

The lobby of the building was decorated with an oversized clock face which hung above the main security desk. Its appearance had a stealthy corporate double-meaning. On the one hand, visitors would be impressed with such a bold artistic statement. On the other, it reinforced to any tardy employee that they had been caught red-handed, their arrival time electronically indelibly stamped on their permanent record as they would swipe their access cards. To add to this crafty corporate purpose, this oversized clock always seemed to be a few indistinct minutes faster than almost any other clock that existed.  

Tonight, it took on a new role. It sarcastically emphasised my rapidly vanishing evening as I walked pump-truck after pump-truck of Dell branded boxes to their temporary homes. Neither Angie or BHIT were anywhere in sight to mediate the situation. Repeated appeals to helpdesk to locate their whereabouts went unanswered. In the end, some sympathetic Facilities manager had yielded to my plight and offered three temporary rooms to hold the laptops. These were now crammed floor to ceiling with Dell boxes. My clothes smelled old from my efforts; prickled with box-dust and the stale smelling air of the rooms I had been afforded which had sat unused for some time. I packed away the last box, finally leaving the building at 9pm.

My disentanglement from the project, as prescribed by Angie, seemed to have been suddenly and majorly rehabilitated in this single dramatic move. I had clearly stated in my project plan that these deliveries should be conducted in batches of 50 at a time; we didn’t have the space to deal with 250 machines – as this very evening would attest. This detail, I’m sure, had made it into Angie’s rewrite of my project plan in verbatim. I know I had even seen it. What’s more, with only two weeks to go, building 250 machines in that time was no mean feat! What had Roland even been doing this whole time? This blunder, which felt a little too obvious, seemed to signify stage two of Angie’s sabotage.

jon6,674,3111,1b03d2,1903,"QBG and I worked long and worked hard. Machines were building while machines were unwrapped while machines were repacked - this time with larger address labels as per Angie’s demands. The previously arid air infected by Roland seemed more pleasant now that Angie had declared he had ""far more pressing duties to attend to"". That didn't stop Angie's persistence in micromanagement. Each visit brought a new list of vices which had to be adhered to; her elephant-like memory seemed to retain every minor piece of misdirection she spluttered, her leathery face and tongue breathing fire at the slightest transgression. 

QBG and I pulled overtime on Wednesday/Thursday. Our thanks came with a company-sanctioned pizza on one night, followed by an impromptu trip to the local Chinese takeout the next. We both worked diligently for our cause until sometime on Friday afternoon when the last batch of laptops sat imaging. The IT cupboard looked like a bomb site. Discarded baggies, hastily recorded CD-Rs with various drivers on them, several cardboard cups which once contained cheap, cost effective canteen coffee and shreds of ill-cut tape and inners littered the floor. I sat on the trolley, gently rocked myself back and forth, thoroughly shattered as QBG lounged on the chair. Our hands were grubby from the manual lifting, but we were finally done. 

We still had no idea if our plea for clemency from BHIT was the real reason for Roland’s absence, but were glad of the break. The last laptop completed its imaging process as I struggled to my feet. After loading the correct user profiles, we loaded the last box onto the trolley. We turned the lights out on the IT cupboard as we rolled out the door which clanged loudly, echoing through the lifeless corridor as the electronic lock whizzed, sealing the cupboard with a tomb-like finality.

As I pushed the trolley towards the mail room, again filled top to bottom with our efforts, the conversation turned to the conference next week. Angie's plan of having a support presence seemed unnaturally forward-thinking, yet seemed to be yet another construct of some great demonstration of incompetence. We had no real idea of what we were expected to do there and we still had another 50 machines to image as reps waited. QBG and I had also realized that our unanticipated team-building time had come to an end; a valuable insight we would have never gotten had Angie not interfered in the way that she did. But mired with her constant micromanagement, we were glad it was all over - for now.

Another Monday morning! The rain and sleet smacked my windscreen as I could only think of the same old mantra, “I hate Mondays!” ITS had arrived early at the conference centre to set up. Our Support booth spanned four tables which had been strewn with all manner of Support-related paraphernalia. It looked like someone had raided some long-forgotten box of promotional material which now served to entice passers by. A sizable gazebo stood behind the dubiously supported makeshift tables housing the secondary support area.

When I arrived, I found Angie mid-lecture as some helpdesk underling, borrowed for the purposes of the day, had met her disapproval in some way. Her shrill, demanding voice was evident even over the noise of the waiters and waitresses igniting several water heaters in anticipation for the impending delegates. Angie’s constant barking continued up until our official open time of 10:00am at which time she scarpered to make-nice with some apparent acquaintances. It always amazed me to see her personality and body language shift so seamlessly when interacting with anyone who wasn’t, well, us!

Almost as soon as the hall opened, our first delegate arrived at the Helpdesk brandishing a very familiar laptop bag. The delegate bore all the hallmarks of a vintage salesman; his suit was worn, distended around his stomach which showed obvious patronage to many miles behind his rep-mobile on motorways. Placing the bag on the table, he stressed with a clear but jovial tenor voice that he had received it the previous week but was having problems with it.

I ushered him into the back of our support area. Our IT setup seemed to impress him. The Ghost Server hummed proudly atop a stack of plastic boxes while stations demarked with chairs and table space offered spare network cables and power supplies already connected and waiting for their prospective tenants. “It’s like mission control in here!” the delegate quipped. With a confirmatory laugh, he added, “We have lift off!”

The delegate presented his laptop. As I hooked it up, he withdrew a shabby blue-covered notebook, filled with scribbling, bits of paper and bound by a rubber band from the depths of his suit. Peering through the frames of his rounded spectacles, he declared that he had a number of problems. He reeled off each entry on his list, as though sermonising from his blue notebook. The software, though it could open, was unable to load profiles or remember preferences which, though meant nothing to me, meant the world to a marketing guru such as this man. It also seemed to failed to synchronise in any way with the central database. While scanning through the laptop, I had also noticed McAfee was failing to update and the image distinctly lacked any installation of MS Office.

The realization that Roland had indeed fudged the image was all too real. This was polarized by the sight near the helpdesk tables at 10:15. The queue seemed to extend to the far corner of the hall, all said the same thing. The rickety tables seemed the final barricade on the front lines as reps, brandishing the same laptop bags, came to voice their ails.

Tensions ran high as the word spread among the queuing reps. IT had blown it; they’d screwed the pooch and messed up big-time! Dissent spread quickly into the queue. Our borrowed Helpdesk guy was buckling. He was ill-equipped to deal with demand of this magnitude without the simple escape route of simply logging a call for escalation. I relieved him with the instruction to find Angie. In the meantime, all we could think to do was accept laptops back en-masse and deal with the fallout later.

The rear support area filled as some 200 machines lay piled as portrait of the enormous blunder. Angie’s eventual reappearance was complemented with another bout of her ranting and raving; despite her inability to offer another solution, she stormed off in anger leaving us to somehow organise transportation of 200 laptops back to head office. Two sales and marketing managers also appeared, demanding explanations and reasons for this mother of all fuck-ups. 

Our borrowed helpdesk guy and I loaded the laptops into a hire van for their voyage back to the office. Our drive back to the office through the rain seemed dark and depressing. The rain reverberated off the large metal hulk of the van only dampened by the cloth of the soft laptop bags. The only thing to look forward to now was another drenching skirmish through the office yard to return the laptops to their holding cells.

",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt21: The Rollout from Hell,5014
jon6,57,2213,1ambp1,1847,"It's Monday morning. I am in early to set up a bunch of noobies with their fancy corporate gear. I'm usually very prepared and have kit ready to go by Thursday evening/Friday morning at latest. However, thanks to BMFH, our long-standing policy known to all department heads of IT requiring 2 weeks notice of any new starter so we can obtaining and set up new gear is summarily binned. Of course, I find this out Friday evening and need to scrounge up four new laptops and get Vodafone to live up some SIM cards double quick for delivery Monday morning.

I'm literally imaging the final machine when my induction group enters the room. I've had no time for tea or coffee, yet I'm expecting salvation from a sympathetic co-worker at any minute. 

Still, best foot forward, I meet my delegates with my usual optimistic smile and my ""welcome aboard"" handshake. Only, the air is about to darken. The familiar stench of putrid an old woman with too much perfume enters the room. She walks straight to the back of the training room and takes her seat next to a young woman. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the young woman attempt small talk to no avail.

I get started and I'm giving a brief introduction to the Company IT. I can't help be but distracted by the icy stare of BMFH piercing me like a lazer. As I duly hand out prescribed equipment to my delegates, she watches my every move as I dart around the room ensuring everyone gets a new toy. Laptops in bags, phones and chargers in the pocket, it's a little like Christmas morning.

In my haste to get my late-attendees set up, it seems I've inadvertantly packed the wrong chargers in by mistake. After bringing it to my attention, before I could get a word out, BMFH hops to her feet to investigate the situation. Holding the end of the offending charger and staring at me, she silences the room with an authorative ""Well?"" Before even being able to offer either explination or promises to make amends, she takes phone and charger from noobie and walks for the door, with ""Come with me!""

After a solid dressing down, I walk BMFH down to the stock room where she watches me hunt around in a spares box for any combination of phone and charger that would fit. After rejecting my first three finds as unsuitable due to being slightly scuffed, she demands I instead use my company blackberry as suitable replacement. Rather than enduring her wrath any further, I oblige, kitted with charger and wave goodbye to my lovingly customised toy of awesome.

We re-enter the room; like a freshly scolded schoolby, I duly hand over the blackberry to noobie who feels mixed between ""Oooh awesome, this is better than that rubbish Nokia you tried to give me"" and instant pity as she totally knew what just happened.

Endeavouring to continue the induction, my noobie starters felt compelled to keep any and all kit-related questions to bare minumum. Not the most ideal situation I'm sure you'll wager. By the way, where is that coffee?

We make it to 12, BMFH's face looking like she's gnawing her teeth more and more throughout the session. Salvation; the facilities lady arrives with delegates' lunch and coffee. Blimey, I need a coffee.

Yeah... BMFH has other ideas. We break for lunch. I'm making pleasant small talk with some of the noobies - a standard tactic in making them feel ""comfortable"" with support. The queue for the coffee jug disipates and I walk with one of the noobies to go get myself some salvation in a cup. Just as I pick the cup up, BMFH appears by my side. She again orders me outside.

She starts with stating how lunch is for the delegates only; though no it's not! It's been SOP for god knows how long to have a working lunch with the new delegates to chinwag, talk shop, correct any misunderstandings, whatever. However, new policy as of right now, I need to return to my desk where BMFH will watch me complete some meandering tasks she has for me. My co-workers are initially confused by my presence when I should be in induction, but on seeing the red-faced snaggletoothed hellhound, quickly understand.

She insists we look at the queues... well, I'll look at the queues, she'll randomly point to various call tickets and demand why they haven't already been dealt with. This carries on for the next 30 minutes after which I mention I need to get back to the induction. 

For one glorious moment, I thought I may have been off the hook, as BMFH began wagging her finger at another lowly employee who had dropped a mouse on the floor. 

Back upstairs, half the delegates have gone missing. It seems that our departure to some had signified the conclusion of the induction. A frantic run-around the various departments and 20 minutes later, we were a full team again.

Still no coffee.

Maintaining my professional demeanour against all odds, I politely carry on with CRM and best practices. The CRM training goes down like a slow slaughter. Every step requires clarification courtesy of BMFH, like she's picking out every little thing and re-explaining it to the group. A one hour segment turns into a two hour bloodbath and everyone has just run out of happy. Best practises I cover in 20 seconds with ""There's a laminated card in your laptop bag about best practices, password lengths, etc. Read it good luck"".

After the delegates have left, BMFH decides to reel off at me what a terrible job I've just done and how ""if this is how inductions are performed, it's no wonder IT Support are a joke!"". OK I've had enough. Three days of this b****, Monday morning, no coffee, she's on her fourth cup, I react! I just said ""Firstly, it would have gone a lot easier if you hadn't had landed me with four delegates I wasn't expecting needing me to run around and scour kit up from somewhere. Secondly, this is not indicative of how inductions are usually run at all! And I resent your opinion that the support department is a joke"".

Oh... no... you... dit'int....

She exits with a calm and collected look... yea OK... I know it... I'm fkd now. 

And where is my damned coffee!?!?

**The Coffee** I ran into Mr. SureI'llBringYouACoffee no good lying git co-worker who I thought had my back. I just said, ""Dude... you said you were going to... ""

My sentence was cut short when he gave me a complete insight into the morning's proceedings. After helping me haul ass scrambling some extra kit together, he had taken my cup from my drawer, filled it with some lovely hot brown coffee and was on his way upstairs. 

BUT... unbeknownst to him, he was being hunted! As he turned for the stairs, the BMFH had towered in front like a black-clad SS officer standing in front of a little girl in a pink dress. Demanding to know where this coffee was headed, this was where she had learned of the IT Induction. In between dressing down my colleague for God-knows what and observed him as he duly tipped away my lovely coffee and placed my mug directly into the dishwasher, she had decided that she had to be a part of this induction.

As I left for work that evening, I knew I had incurred the wrath. I knew something was coming. What, I don't know... more of the same? My job? Us IT'ers are very dispensible. My thoughts only revolved around one thing... I need to get my CV in shape!",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt3: The IT Induction from hell,4060
jon6,50,2300,1amlsr,1834,"I arrived for work the next day, this time fulfilling my morning's requirement for coffee before leaving the house. I was on the late shift, so I could afford the luxury of adding breakfast. For some reason I was unpreterbed by the events yesterday offered. 

I arrived to find a deathly quiet IT department. Sadly, I had begun to expect this when Angie had imparted her usual words of wisdom on some poor unsuspecting fool. I duly logged into my PC, fired up TouchPaper and began the arduous task of setting up some appointments for the day. 

I was surprised to hear a new type of noise from Angie's direction. Rather than the snarling voice of Satan demolishing yet another soul or the heavy bleak silence that accompanied her stare, there was banter and the sound of humans talking. I looked over to see Angie discussing in depth the virtues of a nearby starbucks with some Finance Hag. On the one hand we were all pretty shocked that Angie seemed to be demonstrating a more human side to her character. Though given her affiliation with Finance hag...

See, IT Support and Finance were situated directly next to each other. Some time ago, we had all been segregated into offices beautifully adorned with departmental monikers which happily contained our respective messes and existances. At some point, some middle manager in a fit of synergetic genius decided to implement an entirely open-office strategy and had all walls removed. As far as I can see, it served to merely underpin the adage of ""good fences make good neighbours"" and that destroying the efficiency of Aircon in the height of summer only adds to tensions.

Finance had repeatedly become irritated with ITS occasionally ""walking through their area"" as they would usually have varying currencies hanging around for traveling business reps - it seemed walking even near their area was suddenly deemed a security risk - and were constantly angered by the fact we had a lot of foot traffic and a lot of equipment which invariably made its way to us. Really - IT Support does not suit open office, especially next to Finance hags.

Suffice it to say, there had previously been a blowout and IT Support were mandated by up on high to keep a three desk distance from any Finance team members (a problem as they were forever encroaching on our space, with temps, filing systems and new layouts meaning we had to constantly move and shrink). Simiarly, they had enforced a three-piece rule, whereby you could only have three pieces of equipment on your desk at any time. As the average monitor and system unit accounted for two of these, you can imagine what a struggle this was should anyone show up with a non functioning laptop and accompanying projector/home router/printer. 

Our constant commandering of any post-room space and the need to create a PC-den in the stock cupboard was a testament to what a poor relation IT Support really was in the company. Though our jobs were now more difficult, in that we had to maintain a presence outside whilst actually getting to work in a cupboard was a constant struggle, we all remained cooperative and chipper in our existances. 

Nevertheless, Angie was evidently on first name terms with Finance wench. With pleasantries exchanged, off they set to the local coffee emporium to embark on their self-made challenge of attempting every single combination of coffee type they could think of - not forgetting the ominous stare at support personnel as she passed.

Finally. The coast was clear - we could take a breath. Being the last one in, my colleagues were quick to ask ""Jon6... have you read your email yet!?""... Well, no actually... and there it was. Retribution, the storm of the BMFH's reign was upon us! 

Angie had decided that during the course of the day, she would be performing ticket reviews on an individual basis. 

Middle-Aged Family Guy (MAFG) was on the early shift. He had obviously already been the meat grinder, Angie's special treatment. Of course, we were now fixated on his response to find out what went down. It soon became clear when he relented and maximised his IE window to reveal several Jobserve results. Wow, it went that well then?

MAFG wasn't a slacker, not by a long shot. In fairness, there were slackers, but he wasn't one. And it looked like the wind had been knocked well and truly out of his sales. 

He began to tell us how Angie had spun her web. She had a printed list of his open tickets and several examples of his closed tickets. She had initially allowed him to dig his grave so it seems with a few innocent cases, until launching into an all-out pincer move to demonstrate terrible goings on within his daily work. This invariably was forcing him to reopen old tickets she was dissatisfied with, despite no suggestion from the customer of that being the case.

That's when it hit me. As he talked about the meeting, the fact that things were printed (Angie has no idea where the printers even are), the fact that she was able to search the ticketing system for tickets at all... it's obvious.

There is a mole... that's all there is to it... someone here is working against us all. Someone had to have provided Angie with a method of retrieving closed tickets. Someone has to have shown her how to use the printer. The cloud of suspicion was very much there. I knew it... and I could sense, maybe some others knew as well. Is there a traitor in our midst? 

After our team post-mortem of Angie's impact to date, we were left deflated and totally unmotivated. We returned to stare into the bleakness of the computer monitor, hoping that salvation lay within. I duly opened my Outlook calendar. Sure enough... Jon6, tickets review at 13:30..... right at the start of my designated rota'd lunch break...

OK Angie... you foul smelling b****... it's on... 

",The B**** Manager from Hell Pt4: Undercurrents,4134
jon6,472,2281,1b2mf7,1835,"**So, did this really happen?**
Yes. This is an as-accurate as I remember account of a bitch manager from hell that I endured over a 15 month period. The story indicates a much shorter timeline, but I only have time for so much writing! In reality, Angie micromanaged to death several ITS initiatives, cost a few people their jobs and was an overbearing terrible person. All of this led to her ultimate, er, promotion…

**How many parts are there going to be?**
To be honest, I had no idea when I started writing how many parts there would be. I just started, initially thinking 3-4 parts at most. As I found people started enjoying it, I just wrote more. In truth, Angie was such a nightmare that if I took to time to recount every single thing she did, there would have been near on 500 parts! At some point, given I have other commitments to adhere to, this needed to end sadly. I decided to steer my writing towards the ultimate conclusion of Angie’s reign. 

**Are you a writer?**
Nope. Not professionally. I’ve never felt compelled to sit down and write anything this novelistic before. I’ve been writing lyrics for years and used to trying to fit syllables to beats, restrained to only a few available lines to get the point across. I play metal though – so like anyone cares about the lyrics, so long as there’s a few cleverly picked crowd pleasing lines. RE-SPECT - WALK!

**I suspect he is in reality, British.**
Yep… sorry about that :)

**Why didn’t you just quit?**
It had been my third IT Support role. In reality, there’s no such thing as a nice IT Support role. They’re all disturbingly hostile places to be and I would urge anyone to get out as soon as possible; it's a slow suicide by telephone. My take on IT Support is that it is the one area that’s simple to get into, but difficult to dig out of. Managers like Angie are just all too common in this field. If I had just quit, as I managed to prove to myself when I did change jobs, moving from one dead-end support role to another resolves nothing. It’s just the same thing, different place!

**...go to her boss? Explain how she's impacting negatively on productivity, and on your team's mental health**
There is such a thing as crapping in your own back yard. No upper manager wants to be bothered by some troublemaking runt from some low-end support role going on about how much he hates his boss! It’s a fast track out the door, I can assure you.

**The BBC should just go ahead and turn these into a show.**
Hahaha, I am open to offers!

**I would have flipped my desk and said ""f*ck it, I'm done"" I am amazed with your amount of patience throughout this matter.**
I was brought up to be very patient. But, the fact I had a mortgage to pay, a car to keep running various other responsibilities, I couldn’t be that flippant about it. 

** I don't understand why the entire department doesn't walk out. That would get the attention of Angie's superiors.**
This is a rather Hollywood ending, but the reality is, everyone has bills to pay. I’d wager such a bold move would fall foul of its forerunner when this reality would dawn on everyone. In truth, we were all jobhunting, though!


** 3 seconds!**
Do I owe you a new spring for your F5 key?

**I love you, Jon6!**
Awww, shucks!

**If this series ends up with a tree-fiddy joke i'll be both angry and impressed**
You don’t know how tempting this was to put up - even for just five minutes! Though I hope it didn’t end that way for you!

**So, just to be clear, this all took place in the mid-late 1990's and jon6 was 20-22 at the time, correct?**
It’s safe to say I was about 22-23, and this was around 2000. I don’t want to say much more than this though, anonymity and all!


**How does it feel to have so many people hanging on your every word jon6?**
Odd! But I'm pleased I provided such entertainment - and I hope I didn't get anyone in trouble with their bosses!

**I feel like Chelle at the beginning of Portal 2. All that hard work, and the feeling of victory at escaping the inhuman clutches of GladOs, only to find yourself back in the pits of hell once more. The evil thing is still alive and kicking, and you'll have to deal with her all over again.**
Luckily I never crossed paths with her at all after that. But it’s the one big lesson of the corporate world. Credit travels up, blame travels down. The higher you are the harder it is to fall.

**Guys... guys. We got to the end. We did it.**
We sure did… my large diversion from doing coursework has also suffered… I’m envisaging a very hard Easter weekend ahead to catch up. But I’ve enjoyed writing for you guys!


**Misogyny loses my sympathy**
I would hate to be thought of as someone who hates women. For one, they’re lots of fun ;) OK I admit, I had to google ""misogyny"". The correct British vernacular is ""male cheuvanist pig""

Joking aside, I feel an explanation may be required to this line of questioning. My account describes the situation endured by all at that time; I tried to paint a picture of the characters involved as best I could. Where you can define your own definition, I would welcome you to do so. In some cases, my brief description of “quiet blonde girl” should be enough for you to paint your own picture. 

However, Angie and her gang were such an uncommon, abnormal collection, I felt that to not describe their mannerisms and neurosis would have done them an injustice. Similarly, Roland’s rat-like appearance just seemed to burn anyone who set eyes on him. BHIT, I think, was also subject to rather unrelenting description. I’ve had some excellent female colleagues, managers and so forth so I would hate for it to be assumed I have a problem with women in power. Apologies if you thought otherwise!

laserpewpewAK,250,615,11i3wf,1821,"So today was my first day at my new job: part time as an in-store tech for a big-box tech support company (take a guess). It happened to be an extremely busy day, so they immediately put me to work on data transfers. Simple stuff- pull the old hard drive and transfer user files to the new one.

One of the full-timers stayed with me and had me walk him through the process for the first computer (I have no previous job experience in this field, so they were understandably cautious). 100 gigabytes, pulled off an old but still functional drive. Easy as it gets. 

After windows reported it's success, I open up the user file on the new computer to double check. Contacts: empty. Desktop: empty. Downloads: empty. Documents, music, pictures- all empty. Finally, I reach ""my videos"". Sure enough, just short of 100 gigs in that file. All of it porn. 

I turned to the tech supervising me. ""...Someone actually paid $100 for a data transfer... Just to save their porn?""

He smiled sadly at me, and replied: ""welcome to tech support, kid.""

wonderweirdo,230,573,159g16,1817,"So here's one I thought you all might get a kick out of.  A new guy started in my office a week ago.  He sits in the cube next to mine, he's a vet and has served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I think he's a nice guy, kind of laid back for someone who just got out of a war zone.  He seems to know his stuff, fitting in nicely.  

Well Today I'm sitting in my cube, it's after 5:00 PM which is considered after hours for most of our clients.  This is important because in some cases if we have to escalate an issue it wont be attended to until the next business day, especially for one of our clients that has a no exception policy for some crazy reason.  With the Holiday Weekend, that means something coming in tonight wont be addressed until at least Wednesday.

So I'm sitting there wrapping up a ticket and I hear him catch a call.  He reads the script for our crazy client (No exceptions) and starts troubleshooting with the caller.  

I hear him go through the steps and he decides he has to escalate the ticket.  He tells the caller that given the holiday weekend, he may not hear back for at least four days.  Just then I can hear the client screaming at him on his head set.  

I stand up and I look at him, he's sitting there cool as a cucumber fiddling with a Rubiks cube while this caller screams at him.  He casually tells the caller this, ""Please, I've been in Iraq and Afganistan.  I've had people trying to kill me every day for the past six years.  Raising your voice to me like that will not get your issue attended to any faster.  I can put in an email to the head of the level 2 department, but if he decides you have to wait until Wednesday, there's nothing more I can do.""

The caller seemed to calm down and my co-worker just smiled, ""That's alright, I'll send that email now.  Have a nice day.""

I learned something very important today, you don't know how bad you've got it unless you've had your life on the line, makes the stuff I've had to put up with seem so trivial now.  That and it's possible to be a hardcore bad ass and still be polite and maintain your dignity. ","""I've been to Iraq, you don't scare me""",2390
captmac,342,507,1c19hx,1811,"While this is not official tech-support, I figured you guys would like to hear a truly happy tale. It involves technology, babies, and cookies, so it has to be worth it. 

At my firehouse, we check and install child safety seats. Enter new parents we'll call Dirk and Amy and their adorable two day old daughter Emma. Now Dirk is not letting one iota of this child's first week go undocumented. I can only imagine what's on the camera. 

Dirk had done an excellent job of installing Emma's child seat. In fact, it only needed a little bit of tightening. While I went over the paperwork, Dirk asked if he could use the restroom. I showed him to the restroom, and returned to the vehicle for mom and baby were playing happily. Mom took it upon herself to get the camera to take some more pictures of baby Emma. 

Dirk returned from the restroom to see mom taking more pictures of baby Emms sleeping. 

""Honey, the camera wouldn't take any more pictures, but I used that format thing to make more room,"" said Mom. 

All color left Dirks face. I honestly thought we were going to have to load him in the ambulance. He broke out into a cold sweat and did everything he could to contain his panic. That card had in fact contained all of the photos from birth until now for baby Emma. I thought the man was going to cry. In fact, upon seeing his reaction, mom realized what she had done. 

Before this lovely couple started yelling at each other, I told her ""turn off the camera right now."" I explained to him that the pictures could likely be retrieved even though the card had been formatted. His response was one of incredulity. He did not believe that was possible. 

I retrieved my laptop, inserted their SD card, and proceeded to recover all but a couple of the photos from the birth of baby Emma until their visit to the fire station using some SD recovery software I'd used before. 

In the end, marital harmony was retained, baby Emma's first days will survive in pictures, and my whole crew was treated to a couple of boxes of thin mints and a half gallon of vanilla ice cream. 

TL;dr mmmmm..... Thin mints cookies and vanilla ice cream.

Zaphod_B,404,721,zd5g1,1803,"Several years ago I was running a 1 to 1 at a K12 school in the US.  1 to 1 deployments mean every high school kid gets a laptop.  I was managing 6,000 Macbooks and 40 servers, as well as 2,000 or so Mac desktops at the time.   One day my boss calls me and the conversation goes like this:

Boss:  Hey Zaphod, we have a serious issue and you need to address it right now


me:  OK, boss what is this serious issue?


Boss:  Your co-worker Derp-da-Derp-a-lot printed out the master password list for the local admin accounts and 


left it on his desk, and a student stole it.


me:  Grrrrreeaaat.  So, basically I need to reset 6 local admin passwords like right now?


Boss: Yes, drop whatever you're doing and do it NOW!


me:  No problem boss I will have it fixed with in the hour.


I hang up the phone, whip up a script in bash to reset the local admin password, but I make one fatal mistake in my haste.  I forget to output everything to /dev/null, so everything goes to standard output, ie the system.log.  My mistake, under pressure, plus I thought no way a high school kid knows Unix.   I find this out, fix the script, redirect all output to /dev/null and the password in the script stops getting logged.  So, the password is on clear text but only on several hundred machines.  OK, no problem I am going to send a command out to wipe the system.log file and clean up my mess.  Since to change the password I had to set a password in a script.  This was back in like 2008, and let's say now my scripting behavior is a bit different now.  :-)


During this small window some kid had been sifting through the console looking at every single log file.  Somehow, picked out a string he thought looked like a password, and bam he had local admin access to the machines.   So, I start doing detective work and use a dummy receipt system.  Basically look for a file or string that exists and if it does, touch another file to ""stamp it"" with a dummy receipt, and then build a database of machines based on that file to see what accounts have been promoted to admin accounts.   Sure enough this one student's user account was synchronized to a lot of Macs and sure enough his account was always being promoted to admin.


I gathered my evidence, called the student into my office.  Socially awkward kid, but actually quite brilliant.  I asked him why he was violating the AUP (acceptable usage policy) and that I had proof he was giving himself admin rights.  He broke immediately.  I didn't even have to threaten the kid.  He spilled his beans, I asked him if he pulled the password form the log, he said yes.  I asked him if he had ever used Unix before, he said no it was just figuring it out on the fly.  I told him I wasn't going to turn him in, and that I will just forget the incident ever happened.  He asked me why and I said you're too smart to get expelled or suspended.  However, you need to take your brain and use it constructively.  What do you want to learn the most on the computer?  He said he wanted to start a programming club and develop games in Python.  Next week I rolled down to the storage facility and grabbed a Compaq dual XEON server, with a RAID 5 controller and 3 hard disks in it and like 4 or 8gigs of RAM.  It was one of those spend your budget money or lose it deal (government, am I right?) and they had been sitting there since I started working there so about 2 years had passed, and those servers had been collecting dust.   They had no OS on it.

I come into his building with the server on a flat bed.  I said here is your development server.  Here are the rules.  You cannot plug this into our network, my network manager will shut this box down immediately, do you understand?   Yes, he replied.  Second rule, this server has no OS on it, so you must choose what OS you want to put on it, and you have to support it yourself.  You cannot call help desk for help, and it has to be legit, either open source or someone buy's an actual license.  I understand, he said.


2 years later the kid graduates and gets a full ride to Boston College.  he also wrote the advanced math curriculum his senior year.  He did a bunch of stuff in Python and LaTeX.  


Oh I also turned him into my mole.  Every time some kid talked about hacking he would email me and tell me what they were trying to do.   I haven't talked to him since, but I bet by now he is graduated.  Pretty smart kid, hope he succeeds.  Him getting expelled or suspended or even in trouble may have damaged his record, which may have damaged his chances at a full scholarship.  Mind you, I was working for an impoverished school district, a lot of families in that district were below poverty level.  


EDIT - fixed formatting


Sometimes it is good not being the iron fist ruling, over authoritative dick head system administrator, but sometimes you gotta do that to get your point across.  I was lucky enough to realize the situation and actually put this kid's smarts to productive use.  I hope he has a bad ass job right now.


EDIT #2


Several of you have expressed interest in the fact it was an impoverished school district and they all got laptops.  Let me explain to you how budgeting works in public education.  The state you live in sets a budget, and according to your size, and your location, you get X amount of dollars every year.  Now, additionally you can get federal money as well on top of state money.  The budget is then broken down into categories.  You have budget for staff, which covers their wages, benefits, and so forth.  Capital Outlay is the part of the budget you spend on technology, desks, renovations, and so forth.  It cannot be used for salary, the government does not allow you to do so.  Furthermore, the government has a thing called eRate, which I believe is regulated by the FCC.   It forces companies who join such a program to lower their prices for schools, and allows schools access to technologies through this program.   


The school I worked for, which I no longer do work there, decided they wanted to go 1 to 1.  With Macbooks being about $900 a pop it wasn't too much out of the question.  You only have a little bit of savings with a desktop, since you must also pay for keyboards, mice, and monitors, and they require more power.  A laptop is 1 plug.   The school was about 60 buildings and 30,000 students.  The laptop program was at the high school level only, which was 6,000.


You have to realize a lot of these kids never even ate their first meal for that day until they came to school.  I grew up lower middle class and I thought I had missed out on certain things in life, and that I was a bit under privileged compared to all the other kids I went to school with.  I didn't realize how selfish and self centered I was until I got this job.  I worked there for 5 years running their laptop program.  I got a bike for Christmas, and while my family was unable to ever take me on international vacations, or cruises, we at least got to go to the lake for vacation.  These kids have nothing.  It taught me how privileged I was.  Giving them a laptop is awesome.  Sure, some kids will squander their opportunities and not care, sure some will just get by and not take full advantage of it, but some kids will put it to good use and get full scholarships to good colleges and come out on top.   That right there makes it completely worth it.


**EDIT #3**


It is possible the kid read this post.  I am not going to say who my employer was, or where it was because I believe anonymity is the best.   I would hate to have anything backlash and reflect poorly on the school system I worked at.   Plus now I work back in the private sector and have learned it is really just a professional courtesy to keep your mouth shut.   I will update if it was really him.   


**UPDATE**

The student in question has in fact found this thread, and I have been messaging him via reddit.   I have told him I won't reveal his name, my name, or the schools name for anonymity reasons.  I think it is best kept that way.  He also reminded me of a few other exploits the students found and used which I forgot about.   The ARD Agent bug (Apple's fault) which allowed you to run apple script with escalated privileges, ie sudo.   Then we had a package that had a self healing auto update, and I had to have one folder in that package writable (bad developer) and we managed application usage by file path.  So, once students figured out they could drop games in this folder they did.   To remedy this I switched off the write bit in POSIX and then just download and repacked the whole package manually every time an update came out and just redeployed said package.


I'll have to admit I was impressed by how adaptive and smart a few of the students were.    They made me pay for my mistakes.  Plus, it is impossible to test every aspect of security with out a security audit team.  That is why companies have and contract out IT security people to audit such things.   I also changed my whole approach of imaging and managing the Macs after a lot of these issues.

...smart kid. ","6 Year old ""Hacker""",2325
400921FB54442D18,210,715,1lcwoz,1770,"So, I originally submitted this story as [a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lc6bt/dont_cook_crack_over_your_laptop/cbxt2j7) on the [crack laptop story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lc6bt/dont_cook_crack_over_your_laptop/), and more than 20 people thought I should submit it as a main story, so here you go.

A few years ago I worked as a repair technician at a popular, name-brand computer store, and the specific store I worked at was in a suburban area well-known for a high concentration of rich bitches (and their rich dick husbands and rich twat children). You may have seen a movie starring Lindsey Lohan that was based on the high school that serves this particular area...

One day, a woman came in with a laptop. This woman was fully decked-out in that particular combination of gaudy jewelry and name-brand clothing that is meant to tell the world ""I'm richer than you, so shut up and do my bidding, serf,"" but actually it just screams ""I married my husband for his six-million-dollar inheritance and now I'm blowing both the money and the pool boy."" I assume you're familiar with this type of person – the type that thinks that listening or paying attention to directions is so CLEARLY beneath her station in life that even ASKING her to do so is a waste of her time.

Before she even got to the counter, I noticed the snowboarding sticker on the lid of the laptop. It stuck out, because it was totally discongruous with the rest of her belongings. So I wasn't surprised when the first words out of her mouth were ""I bought this laptop for my son"" – most of these people would buy a laptop for each of their children by the time the kids were in middle school. And the next words out of her mouth were ""and he says it doesn't turn on anymore.""

The laptop was a year or two old, and appeared to be in pretty good shape – a little bit of scuffing, no obvious damage – but any time we had a computer without power, we were supposed to double-check for liquid damage before we quoted a repair.

So I excused myself and took the computer to the back room and opened it up. Sure enough, there were some remaining residue spots and even a few drops of water left inside the machine. But that's not what caught my attention.

On that particular model the keyboard is built into the top panel of the housing, so you have to remove the entire panel and keyboard to open the machine. As I pulled the panel off and turned it over onto the workbench, some little greenish flakes fell out of somewhere. I looked closer at them. They looked strangely... familiar. I took a hard look at the keyboard... especially the edges around the keys, where dust and hair get in. More green flakes seemed to be trapped there. So I took a can of compressed air, put the nozzle up to the back side of the keyboard. A ton of green flakes flew out all over the workbench.

I was starting to get an idea of what might have happened to this computer. So I dipped my finger in the drops of remaining liquid inside the computer, raised it to my nose, and sniffed... which confirmed my theory.

This kid had been smoking pot, and I don't know if he was rolling joints on this keyboard or what, but over the past couple of years he had managed to get at least *an entire bowl* worth of ground marijuana trapped in his keyboard. And the spilled liquid that had fried his laptop in the end? *Bong water.* Nasty, funky, grody bong water.

I showed my discovery to the other technicians, and we all had a good laugh. One of the newer techs asked me ""so what are you going to tell her?"" I thought about this for a moment. This lady was *not* the sort of person who would react well to having a retail keyboard-jockey tell her that her son was Up To No Good. The more I thought about it, the more I thought ""...hell, if this lady were *my* mother, I'd be using every form of chemical escapism available to me, too!""

So my course was clear. I blew the rest of the bits out of the keyboard, wiped up the weed that was all over the bench, reassembled the thing and took it back out front.

""I'm sorry, ma'am, but it does appear that a glass of water must have been spilled near the laptop. Under these circumstances we do have to ship the laptop out to be fully rehabbed, and it will not be covered under warranty. The cost to get this laptop working again will be $755, and we could have it ready in about a week.""

She didn't even flinch; she paid without hesitation. I never told her what I'd found.

Wherever you are, bro, I hope you survived high school.

paracelsus23,313,615,1j7rcf,1764,"Many of the tales on this subreddit are stories of the frustration of clueless users, short-sighted bosses, and basically anything that arises from working in an industry where nobody else really understands what you do. I thought I'd share a different sort of story - the only time I really wasn't sure what to do ethically. I'm still not completely sure I handled this properly, but screw it I'm not going to bother with a throwaway. 

I had several clients I supported long-term, to the point where I almost became another employee. These were engineering firms, and while they didn't understand all the technology, they understood the value of preventative maintenance, taking care of equipment, and the IT itself was typically pretty low-stress. Some of the employees would request my services for their personal computers, which is how this story starts. 

I'm at one of my best clients, and their senior engineer, a man in his 70's, approaches me. I've known him for years, and even met his family at a few company functions. He has a few daughters, and a son - all in their 30's and 40's. Here's how the conversation went:

* ""My son has recently passed away, and I'd like you to help recover some of his files"". 
* ""Sir, I'm very sorry for your loss. What can I do to help?""
* ""When going through my son's estate, the most recent copy of his will, which was updated about 2 years ago, has a significant portion of his assets going to his best friend, and not to anyone in the family. We found some files on his laptop we can't open, and thought they might have some clues as to why he made this decision - maybe a journal or something. We always thought we were close with him and are really perplexed as to why he'd disinherit us. The friend seems just as surprised"". 
* ""Sure, I'll be glad to take a look at it, although depending on the security there might not be anything I'm able to do (I'm thinking TrueCrypt, etc). 
* ""No problem - whatever you can do""

So, I get the laptop, and go home. When I power it up, I see in C:\Program Files\ are the files in question. Archive1.RAR, Archive2.RAR, etc, through about 7 or 8. Someone had obviously been doing some digging - who the hell checks program files for RAR files? Anyway, they vary in size, from say 2GB to 5GB. Try to open them up - and of course, password protected. As RAR's are known for their rigorous security, I figure I'll have this job done in 5 minutes or less. 

I grab some random RAR password decryptor, and get the password. I open the files, and - they're all filled with - gay porn. Most of it is pretty vanilla, but there's a little bit of light bondage and watersports. No journals, personal files, or anything else - just porn. As I work my way through archives 4 and 5, I realize that the file names are all now ""John and I doing X"" - not the names you'd see from a porn site. Great. 

So, as I realize that I'm looking at the amateaur porn of a dead man who was obviously in the closet to everyone - it dawns on me. The ""friend"" was really the boyfriend, which is why he was named in the will, and for whatever personal reasons, the son / boyfriend don't feel comfortable coming out to the guy's father, even in death. Now's probably a good time to mention that I'm only 19 at the time, and that I also happen to be bisexual (I was completely in the closet at the time, I still am to my family). So now, instead of dealing with a simple file recovery, I'm faced with lying to an important client about his dead son, or outing a dead son and boyfriend - with photographic evidence. Fuck. I decided I'd pull the laptop's drive, and search for deleted files, in the off chance the son had a note or journal or letter to his dad that might somehow help the situation. I found nothing helpful - it seemed that his computer was solely for web browsing / online banking / porn. Nothing helpful at all. Fuck. 

I thought about it for a while, and decided that the boyfriend was fully capable of disclosing this information if he chose to, and that the son obviously wanted this information secure, and that it wasn't my place to disclose it. However, this still left me in a tricky situation with the father. I couldn't tell him, ""Sorry, I wasn't able to open the files"", because he'd simply find someone else who could, and might not be as discreet as me. Somewhere down the line, the boyfriend and son would still be out, and the father would know the homegrown porn existed. No, I had to lie about it in such a way that the father would be satisfied, and not pursue the issue. 

I pick up the phone: 

* ""Hello, It's Paracelsus, I've got some news""
* ""REALLY?!? Did you find anything? A journal, notes, anything at all?!?""
* ""No, I was able to decrypt the files, and I could see why your son wanted to keep them secure. It turns out that he had downloaded some bootleg software and movies off the internet. It's not a big deal, but they can contain viruses and be dangerous to the computer, so you'd want to keep them protected. I'd suggest deleting them, or at least not trying to open them"". 
* ""Ah, that makes sense. My son was always really good with computers, and I could see him messing around with stuff like that. Thank you for letting me know - the last thing I'd want to do is try and open them and mess up his computer. You didn't find anything at all, Paracelsus?""
* ""No, sorry, I even ran a full-drive search for deleted files, just in case there was something in another location. I didn't really find any personal files at all"".
* ""Wow, that's thorough! Thank you for doing that! How much do I owe you?""
* ""Oh, considering the circumstances, nothing at all... I'm sorry you didn't find what you were looking for, and for your loss.""

**TL;DR I lied to an old man to keep him from finding his dead, gay,  closeted son's amateur porn collection, and kept the son's boyfriend in the closet in the process.** ",The only time I lied to a client,2379
thesistergeek,437,805,15n4do,1735,"Sorry if this isn't strictly tech support, but seeing as it plays a large factor, I thought it was relevant.

**Background**: I'm still in college.  My soon to be husband is graduating ahead of me, and since my credits (oddly) transfer to whatever communication program exists in the world, I'm looking for jobs for both of us somewhere out of the American South.  I've worked tech support for my dad's consulting business and all his clients since I was knee high, and while I've never been IT, it was what everyone called me.

I freelance in social media marketing to help put myself through school, which is about as difficult as you'd think it is (as in not really at all).  Older, computer illiterate people just don't understand the internet, but can really be getting into a younger market with a little bit of help.  I have a rate that turns out at about $15-$20/hr, depending on how much of my help they need.  Because I work in a lot of really teeny businesses, I often help the owners fix computers and set up their phones on the side.  I'm very accustomed to genuinely confused clients and bosses.

Today, a small marketing firm out of a major New England city called me for a phone interview.  Everything had been going really well, and I had spoken to them several times.  We even had a time set up for an in-person interview in March when I would be in town.  The employees I'd dealt with were super nice, and there had been no red flags up to this point.

I'd actually become rather close with a specific guy, who I'd talked to and emailed multiple times over the last few weeks, and who I know is a redditor.  We'll call him ""Geoff.""  I had his extension number, and his personal email address.

The person on the other end for the interview was significantly older than anyone else I'd dealt with.  He sounded like a late 50's smoker who would have been better suited for a manufacturing plant.  He starts giving me scenarios, asking how I'd respond to them.  Really weird things like, ""If one of our clients made cupcakes that killed one out of every three customers, how you would respond to that?""  Every time, after the second sentence of my response, he cuts me off, saying, ""Ok, that's enough, sweetheart.""

After about 20 minutes of this, he suddenly asks, ""Do you know anything about resetting wireless routers?  We really need someone to do that.  We just had to fire our IT guy because he kept messing up.  Lying bastard anyway, would always clear his internet history.  You don't do that do you?  Because only liars do that.""

I spent a couple of seconds in complete silence, wondering what the hell I just heard.  I eventually said, ""Yes, I do know a good bit about networking setups.  What seems to be the issue?""

He then details how he tried to install this browser tracking and keylogging software on the network, so that he knew his employees weren't liars.  He had also installed security cameras so that he could see how much they were taking breaks.  I needed to be OK with that.

I also helped him install a wireless mouse.

Now, he was speaking REALLY loud.  I had to turn down the volume all the way on my phone, and still had to hold it away from my ear.

By now, I was sort of scared that the employees didn't know about any of this.  I decided to stall, telling him that was going to have to talk to my fiance and see if the dates lined up for when he first needed me.  I obviously wasn't taking the job.  He wanted me to start as soon as possible.

I got off the phone, and immediately called Geoff.  I asked him if he'd heard any of that.  He confirmed that he had heard everything, and that no one had been aware of what was going on.  He'd checked his processes and there it was, a keylogger as well as some other random software installed that dumped everything he'd done during the entire day into a file on his boss's PC.

He told me he'd call me back.  He had to call a lawyer, then quit.

He called me back later, and told me the entire office did just that.  25 people.  They're starting their own firm, and have invited me to join once they get on their feet.

The owner had died a year or so ago, and this guy had bought the business.  His previous job?  Head of sales for a sofa making company.

**tl;dr - Big Brother is revealed in a phone interview, entire office quits.** 

**edit** Just got a text again from Geoff.  Though he didn't give me any information on how his boss was doing it, apparently he was recording every phone conversation in the place and saving it, without notifying anyone, including the person on the other end.  There had also been some discrepancies with pay, with half an hour being taken off somehow, or being made to work an hour longer.  Apparently, even though most were salaried, he had been docking their checks for EVERY MINUTE spent on non-work-related activities.  They're hoping they can sue him just on the phone conversations alone.",On how I got an entire office full of people to quit.  All because I had a phone interview.,2540

scootersbricks,377,589,1clbfk,1695,"I worked blackberry tech support for (Major wireless provider) several years ago, right as they were being bought out by (other major wireless provider, we'll call it ""Spring"").  One of the two worst calls I received was regarding that very buy-out.

I gave my (overly long) introduction, got the customer's full information (it took approximately 2 minutes of us demanding information before we were allowed to ask what the customer's issue was or we would be disciplined for not following the script), and asked what the problem was.



Me: ""And how may I assist you today, ma'am?""

Customer: ""Well first, let me start by saying that I am not at all racist.""

Me: ""Of course not, ma'am.""  At this point I'm recounting how the most racist, bigoted things I've ever heard were prefaced by those eleven words.

Customer: ""Well you guys just got bought out by Spring Wireless, right?""

Me: ""We, uh, technically 'merged' with Spring, so now we are the same company.""

Customer: ""Used to be, when someone would call my phone, before ringing they would hear, 'Please wait while the (Original company) customer is being found.""

Me: ""Yes...""

Customer: ""Well now it says, 'Please wait while the Spring customer is being found.'...but then it repeats it...IN SPANISH!""

Me: ""Yes ma'am, because our customer base is very diverse we find that it is best to reach-""

Customer: ""Well I do NOT want people to think I would ever, EVER associate with someone who would speak Spanish!  I'm not going to support those illegals!""

Me: ""But...it's just a recording.""

Customer: ""Well you better change the damn recording. I don't want people to think I have anything to do with them!""

Me: ""You don't understand...I do not have the ability to re-record the message that goes out to several million subscribers myself.

Customer: ""You will change the message or I will cancel my account TODAY.""

Me: ""Okay, ma'am,"" I responded, exasperated.  ""But I just don't seem to understand why it is such an issue.""



Customer: ""Because if those LITTLE PEOPLE want to float over here in those LITTLE BOATS and steal OUR JOBS and ruin OUR ECONOMY then they DAMN WELL BETTER LEARN OUR LANGUAGE!  Now you send me to cancellations so I can switch to a company that has some MORALS!""

At this point my supervisor has come over to listen to the call and is doing everything he can not to fall out of his chair laughing.  The lady has four phones on her account and is just a few months from the end of her contract--meaning she will still get hit with $800 in cancellation fees because she can't accept the fact that other languages exist.

My supervisor comes over and mutes my phone.  ""Let me handle this,"" he says with a grin.  He hits ""conference"" on the phone.  This puts the customer on hold and opens another line.

He types in a number that I faintly recognize but just can't place.

He hits ""conference"" again right before the line picks up.  The phone is muted from our side, but he has just connected the customer to this other department, who starts to give their intro.



I can't believe what I heard.  My ballsy supervisor transferred my racist customer to the Spanish-speaking helpdesk.

jon6,393,2323,1b2k7r,1688,"Weeks came and went; another month slipped by unnoticed. A new support manager had appeared. Young, new and inexperienced, his often rash decision making seemed reminiscent of Angie’s vicious and brutal idea of management, though it seemed driven by immaturity rather than vindictiveness. We continued to exist in the knowledge that there was nobody who would be like our first ITS manager. But, thankfully, nobody like Angie either. 

I had two major projects after Angie’s departure. I was in the midst of successfully redeploying the laptops complete with fully working software. However, it became apparent in the days subsequent to her finding out that Angie had opened administrative access to AD to the entire Helpdesk. As you can well expect, our sparkling and carefully maintained AD structure now had contradictory group policies, login scripts which went nowhere and more phantom accounts and objects than I think we would ever finally sort out. It was if Angie had left me a parting gift, a final “fuck you” from the Queen of Aggression. It’s two-pronged effect seemed unintentional given her ineptitude. But it had encroached on every single user in the company as their login times grew exponentially, together with seemingly random permission sets which denied sometimes even the most basic of privileges.

It was getting to be the hottest summer I’ve ever known in Britain. I still hadn’t taken time out to wash my Mondeo; it’s recent costly repair bill had left a bitter taste in my mouth. The grime that lay affixed to the bonnet and wings seemed an apt punishment for depriving me of yet another wage check. 

Arriving back to the office from a well-earned summer pub lunch, I walked towards the building across the car park. As I passed, a familiar Jaguar graced a VIP spot in the car park. Sleek and shiny, its black finish shone in the midday sun, freshly polished and lovingly detailed. Its congeniality seemed marred by the fact that Angie had once owned a car like this, her angry face refusing to even make eye contact as she stared over the leather steering wheel. 

I had finished replacing a dead hard disk in an OptiPlex and was delivering it to a damsel in distress. Particularly, this was one of the sales guys damsels in distress. As I connected the machine back up, he came out of his glass-clad office for a chat. “Did you see, your ex manager is back” he grimaced. I knew what he meant; this man had been trained to smile and lie for a living. The news that Angie was back seemed unpalatable. 

“Who, Angie?” I questioned. “She got sacked, didn’t she?” 

The Sales Manager shook his head with a learned look. “People like that don’t get sacked!” he explained. I hung on his every word, as if this was the most important lesson I would ever receiving in my life. “When someone like that is put into a particular position, it’s usually because someone recommended her for it. Someone put her there, Jon6! If she had done well, the person who recommended her would have gotten a nice pat on the back. But, if she cocks it up, there’s no way they’re going to turf her out. Whoever recommended her would have their nuts in a sling for recommending such a dud; nobody would ever take them seriously ever again”

He continued “When people like that in such positions of power make a fantastic fuck up like that, they get paid off. They get promoted with a golden handshake just so someone above her can save face with the board! Admitting failure isn’t even on the menu!”

Despising the obvious truth to his words, I had to probe deeper “Then, who got the blame for all that then?” 

“Well, BHIT of course. He was so close to retirement and he didn’t really make much noise anyway. People forgot he was there. It was either him or you guys, really!”

I looked up from over the desk partition. Across the cavernous office, I could just about see the familiar twisted frame of Angie as she stormed with intent around a small section of desks, her shrill and piercing tone somehow breaking through the human noise, over the sound of printers, phones and chatter. Another hapless team of underlings were getting it from her, both barrels. 

I turned, eager to continue this discourse; however the Sales Manager had already retreated to his office. He held his phone to his head as he clicked the door closed. 

As the OptiPlex spun into life, the Windows XP splash screen floated as if to stand testament to the spoils. Who had really won here? Well, nobody it seems.  As I struggled to think for a moral to the story, I was interrupted by the returning damsel. She thanked me for my time turning back to her work, our brief moment of temporary friendship now at an end, politically and autocratically ceased with the completion of my task, the only remaining duty being the closing of the support ticket.

I work with around 400 users - but as you all know you usually get around 12 nonstoppers as i call them. ""hey %user% , whats up today"" deal.

11 are pleasant and just sometimes need confirmation they are doing things correctly (cute and annoying). 1 however is an arse. ""do this do that""...

He regularly phones and complains that I am not fast enough in sorting issues out, ten minutes after a ticket opens is not fast enough, no toilet for me! He is always deleting files by mistake, trying to send emails around 50MB...give me all permissions i dont need...etc etc...""IT stops me doing my job"" attitude.

So......one day he phones me up in panic mode. ""I have sent an email and the person is on leave so won't get it, can you delete it/remove it before he gets back from leave""...you can hear its not just a sensitive email situation where figures or the like have been sent to the wrong person. So i go and see the email he has sent. He is badmouthing his boss and CC's him in the email. 

""can you get my email back""....No 

I didnt hear from him after that and got a User delete request from my boss. Shame.

The software we support uses the SQL database engine. The installer has a batch file, that runs the SQL express installation with the default settings our software requires. At times, it fails due to windows updates, permissions, Microsoft sucking, etc. I can walk somebody through an SQL install and it's not too painful. As long as they follow my instructions, the manual install doesn't take too much time, but like I said, the prerequisite of this not taking too much time requires the customer to follow my instructions. 

A remote session failed, so I was not getting into this guy's computer. An hour went by, no progress. 

**Me:** Are you SURE you don't see that folder in the temp folder?

**Customer:** Oh sorry I closed it. 

This is pretty much the story of this case. However, the fates were kind to me, as something glorious and slightly majestic happened: He yelled at his son. 

**Customer:** NO I don't want you to take that! Unplug your computer from the TV! I don't know how you did that.

My gears start turning. This kid is probably running an HDMI connection from his computer into the television. This requires him to change the default sound settings and sometimes visual settings. It's a gamble, but I'm bald, and don't have any hair to rip out to ease my pain. I began to engage in small talk.

**Customer:** Sorry about hearing me yell at him

**Me:** No problem. How old is he? 

**Customer:** He's about 17. He's pretty savvy with windows. 

You guys play Command and Conquer Red Alert? Remember Tanya? Remember how she'd go in a somewhat manly\womaney voice CHA CHIIIINNNGGG??? This happened.

**Me:** Oh. You think he'd be able to help us? 

**Customer:** Meh maybe. 

This is no longer up for debate

**Me:** May I talk to your son please?

**Customer:** Oh, sure. JAKE!! COME HERE AND TALK TO THE NICE TECH GUY.

Note we're about an hour and a half into this. I get his son.

**Me:** Hey Jake. I need you to follow my instructions exactly as I say them. If you have questions feel free to ask. This should take us about twenty minutes. 

**Jake:** Oh okay cool. 

I was wrong. It took 15 MINUTES. So, thank you customer's son for being the light at the end of that issue's tunnel. No there was no bacon at the end of that tunnel as I was wanting. But whatever.

mrlithic,211,575,1h8z4b,1654,"This happened a very long time ago when I worked for a very large organisation (3rd largest employer on the planet, if that is a clue). I worked for a National Group in this organisation and we had offices in every major city in the country. One of the cities had a regional holiday and I had agreed to cover any local calls while the two IT Support guys took the day off. I was not expecting much other than a few senior managers who had to catch up on work. 

No calls had come through until about 9am, when a senior member from this remote office telephone number came up. 

“I’ve been trying to print and nothing is appearing in the printer”, he told me. 

“Not a problem” I said, “I will remote into your machine and check it out myself”.  So, I get onto his box and could see that someone had changed his printer to a networked one. 

“You are not printing locally”

“I am sorry” he replied. 

“You are not printing to your local printer; it has been changed to a printer on the network”. 

I changed it back to the one on his desk, while I explained . “You are printing to another printer in the country”. 

“Oh” he said and hung up really abruptly. I did not expect that type of rude behaviour from this guy but then he was a pretty high level person and they could get rude.

The next call I got was from this young secretary in one of our small offices. I did not get support calls from there very often since it was a small office with only 10 staff. This girl had started about a month before and this was her first job, I think she still lived at home. 

“Hello, is this IT Support”. She asked. 

“Yes, it is. 

“My printer has not stopped printing this morning.”

I was kind of expecting this call and so I told her not to worry and was about to say I knew where it was coming from when she interrupted me. 

“It won’t stop printing p-p-porn”, she exclaimed. She had trouble saying the word ‘porn’, as if this was something bad that her parents had told her about. 

“It is pages and pages about men’s ‘things’ and their problems”. 

“I am sorry, what is it”, I asked. 

“Men’s parts and them having difficulty with them”. She explained. 

“Erectile Dysfunction?” I asked. 

“I am not explaining this any more!” 

“There are pictures!”

“We have been hacked””. She yelled at me in quick succession.  

I calmed her down and told that I had stopped the printouts and that we would not be ‘hacked’ again. 

I guess the fellow in the other city had been trying to print out suggested solutions to his problem from various medical websites and when the first printout had not appeared, he had pressed print several more times. He had tried to print over 25 copies of multiple articles. 

The secretary left a short while later, stating that she did not feel suitable for this position. It seemed to have really rattled her. 

EDIT: Wow - Front page - Thanks. 

He was not in a medical profession. This stuff was strictly personal. He came in on a holiday to surreptitiously print information of a sensitive nature and read it later. This was back when folks did not have home broadband. 

I think that he had probably been set up to print to the remote office and then forgot about it (until he remembered). I never chased it up and found out if the local support guys had done this for him. I thought the fellow had suffered enough. The offices were on opposite sides of the country (roughly 50 miles apart). 

The lass had left after this but I think other things were also affecting it. She was pretty sensitive and did not handle being in a busy office well. Closeted schoolgirl to frontline support staff in a busy office is tough for most folks. This probably did not help. 

I have no idea what the pictures showed. Use your imagination.

Techsupportvictim,237,649,1r5j3f,1647,"Okay this is by far one of my fav stories and I tell it at work often as a 'tale of woe and caution'. 

The scene. My retail, that also does tech support for our stuff, store. Sunday afternoon about thirty minutes before close. 

The players. (And yes the details are important). TSV (me) a 5‘2 size 00 chick. Darren (customer) easily 6‘4 muscled guy. Looks like the stereotypical bodyguard sort with his black on black suit, shaved head etc. Guys biceps are as big as my head.
Jeff. Coworker playing 'captain of the ship' in the tech area. 

The game. Dialogue is paraphrased but the gist is correct.

So I'm doing my thing fixing user error issues, the occasional software restore, and so on. Oddly quite for a Sunday. But whatever.

Jeff: hey TSV do you think you can take one more before you go (I was supposed to be off the floor in about five minutes to go do some paperwork that was actually done so yeah I could)

TSV: what's up?

Jeff: got a guy with a phone that was broken needs to replace it. No appointment. 

TSV: sure. Bring him on.

Jeff brings over big guy. Huge guy from my POV. I firmly invite him to grab a seat as it's the only way I can look him in the eye (for those that don't read my retail stories I'm partially deaf so half my hearing is lip reading)

TSV: hi, I'm TSV. 

Dude: Darren. (Not real friendly, but not pissy tone)

TSV. Nice to meet you Darren. Jeff tells me your phone was broken, sorry to hear that. Let's get you set up with a new one. Okay (yeah this is how the company makes us talk)

Darren kind of nods, pulls out the phone. Now this model has a glass front and back. Both are shattered. Total spider web. He hands it to me and a quick look shows that it won't turn on and the external liquid tags are screaming red. Yeah it's dead, time to bury this dog.

TSV: I need to take this in the back for just a moment okay.

Darren nods again and I notice that his lip is shaking. Dude can hulk smash me like a fly and he honestly looks like he's about to bawl. Over a phone. WTF?  

So I make quick work of going to the back, popping the back off the phone, get the serial and look up the warranty and part. I put the phone back together as best I can, pop out the sim and put the unit in a static bag for the moment in case any glass decides to pop off. Back to the floor I go.

TSV. Okay Darren. I was able to get the serial and my system shows that you have (warranty thing) so a replacement is just $50. Since you have ATT transferring your number will be a breeze since it's on the SIM card. I have you out of here in just a few minutes. 

Darren: okay (pulls out his wallet and hands me cash). What about my numbers and photos and stuff? Can you get those? 

TSV: (I hate this part it never goes well) unfortunately the phone is very water damaged and won't power on so there's no way for us to retrieve any information

I brace myself for the yelling

Darren: my wife is going to kill me. She's an ex Seal. She's good at killing people when she needs to. She's going to (cue a swear word filled rant that would make Colin Farrell blush. Mostly directed at himself. Some at the universe in general.)

Darren: I'm an idiot. She told me to back up the photos. She said folk's phones get stolen in Vegas all the time. She kept nagging me so I said I did it. She's going to find out I lied and they will find my body in like a hundred pieces. 

I get him to calm down and tell me the whole story, half out of a perverse interest and half because he clearly needs to confess his 'sin' and I'm the priest. He's not yelling or anything so okay I'll listen 

Darren is ex military and the last of his buddies was getting married so as a bachelor party they went to Vegas for the weekend. It's not uncommon as we are in LA. You can drive up pretty easy or find a cheap flight almost any time. The night before they were out drinking etc and the phone took a drop into a stone bottomed fountain. 

Now why was Darren so flipping out. It wasn't over the phone but the data. See Darren was the (generally) happy father of a baby boy. A three week old baby boy who popped up a little early so the mother in law came to help Mom so Darren and the boys could have their party. How nice etc. But before he left, Mom had reminded him to back up the photos, the only photos of Darren Jr, to the computer in case something happened to his phone. She had reminded him several times but he was too busy thinking about Vegas to be bothered. And yes Darren told his wife he did it. And now she was going to kill him. Having seen Darren I'm a tad worried about a woman he's scared of.

Now our company has a backup/sync service that if all goes well will save your stuff nightly. I figure what's the harm in checking if he had it on. There's a part of it that does save photos although it's not on by default. I don't tell poor Darren about it because I don't want to get his hopes up. 

Darren: (finally out of steam) oh well, it's my fault. Time to face it like a man.

TSV: that's the spirit. Your wife will be mad but I'm sure she loves you and will forgive you, after a lot of grief of course (this actually gets a chuckle). And he's only a few weeks old, you have plenty of time for taking more photos.

Darren: yeah (not quite convinced he's not a dead man)

I ring him up for the phone, power it on. Get to the screen for him to log in. At this point he just thinks he's setting up the new phone like normal. And what to my wondering eyes do appear. But a backup made the night before his trip. 

TSV: well that's interesting. There's a backup listed in (our system) for your phone. Last updated Thursday night.

Darren: I don't remember doing that.

TSV: you probably set it up when you first got it. That was months ago so it's easy to forgot. Plus it runs on its own so you don't have to do anything other than plug your phone into power. It might just be contacts and notes. But why don't we try it. Can't hurt.

Darren: okay if you think we should

TSV: (knowing the camera roll is on by default if full backups are) I do. 

Jump ahead about five minutes and the phone reboots to load whatever it just downloaded.

Darren: hey all the apps I had are there.

TSV: waiting to download but it knows what to get

Darren: if it knows that could it have my photos?

TSV: let's look.

He taps the gallery app. 

Darren: those are my photos. Old photos. Wait those aren't as old. Those are THE photos. You saved my photos. You saved my life. 

Darren is so thrilled he jumps up and grabs me and hugs me. Remember he's got a foot and a good hundred pounds on me so he literally lifts me off the ground in the process. I thought my LP guy was going to explode. Darren realizes about a split second later he probably shouldn't have done that and puts me down and steps a noticeable space back. 

He thrusts his hand out to shake mine. 

Darren: you just saved my life. Literally. My wife is an ex Seal. 

TSV: so you said. I'm glad it worked out. Now be sure to back up those photos when you get home 

Darren: yeah I learned my lesson. I'm never lying to my wife again. 

TLDR: guy drops phone with very important photos on it into water. Had lied to wife about them being backed up. I look like a goddess cause I get them back via online backup service he didn't know he had set up. man vows never to lie to wife again. My job is done.

Then, when he couldn't get the program to re-size the pictures properly on the screen and I had to show him how to use the computer, I said to him, ""Don't worry, this is what I went to school for, I wouldn't expect it to make sense to you.""

[deleted],105,447,1kijzn,1613,"**Positon:**Deploy Technician.  Main duties were building the computer to the requested specs and delivering to the end user or to the machinery it was used to run.

**Company:**Big Green tractor maker.


We had around 7 various buildings with different IT equipment in them, but the one that everyone dreaded goign into was the Foundry.  If you've never been in a foundry, they tend to involve a lot of activities like [this] (http://www.walkerfoundry.com/foundry6.jpg) and [this](http://blog.kenkaminesky.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kaminesky-Blog-Innsbruck-Grassmayr-Bell-Foundry-2.jpg).  Needless to say, this was not our most favorite place to deploy..well anything.  

The one redeeming factor there were the people.  They fixed and made-do with whatever they had for as long as possible to help us out, and we appreciated it.  When they called for hardware, they needed it.  There was never a complaint from us about them requesting too many things as they used things to the last shred of usefulness was gone and THEN they called us.  One of these fine people was Alex.. aka the Mad Russian.  Alex was really a fun, fun guy.  Got work done, but when things went wrong due to ineptitude or bad planning on someone else's part, he let it be known.  He also had the pull to make things difficult for anyone who crossed him, so we usually went out of our way to keep him happy.

Usually.  

This is a story of what happened when we didn't.

I was driving in the foundry to drop a computer off for a small office located just next to one of the hotter holes of hell located in the Foundry.  I make my drop, hook up and confirm it connects.  All is good and grab the gator to leave and head back to that air conditioned office.  I can see the door at the other end, but then notice a 6'4, bald mid-40s Russian standing directly in the middle of the inside driveway.  No no for most people, but not for him.  Hell, who would tell him to move?  The following exchange occured:

**Alex:** Derp, we need to talk.

**Derp:** Sure, how can I help?

**Alex:** Where is my printer.

**Derp:** *noticing this isn't the regular happy Alex* I'm...not sure I know.  I don't handle the printers really.

**Alex:** *unimpressed with my lack of answers* The printer I requested 3 weeks ago. Ours broke beyond patching and we need it. Quickly.  PLEASE find out and get back to me ASAP.

I agree and speed back to the nerd cave we have on the other end of the site.  I approach one of the more senior techs about this.  He assures me he knows and is trying to do what he can to get it and that he will contact Alex.  He does, notifying Alex that due to restraints put in place by our contracted company (terrible place, by the way) we had to wait for too many varying levels of approval.  Alex understood, he wasn't happy, but he understood.

Now, Alex isn't dumb.  He knows things such as hardware requests, replacements, etc. are pretty low on the hierarchy of IT issues around there.  The bigger issue we had was network security.  The Wireless we had was strictly for laptops and they were hardcore at making sure it stayed that way.  No personal phones, corporate phones or personal laptops...anything not a business use laptop was allowed.  When something not allowed connected it was noticed and that area was notified immediately.  More than that, the higher IT people were forced to deal with it, look into it and update superiors on the issue, etc.  Massive email chains always erupted from this.


The very next day, we get a high urgency ticket regarding network activity and an iPhone.  Specifically, someone attempting to logon with Alex's credentials through a phone.  Emails were spammed. Alex was contacted.  The phone was disconnected from the network.  As he had recently gotten the phone, he was made aware and disconnected.  He also became aware of just how serious this ""network intrusion"" seemed to be.

Fast forward to the next day...

Around 1 pm the following day, the same thing happened.  Emails, Alex contacted, phone disconnected from network, ticket resolved.  Again, the following day it occurred.  It started happening each and every day.  Ignorance no longer a valid excuse, this email roundabout was becoming a hassle for all those involved as it touched some pretty important IT mailboxes, not to mention some higher ranking managers of the plant overall.  

Not soon after this first week of calculated ""attacks"" he stepped up his game.  2 times a day, he would connect his phone to the network.  By the middle of the second week, our IT broke.  Literally. Every other email seemed to be about why we couldn't keep the network secure.  Why all these intrusions were happening.  To the passive viewer of emails, most higher ups who were CC'd out of requirement, all this looked like was a bad IT company not able to do their job.  To us in the IT area, it was pure genius.  He couldn't get his printer in a reasonable time?  Fine, but to make up for it, he would swamp the IT higher ups with so much grief and email that he would be impossible to ignore.

Finally, one of the higher IT people of our company called him directly.  At first, to berate him on his constant breach of wireless protocol.  He left a stern voicemail and stood by in fake bravado as he told us it was handled.  A call came in, but as he was talking, we were to listen and let it go to our department voicemail.  When he finished, he turned, saw the missed call was Alex and put the phone on speaker before playing it.  Obviously, expecting it to be an apology but getting something much, much different.

[Voicemail starts] *In a heavy Russian accent* I'm aware that I've broken your...rules.  I do not care.  I've waited. I've followed your..rules.. to get a printer for this area.  You ignore me.  Can you ignore me now?  I want. my. printer. *click*

The bossman stands in silence, not sure what to think.  We all sit there doing our best not to laugh our asses off at his failed attempt at returning order to the land.  If the situation wasn't perfect enough, we all got an email as we sat there in stunned silence.


Intrusion alert.

2 days later, Alex got his printer.  mad Russian?  not anymore.  

**TL;DR** Russian turns into cold, calculating network abuser to convince IT higher ups to give him what he deserves.

Angry: oh, we'll why didn't you say that! It's (ID number)


Me: thank you.

The discount is only available to students who are currently attending classes.


Angry: (voice suddenly filled with rage and ignorance) I am too a student here! I need office for some classes that I'm taking over at (other school not related to us at all) and I **demand** the cheaper price. That shit is too expensive to buy regular.


Me: are you currently enrolled in classes here at (university)? 


Angry: No, but I **AM** a student!!

Me: I'm very sorry, but unless you are taking classes, you don't qualify for the discount price.


Angry: can you just let me use your student number and order it for me?


Me: no ma'am, that's illegal.

Angry: I just called a few minutes ago, and one of your employees was rude and refused to help me! 


Manager: I'm very sorry for that, I'll have a word with Toplesspenguin later. Is there anything I can help you with?

Manager then goes through the whole process of getting her number and telling her she's not a student and doesn't get her discount. 


Angry: is there anyone there with more experience who knows what they're doing!?


Manager: ma'm, I designed and created the system you're using, there is no one with more experience. It's obvious you're trying to get something you don't qualify for. If you call again your number will be blacklisted and you will lose IT phone support privileges. 


Angry: fuck you!

Me: ""Are you using a VGA or HDMI adapter/dongle?""

Her: ""I don't think I am using an adapter, I've got it hooked up already, its obviously the projector that is broken since I cant see it on the screen.""

Me: ""What cable did you use to hook it up without an adapter? How old is the computer?"" I am wondering if this is some kind of new Mac that I haven't heard of that has an HDMI port

Her: ""Oh I used the modem cable, it was the only one that fit""

Me: ""Modem cable? What do you mean? There are only three cables on the podium and none of them are...""

Her, interrupting me: ""Its the one that looks like it goes in a modem. See I don't really understand all this new technology, that's why I got a Mac, it's easier than a computer."" 

She's referring to the ethernet cable as a modem cable and thinks that will carry video to the projector automatically.

Me: ""I see, well unfortunately that's not going to work. You will need an adapter to hook up your Mac to the projection system. You can come by our office anytime to pick one up""

Her: ""I don't have time for all that, I have to give this presentation right now. I'll just use the modem cable""

Me: ""Good luck!""

theOtherJT,249,512,1dc9sg,1599,"So, we recently made some changes to our wifi infrastructure here, and predictably, it's caused a great deal of angst from the users. That this was going to be done was announced a month ago, and a web page put up explaining what you'd have to do. 

It was announced again last week, as is our way, and again last night, before the change actually occurred. There's been a lot of ""Why is the internet down?"" and ""My username's broken!"" and a whole bunch of ""Why doesn't it just work? Why do I have to do anything? It worked yesterday. This is too hard!"" coming from people who didn't read the email announcements, or the ""Status"" or ""News"" sections on the intranet site, or even the notice that we stuck up outside the department hoping that people might read it before coming in here... which is causing a certain degree of homicidal feeling among the support team, but this one, this one user... 


from: [idiot]@company
to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company;  [it-team-member-3]@company ...

It went on like that. As far as I can see she just emailed every address she's ever corresponded with. 

subject: wireless down

&gt;""The wireless is down.""

Then a whole bunch of ""reply to all"" happened, with the various CCd people _also_ emailing help, and occasionally even each other, and it took a couple of hours to prune everyone who had nothing to do with this out of the conversation. Once the shouting had shut up we managed to get a reply back explaining that the wifi was not down, and that she needed to log in using her usename and password now, along with detailed instructions as to how. Also, a fairly stern warning about sending out bulk mail and why it was causing everyone such a pain in the ass. 

What did we get back? 

from: [idiot]@company
to: help@company; support@company; [linemanager]@company; [local-office-drone]@company; [it-team-member-1]@company; [it-team-member-2]@company;  [it-team-member-3]@company ... (etc)

subject: Ok. 

&gt;""The wireless is still down.""

aaaaaand the reply to all happened again. 

Whilst we were trying to quieten everyone down we got another, again, CC'd to basically everyone she'd ever met. 

&gt;""I tried the password.""

then another...

&gt;""It didn't work.""

then another... 

&gt;""I tried my username too. Is that the password?""

and another...

&gt;""What's the password?""

Each time CC'd to what appears to be her entire address book, each time just one line with no context. Each one a new ticket that we have to merge with the old tickets to try and track this growing abomination. 

To try and stem the tide we sent one of the helldesk to her office to talk to her in person... she wasn't there. Whilst hunting for her more emails kept coming in. 

&gt;""I thought my password might be wrong.""

&gt;""My password is [password]... is that right?""

**headdesk**

&gt;""I tried [otherpassword], which is for my PC... is it that one?""

**double headdesk**

&gt;""I changed my password to [newpassword]. That doesn't work either.""

I had this image of someone sitting there just typing whatever came into their head into their email client and hitting ""Send to all"" once every few seconds, never reading the replies that came back. Then something occurred to me... if she's not sat in front of the computer in her office, and she's not able to use the wifi, then where the hell is she sending these emails from? I was composing a message to that effect when I got this final one:

&gt;""By the way, I'm at home.""

But at times, it can form an unrealistic expectation of my looks to men I talk to on the phone. I talk to a lot of guys who work in the field, and they are less like the corporate guys who apologize for swearing and more like boys playing around. They really have no filter.

They usually try to unabashedly flirt with me. I don't care so much about that, it's the time it takes for them to stop and tell me their problem that drives me insane. I have never professed patience as a virtue.

One guy in particular was especially flirtatious and obviously decided that he had ""game"" and would try and woo me even though we were over 2000 miles a part.

Me: Oh hello, what's going on? (nervously laugh)


DYVIS: Why haven't you accepted my FB request?


Me: Oh, I really only have people I know in person and really well on there.


DYVIS: Ah, c'mon, I'm not a creep. 


Me: What problem are you having? (I try to extricate from the uncomfortable conversation.)


DYVIS: Oh, I see how it is. (He guffaws) My aircard isn't working.


After some troubleshooting and remoting into his PC, I am checking the drivers and need him to take out the aircard and put it back in.


Me: Can you take it out and put it back in?


DYVIS: Woah, Bookinvertebrate, it's a little early for us to be doing that! (Laughs obnoxiously, shredding every last remnant of patience I had ever deigned to posess.)


Finally fed up, my voice entered a flat tone and I said:


No, I am not talking about your penis, I am talking about your aircard.


He coughs, the line goes silently awkward. My coworker practically broke his neck as he swung it around looking at me with surprise.

Working at a small company budget is a major concern. So if it can be done cheap great, free is better.

I come in one morning to find the boss has performed one of their ""audits""of my computer. Having already configured spiceworkd I never understood why they needed to go to computers. Then again, they didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing.

These audits consisted of looking around for files and applications they don't know and deleting them. I wrote code examples like Github gists to demonstrate how things could be implemented. They were deleted to prevent them accidentally being included in release builds. Two branches of source code, better delete one... which one? Better delete them both so they know not to have multiple copies. That reminds me, I better ask where we are up to with the new features they were writing.

I would come back to databases being deleted. Migration projects gone! Database engines gone!

I open outlook to see they have once more removed the reading pane. Oh look they have moved all my email and forwarded them all to themselves. Oh joy, I envision a day of ""you received an email 3 years ago from.x at y about z can I mark this as resolved?""

There is an email from them at 04:00. ""It has been noted that hardcore pornography was on your computer.""

Unsure what constitutes hardcore these days I email back ""was this email meant for me? I am not sure what you mean.""

After only a few seconds I receive an email back with ""on your computer you had a file called gimp that contained pornography.""

""We have Photoshop. I will bring it in. It's the latest version you can get and it cost us a fortune.""

drdeadringer,185,559,1ivye4,1575,"I read [this other story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1iuuxd/no_maam_for_the_9th_time_already_it_is_not_fixed/) and it reminded me of something a coworker shared with me from back in his day. A story where styles of management and tech support collide.

Let's call this coworker ""Tim"". Many years ago at a company far, far away...

Tim was working for a U.S. defense firm. As you may expect, defense companies use computers [and other stuff] to test military hardware. One day, during a particular test cycle, the test fails and fails hard. In the beginning, it's not even clear if it's an issue with the computerized test equiment, or the Unit Under Test [""UUT""]. God help you if your test equipment fried a perfectly good UUT -- the Pope will refer you to St Jude before running like Hell.

So there's a tight schedule and all testing is halted because of this failure. Managers are sweating. Senior managers are sweating. Directors and VPs are sweating. The customer pays a call to say 'hello' in person. For defense firms, ""the customer"" is a polite term for ""uniformed members of the armed forces"".

It falls to Tim to be the man on the spot. ""Hey, Tim, fix this up double quick."" He gets to it. After some troubleshooting, it turns out the test equipment is buggered but the UUT is fine. The fix will take roughly 20-40 minutes.

... except that all these managers, senior managers, big wigs galore, and the customer are huddled together 30 feet way ""to facilitate"". We know how some managers are when it comes to facilitating via being physically present in the room. Every few minutes, one of these folks would break away from the group, meander over to Tim, and ask some version of, ""So, how's it going?"" or ""What's your status?"" or ""How close are you to being finished?"". Every... few... minutes. A 20-40 minute job quickly starts to extend into forever.

Tim's direct manager walks in. I mean, what's taking Tim so damn long? Let's call Tim's direct manager ""Bob"".

Bob takes one look at the group of Big Wigs, and then one look at Tim, then back to the Big Wigs. Bob walks over to Tim.

Bob: ""Tim, how are you doing?""

Tim: ""Well Bob, I'm trying to do this fix-up work so we can get back to test. I know what needs to be done, I should be done by now to tell you the truth, but they keep coming over one by one and interrupting me.""

Bob spins on the balls of his feet and jabs his finger up in the air. ""Everybody OUT!!!""

After a few minutes of cat-herding and political massaging, the room is evacuated except for Tim and Bob. Tim continues his work and Bob actually helps out by passing tools around. Job is done, steps and fixes are logged, the word spreads faster than bad news, and testing can resume.

Forever after, Tim knew he liked working for Bob.

shwabob,309,529,1mle4z,1550,"Greetings fellow support experts!  I've come to regale you with a tale of GREAT JUSTICE!

This is a follow on to an earlier tale about a ridiculously stupid user/owner that just doesn't have a clue what she's doing, which you can read at:
http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1jdrpx/help_me_help_me_im_not_on_the_network/

After undergoing quite a great deal of hassle and headache associated with their migration to Quickbooks 2013, the owners of Senior Corp finally came to the realization that they were ridiculously under-manned and over-worked, plus lacked real quickbooks experience to deal with their 500+ contractors.  So, they decided to add a few heads to the operation.

At the time, they had 4 employees / 4 workstations (including Owner P's ""server"") machine.  They wanted to add 3 more stations, and Intuit/QB support advised that they would need a 'dedicated server' for their Quickbooks data - something I had been suggesting for the better part of a year now (yes, I could conceivably have up to 10 stations with 7 pro but a server is clearly the way to go here).  Since Owner P never listens to the IT guy but listens to QB support, she now was onboard with me and Owner M that they needed to go with a dedicated server…hooray.

So, I spec out an inexpensive Lenovo server box, with 1TB of RAID storage and Server 2008R2 with 10 CALs.  Plus 3 additional workstations identical to what they purchased earlier.  They have no issues, they order the stuff, stuff delivers.  All is well.

Over a weekend, I get the server in and set up, move the data, etc… no problems at all, backups are running, and the only machine with any shares at all is the 2k8 box.  Sweet.

Owner P also requested a second monitor since User L has two (hooked up her old non-HDMI monitor to the VGA port).  So, there was an extra monitor in there for Owner P since she needs to feel special (P has her new 1080p monitor set to 1024x768 resolution BTW).

Monday evening, Owner P starts texting me like crazy while I'm at the gym:

&gt; 'WHERE'D THE QUICKBOOKS DATA GO!'

&gt; 'HOW COME THE QUICKBOOKS ISNT IN MY DOCUMENTS'

&gt; 'I MOVED THE QUICKBOOKS FROM THE P DRIVE TO MY DOCUMENTS'

&gt; 'I CAN'T LOG IN TO QUICKBOOKS, IT SAYS IT CANT FIND THE FILE'

&gt; 'YOU SCREWED EVERYTHING UP WITH THIS SERVER, I WANT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS'

&gt; 'I CAN'T SEE MY QUICK BOOKS SCREEN THROUGH GO TO MY PC'

At the same time User L emails me:

&gt; 'P f----d up the quickbooks somehow. Can you un-f--k it when you get a minute.  Also the vendor excel sheet is gone, I think she f----d that up too.'

I come home, and prepare to VNC in to un-f--k the f--k up before dinner.

Turns out that Owner P did in fact move the QB data file and Vendor Excel file to her My Documents, and her Desktop…several times.  I proceeded to undo the mess and put the files in the right place, so User L and everyone else is working just fine.

As I'm wrapping up, Owner P apparently GoToMyPC's into her machine and sees I've done work.  She proceeds to call my phone, and that's when the sparks flew:

&gt; P: OH THANK GOD YOU'VE ANSWERED!  Things are REALLY SCREWED UP!

&gt; Me:  Well, yes they would be since you moved the data file off the server where it belongs.  You can't go moving the data file.

&gt; P:  But it needs to be on MY PC! I'M IN CHARGE, so it should be ON MY PC!

&gt; Me:  That's not how it works anymore.  We have gone to a dedicated server now…any and all shared data needs to be on the server.

&gt; P:  That's not how I want it!

&gt; Me:  Well, that's how it is now.  Your PC doesn't have any shared folders, as it should, so nobody else in the office can see the data on your computer.  Anything that needs to be shared must be on the P drive, anything you don't want shared should go in your Documents folder. 

&gt; P:  THAT'S SO STUPID!  I SHOULD BE THE MASTER COMPUTER!  MY COMPUTER SHOULD SHARE EVERYTHING!

&gt; Me;  No.  You just spent X dollars on a server which does all that now for you, just like Quickbooks and I recommended.  You can't share with all the office PC's using just your computer, remember?

&gt; P: THAT'S BULLS--T!  BUT FINE!  I GIVE UP!  DID YOU FIX THE THING?! AND WHY CAN'T I SEE MY QUICKBOOKS ON GO TO MY PC?!

&gt; Me:  Well, it's unfortunate you don't like it this way, but it's the way it has to be.  As far as your GoToMyPC access, it would appear that you have Quickbooks running on your second monitor.  Did you switch monitors in GoToMyPC?

&gt; P:  Switch monitors?  What the hell is that?

&gt; Me:  You should be able to control what monitor you're looking at when using GoToMyPC.  I'm not sure what the control would look like, I don't use GoToMyPC.

&gt; P:  FINE!  SO HOW DID YOU FIX THE MESS?!

&gt; Me:  I put the Quickbooks file and Vendor Excel file back in the appropriate locations on the P drive.  Now everyone can access them, and User L is already in the system remotely from home without any issues.

&gt; P:  How come I always have so many problems with Quickbooks?!

&gt; Me:  Well, once everything is set up properly and the files are in the right place, you're the only one that has problems, P.  L, M, and S never have problems…and every time you report a problem it's due to you not opening the right file or something else that is only on your end.

&gt; P:  ARE YOU SAYING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING?

&gt; Me:  No, I'm merely stating my observations from current and prior experiences.  I believe you guys are hiring a new person that's a Quickbooks expert, correct?

&gt; P:  YES, BUT I'M VERY COMPUTER SAVVY, I'M A QUICKBOOKS EXPERT!  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU'RE THE IDIOT THAT SCREWS EVERYTHING UP!

&gt; &lt;&lt; and here is where I lost it and rage mode ensued.  I could have cared less about the job at this point.   I just unloaded, full LBJ treatment style here. &gt;&gt;

&gt; Me:  P, how old are you??

&gt; P:  I'm 68.

&gt; Me:  OKAY, P.  I'm going to be direct here, so just shut up and listen.  What you just said is not the case at all.  YOU ARE the one that doesn't know what you're talking about!  YOU ARE the one that screws everything up!

YOU don't understand how a network works, YOU don't understand how data is supposed to be shared in an organization, and MOST OF ALL…YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW ACCOUNTING WORKS!!!  YOU are the cause of ALL the problems in your business, because YOU sabotage the employees there that DO know what they're doing.  HOW DARE YOU call me an IDIOT when I am the one that is CONSTANTLY fixing your screw ups!

&gt; P:  &lt;stammering&gt; uhhh…uhhh…uhhh…

&gt; Me:  Quite frankly P, you are without a doubt the most INCOMPETENT, IGNORANT user I've dealt with in the last TEN YEARS.  YOU have NO business being in a QuickBooks file, and really YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING ON A COMPUTER TO BEGIN WITH.  YOU just told me ""you give up""…well that's what YOU NEED TO DO.  GIVE UP…RETIRE…GO ENJOY YOUR LIFE AND YOUR GRANDKIDS AND WHATEVER ELSE MAKES YOU HAPPY!  JUST FOR F--KS SAKE, STAY AWAY FROM A COMPUTER AND LET YOUR PEOPLE DO THE WORK FOR YOU!

&gt; P:  &lt;sobbing&gt;  uhhhh…ok…

&gt; Me:  Now, have yourself a lovely evening. I'm going to go eat now.

&gt; P:  Bye.

At this point, I figured I was done with the company.  She'd fly into a rage at Owner M and demand they bring someone else in.  I could have cared less.  However, ten minutes later Owner M calls me…

&gt; M:  What did you say to P?

&gt; Me:  She said I was an idiot and didn't know what I was doing, so I laid down the ugly truth to her.

&gt; M:  Whatever it was, you rocked her world.  She told me she wasn't going to be in the rest of the week and was crying up a storm.

&gt; Me:  Good.

&gt; M:  Indeed.  Thank you for everything.


Owner M told me that a couple days later Owner P let her know she was throwing in the towel and finally retiring 'to spend more time with family'.  She came in and cleaned out her office that Friday.  Owner M is beyond grateful to me, as she had been trying to get P to retire for over a year and P wouldn't budge.

Holy shit, that didn't look right. I bring over my coworker who notices that the computer name has the same initials as the company that the old IT guy was currently working for. We look at his IP and bingo, reverse dns shows he is connecting from his old work place.

Reset his password and displayed this message on his session

THIS IS AN UNAUTHORISED CONNECTION, YOUR IP _._._._ HAS BEEN LINKED TO YOUR DOMAIN __.COM.AU AND LEGAL ACTION WILL FOLLOW

Knowing his session wasn't idle I let that sit for a nice 5 seconds so he could marinate in panic and fear then disconnected his session.

Logged in and opened Outlook and he had EVERYONES mailbox connected to his with full permissions, we checked his sent items nothing .. I hit ""recover deleted items"" and hey presto, 6 months worth of emails he has been forwarding to himself OR forwarding to a women in the office who we discover he is having an affair with ! He is feeding her information from her coworkers and she was using that to her advantage.

He had forwarded other emails that I had written to the CEO assuring him the old IT guy was not logging in remotely and he had added 

""Haha these guys are fucking idiots, they have no idea. Cancelled another backup last night, do you think they will figure it out ? Morons.""

I could not believe what I was reading. I simply can not include all of the incredible things we discovered and the evidence we collected, it was the most exciting IT work I have ever done in my life. It was filled with justice and epic wins.

**Epilogue**

The CEO decided to get lawyers involved, I provided them with every scrap of data I could find and they put together this intimidating 200 page document that included itemised lists of connection times, showing he basically logged in every day while working at his new job and tampered with the system. It stated they would sue him and have him charged if he did not capitulate with the terms of the agreement.

That document was delivered to him personally, at his desk at 9am of a work day and at exactly the same time the exact same document was delivered to his boss at 9am. He was escorted out of the building at 9.20am.


Edit: Epilogue, not prologue

***Edit II: Answering some questions here***

**What happened to the girl?**

The CEO decided to review her work and discovered that she had been doing some sabotage as well, not putting in sales orders in from people she didn't like, deleting messages and saying they were never recieved and in one more serious incident she edited someones timesheet resulting in lost overtime. She had to pay the back money owed and lost her job, they could have taken legal action but my understanding was it was not a large amount.

**What where the terms and conditions?**

I wasn't privy to all the details but my client did let me know that he had to attend several depositions in which he had to answer in great detail everything he had done, surrender hard drives and other equipment that he had mentioned he had stolen and there was some kind of financial component to it as well where he had to pay costs of causing all of these issues, I think it was in the thousands, not a huge amount but for a guy without a job it was. There was some provision about not working in IT, I am not sure how legally that works but I believe he had to stay away from IT for 5 or 10 years.


**You aren't an IT detective, you're a big phony!!**

Yes, when taking on a new client all password should be rotated and the entire system should be reviewed. Unfortunately I had been working for the company for two weeks, they took on the client six months ago. I later determined that several factors went into why the system review wasn't done, time and cost constraints but mainly laziness. My coworkers had already ""looked into it"" and concluded that he ""wasn't logging in"" and told me a full password rotation was done (later I discovered it was ONLY for real peoples accounts, not service accounts). When I was given management of the client (account manager, not IT helpdesk guy) the CEO gave me a the full story and I began looking into it. 

It should also be said that my job role was account manager, I met with clients and discussed the performance of our helpdesk, their IT agreement and projects - I was not meant to do troubleshooting, that was apparently for the helpdesk tier 1-3. The jobs that came through to the helpdesk (backups cancelled, account lockouts) were treated by them as isolated issues and did not investigate further than that. All of this coalesced into a situation where everyone in my company was telling me its fine and my client is just paranoid. I didn't accept that, and found what I found. Did I use any advanced techniques ? No. The guy was sloppy as shit and anyone who is worth half their salt could have found it. I am sharing this story because it's interesting, not because I think I am a detective.


**What other evidence did you find?**

He was a prolific user of Lync and his chat logs were all stored in his user profile, he would chat throughout the day with the woman in the office and have some of the most cringe worthy interactions that were just disturbing to read. They had flashes of red hot anger, swearing at each other like two drunks at a pub followed by pathetic apologies and disgusting make up flirting. Constant bitching about others in the office. I found that this woman would contact HIM to fix IT issues, it explained why she was so hostile towards me when I met her in person. Several incidents where he was attempting to ""fix"" something, our helpdesk was also looking at the same issue and this inflamed the problems. 

He had accidentally saved some passwords to websites in his browser cache like facebook, web management site of his personal domain, some other weird forums. Couldn't do anything with these of course but it was hilarious clicking on his history and it loading straight into these sites, the audacity and gall of this guy thinking he would never get caught yet taking no steps to hide his activity. 

The most disturbing of all though was the M Night Shyamalan twist when I discovered that the old IT guy was very close to one of the owners and they had remained in contact after he was let go. He had convinced the owner that letting him go was a mistake and to watch how many problems would occur without him. He also claimed to be logging in to ""check on things"" and ""make sure backups run, that kind of thing"" (quotes from emails he wrote). He was sabotaging the system while pretending to fix things, saying that if he wasn't logging in things would be so much worse. The owner believed every word and met with him on several occasions to discuss how to deal with the situation.  The CEO was furious upon this discovery and went to the other owners who decided to use this opportunity to push him out of the business.

Satielreks,243,482,1km7n4,1531,"This is a quick tale of tech support. A customer called in claiming that there were viruses on her computer. This is the phone conversation ending in my complete loss of faith in humanity.


Customer: I'm not sure what happened, my computer says there are 6000 viruses, I get lots of popups, it locks up all the time.

Me: Alright ma'am. Can you describe to me what you were working on before all of this started?

Customer: I was checking my email and there was a message from J.P. Morgan Chase bank. It said my bank account was put on hold. It told me to click on a link in order to reactivate my account.

Me: Do you have a J.P. Morgan Chase bank account?

wkw427,475,381,19v29r,1524,"About a year or so ago I was in charge of doing a windows xp to 7 migration for a fairly large compay.

This company is quite old, and that said, there were quite a few older people who were running it, especially higher up.

When I get around to doing one of the CEO's computers.. I was in for it. He must have been between 70 and 90 years old. He looked like a goblin. A short, bald, goblin. No. He looked like Gollum. But was taller, and whiter, and had big, thick glasses with round black rims.

This particular man had two computers in his office. The work one, which wasn't all that old running XP, and some ancient monstor from before the dawn of time. It was a grey box pentium 2 with a whopping 32mb of memory.. Running windows 98. Not windows 98 SE, windows 98. And it was dead. Almost as dead as he should have been.

He asks me if I can make his brand new computer look like his old one. 

Being one of the CEOs, I was told to jump through hoops, bend over backwards, and invent division by null if he so requested it. And so I went about the quest to make windows 7 look and sound like windows 98.

I take his ancient Time Lord device and try to turn it on initally. 

The power supply doesn't work, so I swap it out with a 8 year old newer one from a 14 year old PC, and it boots to dos. 

I dont' know very much about dos. I ask the old guy and he asks me to show him. Be punches in some crazy string of characters and juju witchcraft and windows begins to boot.

What?

How did this statue .. KNOW to do this?! Is he a timelord?!

Anyway, he provides me with all the necessary passwords to get into the computer and I begin my decent into the depths of the unknown. I found... The system has one of those Microsoft Themes installed; four of them. Space, Fish, DaVinci, and.. SimCity. What?!?

It is no simple matter to just copy the theme files over from 98 to 7. The computer doesn't have a USB port, no ethernet port, and none of the computers that we have currently running have IDE connectors, and even if they did, I wouldn't be able to turn off the system to access them (As I found one legacy server we have runs PCDOS and has had zero downtime in the past four years.. )

So, how do I get the files off? I have two options. Take the hard drive home and risk losing my job and get sued for insider trading with 15 year old stock information, or ..... The old guy reccomended I hook up a modem via parallel and install AOL. 

So I find an AOL version that works under 98, burn it to CD wait it doesn't have a CD drive. The company doesn't have an IDE CD drive, and I'm not bringing mine. 

So I go about download AOL for windows 98

I put winrar on a floppy

I rar up the CD and put it on a floppy about two dozen times

I extract it

I instal AOL on the machine, hey, it sees the modem!

I try to find a phone wire... oh, hey, why don't I use that fax machine in the office that nobody uses! SCORE!

WAIT WHY AM I USING DIALUP INTERNET IF I CAN JUST PUT THEM ON A FLOPPY

Seriously, that is what I did until I realized.. ugh

So I put them on a floppy, and I put the floppy onto another PC, and then onto a USB, and then onto a windows 7 machine! yay!

But some things don't work right. So I spent the better part of the week fine-tuning all four of the themes. Copied over all of the wavs, tweaked window colors, the works. The old guy did say he wanted all four of the themes, afterall.


When everything is said and done, I present the Pc which I now consider a work of art to the the CEO, and he asks if I can put it in the old white box his old PC was..

They are both ATX, so I don't see why not. I do that, and for added measure, I add one of his clicky IDE disks into it for clicky, and present him a PC that looks like it was made in the mid-90s, running windows 7. 

The man was THRILLED. Not only because he has his childhood computer running, but because it sounds, and looks like it used to. 

Aside from the thanks and praises he gave me for going out of my way to do this (I'd have done it regardless, he is a CEO), he gives me a $250 gift card to a pretty fancy resturant in town and tells my manager to give me the next Friday off, *with pay*. 

Good god. I never felt so good. I got a day of pay, a gift card, *and* a new simcity 200 theme for my computer that I never knew existed.






And due to popular demand, here is the theme!

Me: Thanks for calling ISP this is Baelfur speaking, how can I help you today?  

Mama: Yeah i have been speaking with you stupid M*%&amp;#$ F*#*$@# for the past 7 hours trying to get my S@*$ hooked up and none of you idiots can seem to figure it out.  

Me: okay ma'am can I please get your (insert verification requirements)  

Mama: (swears for 4 minutes about verifying information before providing)  

Me: Thanks Mama, now from notes I see that you are trying to connect a few tablets, an Xbox and a Laptop is that correct?  

Mama: I don't know what the f*#( this all is, its all my mans S*%&amp; and he told me to call you idiots to get it hooked up, You all Suck by the way.

Mama: I've told you F&amp;$*%#S it's this thing hanging on the wall with all the blinky lights,  

Me: Okay, thank you for verifying that, now can you see if the little 1-4 are lit up so I know if you have any devices plugged in over Ethernet?  

Mama: All the stupid numbers are lit up A*$( hole  

Me: Thanks for checking that, so 1, 2, 3 and 4 are lit up, so you have 4 devices plugged in, are any of those computers available?  

Mama: there aint nothin plugged in to it A&amp;$ hole, unless you want me to rip it off the wall and look at the back  

Me: So there are no Ethernet cords or power cords plugged into it that you can see...  

Mama: Didn't I just tell you that idiot?  

Me: but the little 1, 2, 3 and 4 lights are lit up...

Me: so there are numbers 0 through 9 on the router, they are lit up , the router is mounted on the wall, and there are no cables that you can see....

Mama: Yeah, why you sayin i gotta press these and get tha Police to come fix my internet?!?!?!

*My head is in my hands, staring woefully down at my keyboard. Also at this point mama starts scream/ crying and cussing and she either tossed the phone down and walked away or threw it across the room... Either way she became background noise. But then, I hear a childs voice getting closer

Kimmy: Yes mister, I use it to play games and sometimes for homework! I'm only in the 3rd grade though, so not 
so much for homework  

Me: Okay lets see if we can find your router...  

The rest of the interaction with Kimmy was just as adorable. Basically I walked this ranting lunatics 8 year old daughter through hard wiring to the router, logging into the GUI, resetting the password and WiFi name, and  getting the Xbox, both tablets and the laptop connected.

Anyhow, the epicness of our meeting shall be revealed. Going to give more info than originally intended because you'll see:

*2:40pm and 4 of us are outside one of our meeting rooms waiting for Mr. Boss. Myself, Derp, Receptionist and Receptionists husband (henceforth known as Foreversad)*

Mr. Boss: Come in, take a seat.

*Awkard shuffle to the table, sit down. We are all nervous as Mr.Boss is kind of intimidating in formal situations. After reading a few papers readily prepared for him, meeting commences.*

Mr.Boss: It has been brought to my attention that there has been some breach, or attempted breach, of confidentiality in this office -

Receptionist: Sir, no there - 

Mr.Boss: - and further reports of harassment and lies being spread throughout the workplace -

Receptionist: - no, that's not true, I just -

Mr.Boss: - and countless.... Will you please stop interrupting me, receptionist? It would do you good to listen.

Receptionist: Sorry....

Mr.Boss: Derp has spoken to me about an incident which occured earlier today regarding 'File permissions', could you please explain X.

X: Uhm, sure. The short story is that I was asked by receptionist to provide access to her husbands payroll file via sharepoint. I refused to do so, and explained why, and she got irritated and told me to just 'do my job', which in my opinion is what I was trying to do.

Foreversad: Really. C'mon Receptionist, I show you my slip every month.

Receptionist: No that is not true, X is just making that up to make me look bad.

Derp: So this conversation never happened?

Receptionist: No, it didn't. 

Derp: And even though I was there speaking to you two about it together, you are saying it didn't happen?

Receptionist: No, well, sort of. I thought it was a different file.

X: But I *told* you what the file was and why you couldn't access it, and you told me to do it anyway.

*Awkard silence.*

Receptionist: I only wanted to see what was in there because -

Mr. Boss: That's it, I've heard enough. You know why we hired you, right? Because your husband is a solid worker, and I personally thought you would put as much effort into your work as he -

Receptionist: I'm sorry, i just have issues with - 

Mr.Boss: - DO NOT TALK WHILE I AM SPEAKING! YOU HAVE CAUSED NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN IN THIS WORKPLACE! I have had countless incident slips and complaints regarding your conduct in this office and you have pushed your limits. Foreversad, is there anything you would like to say?

Foreversad: No.... I've just had enough of her and this bullshit that goes on... sorry, we will speak at home. I sincerely apologise for these issues.

Derp: It will not reflect on you at -

Mr. Boss: It won't reflect on you at all, Foreversad, you haven done nothing but good while you have been here.

*I'm starting to feel a little bad at this point*.

Mr. Boss: Receptionist, is it true you told Susan (random name) her granddaughter should have had an abortion?

Reception: Well.... she was only 17, i mean -

Mr.Boss: - I have never been as ashamed of having a person with that attitude working in my office. X, how would you suggest we resolve this issue with the privacy and such on the computer networks just in case?

X: Well, she only really needs office 2010 for emails and word, maybe excel. She doesn't even need to be hooked up to the net -

Receptionist: - But internet!
*Boss just gives her the death stare.*

X: Technically, we can give her a netstick, that will give her internet access and no network access, which is not needed.

Mr.Boss: Perfect. Set this up as soon as this meeting is concluded.

X: Sure, no problem.

Mr.Boss: Do you want an apology from Receptionist?

X: No thanks. I don't really want to speak with her if I can avoid it.

Mr.Boss: I understand. Receptionist, X will do what he does with your computer and you will live with it. It won't be for long, I'm opening advertisements for your position this afternoon. You will continue working for us for two weeks, and will train any person we hire for your position if we find a suitable candidate within this two week period. You will receive a further 4 week severance payment (actually quite generous) and will be paid your holiday time accrued in full. If you provoke or upset a single worker under my employment, whether it be by opening your mouth unwanted or by farting in their presence, you will be escorted from the building. Do I make myself clear?

Receptionist - but... no... wait... but... sorry *sobbing*

Foreversad: Crystal clear, sir.

Mr.Boss: And for the record, X, your outburst towards Receptionist was inappropriate and unwarranted. I understand you were provoked, and your job is strenuous, but please keep your temper under control. If it happens again to Receptionist, you will recieve a formal warning (I have 0 of 3). Understand?

X: I do, my apologies.

Derp: It will only be for a couple of weeks, avoid the people you don't want to speak to. *Whilst staring at Receptionist*.

Mr.Boss: X and Derp, you may leave.

Derp and I in unison: Thanks.

*As we are about 5 feet away from the door, closed and made of hardwood, Derp starts talking about how he is finally glad that she will be gone when we hear:*

Receptionist: FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, I KNOW YOU FUCKED SHERYLL AND I KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T GIVE ME YOUR PASSWORD. YOU'VE BEEN BUYING HER SHIT FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS! THAT'S WHY YOU WON'T SHOW ME YOUR PAYCHECK!

Foreversad: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, WOMAN? I can't believe you just accused me of that IN MY WORKPLACE, and are stupid enough to think that my outside purchases WOULD APPEAR ON MY FUCKING PAYSLIP!

*At this point I just ran away from the door, just about pissing myself laughing while Derp was just standing in awe. I felt bad about what had happened to her in a sense, but my god is she one loopy bitch.*

What made her comment all the more sweeter about Sheryll* (fake name) is that Sheryll is Derps fiancee. From what I understand, Receptionist was escorted from the building by security (i am still working on her laptop tomorrow as i have no 'official' word otherwise) and Foreversad has been given some time of for 'Family matters'.

I don't know if i should feel sadness, win or epic fuck yeah about this, but one thing I do know is this: That loopy bitch had to go, and I'm gonna love my job *that* much more. 

Any questions? I feel like i've missed so much of the event in this post, it's a 'you had to be there' type thing IMO.

ed-adams,247,389,1gs8dm,1508,"A few years back I used to work for a computer repairs company and I was the one receiving calls and assigning techs to jobs. One of the things I learned early on in the job was to ask customers exactly what the fuck ""Nothing works"" means, generally by asking them to boot up their machine and talk me through what they're seeing. This was because ""Nothing works"" most times means ""This software I'm trying to use doesn't work the way I want it to"".

One morning I got this call:

**Guy**: My Mac won't work.

**Me**: Ok sir, what do you mean?

**Guy**: What do you think I mean? I turn it on and nothing happens!

**Me**: Can you please go to your computer and turn it on? Walk me through what you're seeing or what's happening exactly.

While I was documenting the incident my trainer was there watching me making sure I did everything right. I was typing in ""BSOD on startup"" when I was stopped.

Trainer: "" you can't put that in""

me: ""What do you mean? It was a BSOD.""

Trainer: ""I know but you have to use BLSC""

me: ""ok, thats kinda odd. is BSOD used for something else""

Trainer: ""No thats not the case. Even though BSOD is a standard industry term, some manager over at the west cost was offended at the words 'of death'. So it became company policy to use the term BLSC.""

Me: ""you are kidding me""

Trainer: ""no, i agree its the dumbest fucking thing ever""

zombiekodi,399,526,1hqyoo,1495,"It was slow last night, post 4th partying or something. Most of the calls were simple.. ""We're doing server updates, your internet will be up by morning."" That kind of stuff. Then I got this one call... this impatient, incorrigible man. He had an attitude from the get go. 

After getting what minimal information he would give me, I tried to get his OS from him, just in case. He refused. Wanted a supervisor BECAUSE I asked for it, so I dropped it.

Turns out he can't get online. Ok, he's not in the area with the updates. Damn it. Run a scan, no issues with our network. Shit. This is going to suck. 

So I start asking him what his symptoms are. He can't ping out, or get to the router. Ok. Let's see..there's no Ethernet connection according to the router information I can pull. I verify it's plugged in to both ends, then ask him to do a loopback for me. He grudgingly complies, huffing the whole time and complaining ""It's not my computer!"" Well..both LAN ports light up, and flash. I tell him that shows us the router AND Ethernet cables are working, and at this time I NEED to know his OS, because we need to check something. 

He throws a fit, tells me I'm being rude and I have a shitty attitude, but complies a little more. (I can say right now, I was being as nice as humanly possible to him since he was being so rude... kill them with kindness, right?)

I have him check his device manager. He won't give me any information. 
I ask him to run ipconfig. Won't give me anything.
I am trying to explain what we're trying to accomplish, and he asks (screams) for a tech. I tell him, sure, but I need to get approval for one to come out from a supervisor and he needs to accept possible charges because we're unable to finish troubleshooting and if it's not our equipment causing the issue (router, ONT) then there's a possible charge ""quote price""..

Aaand he flips out, tells me I have no idea what I'm doing, he needs someone else who doesn't have an attitude and is a... male...

Ahhh.. that's his issue. I have a vagina. Well I tell him I'm just as qualified to help him as anyone else here, if not more (tenure and past positions)  and I'm sorry I can't transfer you to anyone else. So he wants a male supervisor. Not an issue, because the only overnight female supervisor is on vacation. BUT, my friend, who I went through training with, is a supervisor on duty tonight and he loves these kind of calls.

He takes my headset. Repeats everything I did, step by step. He makes the guy reset his router just because, then hey.. it's still not working and no I'm not sending a tech unless we're sure it's our equipment. He gets to where I left off, and has the guy do an ipconfig release and renew. 

Hmm. What do you know...it's working.

My friend says ""It *was* your computer.""

The guy apologized to my friend for giving him a hard time, but refused to acknowledge I had been on the right track.

phlogiston,182,454,uaqs1,1497,"I asked an old coworker if he remembered any good stories from our time as small network admins so I could share with Reddit.  He said ""Remember that time you came back to the shop bleeding and muddy and said you didn't want to talk about it?  It's time to talk about it.""
 
It began innocently enough.  I received a call from one of the sales team about a new client who needed an initial assessment of their network and PCs.  This was a new(ish) Japanese restaurant in a declining part of town.  This restaurant was the only business still afloat in a much larger building that once held a movie theater and some sort of shipping warehouse.  I walked in, introduced myself to the nice Korean couple who owned the place, and got to it. 
 
As I got down to business I was informed all the previous tech work was done by the next door neighbor's son.  I took this to mean ""We're used to paying $10 and a plate of chicken and rice for tech support.""  I was not surprised to find a lot of work to do, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The first complaint was the point of sale machine.  It was unusually slow even considering the lackluster hardware.  I could not bring it down as they were still checking out the last of the lunch ""rush"".  So I brought up msconfig and decided to see what I could disable and turn off.  I remember going to the startup tab and thinking ""wow, what a bunch of crap!""  Scrolling down... ""Holy Cow!!!""  Scrolling down... OK, we're turning everything off and instead looking for what needs to be turned back on.  After this it was working better but still needed some deep cleaning or a reformat.  For some reason the internet was still dodgy. 
 
I pulled up a command prompt and did a continuous ping to Google.com and let that run for a few minutes.  When I came back I found high latency and lost of lost packets.  No big deal, we'll try to reboot the router and modem and see if that helps.  So I asked what I considered a simple question ""Where is your router and modem?""  to which I received in answer a puzzled smile.  They were not sure what I was talking about as they had only recently moved from dial up.  OK, time to switch gears.  ""Who is your ISP?""  No idea.  ""Who do you pay for internet access?""  Nobody.  Apparently they used to pay for internet access, but the teenager set them up with free internet.  Big Red Flag was raised.  This just got slightly interesting. 
 
I tried following the network cable but it disappeared into a hole in the floor.  Similar story in the back office with the accounting machine.  So I tried to log into the router and at least get an idea of what I was looking for.  I encountered the DD-WRT password prompt.  That's cool.  I prefer Tomato myself, but we've got a tinkerer.  A tinkerer who thinks it's a good idea to change the default password for LAN access (why???).  I point out the network cable to the owner and ask him if he knows where it goes.  As he looked at me the room grew dark and foreboding.  It got noticeably colder.  ""The crawlspace.  I'm not sure what that cable goes, but he took a whole box of cable into the crawlspace and then we had internet.""  ""OK, can I call him?"" I asked.  ""No, he's gone off to college.  That's why we hired you."" 
 
A second later I'm standing in front of an open trap door in the floor behind the stock room, shining my flashlight into a dark void.  There is a dirt floor and it smells.  An old stepladder is there, but I don't trust it and just jump in with tools and laptop case in hand.  My first thought was surprise at how big it was.  My flashlight didn't reach the far two walls.  It was a forest of concrete footings and steel supports.  There was a lot of power conduit and water pipes to duck under, but for the most part you had about 6 feet to stand up.  It stunk like death and decay.  I found the two network cables and an extension cord and start off on my trek. 
 
Do you remember the Aliens movie (I forget which one) where the guy is following candles in the dark hallways and there are monsters stalking him.  This is what it felt like.  I tell myself that it can't be that far because extension cords are only so long.  At the end of the cord is another plugged into it, then another plugged into that one.  OK, well at least they can't run Cat5 cable longer than 300 feet.  It's quiet and stinks worse all the time.  I keep thinking I hear something or multiple somethings moving around.  Eventually I see green LEDs ahead of me and find a small network switch.  The two network cables from the PCs plug into the switch which is powered by the extension cord, and another cable continues onwards.  My only hope of a 300 feet max was dashed. 
 
I had always thought I was the type to keep a cool head in an emergency.  I didn't think I was the type to panic.  Well, I learned something new about myself a few score feet beyond that switch.  As I continued to recall every scary movie I had ever seen I shone my light ahead and saw two glowing yellow eyes looking back perhaps 30 feet away.  A chill ran up my spine and the hairs on my arms stood up.  Something in my head snapped and an ancient, primal part of me took over.  For reasons I still don't understand I hunched over and screamed into the silent darkness ""AN ALLIGATOR!!!""  And just like that it became real in my mind.  A 20 foot alligator with long teeth faced me.  Like a pudgy uncoordinated ninja I grabbed my screwdrivers, punch tool, and wire crimp and threw them at the eyes.  And then I ran, screaming like a little girl.  I must have hit my head in my disgraceful retreat because I ended up with a small cut and blood in my hair. 
 
I got back to the stepladder and found THEY HAD CLOSED THE DOOR!  What kind of monster would close somebody into a pit of alligators like that?  I threw it open and jumped out in a single leap.  I found myself face to face with the waitress who screamed.  I screamed back at her.  The owner rushed in and looked me over with great concern.  I managed to compose myself and said ""She startled me.  I think I bumped my head, may I use your restroom?""  I splashed cold water in my face and was ashamed of myself.  An alligator?  Really?  Here where we have more snow days than warm ones?  It was likely a stray cat and I might have just killed it. 
 
So I am back in the hole retracing my steps.  I keep telling myself I'm not afraid, but I still wish I had my 22 target pistol in hand.  I get to the switch and then beyond it my tools scattered over a large area.  The slot head screwdriver had blood on it, which frankly amazed me that I actually hit the poor creature in my panic.  So with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other I continued my search for that modem. 
 
At the far wall I found the router.  Standard Linksys blue box zip tied to something holding it up.  And nothing else, no modem.  How in the heck were they getting internet?  I plugged in and tried again to guess the password without luck.  Then, remembering some of the features of DD-WRT, I checked for open wireless signals of which there were two from establishments on the other side of the road.  So my best guess is the teenager had bridged the router to one of those open wireless connections and thus provided free internet for the restaurant.  I power cycled the device (which didn't help at all) and went back. 
 
I must have been a sight.  The owner quickly agreed with my suggestions and promised to call the local cable company come install their own internet tomorrow.  I was ushered out the back door without even a glass of water.  We kept that contract, but the restaurant owner requested a different tech be assigned as he was not sure about me.  I did not complain.  Imagining he must have heard me screaming and crying under his restaurant and then screaming at his cute waitress, I really didn't want to face him again.",So with the bloody screwdriver in one hand and a flashlight in the other I continued my search for that modem.,1951

I decided that I'd shoot off a quick email to the users involved, hoping that they might at least pay attention to me if only because of the fact that the email would come from a university address.

GetOffMyLawn_,218,419,1hecd6,1466,"Back in the days of Big Iron a modest sized computer was the size of 2 refrigerators, the expansion cabinet was another 2 refrigerators and each disk in the farm was the size of a small washing machine. They were large and there were a lot of parts, lots and lots of parts. Boards and cables and more cables and all sorts of bits and pieces. Here is a [pic]( http://www.museumwaalsdorp.nl/computer/images/6410.jpg) for your viewing pleasure. 
 
The IT department, and back then the term IT had not been coined, it was the Computer department, bought one of these modest sized monsters. Now this was a major purchase and had to approved by several people, including the Vice President of engineering, better known as “the mad Dutchman”. Now Dutch was the type of guy who added value to the organization by cutting costs, as opposed to generating new revenue. He was a bean counter extraordinaire. This purchase was no exception.
 
When purchasing one of these monsters the manufacturer would send you a quote listing out all the components and the price of each component. Dutch carefully perused many pages of the quote and started crossing out items he considered non-critical, such as, the console terminal and keyboard, hey we can reuse one in house, right?  And he crossed out cables to connect the CPU cabinet to the peripherals cabinet, cables to connect the peripherals cabinet to the disk drives, cables to connect everything else together. I mean, they’re just cables, we can have our hardware techs make our own cables right? Of course we can, we’re engineers, we can do anything. And wow, look, I saved $4000 on a $300,000 order. I am a financial genius!
 
So without having the Computer department do one final check on the items being ordered, and really, why would you have technical people review technical decisions made by a guy who isn’t technical, the order goes out. And the manufacturer ships the equipment exactly as specified on the hacked up quote. And the equipment arrives and is placed in the computer room. And field service comes on site to do the installation.
 
But then field service starts asking questions, like where are the data cables for the disk drives? Where are the bus cables from the CPU to the peripherals? On and on, all these pesky little missing cables. Proprietary-only-made-by-the-manufacturer cables. Someone investigates and discovers Dutch’s dastardly deed. OK, so everything will be delayed for another month or two while a new purchase order gets generated and approved to order the cables. Or so they think.
 
You see, these cables are not normally sold separately, they are sold as part of a package, a package that includes a $300,000 computer. There are no ordering numbers for these cables. There is no way to tell manufacturing, hey, just send us a few parts. No one can figure out how to sell us these parts and just these parts. (And no, doing a mirror of the quote with all the delivered parts crossed out isn't going to work). 

So the computer sat in the computer room, unpowered, for 6 months while this snafu was unsnarled. If we look at this in terms of engineering man hours lost: 6 months is 26 weeks, one week is 40 hours, there were about 25 engineers who were going to use the machine, and figure that back then one engineering man hour was worth about $50. So about $1,300,000 lost man hours. Plus a $300,000 paperweight. 

Maybe I should have called this ""Cables? We don't need no stinking cables.""

AsthmaticNinja,134,395,1fjpgj,1461,"This isn't strictly a tech support story, but I figured it would be enjoyed here.

First. a small bit of backstory.  I am a regular member at my local hackerspace, where we keep a rather large supply of pc parts (most of them fairly dated). About 3 months before the story, I picked up an old WD1200 to use on my Pi until I could get my 1TB drive back from Western Digital (Amazing customer support, by the way).  Due to various reasons (Yay AP tests!), I didn't even look at it for a few months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was working on setting up raspBMC on my Pi, so I could use it to store movies and TV shows from my DVD collection.  Once I had the software up and running, I realized I needed something to use as storage.  That's when I remembered I had the drive tucked deep into the Narnia that is my desk drawer.  I plugged it into my home PC to figure out what filesystem it was using so I could re-format it.  That's when I saw the files.  The drive was nearly full.  Out of idle curiosity, I dug around a little bit in some of the folders.  The previous owner left a MASSIVE amount of personal info on the drive.  There was insurance info, tax data, addresses, even bank account info.  

I figured that since this drive was left at my workshop, it must belong to a member/previous member.  So I began searching our forums and wiki for the names I found on the drive.  I found nothing.  I couldn't find ANY info on the internet about this person.  

After a few days, I started looking again on the drive for more info. This time around, I found some chat logs (and based on the date, I assumed they were IRC logs).  With nothing more than a few nicks and channel names, I set off to search the internet again.  I tried every IRC network I could think of.  I trawled the internet and searched every IRC network that had those channels.  I found nothing.

Finally after a week, I was ready to give up and just wipe the drive.  I decided to give it one more try.  Finally I found him.  He'd thankfully (for me) been using the same IRC nick for almost 15 YEARS (most of the logs were dated late 90's early 00's).

Here's a chat log (I've changed the names and whatnot, obviously).

Canopyflyer,205,395,1h76w3,1455,"This happened around 2001.  

The company I worked for was a vendor for large corporations.  I worked on a team that provided server administration for one particular customer.  It was the policy of the customer (and probably every other) than when file servers ran out of space, we were to delete all audio/video media file types. 

We usually had few angry phone calls come our way, when we cleared space.  One particular incident got so heated and just down right nasty, that the customer's senior VP of IT gave us his mobile number afterwards and told us to escalate these calls directly to him. 

As it turned out, I received the very next irate phone call of someone looking for his missing MP3 collection. The guy on the phone was beyond deranged, he was barely coherent his rage was so great. 

I popped up the VP's phone, put the user on hold and called him up, informed him of the situation.  He had me to conference him in to the phone call.

Which I did.

The second I got back on the line with the end user, he flew into another rage that was even worse than before.  

The VP sat silent, when suddenly the raging end user stopped and stated an instant message popped up on his screen and it was more important than me.  Then I heard the customer's hold music come on. 

The VP stated: ""He got an IM from me, hang on just a second Canopyflyer, sorry for wasting your time."" I just replied that I was here for as long as he needed me. 

At that moment I really needed a large bag of popcorn. 

Screw that, I wanted the biggest bag of popcorn in the history of humankind. 

The end user came back on.  The VP then proceeded with one of the best, even toned, dress downs I have ever heard.  

The end user was sobbing 30 seconds into it. 

I received an apology and then the call ended. 

About two weeks later I traveled to the customer's headquarters, along with 2 of my coworkers.  This was a normal trip, we usually visited once a quarter during normal times, or much more than that during roll outs and projects. 

The VP took us out to dinner.  While there he handed me a name plate, the type that you put on an office door.  

It had the user's name and (former) title on it.

Cust: so you're saying its all just a mighty coincidence! Convenient that.

Me: Well could I get you to go and have a look at the fax machine and read out what it says on the display..

biohazard13,182,556,1pydyt,1448,"This is a personal story, stemming from my brilliant Aunt who is a want to be technical genius. First, some background:


My cousin (19 yrs old) and her have the same cell phone, the GS2. They are up for contract renewal at the end of December/beginning of January, so they will be getting new phones at that point. 


Now the story:

Aunt sits down beside me: Biohazard, can you **BELIEVE** that cousin has used up 75% of his data already?!?

Me: Okay, so what? I use around that amount. It resets on a monthly basis, so don't worry too much as your new billing date is today.

Aunt: NO! That's not how my plan works!! I have X amount of data (she couldn't remember how much) for the entire 2 year duration of my plan!! Can you believe he managed to use 75% of it?! I've never used that much and I'm always on Facebook and Twitter!!!!

Me: No, that's not how they set up plans, and if that's how yours is you've been screwed. Check your phone bill next month, and you'll likely see everything is fine.

Her: Well, whatever, this is stupid. I can't wait to get us new phones in a couple of months so this doesn't happen again!

Me: Um, this could happen again on your new phone (GS4)... It works the same on the data plan that your current phone does.

Her: NO! Because then he'll have more space on his phone and we won't reach 75% again!

At this point I ask to see my cousins phone, navigate into the phones storage settings and see that he's reached 80% of his internal capacity.  My aunt is still convinced she's going to get charged overages.


**TL;DR - Not-so-technical aunt thinks my cousin has used 75% of his data, he's used 80% of his internal storage**

Zehnpae,227,390,1pk90e,1442,"One thing many people don’t realize is just how layered and interbred internet services can be when it comes to selling and reselling.  

One of my many illustrious career paths was a network operations position for a managed services company.  Our clients were typically technical clients in and of themselves, usually these hosts and resellers for small/medium businesses.  

Over time due to acquirements, trades and resales that I was the NOC admin (IE: Tech support guy) for one company we’ll call “Carpenters Bargain Internet” who rebought some of its services from another company called “Jimmy’s Premium Networks” who we also happened to be the NOC for.  And then one day we were hired on as the NOC for “Big Lawyers on Wallstreet office” who happened to be getting their internet from….Carpenters Bargain Internet.

This would have been fine until one day the moons aligned and I get a call from Big Laywers on Wallstreet because their internet wass down.  Now as part of my job description I had to call Big Lawyers ISP, who was again Carpenters Bargain Internet…who was me.  So I did the only logical thing.

I talked to myself. 

I asked myself why the internet was down.  I told myself that we weren’t certain yet but we’d investigate.  Our technicians would looking into it and then get back to them.

Of course ‘our techicians’ was me.  And by looking into it I meant that I’d ask myself why my services weren’t working for my client.  Now, as a technician for Big Carpenters Internet it was my duty to look into the problem.  I checked into who we got our lines from for Big Lawyers on Wallstreet and wouldn’t you know it, we got them from Jimmy’s Premium Networks.  I did the only sane thing anybody would do.  I sent an email to Jimmy’s Premium Networks asking why the internet wasn’t working.

I waited about 20 seconds for the email to come to myself and then explained to myself that I was just made aware of the issue and would get back to myself once I knew more.  I then called myself at Big Lawyers on Wallstreet to tell myself that we were investigating and would email myself when I got an update.  I then contacted the owner of Big Lawyers on Wallstreet and told him that I didn’t have an update yet but expected one soon.

I had to keep doing this for about 3 days, keeping track of every ‘imaginary’ phone call and leaving an email trail between different mailboxes that I all monitored.  The most bizarre was when Big Lawyers asked me to demand an explanation for the outage.  Nothing quite like writing yourself a stern email and informing your boss that you’re very disappointed in your own lack of communication with yourself.

In the end it turned out some crazy farmer in Virginia cut through a fiber line by accident but then buried the line back up and wouldn’t let the authorities on his property to fix it.

I do know these things. 

I did not dig the hole. 

You do not want to be in the hole.

I have a ladder. 

If you do not LIKE this ladder, I cannot help that. 

It's not my ladder personally, so no offense taken.

If you want, I can try and find another ladder. 

But it will take time, if you don't want this particular ladder. 

It makes little difference to me.

I'm not the one in the hole. 

I'd like to help you out of the hole.

DorkJedi,230,307,11iab4,1424,"I supported remote sites, including drilling rigs. One of them called and stated ""The network goes out every day at exactly the same time! It comes back after about an hour.""

The rigs get all their connectivity from a self-aiming satellite dish on a trailer. All their IT stuff is contained on that trailer for portability and ease of use by technophobic roughnecks.

This seems odd, but he called at 2:30 so I troubleshoot a few things and watch his connection. At 2:45 exactly, it went offline. No warning, nothing. Just gone. The phone is VOIP, so I lose him too.

An hour later he calls back, and everything tests perfectly. he assures me that they do not lose power, all his boxes have the right flashy lights. I ask him to call back tomorrow, I want to see it again and prepare tests. He does, and all tests show it offline and at his end.  A cell call from the drilling manager verifies that the site is dead, and it is ""Always down"".

So I load up the company pickup with tools and spare parts and start the long trek out to the drilling site. I time it to arrive at 2pm and give me time to test, check, and try to find the culprit while still observe the outage if nothing turns up.

It is all good, everything is in perfect condition. Then, promptly at 2:45pm, as he does every day, the drilling manager pulls up and parks his pickup right in front of the satellite dish.",The Daily Outage at exactly 2:45pm,1731
Pavix,418,386,1knoij,1422,"So a couple years ago a local business was turned to me to acquire a server on the advice of a local consultant. When I asked the office manager why they didn't go with the consultant for the work he said that he felt like the price was inflated and he declined. Fair enough, I suppose. So I asked him what the consultant recommended and was handed the sheet. Apparently this office was using local accounts on WinXP for authentication, no backups and no network filer, they used simple file sharing to share files in the office. UGH. So the consultant recommended a server for AD, running SBS 2008 with 20 CALs so they had room to grow and it had Volume shadow copy so if something got deleted it could be recovered easily. 



The owner was also recommended to buy tapes for backup, but he nixed this idea saying he didn't want to have to deal with tapes....wat? Whatever, he wants to take it in the pooper once his drives fail, that's on him. Then he hands me a sheet of paper with his requirements. I found this odd since he is not technically capable of using his computer much less dictating hardware requirements. But lets see what he has...

2 quad core xeons
32GB RAM
3TB SATA drive with no RAID

ummm, wat?



So I first ask him if he'd rather use RAID in case of drive failures, nope. Ok then what about the machine, are you planning on running virtual machines? Hosting your own email internally? Running a busy SQL server? Nope, nope, and nope. huh. Ok, So I tell him that for his purposes a single quad core xeon would be more than enough with 8GB of RAM. Nope, he is adament that it has to be that exact specs. 


I ask him if he got those specs from the consultant? Nope, but I know that's what we need. Your money, guy. So I go out and spec the server with the SBS 2008 license and CALs, print it out with an invoice for $BucketsO'Money. Understandably he flips his shit. 



Manager: So why is this so expensive?


**Pavix:** There's an itemization on there, indicating the price of everything. I wouldn't be able to cut the price in half, but I'd be able to reduce the cost by $metric-shitton if we went with a single xeon solution with 8GB of RAM which is more than enough for what you're using it for


**Manager:** No, it has to be the exact specs I stated


**Pavix:** If you don't mind me asking, who gave you those specs? It seems like someone at least a little familiar with IT work since the specifically referenced Xeons, SATA etc. 


**Manager:** Look, I don't know what you're getting at. We've already hired a consultant, just do your damn job!


I would like to point out that this is typically where I'd NOPE! right out but I wanted the money so whatever. I got the manager to approve the budget, ordered the kit and left. I get a call a week and a half later saying the order is there and asking if I could drop by to get it setup. Sure. 


So I get there, toss in my earphones and start building the server. Get it racked, plug in monitor, mouse and keyboard and begin the SBS install. As I'm about to grab another refill of water and hit the can, the manager comes in with some kid that's about 17 or 18. 



**Manager:** Hey Pavix, this is Jeremy


**Pavix:** Hey Jeremy, what's up?


**Jeremy:** Nothin' I'm just coming to help.


**Pavix:** Help with what?


**Manager:** Well, Jeremy has got software he needs to install on the server once the server is up.


**Pavix:** What software? If it's licensed and was installed from the old server I can do the migration for you once I find the media.


**Manager:** This is something only Jeremy can do. Just let him know once you're done.



Hmmm...dafuq? Whatever, I don't have time for this crap. So I go around getting the names of all the employees, Get AD setup, create accounts with default passwords for everyone and go around joining their computer to the domain. There's a few squabblers of how the ""New system is slower"" and ""Why did we have to change if the old system worked"" Worked, huh? If by worked you mean no way to remotely manage accounts easily, no way to easily apply security permissions, no easy way to reset a password if you forgot yours....oh, well of course you will have to use a password to get in. 


So after everyone is logged into their domain accounts and the computers are on the domain I set about setting up shared network folders when Jeremy comes into the closet.


**Jeremy:** Are you almost done?


**Pavix:** Umm, in a bit. What did you need?


**Jeremy:** Well, I wanted to get this software setup.


**Pavix:** What software?


**Jeremy:** BF3 dedicated server


**Pavix:** Umm, what? Are you the one that gave the manager the server specs?


**Jeremy:** Yea, I went on a forum and asked this group what server stuff they had so I could get it too and host my own server


I walk into the manager's office and explain what was just told to me. He told me that it wasn't my responsiblity and to finish the install. So I go back, get shares setup to match what was preexisting, setup OU's, added the users with correct levels, had users reboot and test. Copied all the files over after configuring VSS. I goto the manager and explain that it's done, but that I won't be offering any support to this network in the future if he's going to let his kid host a BF3 server on the domain controller. 


After about 15 minutes of yelling, saying I'm unprofessional and how he knows more about IT than me and that a BF3 server won't affect the server or it's security he begrudgingly cut me a check for my hours. 


His number is now on my verizon block list because fuck that. 



[edit] Wow! Front page, thank you so much :)

**UPDATE** Yesterday since this was a somewhat popular post I decided to reach out to the consultant who referred the customer to me and ask if he ever heard from them again. Of course he has, where else was the customer going to go, Geeksquad? Anyway, I know this post is getting long in the tooth and if this should be a new posting feel free to let me know mods. First thing's first, it was MW3 not BF3 he was hosting off this new server. My apologies for the confusion, I've never setup a server for either so I wasn't aware of the restrictions Origin/EA has for servers. 

So after I left Jeremy tried downloading his shiny new server software, if what I'm being told is correct it's run through Steam?, but anyone that has logged into a Windows server with an administrative account knows that IE runs in ""Hardened mode"" to protect novice Admins from doing something stupid. But Jeremy wouldn't be thwarted by some geek engineers from MS, oh no! He went back to the forums asking how to get the software on his machine, and the internet being incredibly helpful, suggested he download Firefox on another machine, put the installer on a flash drive and plug it into the server. So there was Jeremy with an unrestricted browser downloading whatever he wanted. Oh boy! 

And I know what you're going to ask...""But what about his firewall? Wouldn't that block him?"" I'm glad you asked. When the network was setup, the contractor was quite adament about using private 192.168 IP ranges, but the ladies didn't want to have to deal with pesky VPN to RDP into their machines, and couldn't be bothered to change ports that corrispond to each of the workstations. Nope, instead every machine in the office has public routable IP addresses. This of course includes their network printer and the server. Oh joy. And they don't restrict inbound or outbound traffic in any way. 


After a week network shares were unavailable, Jeremy stopped all services that the helpful gamer forum didn't recognize....they're gamers so they should know all things IT, right?....which included volume shadow copy service so backups weren't being done. Oh and the ladies, or Jeremy, found some way to enable C$ shares on all workstations so after Jeremy started to get the ""Scary"" FBI virus warnings on his machine the entire office got it as well. This is a Real Estate office so HIPPA doesn't apply but i'm sure there are some legalities. So my friend got called in to quote a price to fix it. He said he wouldn't ""Fix"" it except to nuke and pave all workstations, all servers and that he wouldn't hand over Administrative credentials until a paid IT staffer contacted him. They politely declined. I'm guessing the manager tried my phone, was told there are ""Call restrictions in place"" and moved on. Either way, I have securely NOPED my way out of this.

773-998-1110,162,412,1bidvw,1414,"A small bit of background, I work as the IS Manager for a small company with about six branches and under 100 employees.  About a week ago we had an issue where one of our SCSI HDD's burned out in our mail server.  It was RAID 5 so I replaced it and let it rebuild, but I began to closely monitor the server in case anything odd began to happen.  I say this because I normally don't monitor our mail logs all that closely otherwise unless people are having problems.

Our company employs a team of third shift workers to pull product for trucks that depart in the morning.  Most of these employees have been with the company for over ten years and are mostly all over the age of fifty.  They're all good guys, just not the most tech savvy which is fine.  They're also unmonitored all night, for the most part.  We also don't run any content filtering software, so all websites are open for browsing.  Our CEO's thoughts are that if we hire someone we expect them to be adult enough to know when it's appropriate to browse websites for personal use and when not to, and what sites are appropriate to begin with...which is okay for people who legitimately aren't going to download the worst viruses imaginable on accident but I digress. 

One employee in particular, we'll call him Stew, doesn't like *not* being savvy and every morning he'll wander over to my desk with a plethora of questions that I'm more than happy to answer for him.  They're usually things about which phone he should look at buying or how to do something with the computer he had never done before so it's nice to just shoot the shit before getting on with my day.  

Well, a few days ago Stew walks over to my desk and begins asking me some questions about Craigslist.  His issue was that when he, ""clicks on an email address on Craigslist to email someone it opens a bunch of options that I have no idea what to do with.""  I think on it for a second, and then figure it's probably because the computers in the warehouse have no default email client, they all use web based email because so many people share the computers out there.  So I tell him that if he just copies and pastes the email address that will work, *or* **he can just type it by hand**.  Which is what I believe he did because...

...The next morning I walk into work and begin searching through email logs.  We have a queue of bad emails that couldn't be delivered for one reason or another and more often than not it's because someone sent an email to the wrong address by mistyping a letter or some such thing.  So was the trouble with poor Stew.  You see, as I found out that morning Stew was using Craigslist at work to solicit sex from people creating FWB posts.  There was a message from Stew stuck in the Bad Message queue to ""whoever@cragslist.org"" instead of craigslist.org and it had been rejected.  Both the subject and message were there in all of their glory describing, in detail, what this 55 year old man wanted to do to this supposedly 22 year old busty blonde college girl.

I lost it and absolutely could not stop laughing.  I legitimately felt bad more than anything else.  I wasn't going to tell his boss or call him out on it because he needs his job but it was obviously not appropriate so before he left that morning I met him in the warehouse.  I pulled him off to the side and let him know that, regarding his question yesterday, I'd appreciate it he not use his work email for Craigslist if that's what he planned on doing as sometimes it results in increased spam for the company.  It's only been a day now and I haven't seen another email go out but I just absolutely had to tell someone because I really don't have a team at work and I don't think anyone else could appreciate it as much as you guys.",You will find nothing for you at cragslist.org,1826

First, I had to get the original ones back into shape, since they'd pretty much been run into the ground.

That's where I've been lately, btw.

Anyway, last night this batshit crazy woman came in (I'd had a few run-ins with her before) claiming that I was obligated to give her the ""Windows Anytime Upgrade"" license key.

Huh? 

I showed her that ""Windows Anytime Upgrade"" wasn't specifically a *version* of Windows, but a program through which someone could upgrade their version of Windows from Home to Professional or Ultimate.

She didn't believe me and kept repeating that she'd spent an hour on the phone with Microsoft and that they'd told her she'd have to talk to the people who'd sold her the system.

I kept telling her that there wasn't an ""Anytime Upgrade"" version of windows so finally she navigated to the Properties screen, pointed triumphantly at the Windows Edition and the copyright notice underneath and said accusingly, ""You didn't even sell me a current version! This one is from 2009 and I bought the computer in 2012!""

""Ma'am, that's the copyright notice. There is no specific 2009 version of Windows 7. It's constantly updating.""

""ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME THE WINDOWS ANYTIME KEY OR NOT?!?!?!!""

It was at this time that I finally lost it. My employees were shaking with laughter, tears streaming down their faces, trying to hold it in and failing.

""Ma'am, I can't give you a key to SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST!""

She glared at me, took out antiseptic wipes, cleaned everything I'd touched, grabbed her computer, and left. 

I can't wait to see her again. Apparently she'd been causing the employees hell for over a year and the ones that were left (that I didn't fire, actually -- it was a massacre) hated her and have really enjoyed seeing me interact with her.

Good times.

PolloMagnifico,293,486,1qguwv,1404,"**Now, a short disclaimer. This information went through two technical people before coming to me, so I may have gotten some bad information.**

At my previous job, I was responsible for managing a large number of laptops out in the field. Basically they would come in, I would re-image them, and send them back out as needed. Sadly, the guy I replaced was bad at managing his images. So we had four laptop models, and all the images were in terrible condition. Half the laptops would come back because for some reason something didn't work right.

So I set about re-doing the images, and got two of the four models re-imaged. The field supervisors thought I was the greatest thing ever, and told me their emergencies had been cut in half in the short time I had been working there. They were sleeping better, there was less downtime, and I had gotten everything so efficient I was able to re-image any number of computers that came in and get them back out the same day.

Well, something important to note was that they had a multi-install key for Microsoft Office. They refused to give me the key. And one of our images that I hadn't gotten to fixing *didn't have the right key*.

Well, we had to send out this laptop, and had no extras to send in its place. Originally it was going out in a month, but the next day it got bumped up to ""the end of the week"" and later that day to ""in two hours"". I needed the key, the head of IT wouldn't get back to me, so I used a tool (PCAudit) to pull the registry information and obtain the corporate key.

jon6,182,532,1agon8,1403,"I'll say it - anytime I've retold this story, I don't think anyone has ever believed it - I have to be honest, I wouldn't either. However, me and at least two other people in the world know this to be absolutely true. 

I was doing a contract for a major national public sector organisation. Obviously no names, but if you've ever been to London, you've been a customer. It was your standard high staff turnover, pay em till they get bored, throw them the BS tasks kind of role. Anyway, one day, myself and another contractor were set the task of a machine hunt. Basically the network was a hodge-podge of bolted on spokes using various standards, practically held together with poor soldering and bits of gaffa tape. However, there were a list of umpteen Windows 9x machines which were apparently alive on the user subnets which needed reimaging to XP or replacing. Our job was to do the pre-project hunt to determine who was using them and where they were. I say pre-project, it wasn't exactly ""thought out""... it was some task that appeared from the ether which would most likely be re-filed into the ether. This is the same organisation who only a few months prior saw a £70,000 shipment from Dell literally get delivered outside their offices, which nobody retrieved or was aware even being ordered and over the course of the next 24 hours were promptly retrieved by members of the public! Yep, it got left there overnight and there were only docking stations left! Good use of public money, eh?

Anyway, we hunted down an old Compaq on our list. Serial matched, IP matched, now to talk to the user. The user was a guy who wore a grey suit, impeccably turned out but who looked like he was about to wet himself with fear. He asked us several times who we were, what we wanted, what for, where was this information going, etc. After placating him as much as possible that it was just an upgrade programme and we were IT Support, he finally relinquished his name.

It just so happened, another machine we were hunting for was right next to his desk; our decision to wait around for this user to return was overshadowed by his worried glances... after a few minutes of uncomfortable ""I'm pretending to not acknowledge you"" silence, we went away aiming to return later - ideally when he had disappeared.

A few days later, the same contractor and I were out on a pub lunch. The guy happens to come in and immediately notices us. He's weird, really weird. He walks quickly to the back of the pub, hovers, glances at us and then makes for the door. Of course now we're talking about him, like WTF!? He makes an about turn at the door and comes up to us; he nervously asks ""Are you definitely just IT support?"" We reply and say yep, and he just immediately leaves with an ""OK thank you"".

Of course we're weirded out, but whatever. We just put him down as a fruitloop.

Again another few days later, we're out on a smoke break, this guy appears again seemingly on a smoke break too. His eyes are wide as soon as he notices us, but as he's already lit his cigarette, he kinda has to come out now. We're wary of him, this guy is a fruitcake. He tries to make small talk; it seems to me he's probing, so I just come out and talk about what we do all day, pretending to moan about our menial duties.

Anyway, it turns out after a few more chance encounters he kinda settles down and starts talking - mainly about F1 racing, etc. He shows up again on a friday afternoon drink, this time with his wife in tow. It turns out that he has every right to have been nervous.

This guy was initially hired as part of a major projects team in the organisation. He applied for a role, got accepted, gave in notice at his old job and duly showed up for work as prescribed. However, as it turns out, in between getting confirmed for his role and actually starting, the entire major projects department had gotten nuked. The manager who hired him had left the business, members of the team were scattered far and wide, yet he showed up, some receptionist showed him to his desk where he was to wait for someone and nobody showed up. He made enquiries, all he ever got told was that someone would come talk to him eventually - but nobody ever did. 

For the last 11 years, he had shown up for work. Nobody ever hassles him, nobody ever asks him for anything, sometimes he just doesn't show up and nobody questions it, he gets paid every month, gets a statutory annual pay rise and that's it. He's been filling his time writing books for the past 8 years on this that and the other, and that is literally what he does every day. As the physical office he's in also has a high staff turnover, there's no time to make relationships or for anyone to even really acknowledge him.

Of course, he was slightly inebriated at that point. I just thought he was plain outright nuts permenantly resident in psychos-ville. I didn't believe a word of it. It's too hollywood to be true!

That was until the Monday morning, we had to check. Sure enough, HR systems showed his dept had indeed been nuked mere days after he was recruited and his active manager on the HR system had indeed long since left the business. Everything we did to verify his story checked out. We even performed a few random drop-ins and, sure enough, there he is with Word opened and he's tapping out page 370  for a novel. He never seems to do anything. Of course, he's back to being nervous again as he let his guard down while drunk and told someone. Even his wife at the time seemed to corroborate his tale.

I left the contract a couple of months later, but as far as I know, he's still there. I still even questioned the reality of such a situation. However...

On my first day of that role, I duly asked where IT was. I was told to go with a massive group of people to induction. I passed three checkpoints where security guards asked my name and, though I wasn't on their list, let me through with an ""OK must be a mess up"". One even said ""Who's your manager?"" to which I replied ""I have no idea, I've only just arrived."" He too allowed me through. What I went into was an entire day's induction for permenant staff. A lot of sensitive stuff got said, a lot of activities went on - nothing catastrophically major, don't get me wrong - but there we have it. On leaving and switching my phone back on, I had several voicemails from my recruiter demanding to know my whereabouts. I told him I'd been in induction which surprised him. It took me another 30 minutes to track down WHICH IT department I was even supposed to be in, and even a day later got told I was still in the wrong place while I was arms-deep into laying some network cable!

dropthehandle,303,429,15x2rk,1398,"This morning as I was walking into work one of the owners of the IT company I work for pulled me aside before I even had a chance to power up my laptop, surf reddit or have any coffee-

A little back story on this client.  They came to us as a referral and had just recently lost their IT guy.  They needed some equipment set up ASAP so they hired us.  The CEO of the company is one of those guys in power that likes to swing his title around like a large male member because well he is just kind of a dick like that.

On to the rest of the story-

Bossman-  Hey, COMPANY is happy with the work you did and would like to use us for future work but there is one sticking point.

Me-  What is the point you guys are stuck on?

Bossman- The client will not move forward unless we give him your direct (personal) cell number.

It should be said now that we DO NOT provide 24/7 support.  We do have an on call rotation, but we stop responding to calls at 10pm.  We also have a policy that states we do not give out our cell numbers to clients (too easy for things to fall through the cracks).

Me- ABSOLUTELY NOT.  I have met COMPANY CEO and you will not give him my personal cell phone number unless you are prepared to give me a SIGNIFICANT raise.

Bossman-  Well he really wouldn't have a need to call you that often and it would not be after hours.

Me- I will respectfully disagree with you.  I will do whatever I can to help this company succeed, with that said in my experience once you give a client your personal cell number they will abuse the privilege of having it and will call at all hours.  Like I said before, unless you are willing to give me a large raise you will not give him my number.

Bossman- *stunned silence*

tl:dr Blunt response shakes up bossman's sales pitch.

**Update**

Thanks everyone for the upvotes and comments!  Front Page!
  
I came in to work this morning, and bossman pulled me aside and apologized for the conversation yesterday, and said I was more valuable to him and the company than taking on that client.  Felt good to hear 

**Update two**

Because people have asked. It has been clarified that we will not be doing business with CEO and my bosses have backed up my decision to not give out my cell number and I did get lunch.  It was a good end to the week!

CitizenTed,140,302,vejfe,1378,"
About six years ago I was providing product support for a well-known manufacturer of Pro AV products. We had joined with our parent company for a big booth at the NAMM show. At the show, a bunch of famous rockers popped in and showed interest in our solid-state recording devices. It was a good show, we did well and went home. 

A few months later, the main phone rings and the receptionist calls to tell me ""Ted, it's Stevie Wonder for you on Line 4."" Yeah, right...so I pick up Line 4 - and it's Stevie Wonder!

Me: Pro AV Corp. This is Ted. Can I help you? 

SW: Hi, Ted. How you doin'?

Me: Pretty good...um...Mr. Wonder? 

SW: HA HA! Just call me Stevie, man. 

Me: OK, cool. What can I do for you, Stevie? 

SW: Well, I got your new recorder. I keep it by my bed. When I get ideas, I just sing 'em into that thing. I always get good ideas when I'm falling asleep. 

Me: Totally. Me too. 

SW: Yeah, man. Well, I got these for my friends, too. We love these recorders. But the thing is, you see, I need to set the record settings right. I got the transport, but I need to know if I've set everything to, like, a clean slate so I know where I am. 

It's at this point where I remembered that Stevie is blind. His recorder has a small screen and umpteen zillion possible adjustments and settings. 

Me: I got ya. So what we need to do is get you to factory reset, then get you to your preferred settings if something messes up your settings. 

SW: Right, man. So tell me now: get me to factory reset. 

I walked him through which buttons to press and how many clicks of the dial to get to the reset, etc. I'm all prepared to walk him through the process over and over until he gets it. There was no need. I explained it once, and he GOT IT. 

SW: OK, man. Top right, MENU. Click down twice, ENTER. Click down four times, ENTER and CONFIRM. 

Me: Um, yeah. You got it! So what Record setting do you want? 

SW: Just 192K MP3. Is that the default? 

Me: Nope. The default is 16/44 WAV. We need to set the Record setup for MP3. 

Once again, I tell him the buttons and clicks ONE TIME and Stevie has it wired in his mind. He repeats it back to me. 

SW: Got it, man. 

Me: Stevie, I gotta say you're pretty much the fastest learner I've talked to on the phone. You can call me any time, with any questions. 

SW: Ted man, you were great. Tell you what, if you're ever in LA, you look me up. Seriously. Here's my number xxx-xxx-xxxx. You call me, my people will figure it out, man. 

Me: It's been a pleasure, Stevie. If I'm in LA, I'll call you up. 

SW: Sure thing, man. You take care now...

And that was it. Stevie Wonder was whip-smart, totally casual and a pleasure to work with. And he actually gave me his number! I never did call him because I never went back to LA for anything. Would he have actually visited with me? I dunno. But just spending 20 minutes talking to a client who wasn't a belligerent, clueless jackass was wonderful.

Boss: ""Could you possibly have a look at my PC while I'm out - I've been having issues with the second screen being intermittent"".

Me: ""Sure I'll get right on it"".

I went in to look at the PC after he had left and found the cable/DVI adaptor at the back was loose. Plugged it in, tested it was working OK and left thinking I had fixed the problem.

My boss returned a few hours later.

Boss: ""Have you had a chance to look at my second monitor? It's not turning on at all now"".

Me: *thinking WTF*

Me: ""Yeh, I checked it before; the cable was loose. Let me take another look"".

I walked into his office to find the VGA/DVI adaptor had now come completely unplugged. I thought someone was playing a cruel practical joke on me, I plugged it in and let my boss know and chalked it down to me now securing it properly in the first place.

All was fine for a couple of hours. I was in his room having a quick 5 minute meeting with him. I was stood about five feet away from him facing his desk while he was sat down.

It was at this point I heard a scraping across the floor. I scanned downwards to see where the noise was coming from. Our office tortoise* was making his way across to my boss's PC. He arrived and started climbing up the back of my boss's PC, knocking the VGA/DVI converter out in the process. The little bugger was trying to nestle where the grill was emanating hot air.

I laughed so hard that I nearly ended up crying. Thwarted by a tortoise. When I finally calmed down enough from my hysterics with my boss sat there looking at me like I'd gone mad I told him to come to the other side of the desk as I'd found the cause of his monitor issues. I saw the look of realisation kick in because at this point the tortoise had managed to get himself tangled in the cables at the back of the PC.

ePants,205,413,1dqh8g,1362,"Edit: Holy cow, guys. I wasn't sure how well this one would be received because as /u/Sapiophile23 [pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1dqh8g/a_high_school_network_unreal_tournament_and/), I wasn't *technically* providing tech support, but I couldn't help but hope others would enjoy a story about my juvenile network exploits. I couldn't have imaged it would get this kind of response. I guess we all have something to bond over when it comes to circumventing school network restrictions :) Some of you have some pretty impressive stories, and I'm glad I posted -  I've loved reading all the different workarounds everyone came up with. 

/u/Coolbrys recent story, [Mischievous Computing](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1dl4hd/mischievous_computing/), about his creative victory against students gaming on school computers brought back an old memory from my own days in school. Forewarning, though:  In this story I am the admin's adversary. 

Just prior to the turn of the century, I was in high school. My junior and senior years I took one computer class each year; one which turned out to be the same class I'd taken my freshman year but had its name changed, and one which turned out to be little more than a keyboarding class. This resulted in a lot of free time sitting at a computer. 

##Freedom, Trust, &amp;amp; Pickles##

My junior year, in the class that had its name changed, there were three other kids who had already had the class as well. The teacher put us together and pretty much told us we could do whatever we wanted, provided that we could pass the quizzes to show we'd retained the material. We could work on whatever side projects we came up with as long as it didn't disturb anyone. The teacher knew us and our ""elite skills"" well, so her trust was not *entirely* naive. 

Throughout the year we did various projects to keep ourselves busy and present to the class occasionally ""to prove we weren't wasting time."" It also served to make us into a sort of peer-role model, which made other students actually pay attention the the basics after seeing what kind of advanced stuff we churned out. The most popular project used VBA to script the Microsoft Agents with custom dialogue so that when we gave a presentation we could have a simulated conversation with Clippy, but our personal favorite was a very compact messenger/chat executable that would allow us to text to/from any computer on the network. 

However, even with the freedom to make our own projects, boredom inevitably set in. As we began to waste increasing amounts of time playing Unreal Tournament (which we had installed on several computers), we were also getting frequently called to various other classrooms and computer labs throughout the high school to act as tech support. Our teacher was a little passive aggressive, so rather than tell us to stop wasting time gaming, any time she saw us playing she'd send us to help a teacher somewhere with a basic computer problem - word of our abilities spread quickly among the faculty. 

We addressed all the typical problems: Monitor power ≠ computer power, logins don't work with caps lock on, system volume doesn't matter if the speakers are turned off, etc. Despite the trivial nature of most of our highly-praised ""repairs,"" on many occasions we had teachers volunteer their passwords. As if this weren't enough of a security breach, apparently each lab teacher had the admin password. It seems that the original network admin had done a web search for ""most common school network passwords,"" found a top ten list, and *picked the number one most common password* at the time: ""**pickle**.""

##Absolute Power Corrupts... Sometimes##

We deliberated for many days on whether this was useful to us, and for what purposes it could be employed. As we weighed our options, we reconnoitered the network thoroughly. We had access to just about everything. We could remotely login to *any computer on the network*. We could use that remote connection to subsequently connect to *other computers*. We could access the main office's *attendance records*. We could even access the **grade books** and even the *backups* of the grade books. We also determined that by remotely connecting prior to accessing any documents, we could make any changes we wanted, and could cause the ""last saved by"" field to reflect *the name of* **any** *teacher with an account on the network*.

What did we do with all this power? Well, since none of us were at all nefarious (and because we knew we'd be the primary suspects if anything went awry), we actually opted to do *absolutely nothing* with this knowledge. Aside from continuing to play Unreal Tournament in our down time, the rest of that year was entirely, believe it or not, shenanigan-free. 

The following year, however, was a little more interesting. 

##A New Year##

Over the summer a new IT company had been hired, but aside from new registers in the cafeteria and a new naming convention for all accounts and terminals, not much had changed. It amused me when I confirmed that I could still access everything. 

Although most computer labs had been completely re-imaged, I was able to find a backup I'd stored in a subdirectory on the assistant principle's computer (1st world anarchy, *amiright*?), and I quickly distributed the game across the entire network. All in all, there were about 5 or 6 labs, with 20-30 computers each, so we had some pretty epic games going towards the end of each period as everyone finished their work, with as many as 90 players in a single free for all deathwatch. Those were glorious days. 

The teachers actually didn't seem to mind. They saw it as incentive for us to finish our lab assignments quickly. After a few weeks, though, our copies of the game began disappearing from the lab computers. No notices from an admin; no new anti-gaming policies from the school - the files just started disappearing. Teachers even started asking why we weren't playing anymore. 

##The Copy/Delete Battle##

At first, it was about once a week they'd disappear, and it took them a while to track down all the different computers that had the game. No big deal. Re-copy on Monday and play all week. 

Then, the cleanup started taking place daily. So, I'd just begin the copying process at the beginning of the period so by the time we finished our work it would be ready to go. When doing this, I would use a different account to do the copying, which I think kept them from figuring out who the culprit was. 

Since this was time consuming, I eventually made a .bat file that I would run from a different computer each day, using a list of all the computers in each lab (which was only possible thanks to their new standardized naming convention- something like \[schoolname].rm\[room#].computer\[#]of\[#]). 

This worked well for a while, until one day they removed the original game folder.

Crap. 

It was a long, disgruntled couple weeks before I figured out what do to next. In the meantime, I managed to find a computer that was connected to the network, but for some reason was overlooked during each wipe, and I hid a new copy of the game there for later. I don't know if the computer was even on site- the room number didn't exist anywhere at the school. Odd, but irrelevant. 

*Edit: In retrospect, there's a possibility that this nonexistent room number may have been the admin's off-site computer. lol*

##Work Smarter, Not Harder##

Remember the off-hand comment I made about new cafeteria registers I mentioned? Those could only be connected to from a couple specific computers. It took me about a week of poking around the network every day before I found them, and about another week before I realized I could use them. 

I have no idea why they were on the same network, but the were. I also have no idea why the register's daily transaction upload .bat files could be accessed so easily, but they were.

After some manual trial and error, I copied the game folder and .bat file to all the registers' completely unused (and apparently completely un-monitored) backup drives. Then, after backing up the originals, I added a new last line to each register's daily .bat file, which called and ran my own .bat file, so the game would propagate across the network every night at midnight - every time the registers updated their transaction logs. The best past is that every day it would randomly choose a different teacher's account to be the one doing all the copying. 

##Expect The Worst##

Given that I expected to be caught, I actually fully documented the file, commenting each line very thoroughly. In the event it was found, I wanted it to be immediately clear I hadn't done anything as harmful as what the network setup would have allowed me to do. The closing bit read something like:

&gt;None of this would have been possible if the admin password wasn't freely given to students. Or if the password changed from year to year. Or if multiple remote access didn't mask the executing terminal. Or if the registers were not on the same network. (Seriously. Had I been malicious and not so bent on gaming, I could have changed the cafeteria price list and/or deleted all transaction data). 

##The Prestige##

Every day, every single lab computer on the network received a fresh copy of Unreal Tournament and most students had no idea that it was disappearing and reappearing every day. They only thought that whoever had been deleting the files had given up. 

We continued our daily gaming sessions and even though my classmates had started to suspect I'd had something to do with it, most kept quiet. The only ones who had the gall to ask me about it were the, well, the most gang-like guys in my class. One in particular had often asked me for help in the lab (he probably hadn't ever used computers before, honestly). He was actually pretty sharp, but kept up his ignorant thug persona when his friends were around. When he realized I'd been the one to ensure we could keep playing Unreal every day, he gave me props and said something about street cred. Not even kidding. I think that once he realized even a straight laced nerd like me could rebel against the system in my own way, he was more comfortable with admitting to being interested in learning. And you know what the best part was?

From that point on he always had my back in-game. 

As of my graduation the little setup was still working perfectly, and it probably continued to work until whenever they changed the name of their computers or changed the password. For some reason I doubt either happened very quickly.

She quickly finds this is a scam, and even recognizes the preferred payment system of the scam as one her son had warned her was rather untraceable and so a favorite of scammers.

Third moment of win: She finds instructions how to remove the infection...

...which has found a way into her startup settings and so appears right when she loads into Windows. And she...

Fourth moment of win: ...fixes the issue herself!

While I'd been prepared to give her some basic info, just enough to scare her into paying me to fix her computer, I ended up congratulating her and telling her she'd done precisely the same thing.

bolunez,101,287,1b4q6x,1347,"I've been working for my current employer for about eight years now. It's a large site with several buildings over a couple square miles and there's a flock local support techs with small offices scattered about. 

Not long after I started, I came to work one day to find a junky looking old desktop outside the door with a post-it labeled ""Please Fix."" No asset tag or any other way to identify it. Not being the type of person who is inclined to bother with that sort of nonsense, I stuck it on a shelf and left it there.

A year later, I moved up in the ranks to a new position in a different location. A few years went buy and I moved again. It's been over seven years since that mystery computer showed up on my doorstep.

This morning, I paid a visit to my old office to help the current occupant (who replaced the guy that replaced me) with a particularly vexing problem that had been plaguing him. There on the shelf, right where I left it was the mystery computer, complete with post-it note. The glue had dried up and it had been moved to the top of the chassis but there it sat.

After telling my fellow employee the history behind the mystery computer, we decided to turn it on and have a look. After applying power to it, no lights came on and no fans whirred.

We opened it up, to find that it had been gutted other than the motherboard and power supply to make room for what looked like they used to be brownies packaged in plastic wrap with a bow on top and a note that read ""Congratulations on your six month anniversary at FlerpyWerp International.""","""Please Fix""",1634
faultyk,517,428,1pdto3,1349,"This post is actually a cheerful one, maybe it'll brighten up your day reading it.

I have played tech support for my Nana since highschool (Completed Uni and working as an Engineer now - that has its own stories to tell). In that time she has always tried her best to understand computers, but has always struggled for a variety of reasons, the biggest of which being her severe arthritis.

Recently she was encouraged to buy a new computer (last one was running Windows Vista and had slowed down to the point where it was unusable) so her and my Pop (who rather enjoys using his laptop for checking emails and playing card games) went and bought a new HP Windows 8 machine from JB Hifi (""it was the one the young person said we should buy"").

After two days I was receiving complaints and queries about ""this new Windows 8 piece of sh*t"" computer (their words, not mine). After some troubleshooting I discovered it was a case of too much change, too quickly.

They didn't want to go back to Vista but didn't want to pay for another Windows license, so I offered to install Ubuntu on their old (now unused) Vista machine (12.04LTS for those wondering) and run them through how to use it, just as a trial - if they didn't like it we'd work out something else to make Windows 8 a little more familiar to them.

It's been 8 days since installing Ubuntu and giving them a ""how-to"" lesson for an hour (I actually enjoy teaching them computer things because they really try to learn and take in as much as possible). In that 8 days I have received 1 phone call, which was a quick call to say everything had gone well.

My Nana had figured out how to change the wallpaper, discovered how to make the on-screen font bigger, has installed her own card game applications from the software store, and has completely adjusted to Thunderbird for her emails (""The delete button was down the bottom, took me ages to find it - but I found it!"" - Nana). She's now convinced she'll never use a Windows machine again if it can be helped.

I'm not trying to start a Linux V. other OS war, nor trying to say that Ubuntu is the Linux distro for everyone. I just wanted to share my experience with an old lady who didn't take well to the adjustment to Windows 8 and has found Ubuntu to be a dream. I couldn't be more proud of her.

**TL:DR:** My old Nana hated Windows 8 so much that she decided to let me experiment Ubuntu on her. She's never planning on switching back to Windows.",My Nan tries Ubuntu,1777
FredFltStn,299,595,1qz6qm,1341,"About a year ago, the big company I work for dumped Blackberry and switched everyone over to iPhone 4s as their company phone. Since the Blackberry’s that we had previously carried were an older model with few features, most of the managers were happy with the switch.

Although the new phones were supposed to be used only for work activities, some of the people in the office went a little crazy, downloading apps and music onto the phone. The phones would sync calendars, email, and the like over the air, and didn’t need to be connected to a PC. 

Of course, many people used their desktop PC’s to charge their phone during the day, plugging the phone in while they were sitting at their desk. The iTunes app was preloaded on the desktops, and would pop up every time you plugged in the phone. No big deal, you just had to choose not to sync the phone and then close the app after it popped up.

One of the managers in my office was having an issue with a PowerPoint presentation, and asked me to help out. She’s not in I.T., and her computer skills are mediocre at best. I sat down at her desk, and went through the presentation with her, with me driving and her sitting by my side, walking me through what she wanted.

We came to a slide where she wanted to insert a photograph, so I clicked Insert/Picture from the menu.

Apparently, the manager had unknowingly downloaded all of the photos from her work iPhone to her desktop PC. More importantly, she had apparently been using the iPhone to take naked selfies, which were now gloriously displayed in extra-large icons across her 27” monitor. 

I closed the window as soon as I realized what I was looking at (ok, maybe a few seconds longer than that), and she immediately turned 10 shades of red. I blew it off like it was no big deal, saved the presentation, and told her we could work on it later. I walked back to my desk smiling from ear to ear.

I was working as a System Engineer for a company that had offices across the country. Many of the larger offices had an on-site IT Tech. Every office had a small server closet running some non-important local storage, print queues, and the like. One of the offices had a problem that was escalated to me. The onsite tech would get calls that all printing broke around 5PM every day. He'd run back to the office, and it would be working again. He asked his manager who couldn't resolve the problem either. They were stumped and escalated the ticket to me. I took a look at the local server and noticed there weren't any print queues set up. I used our remote control software to view a pc that had the problem, looked at their mapped printers, and had to laugh. The on-site tech had set up all the print queues on his laptop. Everyone at his office had all their printers mapped through him. When he left for the day (at 5PM), they couldn't print. When they called him, he'd come back, put his laptop in it's dock and boot it, then go look at the problem.

Fridgeanbu,157,474,16a71e,1342,"Hey TFTS, got an old story from my days as a student techie from my days in college.

Back in those days, most of our duties involved moving around all in one units (Laptop, Projector, Speakers on a cart) from class to class that requested them. Some units were better than others so there would be some fighting amongst professors about what units they wanted, but that's neither here nor there.

We would have our usual troubleshooting calls now and then, and I would gladly run to the class as fast as I could and fix any issue (Which would usually just be getting the projector to show what was on the laptop). Most teachers were grateful but there were a handful who would get rather indignant, and so we come to the main story.

Usual day, ahead on my deliveries I get a call from a classroom and the Professor is raging pretty hard. 

Me: ""AV, how can I help you?""

Prof: ""YOUR CART IS BROKEN, GET ME A NEW ONE!""

Me: ""Sorry to hear that, may I ask whats broken on it?""

Prof: ""EVERYTHING, THE PROJECTOR WONT WORK, THE LAPTOP JUST SHUT OFF, I CAN'T BELIEVE FOR AS MUCH AS THESE STUDENTS PAY FOR CLASSES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SUCH INFERIOR EQUIPMENT FOR US TO USE.""

Me: ""Okay, sorry again, but give me one moment and I will come look for what's wrong."" 

Prof: ""NO, YOU WILL REPLACE IT NOW OR I WILL CALL YOUR SUPERVISOR AND COMPLAIN"" -click-

I've heard all these threats before so it's nothing new. I make my way up to the classroom and peek my head in. Upon seeing me with no replacement cart she begins to sneer at me as I look over the cart to see if there is anything broken. I see nothing so my eyes begin to wander to the usual spots. Lo and behold I found the problem. 

All of the carts have a power strip that everything is plugged into and from that is a single plug that powers everything. The master plug just so happened to be on the floor, not connected to a thing. Upon making my discovery, I pick up the plug, hold it up for all to see as I take a small trip to the wall and plug it in. This leads to a small bit of laughter and a red faced professor. She muttered out a small ""Thank you"" and I just smiled and walked out.

 For the rest of my time there, anytime she had a problem she would remain calm and I would walk her through any issue.

TL;DR ""Have you tried plugging it in?""

halbasus,381,374,1mydgn,1344,"I work in a small company where besides my regular job I also fix computers, networking problem, printers, etc... 
Last week one of my female colleagues told me that her home computer was acting weird and the monitor would ""go blank with some text on it"" occasionally, one time she called me and read me the ""some text"" it was a ""no signal"" error. I told her to bring it in and I'll take a look at it, I was already suspecting a faulty GPU.

She brought in the computer, and as soon as I opened the case I noticed that the GPU's fan was disconected (it was an old AGP card), I plugged it back in, started the computer and started a hi-res youtube video to make sure it was working. Problem solved.

This is when it became interesting: ""since I already brought it here, can you install internet explorer for me ?"". I was speechless, not because she wanted to use internet explorer... but why would I need to install it ? ""oh, and could you install... how do you call that program... not Word, oh Excel, I need that too"".

klaqua,144,401,1d2tgb,1341,"A couple years ago I was called to a customer’s home since she could not make her wireless printer work. The early days of HP wireless printer issues still give me the shivers. Long story short after some work I get it going and everything is working great. When I pack up and settle the bill she shows me an external Hard Drive that she sued to backup stuff. Turns out it dropped of her desk and hasn’t worked since. I take a quick look hook it up and sure enough the drive doesn’t show.  I am upfront tell her that this is most likely a lost cause. I inform her about the cost of professional recovery and that she must REALLY want the data for that price. Data doesn’t seem that important to her but she keeps asking if there isn’t anything cheap we could do. 


Sooooo mind you this job has been over and this has been one of those “one questions real quick before you leave”. I tell her I can take it with me crack it open and see if I can read the drive on the computer I used to do data recover on. I tell her that this is a HUGE long shot and the external drive cage will be destroyed and if I do it we have to agree that I can recycle it if nothing comes of it since I didn’t want to drive that way just to bring back a bad drive on a job I don’t get paid for. She agrees I got paid and all is well.


Nothing comes of my effort to make the drive work again just I suspected and I call her to let her know. All is well…
Fast forward two month and a semi annoyed call. The printer disconnected and she can’t connect. Her husband never could and she is not happy with me. Oh and bring the drive back I took from her house… say what?! I tell her what we agreed on and that I don’t have that drive anymore… the call ends with me telling her that we can talk as adults and she can call me back when she wants to change her tone in a manner appropriate of adults talking with each other.
Fast forward about two weeks and a very angry letter, various treats and another big point about her drive and if she won’t get it back she will file charges for theft. I ignore that letter and figure if she needed to vent that is OK and I can recycle her paper too.


After about a month I answer my business phone and find myself talking with a detective from the local police department. He informs me that the lady is in his office and before he files the paperwork if we could not come to some agreement. I calmly explain the situation to him, tell him there is no more drive (never mind that I signed nothing saying I took anything) and I simply did as I was asked to do and we have a very unhappy and unreasonable customer. He chuckles a little apparently suffered under her attitude and said… “I understand, Thanks”. And that was the last I heard of it. 


Funny, looking back on it I got in trouble most when I tried to go the extra mile with customers.

Granak,376,410,136qoi,1329,"**EDIT: Wow. Did not expect this big of a response! I guess I shall have to tell the story of the baby, the angry woman and a CD burner. Same Bat time! Same Bat channel!** 

Join me now for a sordid tale of a computer repair shop deep within the heart of low-income (A kind way to say it) area within a large city. That six months spent there was fraught with peril, racism and, yes, repairing nothing but shitty Toshiba Satellite laptops and Gateway towers. This is but one of the awful memories I have of that den of horror.

Ours was a cozy little shack nestled deep within the heart of the downtown area. It was sandwiched between a head shop and what doubled as a gaming center (the sort old women with oxygen tanks and cartons of Virginia Slims to waste their Social Security checks) and occasional drug den. It was one of those dilapidated places that never had the latest hardware, only sold at MSRP or above and made me feel like I was doing a disservice to people times. Well, until they did shit like barge in toss a computer tower at my head and try to fight me and my boss!

This customer saunters in with a Gateway tower in tow. When I say ""tow"" I mean that he actually brought it in via a rusted red wagon. He felt the need to include his mouse, keyboard and a CD Stomper. (WTF?) So I, being the dutiful employee that I was, ask him what the situation is. He, instead of being a rational human being who can formulate complete sentences, yells back at me: COMPUTA' DON'T WORK.

I decided not to bother with trying to probe further, at this point, and directed him to hand over the tower and I'd take a look. He was *INSULTED* that I asked him to do that and, continuing to yell at me, said for me to ""YOU GET IT, NERD."" I wasn't really opposed to that so I hopped down from my chair, scurried around the desk and bent down to pluck his computer from the warm bosom of it's Red Flyer wagon. There was this very strange moment of tension that flared up between the customer and myself. All of it came from his end. I had, apparently, gotten a bit too close to him for comfort.

I had the tower clutched within my mitts as I moved back only to find that his rather LARGE calloused hands were not pulling the tower away from my grasp. I could not help the rather confused look that was plastered on my face at the moment, but he informed me soon enough.

""CAREFUL HOW YOU GRAB MY SHIT, DUDE. 'SIDES YOU GETTIN' ALL IN MY SPACE.""

I had not tried to do that, but I let him have the tower. I moved back behind the counter just to put some space between myself and this, clearly, angry person. ""That's fine then.."" I said as got back to my post, extending a set of friendly hands towards him. ""I'll just let you give it to me.. and I'll take a look at it.""
(This was not the first time I had dealt with this sort of customer before. Many who came in were either flat-out angry, either at their lot in life or that they had to deal with some white kid who was CLEARLY out of place in this store, and acted in such a manner.)

So, he does the only thing one naturally does in this situation. HE THROWS THE FUCKING GATEWAY TOWER AT ME. Not just in my general direction but at my head. This action was accompanied by a, ""HERE YA GO."" I managed to somehow not drop the piece of shit tower in the process despite my being nearly stunned senseless.

I placed the tower down on the counter and spoke in the most calm yet assertive tone I could. ""Sir, I cannot help you with your problem if you persist in treating me this way."" He replied with a scoff, ""FUCK JUST DO YOUR JOB, FATBOY.""

There have only been three instances in my entire life where rage just consumed me. This was one of those three. I did not attempt to sound calm. ""GET THE FUCK OUT.""

He, shocked at my retort, offered a rebuttal. ""NAH! I WANT MY COMPUTA' FIXED NOW."" I had been alone in the shop, by the way, and it was just about this time that the owner walked through the front door. He had been gone running some errands for the past hour. He saw that a situation was developing. ""There a problem?"" he asked, making sure, unlike myself, to be calm and collected.

The customer turned and remarked, ""Yeah! Your boy here don't wanna fix my computer."" (First time he hadn't yelled) My boss seems rather surprised, ""Sure about that? Granak is our best tech. He wouldn't do that.""
The fellow, being called a liar by my boss (or so he thought), immediately turns and throws a REALLY terrible punch at my employer. A scuffle ensues and the only casualty is the customer's CD Stomper.

Police are called, names are taken. They arrest the guy for assault and my boss only has some minor bruising. That was the last week I worked there. It was the third fight that had broken out in this computer store.

**REBOOTING...**

Hello again, TFTS!

It has been a while, hasn't it? 

Today's story is simple, relaxing, and humorous, and details exactly what to do when your vendors refuse to replace equipment under warranty... or at least what I'D do.

- - -

LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN

- - -

The afternoon was boiling. Patton used to joke about renting out Texas and living in hell, as hell would be cooler - he wasn't kidding. It was a crispifying 90+ outside, and it was only early May.

Fortunately, I and my support staff were inside a specialty clinic we were rolling medical record software to, so we were nice and cool, and our coffee supply was flowing freely. When you have a conference room with a HUGE dark wood executive boardroom-style table and really comfy leather chairs and overhead lights with a dimmer switch at your disposal, you REALLY want to base your operations out of there, you know?

I'd just fired up a few tabs in Firefox with several subscribed subreddits for a fine, productive afternoon of dicking around, and I'd had a bottle of Sodastreamed diet Red Bull next to me, when one of the RNs (registered nurses) walked into the conference room where we were and looked expectantly in our direction.

""Um, Jack? We have a bit of a problem with a printer down at one of our nurse pods downstairs.""

Now, normally, I'll tell users to cram it with walnuts and to go to the helpdesk, then idly entertain fantasies of flipping a table at them, but today I was feeling... uncharacteristically altruistic, for some reason (I think the caffeine did it), so I thought what the hell.

I motioned for her to tell me what was going on, and she related a problem that involved the printer jamming - repeatedly - and being a royal pain to clear. Now, mind you, we're an all-Dell shop here, and Dell stuff is usually pretty easy to clean / repair, but this particular model of printer... well, the Oatmeal was right when they said printers were sent from hell.

This particular one, a Dell m5200, was well-known to the field techs that serviced that location regularly. One who I worked with occasionally sent me a ticket history for the past six years (out of warranty from Dell, but not from our printer service company, oddly enough) for that printer, and the logs on it were longer than a /r/politics thread about Michele Bachmann. After reading only a few of them - 75% of which were for it not being able to be cleared when paper got jammed in it, about 15% were for it spewing out extra sheets of paper, and 10% were for miscellaneous problems - I had but one reaction.

&gt;bertstare.gif

Now, as this printer was at a pod where nurses and clinical assistants sat - and were expected to give patient progress notes to the patients before they left - its malfunctioning directly impacted patient care. That's a HUGE red flag for me, and for most people in healthcare IT.

I got one of the printer techs (we'd outsourced printer repair to a major printer / MFD / copier company within the past year) on the phone, bypassing the helpdesk, and was told ""no, you can't have a hotswap, this isn't a hospital facility, so it's not directly affecting immediate patient care.""

&gt;bitchplease.jpg

""I'm onsite right now and it's completely nonfunctional. We're supposed to pass these progress notes out to a patient as they leave. You're telling me that THAT isn't stopping us? That's a workflow stoppage right there.""

The tech groaned and grumbled.

""FINE. I'll see if I can get out there tomorrow to fix it.""

After a bit of finagling with his boss, I had him out there that afternoon, and he had it fixed after clearing stuck paper from pretty much the entire printing path on it. Right after he put it back together and reconnected it to the network, queued jobs started spewing off, and - OF COURSE - right after he left, the printer jammed dead shut again.

A quick stroll down to the elevators resulted in my pulling him back in and having him fix it again.

""Look, this thing's nearly six years old. It's obviously out of warranty by Dell, there's no way we can keep using this and expect it to function reliably on a long-term basis, let alone for parts to be available if - when - it dies again. It's no Laserjet 4. Seriously, can we get a replacement, preferably within the week, or at least a hotswap to tide us over until you all can fix this to a point where it doesn't suck like a Sears Shop Vac?""

""Nope, sorry. It has to be completely effed before we'll replace it, and this thing doesn't even remotely qualify. Sure, it jams on occasion, but what printer doesn't?""

""This thing has spent more time down than up! It's the printer equivalent of a hamplanet in a scooter! If it was working even half the time, we'd give it a pension and benefits, but this thing's the surly hired-on boss's son who screws up everything it touches and somehow gets a pass because it's been here for twenty years on and off!""

""... Has anyone ever told you you're not really that good at analogies?""

""... just fix the bloody printer.""

The next morning, the practice manager came up to the conference room - nearly catching me on /r/firefly (read: /R/GENTLEMENBONERS) - and in no uncertain terms told me that the printer had jammed again and she wanted it dealt with. She also stated that she knew it wasn't part of the rollout we were supposed to do, but she would count it as a personal favor, as the printer techs had stonewalled her for months over replacing it and she was tired of all the clinical staff complaining at her about it.

I told her that I would fix it out of hours that evening, and that it would have to wait until everyone was gone.

""I don't know if we can wait through a whole day. Seriously.""

""For this? You'll want to.""

Her suspicious look was well-rewarded as I went into a full-on Gendo Ikari pose, with my glasses catching the light from the dimly-lit lights over the conference room's table. Hey, I'm seated at the end of it, it's got dark wood and black leather, you HAVE to go for the dramatics sometimes.

""I have two words for you. Plausible deniability. Now, I strongly suggest that no one be here after eight tonight, and my fee for this is that your practice orders lunch for us techs today. Do this, and the printer will never trouble you again.""

She nodded, got up from her chair, and left.

That day, we had a very nice lunch catered in by a local bakery, one that makes a very excellent creme brulee French toast. The other techs and EMR analysts were effusive in thanking the practice manager for the delicious lunch, though over the table she and I exchanged glances, and we knew that the 30 pieces of silver had been spent; the hitman had his blood money, and the target would meet its untimely end.

A short time later, I descended the stairs to their suites, entered the comms closet, and retrieved their office toolbox and two cables, then returned to my table. Opening the toolbox, I found a pair of wire cutters and a box cutter, and in about fifteen minutes, I had a tool that would solve our problems. I returned the toolkit to the comms closet, and sat quietly, reading and playing Penny Arcade Adventures 3 on my phone until seven PM. The clinic was empty - not a soul was there, not even the cleaning people. I'd queued up a certain song on my phone when I left the conference room, and as I walked through the empty corridor inside the clinic, the strains of the 1812 Overture serenaded me with but a hint of the potential of what was to come.

I reached the printer and couldn't resist.

""In the name of Gerald of the department of information services, vice-president of the ministry and overseer of all that we provide within the realm, I, Jack, of the department of information services, Bastard Operator from Hell, lord of the cubefarm, do sentence you to die.""

My hand descended into the pouch on my belt, and withdrew the means to the end - a device which makes all electronics tremble, for precious little can shield against it, and to use it guarantees instant death.

[It was an Etherkiller, built for US three-prong outlets, and just as lethal as the chair.](http://imgur.com/7Mbx8yk)

Swift hands swapped the RJ-45 end into the printer's NIC, and the other end into a powered-off surge protector on the floor. The music was fast approaching a crescendo, and I knew the cannons would start soon.

""Does the condemned have anything to say before the sentence is carried out?""

The display, perhaps in one final act of defiance, flashed ""ERROR 202"" at me.

""So be it. May your creator have mercy on your soul.""

As the famous finale started, and the cannons went off, I flipped the switch, and with a swift pop, the printer was ended, its metaphorical bowels emptying as the smell of ozone flooded the room. As the cannons in the overture blasted, I flipped the surge protector on and off in time with them, and continuous popping started sounding from the printer's smoldering corpse - capacitors bursting, I assumed.

I shut down the surge protector, removed the Etherkiller, and filed a ticket with the helpdesk to have them replace the printer based on that it wouldn't power on at all.

THE NEXT MORNING (INSERT FFVII INN MUSIC HERE)

- - -

I was back at my desk at my cubicle in another building, about six miles away, enjoying a cup of coffee, and my desk phone rang. Caller ID showed that it was the printer tech calling from his desk phone, and with a grin, I picked up.

""Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyes?""

The tech's tone was frustrated and angry, and I had no doubt he had no idea what was going on.

""HOW DID THIS BREAK? IT WAS FINE WHEN I LEFT ON TUESDAY!""

""When I got back from getting dinner, there was a HUGE smell of ozone in the air. I know the smell of burned electronics - my house was hit by lightning when I was a kid - and the smell's pretty distinctive. I followed it to the printer, and when I got there, it reeked! I almost threw up! Anyway, I unplugged it and made a ticket with you all.""

""... I'm going to pick it up in fifteen minutes. Do you want a hotswap?"" He'd gone from angry to defeated in a quick turn of events, and with a smirk, I replied in the affirmative, then told him to call me when he gets there and I'd make the backend changes with the server team for the DHCP lease.

He did so, and when he got it back to his lair, he called back.

""What the hell happened to this? It's burnt! Every capacitor on the NIC has MELTED! ON BOTH SIDES! The NIC port has scorch marks on it! The entire motherboard is completely ruined!""

""Don't ask me, you're the printer repair guy. I just deal with systems and networks.""

""The network admin here -"" (and it should be noted that the field services guys used to repair printers before the new company took over; the guy who'd had to cover that clinic had gotten promoted in that time) "" - he said it could have been a misconfigured power over Ethernet port that blew it out, but... but... I just don't see how that could be possible!""

""You may have to go out there with a current tester and try that drop. I mean, PoE doesn't really have that much current... anyways, what are you able to do for them to get them up and running in the meantime?""

""We're ordering a new one. It'll be there in a week. They've got a hotswap, and that should hold until the new one gets there.""

""Really? Thanks! You know how it is when we can't get work done. Thanks for taking care of this for us!""

He hung up on me. I'd SWEAR I heard a muffled sob on the other end of the line, but eh. The clients were happy, the printer ended up being replaced, and the patients could get both their progress notes and any EMR-printed prescriptions that the doctors needed to give out (I'm looking at you, Metformin).

I turned to my phone and played a quiet, victorious game of Snake.

Tesseract420,107,470,1602js,1313,"I work on an IT Help Desk for a global company and the first position I had there was Tier 1 Analyst (which basically means, taking calls from employees and try to solve whichever problem they had with the numerous applications that the employees of this company use, as well as being first point of contact for any big problem that needs to be escalated).

Once I had a call from an angry lady stating that she was unable to log in her company provided laptop. The first thing I asked was the error message that she gets. Incorrect password. Next question is where she is at? She is at home. Then I asked her if she recently changed her password. She did not.

So, she is not connected to the company's network, and her password should be the same than the last time she was using her computer... I checked on Active Directory and confirmed that. What is happening?
She was angry because she had a lot of work to do and she had already spent quite a while trying to log before she called. I took a deep breath and asked her: ""Please, I know this is basic, but, could you verify that Caps Lock is not active?""

She started ranting about not being her fault. She told me that the day before, she saw one of her colleagues ""messing around with her computer"" and caught her while passing by the office where they both worked. She told me that she didn't have time to ask her what her colleague did, but she was sure that was related to this problem.
I asked her what made her think that it had something to do with this whole matter. She said that her colleague ""left her information on the computer"".

I thought that, probably, her colleague logged in with her account on the caller's laptop and the caller did not modify the user name on the logon screen. I told her that. She told me that her username was fine, but her colleague's ""information"" was still there. I asked her to read that ""information"" for me. She read what it looked like a computer's name, which also appears at the top of the logon window (Brief background: This company uses a computer name convention that includes the name and last name of the computer owner).

Then I figured what the problem was.

I told her: ""Well, there are two possible situations here. Either your colleague logged into your computer and changed your computer's name and changed your Windows password (yeah, right), OR you have your colleague's computer.""

*Awkward silence*

Then she screams: ""S**t!!! This is not my damn computer!!!!""

Road_Dog65,218,468,1lbj3w,1313,"As a recent Redditor, I am only now stumbling onto the wonder that is TFTS, but I have a story I want to share: 

I spent 3 interesting years supporting the DOS CIVPOL mission in Iraq.  Being IT support for a bunch of old cops was usually frustrating, often funny, and once it was almost deadly.  
My job had me spending a lot of time travelling from FOB to FOB doing inspections, emergency repairs and basic support.  Need a new server in Marez, a replacement switch in Bucca, I would grab the part, my gear and head to the flight line.  

We had a camp drop off the network one afternoon and I actually managed to catch that night’s flight from VBC to the location down in Delta.  Got in late, walked myself to our LSA and since it was dark, crashed in the IT shop.  When I got up the guys had all gone out on missions so I got to work.  It looked like the VSAT dish had dropped off of the bird, no problem, right there it sat on top of a pair of double stacked connexs.  Grab my stuff and up the ladder I go.  I could actually tell that the feed horn/BUC had rotated (they would do that due to wind and heat) so I just needed to just do a peak/pol adjustment and I was sure I could get it back on the network and myself back under the shade.  I start to get organized when I hear a “crack” and suddenly a hole appears in the dish!  I think WTF, followed by OH SH!T and scramble down the ladder so fast I got friction burns.  I am on the ground shaking a little bit and blowing off stress by expressing loudly and profanely that I think I was just shot at and that is not a cool thing in my book, when the guys, who had just returned from mission, wandered over to see what the fuss was about.  I was then informed that “Yes, ‘IT GEEK’, there is a sniper working in the area”, and “yes , you probably did just get shot at…  oh, and is that hole going to affect our internet?”   You got to love people who have been in Iraq so long nothing fazes them ~lol~
  
I went back up after dark with a red flashlight and my vest and finished the work.  I was led to believe that the bad guys didn’t have night vision worth a darn.  I will admitt that it was a rather scary 20 minutes to get the dish back in alignment and be able to get back down behind concrete walls ~lol~

tl;dr – Who knew you could get shot at in Iraq?

ilifin,108,294,12q2r9,1315,"About six years back I was working as a phone support temp for a very large outsourcing company that dealt with everything from attaching servers to racks to plugging USB cables into cellphone chargers for their customers. One of these customers was of the largest branches of a government suit that had users ranging from shift nurses to oil rig workers, which meant calls could be everything from pressing a power button to that someone's cell tower was causing packet loss for a production server out in the Altantic.



One of these calls was from an elderly woman who presented herself as the head nurse of a retirement home that was in dire need of assistance with their... cheese wheel.

Paraphrasing this from memory, it went something along these lines:

**Elderly woman**: ""The cheese wheel stopped working this morning, we can't get any work done now!""

**Me**: ""The... did you just say cheese wheel?""

**Elderly woman**: ""What else would it be?! Your guys installed the thing, now fix it!""

**Me**, muting the call: *groan*

**Me**, to co-worker: ""Which of the installation techs would install a cheese wheel for a retirement home?""

**Co-worker**: ""Che-- what? Are you sure you aren't getting a prank call?""

**Me**, unmuting the line: ""Is this supposed to be a joke? We don't ""install"" cheese wheels.""

**Woman**: ""MANAGER.""

**Me**, muting the line, to manager: ""&lt;location&gt; has trouble with their cheese wheel and wants to speak with you.""

**Manager** stares blankly at me and checks the date, we're in the middle of January. ""Cheese?""

**Me**: ""Yes... cheese.""

**Manager**, picking up the call and putting it on speaker: ""This is ilifins manager, &lt;name&gt;. What seems to be the problem?""

**Woman**: ""Our bloody cheese wheel isn't fucking working anymore and your shitty phone man is not listening to me!""

**Manager**: ""I can assure you that we do not install cheese wheels as there would be quite the smell from rotting cheese after a while. Can you describe the object to me?""

**Woman**: ""It's giant, it's yellow, it's full of holes and it stopped blinking this morning! No blinking is a bad sign, said &lt;funniest installation tech we've ever had&gt; when he plugged it in for us.""

**Manager**, choking a laugh: ""Did he call it the cheese wheel?""

**Woman**: ""YES! WHY ISN'T ANYONE HELPING ME""

**Manager**: ""I understand the problem at hand and will take the necessary steps to rectify your situation. A man will be at your location within the hour.""

**Woman**: ""THANK YOU."" &lt;click&gt;


The office landscape of 50+ people bursts into laughter and the installation tech in question comes strolling in at the most amazing timing anyone has ever had. The slowly developing shitfaced grin on his face as we explained why we were laughing was priceless. ""I knew this day would come,"" he said as he picked up his car keys and went into a store room, bringing out a spare circular shaped USB hub with 12 ports in it, yellow and quite full of holes.

**Background info:** It was late April. We didn't have laptops back then, but teachers could sign out carts full of old dells when they were needed. My phone was more powerful than one of the laptops. The wifi on one wasn't working. We had a very fat and annoying screechy old woman as our substitute teacher. Now, my teacher knew that I was good with computers, and she didn't object to anything I did. The substitute, on the other hand.. You'll see.

**The story:** Someone's wifi wasn't working. I tried the wifi switch on it, but nothing changed. I found the problem in the network adapter settings, but it needed admin. So, I did what any geek would do: I booted into safe mode to use the hidden admin account. What I hadn't realized was that the sub was looking over my shoulder. As soon as safe mode started loading drivers, she started screaming. ""What are you doing?!"" she asked. ""I'm booting into safe mode,"" i said. ""But safe mode isn't safe! It looks like it's hacking something! Turn it off! TURN IT OFF!"" She held the power button down, killed the innocent laptop, and sent me to the IT office to ""explain my actions"". Well, I went to their office, yadda yadda yadda, she's not allowed to touch school laptops anymore.

TollhouseFrank,308,392,1p4cw3,1309,"Another magical tale from my job at the now closed dial-up company
*****

Even though I do not remember the reason why, now, I had asked to swap one of my weekend shifts for a mid-week shift with a co-worker.  My manager ended up swapping with me as his wife had something to do that weekend and it gave him time to work on his project - he was working on programming the 32gpx and writing a new gui for it - so I could have that saturday off.


I come in to work Sunday, and everything is out of place.  It looks like someone has rifled through every drawer - even the financial officer's desk - and left in a hurry.  I call my manager and ask him what was up, as the door was locked when I got there, so it couldn't have been a break-in (this was 3 stories up with no windows to the outside, so no smash-n-grab either).  However, if it wasn't that way when he left, I was gonna call the police.


He told me to clean up what I could, but it was ok.  He would explain everything monday morning, because it was too long a tale to tell on the phone, as apparently, the police had already been there.


So I spend all day sunday straightening things up and cleaning up. 


Come monday morning.  ME: and MAN: (manager)
*****
ME:  So boss, whassup?  Why all the mess?  Did you have a party Saturday?


MAN:  You could say that.  I was sitting here, minding my own business, writing code for that GUI for the 32gpx I was showing you, and I hear the elevator running and a ding on our floor.  I look down the hallway, and see a huge German Shepherd coming out, following by 3 DEA guys with guns.  


ME:  Uh, you weren't doing drugs, were you?  I mean, you look like a hippy, but you are clean as far as I know.


MAN:  I was confused too.  I had to get down on the ground with my hands on my head while they searched.  After 30 minutes, they gave up, and started asking questions.  When they got to what address this was (to confirm I wasn't high, I guess), I told them.  They started to arrest me until I asked them what address they thought it was.   They told me, then I started laughing and told them they had the wrong building, they wanted the crack-house across the street.

ME:  Uh, wow.  That is a weekend to remember.

I currently work on in-house, proprietary software that is business critical in every sense of the word. My workstation has its own individual UPS that management had installed separate from the building backup because they are worried about power outages stopping work or causing work to be lost, especially when it involves things like quickly needed hotfixes in production. 

This did not stop Sandra (fake name). Oh no. They didn't account for her. I am just glad I didn't lose any progress.

area88guy,235,341,1h1jfb,1297,"**Background**: This occurred during a past contract which consisted of imaging/migrating machines to Windows 7. The process was streamlined, and all we needed to do was watch for certain errors. 99.999% of the time, imaging would fail due to hard drive space, and this was either because the user genuinely had that much data, or because they had put personal things on the machine.

S.O.P. was to delete anything remotely personal. Music? Check. Downloaded (likely illegally) movies? That's a check. Pictures that aren't related to work files? Definitely a check.

**Story**: Enter Flood. Why did we call the user Flood? Well, Flood liked to ask a question during his stage of the process at a speed roughly equal to the speed of sound. The *least* amount of questions that I was sent via Instant Message per minute was six.

Yes. A question roughly every ten seconds. Thankfully, as has been seen by previous stories, I have no problem flipping into BOFH Mode. In this case, my response every time was to RTFE, aka, to refer to the email that was sent to him. This email outlined a series of steps that needed to be perform before migration. Oh, don't get me wrong, we still migrated the machine. The steps the user took would include backing up their work files and clearing space for us.

Flood didn't seem to read the email... or it's sister mailing... or the one after that. We sent these emails out in bursts. Two weeks before. One week before. Three days. Day before. Day of. So, Flood's turn at migration comes up. I'm there and I'm looking at why his machine immediately failed, and I see that Flood has only 20gb free. 

On a 500gb hard drive.

I'm not about to skip him and make him try again, so I go looking on his hard drive. To start, I delete the ~50gb of folders on the root that have nothing to do with Windows. Mainly repositories of data that should have been backed up or are part of a program that won't survive migration. I then move to his user profile.

I find a nested tree of My Documents folders. No worries there. What's in them is mostly work related, but each one keeps coming up at just north of 300gb. I'm floored. I keep making my way down, and *seven steps later* I'm left with the culprit of folders. Now, Flood thought he was clever, in that he named the folders to be vaguely work sounding.

Sadly, his copies of nearly every movie to be released on DVD in the past few years still retained their names. As did the music files, neatly sorted into folders. As, also, did the photos. 50gb of pictures, and I wish I was making that up. Well, the past has taught me to take extensive documentation, so I snap pictures of all of this, then frag it. I then rearrange the My Docs folders, eliminating redundancies, and shazam. We have the space to migrate! I kick it off, and go attend to the rest of my section.

Cut to the next morning, and the flood begins. 

""im missing files plz visit""

""folders missing plz""

""plz fix my pc""

...and so on, and so on. I finally get down to Flood's desk, and the beratement begins. Why did we alter the contents of ""his"" computer. This is ""his"" computer to do with as he wishes and we are not to touch it. I'm pretty impassive until this line erupts from his mouth:

**Flood**: Fix it. Get my files back, systems monkey, before I call your boss.

Oh. Really? *This hand of mine is burning red...*

**88**: By files, do you mean the copious amounts of pirated movies that we located in your Documents folders? Or do you mean the music that may or may not also be illegal?

**Flood**: How dare you! I will not be accused-

*...it's loud roar tells me to defeat you...*

**88**: Your computer did not have enough free space, so we searched your profile for items that should not be on the computer.

**Flood**: This is bullshit! This is my computer, you don't have any right to touch it!

**BAKUNETSU GOD FINGER~**

**88**: This computer belongs to XYZ Company, *not* you. It is loaned to you for the purposes of doing your job. Your job is *not* to watch movies. Your job is *not* to put your entire music collection on it. Your job is *not* to include every single picture you or your family has ever taken. The communication that went out stated that all personal files were subject to deletion if they interfered with the migration process. Yours did. They were removed. Since you called me a systems monkey, the pictures I took of the files we removed will be sent to my supervisor, and yours, with detailed notes on how I found them and why I removed them.

**K.O.! Winner: Area88Guy, in the IT Gundam!**

He copied everything over, down to the Desktop, to reduce the traumatic change she would have to endure. This lead to the following conversation.

Working at the same call center as the earlier story **[(REFERENCE)](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/149flb/the_day_i_saved_a_little_girl_across_the_country/)**

This is about 2-3 months before this call, my first most memorable call, although the toughest call I've ever had, and ever will (since I don't do tech support anymore..)

More background on the situation.

I was a part time Tier 2 support at the time, but taking Tier 1 calls, except I had all the tools, and info from Tier 2 still at my disposal, so I had a bit more power than your average Joe.

So I just sit down, coming back from a break, and get my first phone call.

The caller is I would assume early to mid 20's woman. She called up because her internet is down, and has been for 3 days. She was already a bit shaken up while speaking to me, but I get that pretty often, it's frustrating having to call and hope your issue will be fixed, we go over a few of the basic steps, everything seems to be in order, but her DSL light just won't stay on, it'll go on for a few seconds then drop. At this point I was doing a few tests, but tell her the bad news, we probably will be needing to send a tech over to the CO, as there seems to be issues on the line itself. (for what it matters, she was 1.05 Miles into the loop, and her max frequency on her modem said she could  only attain ~3mbit, but she should be getting ~10Mbit, big difference) But as soon as I say technician she lost it, crying, screaming, I'm at a loss of words, really, it's just 36 hours away, and it's just your internet. But that wasn't the issue...

I ask her what's wrong? The internet will be up shortly, and I mentioned that the last 5 calls she had she declined a technician, and she starts crying again, 10 minutes go by, and I'm still sitting there, trying to figure out what I do, do I hang up? Do I stay here? There's obviously something going on, so I stuck around, while my supervisor is tapping his wrist watch as I'm over my AHT of 8 minutes.

I ask her, why she doesn't want a technician going over, and then she tells me. 

8 months ago, she had a technician (FROM THE SAME COMPANY) went over, and forced himself on her, raped her..

Now, a bit of back story on me. In my late teens, early 20's I loved to stick it in anything, and lots of unstable / ""crazy"" people. And ended up going out with a girl for over a year that was very unstable, she was violently bipolar, turns out she was raped a few years before that, and was also suicidal. I learned a lot about saying the absolute minimum during an episode as that can be a catalyst, just sit back, and let her vent, and try and comfort.


So here I am, on the phone with a rape victim, who called the same company who sent over a guy who raped her.

At this point I tell her I need to run a few quick tests, I put her on mute (hold music is the devil!) and put my headset down, go talk to the floor supervisor. Tell him a bit what's going on, and he tells me ""Just take her info, but fix her problem and hang up, I'll take care of it"". Clearly, he didn't give two shits, just wanted his metrics looking good at the end of the day. This guy was a tool, and in no way he was going to do fuck all with that info.

I do the only thing I know how to do, I asked her, what happened, was it reported, you sure it was a XXXX ISP technician? (I was writing down the info make sure I can report this...).

She didn't have any names, but I was able to pull out the technicians record, 8 months previous she had two techs go over, in consecutive days, the same guy.

Never a call since, we assumed problem solved, WRONG.

This is where I knew i fucked up royally, I brought it all back to her, she starts freaking out, telling me how the only thing that stops her from killing herself is going online and finding somebody to talk to and comfort her online, playing games and all that. And now, her internet is down, and she needs another rapist to go over and fix her internet.

She starts telling me how she's been cutting herself all night, making the pain go away, needing the internet. I was shivering, I've been through this before, and it felt like I was talking to my ex. It was too real.

She tells me how nobody would care, nobody would notice, she would just die alone in her apartment, laying there rotting.

I asked her, you must have family, mother, father, siblings? She has a mother and sister, her dad left as a kid.

I asked her, what about your Mom, your sister, don't you think they would miss you? You're her Daughter! You're her pride and joy, and your sister, don't you want your little sister growing up with you? (now I only went there because of the tone of how she mentioned her mom and sister, in a good light, compared to the rest of the call, so I took a risk.

She just talked for a good hour or so about her Mom and Sister, about the good times, how she misses her, and should go visit her, she's still in the same town.

As this was going on, I was on chat support with the dispatch center (have tier 2 account permissions), trying to figure out what was going on with her account, and if there is something we can do RIGHT NOW. Lucky for her, there was a tech a few miles away, and dispatch (having a bit of info on the situation) sent the tech to her CO, and replaced her line card (it was defective). All at the same time she was still talking about her family, clearly she was cheering up.

At this point, I was near the 3 hour mark on my call, Supervisor was still giving me the stink eye, other agents on the floor were all starting to wonder what the heck I was doing.

Still probing her modem, I see her modem again! The CO work is done! DSL light is back, modem registers full 10 Mbit, and max speed of 21 Mbit. PERFECT!

At this time I ask her to take a look at her modem, she just stopped talking, gasps, and screams: My internet is fixed, my internet is fixed!

After a few more minutes, she asks me, if there still needs to be a tech going to her house, and I tell  her no, but she should report the issue, but she didn't want to and was scared. Not wanting to trigger a meltdown, didn't push anything.

She thanked me profusely, wants to know where i live, wants me to meet her, meet her sister, all that. I kindly explain, I'm just your internet tech support agent, I can't meet her and her family, but she should go visit them, and tell them about it. I tell her, I just want you to think of me of the tech support agent who fixed my internet.

I finish the call, a bit over 3 hours.


Now, after story.

Since I had access to previous tech tickets, I was able to know what technician who went over, and found out he was no longer with the company since 6 months (2 months after the incident).

A little bit more probing with a friend in the tech depo, turns out he was reported for trying to force himself on a client, and was arrested, jailed, and obviously fired. Karma.


Now comes my supervisor, with a ""Form of Action"" or a ""Written Warning"" form, for taking too long on a call, and giving ""unsupported"" help. 

I asked him what it's for, and he tells me stupid stuff, not supported, took too long, blah blah. He knew damn well about the situation, but didn't give a shit, it makes him look bad. I sign it, and tell him he's a piece of shit. I was anxious, nervous, and just about to throw up.

2-3 months after this call I was full time tier 2 support, my old supervisor was still there but dealt with T1. I eventually go the bleach call at T2 support.

Story here for those who missed it.
http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/149flb/the_day_i_saved_a_little_girl_across_the_country/


It's now been 8 years since I worked there, 7 since I did call center work. 5 years ago I seen my old supervisor in line at the office I work at, waiting for a job interview, he never got the job (I didn't say anything). I don't know what he's doing.


TL;DR
Got a call from woman who got raped by the ISP Technician, started talking about killing herself. I myself having a suicidal / bipolar ex, did the only thing I knew how, listened, comfort her. Solve her issue via chat while we were still on the line. Was never reported but tech was later arrested for same thing with different person.


PS: I don't remember the exact details in what she was saying, the call was extremely long, and covered a life story. Not to be insensitive, but I was only paying enough attention to keep her busy, while I solved her issue.

There is no way I could of fixed her problem if it weren't for having direct access to the chat system the technicians use.

Raidend,384,403,1g4ds9,1266,"A bit of background, I'm not tech support but I work at software QA. And I hate when people ask what I work at. Mostly because I don't like explaining what my work is about; because most people will simply not get it; and I'm just bad at explaining. So when anybody ask I just gave a non-committal response about computers or systems and try to defuse the situation.

Anyway now the story, today I was running a bit late for work, so I took a taxi (normally I take the bus), everything was fine. I made some polite conversation with the taxi driver, and then he asked:

&gt; **TaxiDriver:** So what work you do?  
&gt; **Me:** mmm... systems... hey maybe we could take a left there(points)  
&gt; **TaxiDriver:** Oh! really? then you can help me, my computer... laptop is not working

At that point we stopped at a red light and I was not liking the look on the taxi driver face...

&gt; **TaxiDriver:** It gives some ""system error"" and its very slow... probably virus  
&gt; **Me:** (incredibly uncomfortable) It could be any number of things I wouldn't know... Why don't we try a right in &lt;street name&gt;? 

The TaxiDriver reaches behind his seat taking out a laptop. Pretty generic  I couldn't recognize the model. 

&gt; **TaxiDriver:** But here's my laptop, so fix it maybe.

I took the computer and notice the TaxiDriver looking at me in the mirror. I open the laptop and press the power button. The thing comes to life with the windows 7 logo. Luckily before the computer finished booting up we got to my office, I paid the guy and leave the computer on the seat beside me.

She calls me today with a very simple issue.  If a manager from another site tries to log in *and* types the wrong password, the program may freeze.  The solution is to simply end the program via task manager, restart the program, and log in again.  Without realizing what she did, she picked the wrong manager's name from the drop-down menu and entered her password.  The program froze, and she called me.  I asked her if she had done what she was supposed to do, and she insisted that she did.  I knew that she hadn't, and she was in her ""Oh just get down here and fix it, asshole!"" mode.  It has begun.

So I go down there and sure enough, she hadn't terminated the program via task manager.  She asked what the problem was, so I told her it was an ""ID - Ten  - T"" issue.  She asked what that was.  I told her it would be too technical to explain, but I told her to write down how to fix it.  

So she gets a piece of paper and starts writing......""How to fix ID10T....""

She then drops the notebook, chasing me down the hall and beating me with anything that wasn't nailed to something else.  The other emploees pick up the notebook and the everybody starts laughing as I eventually run out of the building, being chased by a mad woman beating me with an oven mitt screaming ""I'll give you ID10T you son of a bitch!!!'

DrTee,97,344,127taa,1261,"Brief background, I'm currently 1 of 2 tech support guys at a local school, it's my first proper job and I'm actually enjoying it quite alot, staff and students are both very friendly and the job is challenging in the good way not the ""NO MORE KILL ME NOW"" way.

I was the only one in one day as the other guy was off on holiday, it was going pretty well, nothing big breaking, keeping on top of workflow, all good.

Later in the day one of the teachers popped down so I could give her some new software she wanted on her laptop.

I put the software on, showed her how to reach the google earth plug-in, etc and while I installed it she explained about ideas she had been told about when in came to incorporating IT into her lesson.

One thing she mentioned was qrcode implementation in field trips, she asked how it would work, I explained how qrcodes worked and how to get them, demonstrating that I had downloaded a qrcode scanner onto my blackberry. She also had a blackberry but hadn't a clue, so I showed her the app store on blackberry phones, which in turn she showed on her blackberry (a older model) that she didn't have the app store. I explained how she would get the apps onto the phone from her pc, which she was grateful for. 

She then continued to talk about her past with phones and problems she's had, explaining that she had her phone reset (back to factory settings) and that she had lost tons of photos and videos, and here's the tough part, it was her god-daughters wedding, who was married to a guy who had just came back from his 2nd tour of Afgahnistan and they had just had a baby. I was worried she was building up to ""and he's been killed now"" but thankfully I was spare the awkward social moment, as that wasn't the case. 

She lost 50 odd pictures and 10ish videos, you could see she was quite upset about the whole thing.

Apparently she went to her mobile service provider's phone shop and asked if there was a way to recover the photos, they told her they couldn't but apparently a lad there said he did ""computers"" at university, a phrase that still doesn't quite sound right to me still, and that he'll have a look at fixing it, but eventually returned and said there was nothing he could do. He had spent every possible way he had thought of fixing it.

I was sympathetic and asked if she had a memory card in the phone, so for future reference it could save photos onto that to help incase of these such situations, she responded with no she didn't. She opened her phone to prove it, in which I spotted a card in an unusual (for blackberrys) spot. 

I took it out and asked if it was cool to look on it, she agreed and lo and behold every damn photo and video was there, she started welling up and had tears in her eyes, I backed them up on a USB stick for her to take and transfer onto her computer. 

Not your usual rage inducing story of tech support, but I honestly felt like a damn superhero after it, sometimes tech support is a damn good job to have.

TL:DR A guy who ""did computers"" at university couldn't work out how to take a memory card out of a phone.

MY BRAIIIIIIIN. ","It's now mine, because I said so!",1610
vonadler,208,282,16b69a,1247,"This story is pretty funny, because the user did do that.

Allow me to explain. Back when I studied at the university, I worked extra at an internet support company. The job was mot fantastic, but I got some experience and extra money for beer. We did internet support on dialup and DSL for a phone operator and ISP, support for a few muncipality/city nets and served as the first point of contact for a company that used to own us (we branched out to do more than just support us, they sold us to focus on their core business, but we still did first point of contact for them).

The company delivered high-speed internet connections for companies, muncipalities and homeowners' and tenants' unions - there were no direct private customers, they only delivered to organisations, companies and associations. A large part of of their network was radio LAN. This was around 2000, before a lot of fiber had been laid down to build an extensive fiber net over the country - connecting customers to radio LAN to the few large-capacity fiber lines in existance was a good business back then.

Around 2002, we get informed that this company, due to the IT crash close to bankrupcy, are being bought out by a LARGE power company that wishes to acquire the fiber net they have laid out and branch out in their own ISP business. Everyone is happy - we because we can have continued business, they because they won't have to go bankrupt and the large power company because they get a good net and customer base really cheap.

So, the company starts to do a lot of clean-up in their system before the merger. They build a lot of their net and customer base in during the happy times of the IT bubble 1998-2001, and it was known that technicians had arranged connections for friends and relatives and made many undocumented solutions. So we were warned that they were closing a lot of connections that had no contract to it and were not paid for, and were asked to document everything in case it looked like someone had been disconnected by mistake, send a case to the technicians and let them handle it from there.

So, one day I get a call on that line.

ME: ""[company] support.""

HIM: ""Hi. I have an internet connection from you guys, and it has stopped working.""

ME: ""Ok, what is the name of the company?""

HIM: ""No, it is not a company.""

ME: ""Oh, is it a tenants' or homeowners' union?""

HIM: ""Nope, just me.""

ME: ""There must be some kind of misunderstanding. We don't sell individual connections.""

HIM: ""You did to me.""

ME: ""The info I have is that we never did.""

HIM: ""Look, I live in an old water tower. It is the highest building in the city. You guys came here 1998, and told me if you could put up an antenna on my roof, I got free internet from you. It has worked fine for 4 years, now it doesn't.""

ME: ""Ok, I'll put a case to the technicians and have them look into it. I'll get back to you.""

HIM: ""Fine. Thanks.""

So, I make a case and send it to the technicians, who, perhaps understantably, close the case, saying he is not a customer, they do not provide individual connections, and he is not getting his internet back.

So, I call him back to tell him this.

ME: ""Hello again, it is [vonadler] from [company], I promised to call back.""

HIM: ""Oh yeah, what did they say?""

ME: ""Unfortunately, they claim you are not a customer and you do not have any contract from us. They have closed the case.""

HIM: ""What? Get back to them and tell them that if they don't restore my connection, I am going up there and I'll take the antenna down!""

ME: ""I don't think that will help, but I will do so.""

HIM: ""Thanks.""

So I re-open the case, submit the new information and get it back almost immediately, closed, with a belitteling comment about not believing people that are not customers and not re-opening such cases again. At that time I was busy, so I did not have time to call the customer back with this and by lunchtime, I had almost forgotten it all.

Until the manager comes running. 

MAN: ""Get back on the phones! The [company] line is going mad!""

ME: ""What? What happened?""

MAN: ""They lost [large geographical region with about 20% of the customers]. It is completely black!""

ME: ""I think I know why.""

Yes, it turned out in the end, that the technicians had made the guy a deal in 1998, but never put it to paper. They had given him a 100/100Mbit connection with 1:1 contention which he used for e-mail and checking some forums and read newsapers online.

They made him a special deal and connected him to a 10/10Mbit 1:32 (I think it was) line, and he connected the antenna again.

Oh, sometimes I wish I had his power when the internet is down.

itssilvernotgray,226,432,1fpui0,1243,"This past August of 2012 I had just moved into my first commercial location, having been cramped in a garage for four years while I grew my business and saved up money to buy a house. 

 I heard a knock at the door (which was strange because it was open) so I answered it and was greeted by a girl of no more than 20 years of age trailing four kids behind her. 


""Can I help you?"", I asked. 

 She said ""Yeah, I'm here to get my compruta"" (sorry guys, I'm not being racist here, it just adds to the realism of our conversation), so I ask her name and she tells me.

  I look it up in the database, turn back to her, and ask ""When was it that you brought it in?""

She replied ""Oh, I dunno, it been a minute.  Like a few months or so""

I ask ""Was it a big gray desktop with lights on the front"", ""YEAH dat was it"". 

 I reply, ""You DO realize that you brought that computer to me in my other location in September of 2009, right?  That's been THREE YEARS, I don't have your computer anymore - to be honest with you, I barely even remember it.""  

  
OMG, she starts yelling ""WHAT YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE IT NO MO?!?!?!  WHAT DA FUKKAMI POST TO DO NOW???  YOU AIN'T NEVER CALLED ME OR SHIT ABOUT IT"".

  I ask ""Is this the right number *reads number*"", she says ""NO, I got a new number when I moved out of town three years ago"". 

 I asked ""Why didn't you call me and even ASK about the computer?  In the three years that passed, I never heard from you, and the phone number didn't work.  I considered the computer to be abandoned.""

 She went absolutely nuts then.  She was stomping her feet and yelling a lot of incomprehensible things, mostly cursing, while her children silently watched. 

 She wandered back off down the street cursing me, my race, my mother, my shop...pretty much everything.

ed-adams,226,332,1m8mxc,1238,"Let's call this small business I made some custom software for ""More On Inc.""

So the software is in wizard form. You start a new account for each client that comes in divided in two steps: in step one you enter client details, in step two you print relevant documents for said client, and save.

In a couple weeks, said client comes in with printed documents, you take his documents, find the details saved in the software by an ID printed on the paper, match them, and give client his product (spoiler: it's not cocaine).

So, More On Manager, Brian Ded, had a problem this morning. A person of the female persuasion came in with her documentation but half the data does not match what's printed on paper. He calls me.

Me &amp;mdash; Hello, this is Ed. How may I help you?

Me &amp;mdash; Did you do anything different while keying in your client's data?

Him &amp;mdash; No. Can you please check what's wrong?

An hour of remote magic and a whole bunch of guesses later, I realize what the problem was.

Me &amp;mdash; When filling up this client's data, did you print the document, go back change her information, and then not print the document again?

Him &amp;mdash; ...maybe? I don't know. Whatever it is, I can't give her this not-cocaine-product unless it matches her document.

Me &amp;mdash; Yes, but, you made the mistake. You printed the wrong documentation.

Him &amp;mdash; Can't you fix this?

Me &amp;mdash; Is the data on the computer the correct one?

Him &amp;mdash; Yes.

WeedHitler420,399,359,1efrsx,1236,"So here I am tasked with the effort of maintaining roughly 200 computers. I've been tasked with defragging, making sure Microsoft update worked because for some reason the guy who's now the boss of my boss set up the network in such a way that just turning automatic updates on wont work and will cause infinite restart/shutdown loops. We use a software called DeepFreeze to maintain some of our computers since we have lots of guests coming in and out and we like to keep them in relatively pristine condition software wise. In the last guy's incompetence he could not for the life of him figure out how to automate any of the basic things like software updates but apparently nobody has the spine to say anything because he somehow moved up in the company.

So recently i've been getting into the idea of doing things remotely and through batch files. I just whip up a script to do the defrag and while I'm at it I have it update all our other software that needs updating. Namely Java, flash, reader. 

Now before I go any further I should explain. The policy before I started doing things automatically? Send a team of five people down to the job site, and manually log into the admin account of every single computer and click to get windows update started and then click a few more times to update flash and java. Then come back hours later to log them out of the account then.

 Needless to say that's dumb as all hell. So I whip up these scripts, and deploy them across the entire network. I turned what used to take five people almost a week to do into a five minute affair with text logs to show my work. I'm sitting there thinking i'll get some kind of reward since in my head that's a major thing.

Nope. My boss comes in and tells me that if I do too much work they'll have to let me go at half a day or maybe tell me to not even come in tomorrow because I did too much work at once.

Wow what a reward.

area88guy,139,310,1go03c,1230,"I originally posted a shorter version of this in response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1gna8c/the_server_room/) posting about negligent IT guys. Someone suggested I repost my comment as its own tale.

My first job in this field was working at a national for-profit college that I also attended. I worked there officially for around three years, though I was the intern for roughly another year. I took the job from a guy whose no-call, no-show antics caused his termination the day he returned. THAT guy had been hired to replace the first sysadmin hired at this physical location.

Guy1's mantra was job security. Only he knew how to ""do"" certain things, and never explained them. Wiring was a joke that he had mapped out in his own head, and again told no one. I spent much time fixing this guy's shit.

Guy2's mantra was screw it, let's game. Myself and the other intern did most of the work, and he did only what he couldn't pawn off onto us. The rest of the time we were deep in vidjamagames. It was fun, but he barely tried to keep that job.

Enter me. I will not be a braggart by saying I was the best damn tech that site had seen. I fixed problems and explained them in layman's terms. Anything I could possibly fix, I did, though there was much that I was not allowed to fix. This was either due to a lack of resources or time, or an unwilling of the jackass manager to give me overtime or let me shift my schedule.

Our server room was utter shit. I never had the ability to fix this, however, because my boss was a complete jackass with no understanding of IT or best practices. He wanted 24/7/365 uptime, regardless of whether or not anyone was on campus, and refused to pay overtime. ""Do it on your own time if it's so important."" was his mantra. ""Pay me."" was mine.

I had submitted around six proposals to this Dunder-Mifflin reject, all declining in price from $10k. We needed new switches that met with our college's Acceptable Equipment list. We needed a new server (we had two, one for student-related items and one for the business) ASAP. We needed a complete rewire of the server room and other networking closet, to sort out what went where, and to label it all.

Denied every time, when I had people at a level above him who said it would be approved if he submitted it. I pleaded with him to bring our stuff up to HQ's code, but he denied everything, stating that it wasn't in the budget, or that he couldn't be bothered to pay for the time. This meant that if something broke, I was expected to drop everything to fix it.

So, my rule of thumb became Customers First. I didn't care if the business was suffering. If classes were being affected because of downtime, it was my job to fix it. Dean of the Criminal Justice school can't get on Facebook? Fuck 'em, Lab 435 is down, and there's a class in there in two hours.

As the years passed, I began to be more bold with my time. If I knew I had a major project to get done, I did it. I didn't care if the office wasn't staffed, because they had removed my ability to have more than one intern. If Jackass Manager asked me where I was, I told him, and informed him of what could have prevented the downtime.

My pleas for new or newER equipment were still ignored, and I was done with it.

Cut to the last hour+ of my employment there. I was leaving for greener pastures to work with a team at a medical facility. It was my dream job, but my work ethic is such that I had not yet ""checked out"". I remember it being about 64 minutes until freedom. Server room alarms go off. Three switches have died, the student server has crashed and won't come back on. Phones are out due to the wiring being so haphazard that some of the lines were on the dead switches. The whole student side is down. Normally, I would go to Mr. Jackass and inform him of the situation.

Mr. Jackass is on vacation.

I go in and assess the damage, then assess my time left. I grab my cellphone, call his assistant, and tell her that he needs to authorize emergency overtime for me, as well as prepare to be contacted by HQ regarding the equipment. She calls. She's a nice lady. Kinda hot, too. I sit outside of the server room, waiting, when my cell rings. It isn't a number I know, so it must be Mr. Jackass. It is.

Confirms it's me. ""Under no circumstances are you to stay over your 40 hours. Fix it."" Hangs up.

I stare at the cellphone, and start laughing. I dial up my Level 2 contact and brief him on the situation. He starts cracking up. He knows I'm outta here in another 20 minutes or so. He says he'll start the official process, and I let him know if anyone from Level 2 up needs to ask questions, to call me. I then unplug the three switches and gather their cords up, placing them in one box. I know HQ will want these, so I label the box and hand it to the newly-arriving Assistant. She asks what I'm doing. I tell her I'm doing damage control until 4:00PM.

She begins to laugh. ""He didn't approve the overtime, did he?""

Nope. I immediately begin to bring down the administrative network and restore it using the shittiest switches that I had. I filmed all of this with my phone, stating my reasons for doing so. I then brought the student network back up using our production-grade switches. Fuck the administrative staff, these kids are paying for school, and they're going to get it.

Instructors are coming down to find out what is going on, and I'm letting them all know. I won't brag, I'm a nice system admin, so they all at least liked me if not loved me. Every single one of them left the room laughing. I leave detailed notes, both digitally and on paper, as to what has happened, what needs to be done to fix it, and why I'm leaving the site at 4:00PM. I save copies of the filmed work on three locations, head to the office and grab my stuff. Hands are shaken as I inform the intern about what has gone down.

At 4:04PM, and I couldn't make that shit up if I tried, the admin network goes back down from the horrible switches I was forced to use. Intern calls and asks for advice. I tell him there's nothing he can do, and give him Level 2 tech's cellphone, which L2 had already bade me do. 

At 4:19PM, as I'm pulling off the highway and nearly home, I receive a call from Mr. Jackass. He demands a status report. I inform him that HQ has been notified, as has the Level 2 technician, and that it's out of my hands. I tell him what I did with the networks, and that I left crystal-clear instructions with everyone who matters. 

He demands that I return to the site. I laugh in his ear, and tell him I'll return as soon as he authorizes the overtime. He growls out that I am not to count these hours, and I laugh again. I decided to bargain with him: you supply the hours, I'll go buy the equipment personally. He starts raging, threatening to fire me if I don't get to the store, buy parts, and get the school back to 100%. I ask if I get overtime, he yells no, and I calmly state the next bit:

""You cannot fire me, as I no longer work for you. I've done my due diligence and informed everyone that needed to be informed, but I am not a hardware wizard. You were informed several times about your hardware and wiring issues, and you chose to ignore them. I included that in my communication as well. Now, lose my phone number, because I'm not your employee any longer.""

I hang up to the sound of his rage. Three hours later, he's the only one who doesn't show up to my going-away party. Tales are spun of how Mr. Jackass was furious, calling everyone he could to get them to convince me to return. Amazingly, none of them had seen me, nor had my phone number. 

I found out later that this incident, plus my reporting on his practices (such as no overtime but fix it for free), was the nail in a coffin of evidence collection that the school had taken years to gather. He was fairly decent at covering his ass, but I was better, and they took him to task for it. Intern ended up helping them fix everything, then replace everything, and was finally hired on as my replacement. 

Original TL;DR: Don't assume the IT guys were idiots. Instead, assume that they weren't given the tools that they needed to fix everything, and let their work speak for itself.

farkanoid,203,439,yugsk,1220,"I worked as a general tech at a local high school around 2000. They had hundreds of workstations running Novell Netware on-top of Win95, 98 and 98SE, all the machines were P-III's and below (typically P-II's and Celerons for students, P-III's for staff)



Computers were generally off-limits during lunchtimes, unless you booked one of the public workstations in the library in advance (you're restricted to 20 mins, which is the first half of lunch or a full recess). There were a handful of 'Senior' (11th/12th grade) students allowed access to 'private' unsupervised-ish computer labs at lunch time, most of the students would play Star-Craft and GTA over the network, others would browse the web and mess with Visual Basic 5 for class


Later on in the year, some of the machines I looked after in Lab 4 had trouble loading their desktops; Essentially Explorer.exe had been corrupted. Rather than try and troubleshoot these machines, standard procedure was to restore a known-working image using Ghost instead (it took around 5 minutes to do a complete wipe/restore of a Win9x partition, or closer to 15 minutes if the image is streamed over the network)


Students have their own 'drives' and desktops mapped to sub-folders on the server, so there shouldn't be any personal data stored locally on the machines. Applications are installed on-the-fly using Novell Snappshot on first-run, so the recovery image was bare-bones OS, Drivers, NetBEUI &amp; Novell stacks, and shortcuts to Snappshotted applications on the network


After restoring a few machines, I noticed some juniors pointing at a screen and giggling uncontrollably - I figured it was porn and carried on working (we've all been there, and being a tech I have no real authority anyway); Soon more students started acting the same way towards other machines. My curiosity got the best of me, so I casually walked across the lab, hoping to get a glimpse of the screen as I passed by


Sure enough, someone had changed the 'Start' menu text to 'Penis' on a few machines. I admit that I found it amusing at first, and suddenly the Explorer.exe corruption made sense, as the culprit must have messed up modifying the file the first few times before figuring it out. Needless to say, I wiped the affected machines and restored a known-good image after everyone left. This happened on and off over the next week, until I started receiving concerning emails from staff saying *their* machines have been affected too


One email stood out in particular, it was from the Librarian, which the students aren't terribly fond of. Someone had changed the text of several public library machines to ""Psycho!"", a nickname the students had given her, as it rhymes with her surname and reflects her default demeanor. I admit that I may have been rooting for the under-dog a little, I watched with glee as she tried to hilight and delete the text on the start menu (to no avail, of course)


Over the next few days, pretty much every department excluding the front office had been affected - I'm talking hundreds of machines. I was gob-smacked, how the hell could this many machines be affected? I can understand the students working together and affecting lab machines that they had access to... But staff too? Students don't have access to staff machines.


Some departments started becoming super-snappy towards me, accusing me of not doing my job and allowing this to happen - Bare in mind, I was a basic card-level tech there. I had admin-level access to the server, but I was not to mess with configuration, user accounts or network policies, that was someone elses job. My job was to run leads, replace cards, troubleshoot and 'format' machines, no more.


Feeling like my job was on the line, I got to work in trying to find out how it was being done. It had to be at least semi-automated to reach so many machines in such a short time, so I started from a freshly imaged student machine. The staff gave me a lend of the ""Office boy"" for a while (each day they pick a random student to run errands for the office), the seniors nick-named today's one ""Office bitch"". I asked him to have a seat, and show me exactly what he does to log into the machine to play games


He entered the username/password combination of student/student - apparently only 12th graders get their own logins, everyone else is to use 'student', with the exception of library computers, which use library/library. Immediately after start-up, I notice a black command prompt appear for a moment with nothing but a blinking cursor, then the machine reboots automatically. I ask him to log in again, after which the command prompt appears for under a second, and the desktop shows up


Lo and behold, the start menu text was changed to Penis on this freshly imaged machine too. Office boy bursts out into teary-eyed hysterical laughter, I figure yeah-yeah, I get it, penis (man I miss high school). Only this time there was a subtle change; the windows logo next to the text was replaced with crudely drawn penis with and similar colour scheme. At this point I was unable to contain my laughter and chortled repeatedly, I got an ""I know, right?"" chortling from office boy in return, too. I haven't seen anything like this since my Amiga days (I posted elsewhere that the 'Revenge' virus on Amiga changes the mouse pointer into a penis)


Figuring it's something being messed with server-side, I start NwAdmin and dig around for a while. I found several lines of code appended to the login scripts of 'student' and 'library'; this script essentially maps network drives and starts rdp services prior to explorer.exe loading. One of the lines pointed to a .bat file on a publicly accessible drive


I open the aforementioned batch file, and am amazed at what I see. First line, @echo off, explains the blinking cursor and nothing more - Next few lines are conditional IF EXISTS statements to determine the likely windows version (and if the machine has already been patched). Next, xcopy is called to copy one of four possible Explorer.exe files from a publicly accessible directory, and finally, rundll is called with SHExitWindowsEx to reboot windows. I felt bad undoing the changes and deleting the files, but it had to be done


I then did a global search for explorer.exe on the student directory, and found one interesting hit in a 12th graders home folder. In this folder there were many revisions of explorer.exe, as well as MicroAngelo studio (icon editor) and HexEdit.exe - I found the culprit! Clearly this is one smart kid, and he'd definitely be suspended or expelled if caught. I removed the files and left him a README.TXT file explaining how I found him, that I could have lost my job, and that I won't be telling the staff. I actually lost my job a few days later anyway, so I didn't get a chance to hear what happened next.


As to how the infections started, it turns out the global login scripts for student and library were user-writeable (rightclick the ""N"" novell icon in the systray, edit login scripts) - this explains how many machines were affected in such a short time, and particularly how the ""Psycho!"" text only affected the library machines


...As for staff machines getting affected, it turns out some occasionally log in as students to participate in multiplayer starcraft/GTA! Oh how I miss those days.


**tldr; 12th grader finds out global login script is writeable, uses it replace explorer.exe on hundreds of machines, start menu text changed to ""Penis"" on staff &amp; student computers, staff were affected because they secretly joined student multiplayer games**

One of my users had been complaining of her pc being very slow. I diligently grabbed my memo pad and visited her desk. 

As I was taking a look at her machine she told me about how she used to be in IT (said she was a programmer) and how her husband is extremely good with computers. She says that he built the ultimate gaming rig and it is so amazing that he has to have a house fan on it to keep it cool!!!

She asked me if she should shut everything down and I told her no, I wanted to see her pc as she would have it during a normal day. I took notes on the configuration, (1GB of RAM, XP...P4), checked the processes running, cpu utilization, virtual memory, pagefile, basically overkill on the notes because I wanted to make a good decision. As it turns out, the president of the company happened by the desk and after talking to him he said to get her a nice new machine. Easy enough.

I did some shopping and came up with a machine for her, ordered it and notified her when she would be getting it. All was good.

The next morning she came to me, all excited with some papers in her hand. She said that her husband had told her the machine I had ordered her would not be powerful enough for her work. I took a deep breath and remembered that my dealings with everyone in the company are forming their perception of me as a member of the team.

I told her that it was already ordered and she said that I could cancel that order anytime; she was sure of it. She thrust the papers onto my desk and said that her husband had spent a few hours last night researching the exact machine she should get.

She had a number of points:

1. 4 GB of RAM was not going to be enough.
2. A core i5 wouldn't be powerful enough.
3. He had picked a few machines that would be more suitable.

I summoned every oodle of patience I had and explained to her that I had taken copious notes about her machine and how she used it. That I had then chosen a very suitable machine for her.

He had selected a gaming machine (said so right on the sheets of paper she had) and I explained to her how a gaming machine was not necessarily suitable for office duty. I showed her how it had a $450 video card in it. I showed her that while the machine I selected did indeed have only 4GB of RAM, that it had 3 open slots and upgrading in the future would be a simple matter and that further more she was only using 988 MB of the memory in her current machine (with full load of programs running)

Deep breath, I also showed her how the machine he had selected was 3 times more expensive then the one I picked. Lastly, I gently schooled her on why a core i7 just wasn't cost effective compared to the i5 I had selected.

I smiled at her and said her husband had great taste in computers and obviously knew his stuff. She seemed a bit befuddled but mercifully wandered away from my desk without any further issue.

Two weeks into my new job, and already I was slammed with things to do.

Our ticket queue was at 100 on any given day, which was fine. We usually had it reduced to 60 or less at the end of the day as is between me and the other office-based tech. A lot of it was the techs using it as a reminder system for work they were doing, too.

One of our major clients, a religiously affiliated high school, had ordered 451 - yes, 451 - Dell Latitude 10-ST2E slate PCs (x86-based Windows 8 Pro tablets) without consulting us.

Us.

Their IT firm.

ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

Nevertheless, we got in on it, and ripped their Dell rep a new one for telling them that one of the big points only available in Win8 Enterprise would be in Win8 Pro. As a result, Dell comped us a MAK for 1000 Win8 Enterprise licenses, plus the services of a project firm to get all the tablets reimaged and deployed.

It fell to me to get the image created, and after a night of cursing and swearing, since they were UEFI-only, and couldn't boot to PE3 or Win7 off their flash drives - and yes, I tried a lot. UEFI only likes signed things and FAT32 - I cursed, swore, and built a WinPE 4 boot USB with the Win8 installer and all the drivers slipstreamed in. An hour later, I had my install, and over the next day, I nurtured and crafted it into an image for the tablets, complete with pervasive branding (lock screens, Default user profile branding, default home pages, et cetera). Office 2013 Enterprise was installed (again, 1000-activation MAK. So nice), the programs they wanted (GloBible and a few others) were installed, and I tweaked the HELL out of it to go even faster than it should.

When I was satisfied with the gold master image, a Dell tech and I sat down the next morning, created a WIM from it, and split it to allow it to fit on the FAT32 flash drive (booting via UEFI, remember?). 6GB isn't half bad for a Win8 image, especially with Office installed. We handed it off to the imaging company, confident that they'd fuck it up somehow.

BOY, WERE WE RIGHT.

We got them back, and there had been a second local admin account added. No matter, we thought, we'd fix it.

Then we found out that the faculty and administration wanted a whitelist for the Windows Store.

This isn't possible, normally. Sure, Applocker will let you block apps from running or downloading, that's fine. We had our GPO in development for that. They didn't want them to even SEE apps that are PG-13 or higher on the store (T or higher, for you ESRB people). This had never been done... supposedly... and wasn't even supported by Microsoft.

Sure enough, some sysadmin in North Carolina had done it for his district, and Dell was desperately trying to hire him. We got in contact with him to mirror his setup, which worked pretty well. It also implemented, by the by, web filtering.

At any rate, I digress.

The tablets were imaged, rolled out to the students at the high school, and on launch day, we disabled the local admin accounts on the PCs via a single psexec command (psexec \\@assetlist.txt net user LOCAL_ADMIN_NAMES /active:no), where assetlist.txt contained the list of every tablet name (exported from AD as CSV, copypasta'd from Excel into Notepad). Due to a scheduling quirk and the sysadmin who was supposed to apply it being out for a few days, we didn't have the AppLocker whitelist GPO rolled out, but we had the Windows 8 management VM in place with the whitelisted apps installed, and the GPO was configured and ready to be linked.

I was sitting at the office, listening to Tears for Fears on Pandora and enjoying coffee, and the school's tech called me in a panic. ""Jack, what's going on there? Kids are downloading apps here! They've got Angry Birds on some tablets, I've seen Netflix on others, and one kid has pulled 4 gigs over the Internet connection! Didn't you roll out AppLocker yet?""

I sighed and got up from my chair. ""Cool your shit, Skeezix. I'm on my way to the high school, I'll see you there in 20."" A few clicks later, I was in the management VM, inside the Group Policy editor. I linked the GPO to the Student Tablets OU, then thought about something.

""GPupdate takes too long to check in and apply."" I tapped a finger on my chin. ""I have an idea.""

After a quick drive to the school, I met with the tech in the cafeteria, where lunch was being served. The kids were crowded around the ones who'd gotten their tablets, and a few were watching Netflix (one even had Breaking Bad on. I resolved to torrent that show when I got home that night). The tech was running his hands through his hair in frustration, and I smirked.

""So, what are we going to do?"" he said, resignation evident in his voice. ""They're saturating the Internet connection.""

""Well, it's easy,"" I replied, launching 2X on my phone and RDPing into the management VM, which I'd left a dialog box up on. ""The GPO is deployed and linked, it's active. We need them to check in and update the GPO. The easiest way is to take the tablets and restart them. That's not an option for these over-privileged little brats, though - remember what happened last week when we locked out all Apple devices thanks to them oversaturating BOTH Internet connections downloading iOS 7 on release day?""

At his nod, I flipped my phone around him and showed him the window up on the VM.

""Jack... what does 'shutdown -i' do?""

The target machine dialog had the list of every deployed tablet, and the message ""AH AH AH, YOU DIDN'T SAY THE MAGIC WORD"" in the comment field, with it set to restart with no warning to the users.

""Push the button, Frank,"" I said with a smirk, ripping off Dr. Forrester, and he tapped the OK button and kicked off a restart on every tablet in the school.

A minute or two later, the students were in an uproar when their tablets restarted... and the non-whitelisted apps - Netflix, Pandora, and the like - returned the message ""This app has been blocked by your system administrator.""

We stepped over to the microphone and speaker system that I'd asked the tech to bring in there before I arrived, and tapped the mic to ensure it was live.

""Attention, students,"" I said, my voice echoing over the cafeteria. ""We apologize that your tablets rebooted without warning and that you didn't have a chance to save your work."" The last word was said with clear snark. ""Please note that when your parents signed the agreement to let you all have the tablets, you agreed not to install applications. As such, we've just removed that temptation from you, since some of you can't be trusted. You know who you are.""

The clamor and rage-filled yells started up. ""We also would like to point out that the agreement included you all not trying to bypass security restrictions. So think twice before you try to do what we know you're going to try to do. I guarantee we'll know.""

I clicked the mic off, tossed it to the campus tech, and walked out of the cafeteria with the wailing and grinding of teeth of several hundred entitled whiny iPhone-wielding teenagers behind me.

*You know, I could get to like this job,* I thought. *I've never gotten to drop a mic before.*

phydeaux8635,180,360,1bqhds,1213,"Well, I worked for a small business company as their all-around IT guy.  I did everything from SBS2003 duties to managing backups to hardware/software installs to help desk.  This particular tale applies to the help desk portion of my job.  I had an office in the back right of the second floor of a two story ""O"" shaped building (had some nice planters and stuff in outside in the middle).

There was a woman that had just started for us in the Accounts department.  She was second to the Dept. head.  One day I see a ticket come up on our web interface saying that she has some computer issues, so being the IT guy that I am, I went to lunch first.

I get back from lunch, and she frantically calls me and tells me there is a bad virus on her computer, and can't do anything.  So after probing for a bit, I find that no matter what window she has open, she describes ""there are '0's all over my screen, and they won't go away!""  Sighing heavily, I get up from my desk and start the trek to her office (which is ironically on the first floor, front left corner of the building...literally the exact opposite end).  I get there, and she's standing in front of her desk in shock, attempting to open different applications.  I don't see a lot going on, so I open up notepad on the computer, and instantly it starts filling up: ""00000000000000000000000"", so I look down, and a binder is open on the ""0"" key of her numberpad.  I literally, in front of her, facepalmed and silently pointed to her keyboard, got up, and walked out of the office back to my game of solitaire.","""0"" Virus",1573

And now, the final installment...

   
  
   
If you've been reading the stories above, you know that all good things must come to an end. And at the end, there was nothing more for me in this, my very first IT job. It was time to let go, say goodbye, and ring down the curtain.

And it was time to do it with style.

---  

Now, the office manager and I had been involved in semi-friendly office-fu fighting for some months. He would demote me, I would use the spare time to embarass the crap out of him in front of his friends. He would try and lock me down, I would get a photo of me and the CEO smiling together and put it on my desk. He would try and loom menacingly over me, I would run my chair wheels over his shoes. We'd bring each other up on charges in front of tribunals and legal hearings, try and get each other fired, that sort of thing. Both of us were too slippery to really make anything stick, him because of his connections and me because I was smart and bored and I'd actually read the administrative process manuals.  

So the stage was set for a showdown.  

Now one of the things the office manager was very smug about was that he'd decreed (not openly, of course) that I was under his permanent control. I would not be escaping out of his influence unless I actually quit, and I was too stubborn to do so. Although his hobby was breaking new staff, making them resign or have breakdowns, he'd never been successful with me. But he wanted to break me. Oh, he wanted it bad. And that was his weakness.

   
  
   
Once I'd decided that it was time for me to move on, I had to find a way to do so without the office manager interfering with the process. So I set up a little misdirection a few weeks before I took my vacation. I mailed some paperwork to the capital city, I took a day off, and used that day to visit over twenty other offices of my employer in the city. I only spent a few minutes at each one, and what I did was to ask to see the manager (or acting manager), and tell them that I was interested in moving away from my current office and into theirs. I brought copies of my CV and examples of all the savings I'd made and work I'd done to date taking my office to the top of the state rankings. Some of the managers had even heard of me, which was quite gratifying. And I would thank them and move on to the next office, and the next, and the next.  

I got back to work the next day, and let it slip in conversation about where I'd been. This in turn got back to the office manager, as planned, and he was furious! I might weasel out from under his control! He'd be putting a stop to this, by thunder! And so he kept an eagle eye out for any incoming contact from other offices, and when they expressed an eager interest in acquiring my services, he would shred the messages and tell them I wasn't available. This kept him so busy that he didn't notice me taking a rather long and intense call on my lunch break, or that the call originated from the national capital, from within a quite different branch of the Service.  

After he'd concluded that he had stamped out any chance of me getting a job from any of the other offices in the city, he was quite, quite pleased with himself - until the events where (as noted previously) I acquired a photograph of myself and the CEO together. He instantly swung into action, and contacted his network of cohorts and those the location of whose skeletons he knew. It took him quite some time, but he eventually nailed down the chance of me being promoted or transferred AT ALL without his say-so as office manager. So now I couldn't go anywhere. Not in the city, not in the state, not in the country, not even to another Department. I was completely, absolutely, totally stuck. As far as he knew.  

The manager, worn out from all these activities, knew it was worth it - he'd won! There was nothing I could do and nowhere I could go. And so, when the Department was merged with a little mini-department the week after, and their staff were being placed tempoarily in our offices in various positions, the office manager decided that he was going to take his first vacation in ten years. He did this in the knowledge that his job would be filled by an incoming manager from the other department, and that that manager would be completely useless because the office was actually run by the triumverate of nasty under-managers who would proceed to eat his replacement alive, meaning he would be all too glad to move on after that time. Oh, and just in case I got sneaky, the replacement manager could NOT authorize any of the office staff to be promoted, transferred out of the Department, or even permanently transferred *inside* the Department.  

   
  
   
And so it came to pass. And verily, the replacement manager did turn up, and verily he was rapidly reduced to a deer-in-the-headlights look as the office triumverate pretty much tore him to pieces and he retreated to the small glass office near my desk to hide and wait out his two weeks. Which is where I found him.  

O Captain, I said to him, I have a request to make of you. For today, you are going to get a request from one of the offices in this city, an office which I have not physically visited on my day off but which I have kept in contact with through other means. The request will be that I be transferred to that office for a temporary period of one month. You are going to authorize this request, and you are going to do it the moment it arrives. For verily, I am young and confident and you currently have the mental fortitude of Jello, and I seem to be the only person in this establishment who both knows what they are talking about and is not actively undermining you every hour of the day.  

And yea, did the request arrive, and yea, did the replacement manager sign it, for as the office manager he had the authority to sign temporary inter-office transfers for the purposes of cross-training and such buzzword-compliant purposes. And thus did I pack my desk and head off to the other office for, as it seemed on the surface, the duration of one month only.

   
  
   
A minor victory, you might imagine. For the temporary manager could not authorize more than one month away, and after that I would have to return to my place under the thumb of the freshly vacationed original office manager.  

Only... there was that little matter of the paperwork I had sent to another Department, in the national capital. It had been an application. And the phone call I had taken during lunch, while the office manager was occupied with other matters, had been my interview. And I had won the job.  

Except that in order to take it, I would need to be released from the Department by my office manager. You may recall that the temp manager did not have that authority.  

...but the manager at the office I'd be at for one month? COULD.  

   
  
   
No, wait, that's not quite the right word. What's the one I'm looking for? Oh yes...

**DID.**  

I mean, I did mention above that I'd been in communication with this other office for a while, yes? And that the computer macros I'd developed turned out to be *very* well-suited to taking offices right to the top of the state listings? Especially as I'd been refining them?  

You see, it turns out that apparently some office managers are actually *interested* in being at the top of the rankings. Particularly if it meant knocking my old office and its smug snake of a manager out of the top spot. And so it came to pass that my new office suddenly leapt from the bottom of the barrel to being the new golden child in about two weeks. Which was exactly the amount of time it took for the paperwork to come through from the other Department, for me to pack my life into a suitcase and hop a plane for Capital City, and for me to achieve a great big honkin' triple promotion and pay rise in what was my second-only tech support position ever.  

   
  
   
The change of status, as with all other personnel changes within the Service, was categorized, recorded, and dryly published in small writing in the Service Gazette.  

I photocopied the relevant section, blew it up onto an A3 sheet, and mailed it to my old office manager.

---  

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of how I slipped the noose, put the dust of my home town behind me, came to the  Capital, and started working for a very powerful government department indeed.  

During my time there, I would see many things. I would work on infrastructure the government swore didn't exist. I would learn to program in Perl. I would completely revamp the IT support section from the ground up, and I would learn that government servers are home to a truly stupendous amount of porn.  

I would take over two hundred calls a day. I would see my first truly multilanguage batch file in the wild. And it was at this very job, dear readers, that I received The One Call I will Never Forget.

Warlizard,467,438,1q3wpz,1193,"I've been waiting to get some more info before I updated so here it is, with clarification on exactly what happened:

Here's the original post - http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ps0ae/tldr_accounting_firm_gets_cryptolocker_virus_tech/

It turns out that what they wiped was ALL of the local backups -- they still have the files that were encrypted by the virus.

I have spoken with the owner god knows how many times and it has been frustrating.

From the get-go, the owner's actions have baffled me. I told her that if she just sent me the encrypted key, I'd see if I could crack it, but she's apparently so tech-un-savvy that she simply doesn't know how to do anything at all with it. 

Her tech has been with her for more than a decade and is a family friend, however, he bolted and she can't reach him.

Naturally, she's pissed off as hell at him because, well, he deleted all the Carbonite backups, deleted Carbonite, forgot the password and can't install it back.

From one of the comments in the last post, I learned that the hackers who created the virus are now allowing people to log into an onion site through Tor, send an encrypted file, pay about 2k in bitcoins, then they promise they'll send the unencryption key plus a utility to unlock everything.

The owner is naturally skeptical that she'll get the key after paying 2k, plus the world of the deep web may as well be wizardry, plus since her tech guy is AWOL, she really has no one to help her out.

I told her that I'd log into her server, grab the carbonite-encryption.pem key and see if I could get the password from it, but I guess she got too busy last night to do it.

This morning she sent me a text asking if we could do it today, however, it's my birthday.

I don't work on my birthday. At all. Period. Today is the day I fuck off and do precisely what I want, without thinking about anything other than doing fun things.

To that end, I'm going to eat food that's bad for me, drink concoctions that will inebriate me, spend time with people of ill-repute, and do nothing at all of any value.

Tomorrow, when I get the file, I'm going to throw the 64-bit cuda version of hashcat at it and see what happens.

I've already pulled  down a 2GB collection of dictionaries, but let's be real -- the odds are low.

This whole thing has been really bizarre. The owner should have thrown the $300 at the original people and gotten her shit back, the tech should have WRITTEN DOWN THE FUCKING PASSWORD, they never should have wiped the backups, deleted Carbonite, only had one backup, etc., but hey, this is the perfect storm of shitty and it is what it is.

I've learned a ton of interesting stuff so for that reason alone, it has been worth it.

Anyway, I'm off to get the mirror on my car fixed (fuck Mercedes and their $400 bill) that I foolishly cracked when I tapped the gates leaving my community, get a hair cut, and I'll continue to snapchat the fuck out of the day.

Oh, and I've gotten the best snaps from you guys and it's really fun, so if you're bored, add me (Warlizard) and you TOO can see absolutely nothing of interest from the great state of Arizona :)

Laterz.

EDIT: First of all, wasn't trying to be a pretentious fucktard about the mirror, was just angry with myself for being a dumbass and hitting the gate because I was trying to beat it closing.

Next, just had my car washed and the guys there are replacing the mirror, fixing the cracked turn signal on the front of it, fixing the crack in the bumper, repainting the bumper, detailing the car and wet-sanding / waxing the whole car for a bit more than the dealership wanted to just replace the mirror glass. So fuck the dealership.

The owner told the tech that he should cover half of the cost to get this shit fixed and that's when he bolted. If I were in her shoes, I'd pay the 2k and hope I didn't get fucked. It seems to me that the only way this scam works is if the hackers actually do what they say they're going to do. Sure, some people would pay the 300 out of desperation and maybe some would lose, but when people start paying 2k, if someone, *anyone* doesn't get their information back, then far fewer people would be inclined to pay at all.

Anyway, time to grab something to eat. I've been enjoying the snaps from you guys and the cool birthday wishes. I know that I'm not 5 years old and I shouldn't give a shit about something as trivial as a birthday, but fuck it. I do. It's fun and it's what you make it.

EDIT 2: I know this really isn't the place, but I need to source a good tech for a friend of mine who's looking for a full-time IT guy to manage his offices. PC stuff, Server 2003/8, networking, etc. It's a salaried position, not paying crazy, but about 35k plus health care. If anyone is interested and in the Phoenix area, please let me know. It's a hodge-podge of crap and you will be unappreciated, plus the hours are long, but it's an interesting challenge, mostly because managing a heterogeneous environment held together with duct-tape and the tears of the frustrated can be pretty fun.",[UPDATE] - TL;DR - Accounting firm gets Cryptolocker Virus.

HigherEdSysadmin,193,300,1eb9ph,1186,"Like many of you here, I'm a departmental sysadmin at a university.  Over the years, our staff has gotten fewer and fewer, so we all have to pitch in for major events and special conferences.  That's fine, I'm a team player, blah blah blah.  Plus, special events break up the routine and give me something different to do.

So this week, we're hosting a conference for about 120 people, roughly half of them from outside our university.  We're holding it (for the first time) at a new conference facility that opened up on our campus a couple years back.  Convenient, right?

Well, what's become evident very quickly is that the people running the conference center are small time.  They're accustomed to holding small alumni lunches, departmental faculty meetings, that sort of thing.  They aren't really prepared for large conferences involving a high number of non-University attendees.  

Example: the assistant operations manager, when told the caterers needed to get in at 5:30AM to set up breakfast, said, ""Really?  I have to get here that early?""  Yes, you do.  Unless you want to give the caterers a key.  They can't set up breakfast in the parking lot.

So anyway, two months ago, this same person told me, ""Yes, we have free guest wireless.""  Great.  I'm assuming that this means some sort of open visitor wifi, perhaps time-restricted, like you'd often find in a hotel convention center, or hospital, etc.

Over the past two weeks, I've wanted to gain more information so I could put it in the program book (yes, I'm designing and printing the program books, 'cause no one else knows how to do something like that.  Apparently.)

Come to find out, ""yes we have free guest wireless"" means something different to them than it does to me.  For our attendees who are affiliated with this University, no problem.  We all have an assigned University username and password which will work to log on to the facility's wifi network.

For our non-University guests, it's a different story.  There's no available blanket visitor network.  The University does have a way to purchase visitor wifi access, at a nominal charge.  The money is no problem; but each person has to be registered individually with their own email address and phone number; since we're allowing on-site registration, this isn't something that can be done for everyone in the past.

I talked to the operations manager about this, expressing my displeasure that his assistant had told us there was free guest wifi two months ago.  He proceeds to explain to me that I'm ""confused,"" that they do in fact have free guest wifi.  When they have an event with outside attendees, what he does is log them on to the University wifi using HIS OWN USERNAME AND PASSWORD, and he suggests that I do the same, for our 50-60 external attendees.  I should log them in with MY OWN USERNAME AND PASSWORD, the same credentials that access my financial records, my grades/transcript (I was a student here), my IT-specific resources on campus, etc., etc.  And again he is ""sorry for my confusion"" on the matter.

Now, I doubt that any of our external guests would be using their laptops during the meeting to download kiddie porn or pirate software.  But I'm not going to essentially promise that by logging them on with my own credentials, thus putting my career at risk!!  I also doubt they have a keylogger installed, or some other way to cache/capture my password.  But they might -- I don't know these people!!

I sent off a stunned email to the IT guy who ""sort of"" manages their network for them (the fact that they don't have full-time IT support is clearly a factor here) and he says ""Yeah, I've told them about that in the past, I'll remind them.""

I needed to back up his files and settings, create a new user profile, and delete the old one.

laboheme1984,217,256,1ggb45,1183,"Hey guys, I was told to post this here since I was the unofficial tech person for my company.


For the past 7 years I have worked for the same company. Without getting overly specific, I market our material to agencies, manage our media, do some HTML5 coding and do graphic design work. We are a small company and I am the resident tech person, so I am a jack of all trades. Over the years I have grown to dislike the people that I work with immensely. They have:


Stolen my food (I am gluten intolerant so I make the effort to make my own food...and people go through my lunch and eat it anyway), stolen my tupperwear, they are completely inconsiderate with my time, they are condescending and I am routinely taken for granted. I have gotten verbally assaulted more times than I can count and I am severely underpaid. I can't even use them as a reference for future jobs because I simply can't trust them - the person that had my position before me used my boss as a reference (and my boss agreed to give him a good recommendation), and I heard my boss trashing my predecesor to a potential employer over the phone. Super classy.


I am quitting this terrible job to go back to school. When they hired my replacement, they got someone as cheaply as they could, and the person they chose didn't have any background in any kind of graphic design/media/web. They think so little of my job that they didn't think my replacement needed any experience whatsoever.

Anyway, training this new guy has been an absolute trainwreck. In 5 days he's nearly destroyed our website and he sent defective media to a sales rep and made a fool of her in a large meeting. At this point I assumed that I'd train my replacement and say goodbye to this company for good with minimal drama - they selected someone without a proper background, they can deal with it.


Last week had been busy since we have clients in, and I brought my personal computer in to help with the load, since my replacement has been on my company computer to 'learn the ropes'. I have brought my personal computer in before when we have been in a squeeze, and I have been compensated ($10 a day, nothing crazy). I brought up compensation this time around, and my boss gets in my face, and says, ""I didn't realize your computer came with a fee. I thought you had been sharing the company computer with your replacement.""


I had obviously not been sharing my company computer with my replacement, since we had been working in entirely different offices. My boss had even requested that I set up multiple webpages on my personal computer during this time. He was playing dumb and lying to my face.


I didn't say anything because I knew whatever came out of my mouth at that moment wouldn't be constructive. However, I did think, ""You have made a HUGE mistake.""


I didn't bring my computer into work the next week and the entire workload was shifted to my replacement. I was working in the respect that I was going over things that my replacement didn't understand (which was a lot, lol), but I wasn't able to work independently since my replacement and myself were sharing one machine. At one point my boss asked me why a project that he gave me wasn't done, and I said, ""Well, since I am sharing a computer with my replacement, and he's been really busy with the clients, I haven't had a chance to get to it."" My boss looked unhappy but was unable to admit his mistake - and by the time he realized the extent of his mistake, it was too late.


Since I wasn't there to shoulder the workload, the under-experienced replacement floundered, the entire company looked incompetent and we lost future jobs with the clients (there were two clients, which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost) that we had in our office. I watched the world burn. This past week was my last week, and this was a sweet way to go out.


TLDR: I bring in my personal computer to help make a busy week more manageable, my boss refused to offer the most minimal of compensation, so I don't bring my computer in anymore and watch all hell break loose.",You have made a HUGE mistake. [X Post from Petty Revenge],1439
FredFltStn,165,391,1r22gy,1175,"A few years ago, I used to support an ancient app that ran in a DOS window on the desktop. The app was actually written is basic, if that tells you anything. As you can imagine, support was a bitch.

We had a user that was having a strange issue with printing. Every time he tried to print something from my application, 28 copies came out of the printer. This only happened when printing from my app. When printing from Microsoft office, everything was fine and dandy.  The user opened up a ticket to the Desktop support team for resolution.

The guy had an ancient LaserJet printer hooked up to his PC. The PC had been recently refreshed, so when the desktop support team couldn’t figure out the issue, they passed the ticket back to hardware, and hardware had the desktop replaced for a second time. No luck on a fix, and the ticket was passed back to Desktop support.

Actually, the desktop support team had sent techs out four different times, but had been unable to resolve the issue, and the ticket had bounced around to several different support groups over the course of a few weeks. It finally made it to my queue, leaving a trail of defeated techs in its wake.

I visited the user on-site, and must have spent an hour trying to figure out what was going on. As the ticket said, he could print fine from all of the other apps, but printing a single page from my app resulted in 28 copies. He must have had 1000 sheets of wasted paper sitting in his recycle bin from all of the useless copies.

My app actually printed through the LPT1 port. I checked the setup, and everything seemed fine. The app was designed to send directly to the printer, and there was actually no way to request additional copies through the app, so I knew that couldn’t be the problem. I checked the printer, and it seemed normal. I was seriously stumped, and had tried just about everything I could think of. 

Out of options, I started playing with the printer again, and going through the various menus. It had been a long time since I’d messed with one of the older LaserJet’s. After about 5 minutes, I blundered across the issue. 

In one of the menus, his printer had been manually set for 28 copies. The other desktop apps apparently used their app print settings to override the built in LaserJet setting, so they would always print the selected number of copies. My app just sent the basic info to the printer, so the printer used the build in print menu when printing.

We had easily spent more than 30 man hours bouncing the ticket around and trying to fix the damn thing, not to mention a case of paper. Modern tech at its finest.

mattyparanoid,95,336,1qm11a,1175,"A short but aggravating one for this fine Thursday morning. 

Yesterday on the way home from work I got an email from our UPS that we went on battery power and 1 second later went back on to grid power. No big deal, we have a generator and it didn't even kick on. This happens all the time. A few minutes later I got a call from one of my users saying they had no network. He was cool with walking down the hall to the switch closet and he quickly found the switch had not kicked back on. Powered up, good to go.

First thing this morning I go over to that building and check everything out. As I am walking down the hall I hear an UPS beeping, calling out to me, ""change my battery, change my battery"" with the incessant beeping I have come to know and love.

Trouble was, I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from... It wasn't the one in the switch closet. Our buildings are rectangles with a hall on the inner perimeter and the acoustics are crazy. A conversation at one corner of the hall can be heard with ease at the opposite corner.

So I stood in the hallway and waited, 2 minutes beep, beep, beep: can't tell where. I enlist the help of our facility manager who is making his morning rounds. BUT he tells me he lost most of his hearing long, long ago in a previous job.

2 minutes later; beep, beep, beep so tantalizingly close, but still cannot tell which direction. I move down the hall and attempt to gain the help of one of our engineers (construction, not IT) but he is unable to hear it and has work to do.

It went on like this for about 20 minutes until I was re-positioning for the 4th or 5th time and the facility manager found me in the hall listening and said, ""Oh, that was probably the microwave. Someone had left their food in it and it was beeping. I just stopped it""

df1000,336,400,1c9mh4,1169,"A few months ago a co-worker named T stormed into my office looking rather frazzled.  T is a retired government employee who was clearly not hired for his computer skills.

I ask him about the cause of his irritation and he tells me that his email has been hacked.  I change his password and start heading down to his office to check out his workstation.  On the way he informs me that it wasn't his work email that got hacked it was his personal email.

Do not care levels are rising rapidly, but I tell him the SOPs.  Change all you passwords run scans on your home computer with these programs etc.  

I head back to my office and about five minutes later T. is back and  angry, talking about how much he hates computers.  I'm wondering why I'm the target of all this anger, but realize that IT tends to be the target of much misplaced frustration.  He informs me that he can't remember his aol password and that's the account that was hacked in the first place.  He then starts bitching about how he's been paying them for all these years and that he just called them to get it reset and that they shouldn't have their phone support run by (insert racist term of your choice here) Indians.  

I do a double take when I hear the words PAY and AOL in the same sentence and wonder if I have been somehow transported back in time.

I ignore the giant WTF sign blinking in my head and try to inform him that there is no conceivable reason to be giving AOL money.  He stays angry and I get nowhere.

rolemartyr-x,220,306,1ox1v3,1164,"Basic Help Desk setting, we take care of AD account lockouts and whatnot, along with pretty much everything else.  A tool was passed down to me that allows you to check a person's AD account, see when they last entered a bad password, the lockout state, the last time the person changed their password, etc.  It's not exactly on the list of approved programs to use, but it definitely comes in handy.  

We often have people locked out of their accounts who INSIST that they are entering their password correctly.  Most often, this occurs when they are setting up email on their smartphone, and they fat-finger the password, but don't realize it.  The passwords are the same passwords users use to log into their web apps.

I receive a call one day from a lady who is trying to set up her email on her phone.  She keeps receiving an error that her username or password is incorrect.  I check her account, and it is indeed locked out.  I unlock it and ask her to try entering the password again, as it won't accept it if she is locked out.  She enters the password again and receives the same error.  I check my nifty little account lockout tool and see it registered a bad password less than 30 seconds ago.  I don't like to give away that I can see my users are idiots, especially since the program is supposed to stay on the DL, so I just ask her to try one more time.  She gives me an earful about how she's *NOT* stupid and that she can obviously enter her password correctly, but complies.  Same error.

At this point she's furious and telling me that it's my fault she has to change her password every 90 days and she always has this problem.  I can hear the clicking of her iPhone as she types in her password each time, and I can tell she's typing fairly quickly.  I ask her to slow down her typing to ensure she's not pressing the wrong button.  Another earful and another quickly-typed wrong password.  She says something about how this should work since she can get to her web apps and it's our fault it doesn't work on her phone.  I get an idea.  I ask her to go to her computer and try to log in to her web app, but before she is able to, I go to the web app, type in her username, and type in my personal password 3 times, intentionally locking her out of her account.  She tries to log in to the web app, and, of course, cannot get in.  

Now she has the revelation that maybe she *is* typing it incorrectly.  I quickly unlock her account and suggest she tries logging in to the web app again, typing slowly and carefully.  Somewhat mockingly, she slowly punches each key while saying it out loud to **MAKE SURE** I can hear her typing slowly.  Magically, she is able to log in.  Now I ask her to do the same thing on her phone, since we know she has the right password.  She types it in slowly on her phone and *gasp* IT WORKS!

At least, I assume it does.  She hung up on me with a *click* that sounded a lot like shame.

So I'm running out of ideas, and ask her if she uses email regularly.  She does, so I hope into MS paint, take a screenshot of the page, and draw a big green arrow pointing to where she has to click to scroll down. 

I'm sure you know the rest from there. 

5 minutes goes by ""I am clicking it, nothing it moving down it isn't working"".  me: ""are you sure you're clicking right where I indicated?  are you sure your screen isn't moving at all?""  yes yes yes.

SanityInAnarchy,250,370,tuolx,1160,"As long as we're sharing school stories, and since I don't think I've posted this one here yet, I thought I'd share a few stories of ""hacking"" with such illicit tools as Windows Explorer, Firefox, and right-click.

The first incident was the year my high school tried to have a programming elective. They were trying to teach Java, but the IDE and associated tools were nowhere to be found. I thought I'd look around drive C to see if I could find them. The network admin showed up, saw me with Windows Explorer open, and said ""Stop. I don't care what you're doing, just stop."" Pretty much word-for-word, with a tone that suggested any second now I might hear ""Step away from the computer...""

This being high school, I was teased for ""hacking"" the system for quite awhile. I didn't think much of it until, much later, I discovered that while the network folders were locked down with reasonable permissions, the local drive was entirely world-writable. So Windows explorer was actually enough for a DoS of sorts -- I could open C:\WinNT and just start deleting things. Or worse, if I was clever enough to rootkit them. I wasn't, and I didn't care, it was just fascinating. Maybe someone upgraded from a FAT32 drive? How does this happen?

**TL;DR: Surprisingly justified paranoia.**

While I'm at it, the admin did manage to lock down which programs could be run. He did so by a whitelist, apparently, as there would be a number of login scripts which would fail because of this on every login.

Few students were willing to risk putting such illicit material as Doom on the network drive, so we loaded it onto USB keys, along with a portable Firefox -- Flash wasn't installed, so this allowed us to play Flash games, as well as easily configure proxies. (I also ran a proxy outside the school network, as the school had the ISP filtering content for us, and an actual Squid proxy pretty much completely defeated this filtering.)

How was this possible? Doom and Firefox certainly weren't on the whitelist! Ah, but notepad.exe was, and it was entirely by executable name. Not even the full path, just the filename. Once I discovered this, we all had multiple subfolders consisting of various 'notepad.exe' files. Any class in which we all had access to a computer lab and were ever left unsupervised would devolve into a Legacy Doom LAN party -- these may have been ancient NT4 machines, but Doom was much older and ran perfectly.

[deleted],372,443,1ewjb9,1153,"I got a call from my MIL this morning complaining that her computer wouldn't turn on. As in, it wouldn't boot at all. Nothing appeared on the screen when she pressed the power button. After a few questions, I found out what happened.

Windows was updating. It had downloaded and installed the updates, and when it rebooted, it had one final phase of updates to install. Even though the screen said ""Don't power off your computer"", she did just that by forcing it to power off...by just removing the laptop battery. While it was updating.

So now her computer is screwed. She lives in the States and I'm in Canada, so I couldn't really advise her on any quick fixes, especially since the laptop is completely unresponsive. I just suggested she find a reputable local tech support guy to come and take a look at it, but it seems like she might have caused a power surge and fried something. Anyway, I thought it was sadly amusing that even though the only thing that was on the screen was text saying ""Don't turn off your computer"", she did just that. There is clearly no such thing as idiot-proof. I wonder if, when she sees a sign saying ""Wet paint"", she touches it anyway.


UPDATE: She took it to a professional computer repair place.

UPDATE #2: The repair place discovered that she had inadvertently installed a second virus scanner (I had set her up with Avast), most likely as the result of downloading and installing some other software that came with a free trial. The two virus scanners were interfering with each other and she got a virus as a the result. Then the whole Windows update fiasco happened. Because she barely knows anything about computers, I couldn't get the specifics from her, but ultimately her computer got fixed and the money and time it cost her has (hopefully) taught her not to power down in the middle of an update again.",My mother-in-law may have fried her computer because she didn't read the only text on the screen.,1596
Cyfun06,178,331,1q3a4b,1152,"Used to work at a cable ISP callcenter.  Many of you probably know that cable modems have... or used to have... a Standby button on the top, and if you hit it, it would essentially turn off your internet.  God forbid they call the button something logical like Off or Internet Disabled.  Us TSAs loved these calls though cause it was the easiest fix in the world.

I should also mention that we had an automated voice recording where if a person lived in or near a city with a known outage, it'd just tell them while they're on hold so they didn't have to wait to talk to a real person.  Unfortunately, it was activated per city, so it was often overkill if the outage was small.

One day, a dude gets through to me cause his internet has been down for days and he asks when the outage will be fixed.  I tell him there's some work being done across town, but no outages affecting him directly.  Have him look at his modem, and sure enough, it's in Standby.  He presses the button and his internet returns.

I ask him the required ""Is there anything else I can help you with today?"" He says he wants his account credited for his lack of internet the past few days.  He's not yelling at me or being pissy or anything, just says it matter of fact-ly.  I explain to him that there was no outage, his internet wasn't down, he'd somehow bumped that button and shut off the internet from his end. The problem was entirely on his end.

He argued that he had no way of knowing what that button meant, that nobody explained it when it was installed and he never received a modem manual.  I pointed out that had he called sooner, we could have fixed it immediately. He said that he actually called several times over the past few days, and the automated recording said there was an outage affecting his area, so he hung up.

I tried a bit more to argue against it, but in all fairness, he was right, we did make things pretty confusing. Plus, he wasn't bitching me out, which I did appreciate.  And we had the authority to credit people up to $50 without requiring approval.  So I crunched the numbers real quick, and told him at $50 a month and being down for 3 days was only $5.  ""It's enough for a six-pack,"" he says, and I agreed and credited it to him.

tikrin,263,311,tbbq2,1157,"So, working for a nonprofit organization here! I got hired back in '09 to help the IT Director with any software solutions needed for the organization.

2010 comes along, and they decide that I should also be the one that services help desk work orders. So now, it is my responsibility to write any software solution, whether it be a PHP/mySQL website, a VB.net site, a WPF Information kiosk, or an iOS app, but to also make sure that I assist any of the other 150 employees with tech support by phone, email, or in person.

2011 comes along and I graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science, they bump me up to salary so that I don't have a reason for ignoring phone/email tech support in the evening. This seems good to me because I'm finally getting paid more than $8.5/hr.($15/hr). At this time, our IT office consists of 3 people: Boss, Tikrin, and Derpette. Boss sits in his lair and only helps with work orders if I can directly prove that he has messed up on his DNS,switch, server, or router settings. Derpette is a VOLUNTEER. This is where I suppose the story comes in.

Derpette, sometime in 2010, created a Yahoo! Small business website. From that moment, she started to email our ""comments"" email about how she could improve our websites that we have. Back to 2011, administration at the organization have decided that it would be great for her to volunteer and help me out with the websites. Always looking for a break, we sit down and discuss what we both know. I quickly find out that she has no idea what HTML is, no idea what a motherboard is, no idea on anything tech support related besides some intermediate Windows knowledge.

I try informing the higher ups that she doesn't have a skillset that would really benefit IT, I get reprimanded for trying to turn away someone who wants to volunteer. So, Derpette starts showing up on a daily basis. She's a grandma, btw. Late 40s, early 50s. I finally provide a back end interface solution for some of our websites. This is good, because she understands this. She starts spellchecking, and making sure blogs look good. Something I don't have to worry about, this works for me.

Towards November of 2011, she gets hired as a part time staff member. She assumes the role of answering any tech support emails she can. I've been able to teach her how to log into Active Directory so she can reset passwords, taught her about security groups, and several other things. She's finally catching on to tier 1 tech support things. 

Boss finally installs a time clock server so I no longer have to walk 100 yards to another department to clock in/out with card. However, they set up Derpette, in a secretarial role, to manage my time clock. So if I forget to clock in, she would be the one to approve of the time clock.

Alright, so, some time goes by and she has begun to email me any work orders she can't do, and she's approving my time worked. Being a good ole secretary, or so I thought.

December 2011, I email my Boss personally to ask if I can help out with another department for 2 hours a week. I tell him I understand I wasn't hired for that role, and it's completely okay if I can't. It was just something that I would love to do, and would rather try to do it, than not. I also tell him that I understand if he has to take it higher up. He replies with a ""I'll see what they say"", and CCs Derpette to let her know that I may be doing this for 2 hours a week.

I, immediately, get a response from Derpette to only me, asking why I thought it was okay to email my boss first instead of her. She starts rambling about a chain of authority and how I shouldn't circumvent it. I inform her that Boss is my boss, and the first person I should be asking. She responds with another email saying that we will talk personally about this the next day.

Next day comes along, and nothing is said. *shrugs*. Over the next couple of weeks, she starts sending me mediocre work orders. Work orders that she could handle. I inform her that I'm busy working on an Admin-approved programming assignment, and she says that I should do them because she wouldn't have sent them to  me otherwise. Oooookay.

So, I do the work orders. Trying to squeeze in the programming projects that I have deadlines on. Eventually, it starts getting ridiculous. We have a remote location, 45 miles away. They email to say that their dual monitors are not working anymore on one of the computers. Derpette emails them back and says that I would gladly start driving that way.

I inform her that I would not and that we could either try to remote in, or they could bring it to us.(They have a ""runner"" that comes to us everyday). Remote location says that isn't a problem and the runner gives us the computer. I hook it up, and it works perfectly. I double check just to make sure, and give it back with two new DVI cables. I even write down some instructions of how to set up dual monitors.

A week goes by, and I show up to work. I'm now tasked to drive 45 miles to the remote location because ""I"" didn't fix anything. Everyone is gone from the location that day so I can't remote in. I have to drive there and fix it. Disgruntled, I get a company car and make the drive. I get there and lo and behold, one of the DVI cables is not hooked up. Simply hook it up, and yep, dual monitors working. I take a picture and text it to Derpette for accountability that the problem is now fixed. I then start to head back to my office, 45 miles away. 

She corresponds with me a little bit on the road, and everything seems okay. I reach the outskirts of our town when she emails back and says, ""BTW, did you fix the other thing they needed done?""

I, having no idea, responded. ""I have no idea what you're talking about.""

She then forwards me an email between the remote location and her. In the PS section, the remote location asks for me to look at another monitor hookup. She adds to the email, ""Do you not know what a monitor looks like? This needs to be done, so turn around and go do it.""

I flip, park my car, and then send an email letting her know how sick I am of her attitude. She responds back all hurt saying that she is offended. Once again, it ends with a, ""We'll discuss in person tomorrow.""

So I drive back to the remote location, and the monitor turns on with a shake of a mouse.

NEXT DAY: I come to work, having no reason or want to talk to Derpette. She walks into my office, closes the door, and pulls up a chair. She then says, ""It's sad that I have to tell you I'm your boss...but I'm your boss. And you should consider yourself lucky, or you would be fired after what you emailed me yesterday."" My boss then walks in to crack a joke about something(I could tell from his smirk), but she quickly demands that he leave so that ""we"" could talk. She then rants on about how she has been my boss ever since the time clock server was installed and was absolutely shocked that I didn't pick up on that. 

I tell her that no one has ever told me that she was my boss, and that if she was, I am sorry. Her response was ""No one should have to tell you that I'm your boss, you should just know. I'll have to bring this up to Administration, because your lack of respect isn't going to get you anywhere.""

Two days go by, and I get pulled into Administration. I'm completely baffled that I'm being called by them, and surely I'm not getting fired? Nope! They apologize for Derpette's behavior and have no idea where she got the notion she was my boss. If she ever tried to do something like that again, I should only need to tell them.

So, it ended well, but geez, she got crazy.

So I wave and say hello!

She also says hello, and tells me to follow her. I'm confused at this point, but she's also thanking me for stopping by. So I follow her to her office, where she tells me that she has to run, but she's leaving her computer and her door unlocked so I can work the ticket she put in

Computermaster,377,379,1acolq,1133,"I figured it's about time I shared one of my gems on here. This happened when I was in 10th grade and doing some freelance computer work.

One of the guys I did work for was at that time my mom's boss, we'll call him L. He and his wife ran this little dental lab with only two computers. He had one up front that was still running Windows 98 (not even SE, and also had never been defragged in the 10 years it had been running) and one in his office that was running XP.

So one day he called me up to transfer all his data to his brand new shiny Vista machine from the XP machine. (Win7 had not been released). So I spend two to three hours moving everything, installing programs, the normal blah with a new setup. I get it done, get my paycheck ($120, not bad) and head on home.

Now while I was setting it up, I told him to next time consult me before buying a new machine since he went out and bought an e-Machine instead of having me build it for him and even showed him I could've made it much cheaper and with no bloatware.

A few weeks later he calls me up and says he bought another new computer. At first I think ""Man, I told him to call me before he got one"" but then I also though ""He's finally replacing that damn 98 machine"".

So I head up there and look in the front office: No new system, 98 still chugging. Then I walk into his office. His oldnew (the Vista) machine is already semi-torn down and off to the side. On his desk is sitting a nice, shiny, huge iMac. Immediately I point out to him that the software he uses will not run on a Mac system. He says, ""I know. I want you to do that Boot Camp thing and put Windows XP on it."" He tells me he hated Vista and so I just use my own install CD and steal the key off the old, original XP system. 

Of course I say nothing and do my job, installing Boot Camp, transferring data and programs again. So after a few hours, I get done, get another check and then I turn and ask him: ""So if all you wanted was XP back, why did you get an iMac? I could've just put it on that e-Machine."" 

He then tells me his story about going to the Apple store to buy an iPod and of this *salesman* who tells him about all the wonderful features of the new $1,700 iMacs such as how you can run Windows and all your Windows programs on it and how Macs will *never* get a virus. 

He then looks me straight in the face and is dead serious, ""So naturally I assumed that if you installed Windows on a Mac, then Windows would never get a virus.""

Of course I explained things to him to the best of his ability and I think he got it. AFAIK, that Vista machine still sits unused in his closet (he told me he was gonna take it home, although I suggested using it to replace the 98 machine) and I believe he's never once booted it into Mac OS.

Epicus2011,544,291,14rfsq,1136,"Well, it's time for another story from my years back in tech support. I was an assistant IT supervisor at a middle school about 3 years ago. One day I receive a call from the principal telling me that she wants me to talk to a student who apparently was ""hacking"" into our gradebook servers and changing his and his friends grades. So I decided to sit down with the kiddo ( he was about 12 years old) and have a talk with him.


Our conversation went like this:

*Me*: So buddy, I heard you were doing some stuff on our school computers.
*Student*: No! I didn't do anything!

Now of course the kid was lying so I tried another approach. I start to talk to him about some ""cool"" and ""hip"" games (such as CoD and WoW or some shit like that) and get to know him a little better. After a while the kid finally decided to tell me that he actually was ""changing"" the grades.

*Me:* So can you tell me how you did it?

*Student*: It's really simple actually! See, you just open Chrome here and login into your student account and then you can right-click on a grade, hit ""Inspect element"" and then you can scroll down and then you can doubleclick on your grade and type in an A !

I was facepalming. The sad part about this whole thing was that he was actually failing most of his classes right now because he thought he could just change them using his super-secret hacking-fbi-technology.
I asked him why then everytime he revisited the gradebook his grades were changing back, he told me he spent must of his free-time redoing it so it would ""stay"".

The kid ended up changing schools. His friends were *really* pissed at him.

DoctorWhoToYou,279,258,1cfxar,1130,"I have been involved in tech for 20+ years. It has been both a profession and a hobby for me. One thing I have always done for cash on the side is computer repair.  All of my business is word of mouth because if I were to actually advertise, I couldn't work a full time job *and* do all the side work. 

I tried doing it as a stand alone business for a while, but there is a lot of competition, so I decided to just keep it as side work. There are *a lot* of people in my area that take advantage of the less technically inclined. I've run across it multiple times.  This is one of those stories.

About two years ago, I had a voice mail message from a gentleman that was having trouble with what he described as a liquid cooled gaming computer. I made house calls and he somehow got my number from a past customer. I called him back and made an appointment to go to his house.

I arrived at the house and was kind of concerned because it was somewhat run down for the area. I tried not to judge, re-checked the address, realized it was right and parked my truck. I walked up to the house, all the curtains were pulled shut and it sincerely looked like no one lived there. There was no car in the driveway, there were no signs of life.

I hesitantly knocked at the door. The curtain in the bay window cracked open just enough for me to see an eye. I then heard ""WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?"" screamed through the door at me. I replied with ""You talked to me about fixing your computer, we had an appointment set for today.""  Everything was dead silent for a minute. Then I heard multiple locks unbolt, and a safety chain get removed.

The door swung open and the guy asked me for identification. I was rather confused, but I handed him my drivers license. He looked at it for a few seconds, held it out and looked at the picture, then looked back at me, then looked back at the picture and then said ""Okay you check out.""  I am not really sure who I check out with but...okay, I check out.

I stepped into the house and I was instantly overwhelmed with the smell. The guy immediately gave me a feeling of [Randy Quaid's character](http://i.imgur.com/uYPHL1q.jpg) from ""Not Another Teen Movie"".

The conversation that took place inside the door was him telling me that his computer was running slow, he couldn't play the games because they failed to start and he couldn't get a hold of the guy that usually worked on his computer.

I asked him to take me to the computer. When we walked through the house, the guy was ""clearing"" the rooms. He would duck behind the wall, look into the room, then enter the room. He did this through the two rooms we passed through as I followed him. I was already regretting stepping foot in the house.

We made it into his kitchen. His computer sat at a table, where he had moved a recliner to be more comfortable. The table was packed with food wrappers, cans and overflowing ashtrays. It was a mess.

The first thing I noticed was that his ""gaming computer"" was conveniently housed in a Compaq Presario case, I can only imagine it was early pentium technology. I never actually got to seriously look at the computer.  Mostly because I was so focused on the teflon line that ran from the side panel of his computer to the kitchen faucet. 

By this time I am *really*, *really* regretting stepping foot in the house. So I ask him to go ahead and boot the computer up for me. I honestly didn't want to touch it. It was dirty, the keyboard looked like he was eating meals off of it and I am pretty sure that there were some fluids attached to it that I didn't want to make contact with.

""Okay, I will boot it, but it will take a few minutes"". I watched as he walked over to his kitchen sink, latched a boot to the faucet, put the exit tube into the sink and then turned the cold water on.  He then walked back to the computer and hit the power button.

I walked over to the sink, the teflon tube ran from the sink, to the computer and then back to the sink to drain. I was now at the point of ""This has to be a joke, there has to be cameras somewhere around here."" But nope. Guy was serious.

The computer booted after a while. I told him to go ahead and shut it down, because I needed to look inside. *I seriously needed to look inside, I wanted to see how this water cooled system was plumbed just to satisfy my own curiosity.*

I told him that I needed to pop the side panel off the computer. He was hesitant and said ""I am going to watch you, I want to make sure you're not planting any bugs"". Because you know, I actually care what this guy is doing on his computer.

I popped the side off the tower, where the teflon lines ran in. The teflon lines ran in, did two great big loops and ran right back out of the case. There was no connections for the tubing on the panel. It was literally two holes drilled, teflon line ran in one hole, did two big loops and then ran right back out the second hole. I could hold the panel and there was no plumbing connected to anything but the panel. *Every time this guy booted his computer, he would turn his sink on, water would run through this system and then discharge back into the sink.*

The first thing I noticed was the liquid cooling plumbing, the second thing I noticed was that his heatsink was packed with tar, dust, tobacco, cat hair and I would imagine other stuff that would give me some incurable disease. The fan in the back of the computer was so packed full of...icky that it wasn't even turning anymore.

I instinctively blurted out ""This isn't liquid cooled, this isn't even close to liquid cooled, whoever did this scammed you out of money."" *Evidently* this was the wrong thing to say. The ""guy"" who regularly worked on his computer was his nephew. Regardless of what I knew, his nephew knew more.

I told him that the teflon tubes were doing absolutely nothing but sweating, pooling water in the bottom of his case and rusting out his case and probably causing some moisture issues inside his computer. I was immediately told I had no clue what I was talking about. His nephew had installed this cooling system for $300 and the computer was running great up until a few days ago.

After trying to explain to this guy that the computer needed blown out to get rid off all the dust, that his rear fan was dead and definitely needed replaced, that the teflon lines were doing nothing to help cool his computer and telling him that he probably needed a thorough operating system cleaning, he called me a liar. I had met my limit and although ""I can't fix this"" usually isn't in my vocabulary, I said ""I can't fix this.""  To add insult to injury, the guy then said ""Yea, my nephew said it was a pretty complex system that most techs wouldn't understand."" 

I then made the mistake of telling the guy that his nephew was screwing him, just in a nicer way.  This was met with instant hostility and I was asked to leave his house. Which I gladly did. I was actually a bit concerned for my safety at this point because I knew I was dealing with someone who was a few cards short of a full deck.

About a week later my phone rang with his number again. I let it go to voice mail. The message was basically berating me because his nephew had come over and had the computer fixed within 20 minutes and it only cost him $100.

I shot down to my local PD to talk to them to see if there was anything I could do. But the PD basically told me I was powerless. The guy didn't do anything directly to me and unless he specifically complains about being taken advantage of, they can't do anything. They knew who I was talking about, because they've done welfare checks on him in the past.

I tried to back track who he got my number from, to let them know his nephew was siphoning money out of him, while ruining his computer, but I couldn't find out how he got my number. Unfortunately everything I tried just ended up in a dead end. While I was there I sincerely wanted to take pictures of it, but I am pretty sure if I whipped out my phone and started taking pictures, this dude would have lost it.

So as far as I know, to this day, every time this guy boots his computer, it starts with him walking to his sink, turning on the water and then booting his computer. I highly doubt the computer is even actually running anymore. I've worked with elderly people and other questionable people in the past, but no one ever to this point. I now question people when they call me on how they got my number. That way I can at least back track for information a little bit.

TL;DR: Got a call from a client to fix a water cooled computer. ""Water cooled"" ended up being a teflon line running from his kitchen sink faucet, to his computer, the line looped twice inside the case and then ran back to his kitchen sink where it discharged. I was the idiot because I didn't know how to work on such a complex system.

However, if a lab tech is unavailable for a classroom issue then the call rolls over to our department. The ""Bat Line"" does not often ring but when it does we gotta hustle as they only call that number for class in session issues. 

I was busy bulk reimaging computers in preparation for staff replacement machines when the bat line lit up, I picked up, asked what the issue was, and ran off to find out why the podium machine would not turn on. As I egressed from the building I took notice of an electrician departing at the same time. We talked for a little while as we both walked to the same building, he stepped off into the electric closet and I walked into the classroom. 

I asked the professor to show me to the computer. As we walked up to it he stated, ""It  won't turn on I checked the power button and made sure the surge protector switch was switched on."" I looked at him, then just gave the computer the stink eye. The computer finally relented under my stern gaze and turned back on. The classroom started mumbling, small outbursts of ""What the.."", ""How the fuck?"" among others as the students exclaimed their surprise. I walked from the room to applause from the students.

As I walked out I turned to the electrician and thanked him for flicking the breaker back on. ",Magics in Lecture Hall.,1390

llnk,63,525,1bfx0t,1123,"I don't know if this story is appropriate for /r/talesfromtechsupport, but since it has something to do with Administrators, tales from tech support, and reddit i'll tell the story anyways.

It was March 31st 2010 around 8:45pm PST. I thought it'd be a good idea to create a subreddit called /r/administrators. I planned on using the subreddit to post about my own tales from tech support back before /r/talesfromtechsupport existed. So I happily created my new subreddit, wrote a small description and clicked the submit button. Voila, the new subreddit was now my own. Unfortunately for me, by the time I had finished creating the subreddit the time had ticked past 9pm PST, which means it was now April 1st on the East Coast of North America. April Fool’s Day.

As some of you may remember, the Reddit admins put on an April Fools prank in 2010 where they made it look like everyone was a moderator on all subreddits. Every user on reddit had the ability to edit and delete posts, ban users from subreddits, and have all of the powers that subreddit moderators had. Unbeknownst to me, it was now April Fool’s day and the Reddit prank was in full force.

After I had clicked the “create new /r/administrators subreddit” button… I suddenly had moderator powers over all of reddit. I was ecstatic! Somehow I had found a bug in reddit’s website code that had granted me administrator powers throughout the entire site! Oh the power I now had! I quickly resolved that I would only use my powers for good, never for evil. I had to tell somebody about my new-found God powers on my favourite website. 

I called one of my co-workers who was also a redditor and explained to him what had happened . There was an long pause on the phone while he took it all in. Then with a chuckle said to me… “llnk, what day is it on the East Coast?”. My heart sank with the sudden realization that I had indeed just been April fooled. And that I had also made a fool of myself in front of my co-workers who would never let me forget it. *facepalm*

To my defense, like any overworked sysadmin on their off hours, I have had a few drinks to help calm my nerves from a stressful day. But still, that’s no excuse for an April Fools internet veteran like myself. Never again would I let my guard down on March 31st and April 1st. I won’t get fooled again!

I stumbled for a second, because this user has no real pressing need for a cloud based system.  The one they have in place is very new and works for their needs very well.  Therefore, the answer to her question is ""You don't need it."", but obviously I can't say that.

""Your systems are roughly a year old, they are working very well.  Is there a reason a cloud based solution has been recommended?""

Keep in mind, her ""boss"" is not my boss, or even very high on the food chain at the site.  Mid-level management at best.

Before she can be bothered to give any more information she's tearing into me because I've ""been there 4 or 5 times already and they keep having this problem and we're not paying for you to fix it this time"" etc etc. I check, and the guy that I replaced 10 months ago was there 3 times in one week over a year ago. She still doesn't believe me that I'm not him and have no idea what the recurring problem is, and hangs up expecting us to dispatch someone immediately. Sure enough, I get dispatched. No big deal, they're right in town.

I get in there and introduce myself as the copier guy, and she affirms that I'm not the guy who quit 10 months ago, but is still pissed that they can't scan ""again"". I put again in quotes because as stated it's been almost a 14 months since this last happened.

I set off on the normal troubleshooting routine, and the problem is immediately clear. The scan buttons are all mapped to static IPs, and the IPs don't match up with their scheme, which isn't even static anymore. Here is the conversation that followed:

Me: Did you guys have any changes to your network lately?

Her: Just fix the copier!

(I change everything to host-names and update DNS on the copier)

Her, irritably: Well, what was the problem?

Me: Your network appears to have changed, that's why I was aski...

Her: You're telling me that [Local ISP] broke our copier?

Me: No, I'm saying your network changes made it so the copier didn't know how to get back to your computer for scanning.

Her: Well [Name of our primary competitor]'s copiers don't need internet! That's absurd!

Semi-relevant side note: The copier in question is a small toner based desktop model that probably cost around $2k at the time of purchase. I checked the meter as per SOP for a chargeable call, and it's rapidly approaching 500k copies, so the fact that the thing still functions is a goddamn miracle.

Lady walks in, eyes shrinkwrapped in tears, clinging to a huge ziplock freezer bag. Inside? Oh that's just some sort of reddish-orange liquid sloshing around a white macbook. So I look at the half-filled bag of soup and macbook then over to the lady.  


me: what happened?
her: I turned my back during lunch, one of my 'delightful' students emptied my campbells cup o soup onto my laptop. for fun.
me: yaaaaaay?
her: sobbing something about saving and so much money down the drain.
me (unspoken): got me in the feels lady

Apparently she is just out of school, strapped with student debt, and this little mac is what she wanted and could afford. She saved for nearly 6 months and waited for the new ones to come out and jumped on the purchase. I'm really starting to feel for her here, I've got educators all in my family so I *KNOW* teachers get paid for shit. I should point out that policy at the time did not cover accidental damage. I struggled to find SOMETHING we could do for her. 

Me: I've got some time coming up for lunch, I want to try and recover data (also something we didn't do, but this was undiscovered country for me)
her: OMG thank you my life is on that (it always is!!)

Still not satisfied with the solution, I find our regional manager on the phone, get her to approve a SWAP out. I then proceed to pull the SATA drive from her campbells cup 'o' laptop and place it on a spare drive dock. Grab an ultimate white macbook, whatever that was at the time, and I proceed to flash her data via firewire transfer mode (target mode).

Customer comes back, I start telling her that something went strange with the data transfer, I need her to look things over first. I bring out her new macbook but she doesn't know it is hers and likely figured it was one of ours for previewing data. She looks it over and, satisfied that her data is at least safe, says ""Great! I gotta run to best buy and get a hard drive to back this up to."" I recommended she go anywhere else to buy an external drive since my store was pricey for accessories. anyway...

I close the lid, put everything back in the box and hand it to her.

So Monday morning meeting and we get instructions on now to remove this bit of nasty from users computers and that a security update to block it had just been issued. Well timed cause not an hour later a very nice middle class mum type comes in with a laptop. 

The laptop was her daughters. A hand me down from Dad who just got a new one for his office. Since she's 14 she had been given permission to keep it in her room rather than half to use it in the family room like the younger kids. So Sunday afternoon she's working on homework or such in her room, come flying into the family room in tears.

Mom calms her down, goes with her into the bedroom. Laptop lid is down. Mom is like 'show me what happened' thinking the computer crashed and won't start up or something. The daughter won't open it. She's freaking again. She didn't do it, it's disgusting etc etc.

Mom opens the computer and in the middle of the screen is this extreme close up. Gallon sized beans and frank. She tries to close the window and another pops up. And more and more.

At this point my only question was did Mom enter it. No. It seemed wrong. Thank the stars a computer user with sense. She had shut down computer and left it like that.

Now, we decided to give all users of a certain level and up a monitor upgrade, quite nice ones for the time (1080p in 08). He loved it, but like most users we let them put thier old monitor as a second one.

Dad: ""No, i've only got my pictures on the right hand screen.""

Boss: ""Is the monitor turned on?""

Boss: ""One Second"".

It was at this point i ran into my Boss and we decided to tackle this together, not because it was a problem, but because my Dad is a lolsy troll of a bugger sometimes.

So we get to his desk, and he's sat there with a fresh coffee and a bemused ""oh deary me, what mischievous adventures i have"" grin on his face. We cruise over to his screen.

Anyone here knows the problem is that the mouse is moving over to the 2nd monitor and hes losing sight of it. But when we see the second monitor we understand why Dad can't see it. 

Boss: ""Dad (since i got to the office and used it, others started calling him ""Dad"" to take the piss), what have you done to your second monitor?!""

Dad: ""I put pictures on it, G-Man (other techie) said i could, i said i wouldnt use it for anything else, one monitor is fine. But G-Man said stick some pics on its background, so i did.""

I see it too. My Dad has Blu-tacced his family photos onto the screen of the monitor, then turned the monitor on for some nice backlit photography thing.

Boss cracks his ass laughing and calls G-Man over to see the results of his vague advice. Merriment is had, then my boss calmly starts taking the cables out of the back of the screen.

Dad: ""wait, i like my photos there!""

Boss: ""what?""

Heard this story from years ago...

A bunch of IT admins were at lunch at a table in some cafe, blowing off steam among themselves about the main machine they had to deal with at work.   Everything from the fact that it just never worked right to how it needed replacement, how difficult it was to deal with... etc. etc. etc....

...when after awhile, the waitress came up to their table, her face wet with tears.   

She apologized to them for doing such a bad job, that she was new at the cafe and honestly trying her best, please don't tell her boss, etc. and asking how she could do better.

The IT guys blinked at her in silent confusion.  Then one tried to explain:  ""No, not you, we are talking about OUR server.""

Waitress:   ""But I AM your server!""

The admins tried to explain:  ""No, no, we are talking about our server we deal with at work!""

Waitress:  ""Wow, she's really that bad?""

Comedic confusion ensued.  It took awhile for the admins to explain to her what a computer server actually was.   Eventually she sort of got the concept and they were able to let her know that she was doing perfectly OK.

No word on if they left a good tip or not...   I hope they did under the circumstances.

The electronics for this were in a big thick insulated box, and consisted primarily of a rather large water cooled circuit board. Not a water cooled board like you'd have at home though, no this was pretty much a pair of foot square boards, with a cooling system sandwiched in between them. 

We had been on the phone with tech support from the manufacturer who told us to remove the voltage controller and power it up and see what happend. We said we would try that and call him back. 

So, we removed the voltage controller, turned on the system, and then waited about 30 seconds, at which point the huge water cooled circuit board burst into flames. Not smoke, not snmolering flickering flames, no, no, good 2 foot tall flames with billowing black smoke and the stench that can only be created by the toxic fumes of burning sillicone and polymer, it lingered for a good solid week. We shut the door on it, which mostly smothered it, a fire exinguisher finished the job. 

Needless to say we were a bit suppried by the result, so we called up the manufacturer. Here is that conversation verbatim.

This one just happened recently. A customer walks in to the cellphone store and she looked furious. As she walks closer to the counter the strongest smell of all types of alcohol starts running through my nose and instantly gives me a headache. I knew this customer was gonna be trouble.

**Me:** Hello, welcome to *Cellcompany1* how can i help you?

**Customer:** I came to this store a few weeks ago to buy a new phone and it ain't working.

**Me:** Oh, what is wrong with it?

**Customer:** I just said it no work you stupid!

**Me:** Well.. do you have the phone with you?

Customer pulls out an OLD phone out of her pocket and flips it open and starts mashing on all the buttons.

**Customer:** SEE! it not work. I WANT REFUND.

By this time I was ready to punch this woman in the face, because first of all, she was speaking like I could not understand any English. Second, the phone she pulled out is old and hasn't been sold in stores for about 8 years. Last, the phone was not even from our company. But I had to be nice.

**Me:** Ma'am, this phone is really old and I'm pretty sure you did not buy it a couple of weeks ago from our store, because this is from *Cellcompany2* and not from our company, *Cellcompany1*. We don't sell these kinds of phones

**Customer:** YES I DID, I BOUGHT IT HERE! LIKE 2 WEEKS AGO. I EVEN HAVE THE RECEIPT FOR IT! (Pulls out a wrinkled Walmart receipt and slams it on the counter).

**Me:** Ma'am, that's a walmart receipt, but if your phone is not working I can try to help you fix it.

**Customer:** No I WANT REFUND. I WANT MY 300$ BACK! YOU STUPID ASIANS BEING GREEDY. Blah blah blah ssj3 Ragemode activated.


I started to get really angry too, only because I cannot tolerate racism. But what I did instead was tell my co-worker to call the cops without her noticing. They got here in about 2 minutes because there is a police station nearby. They took her away for being drunk in public and biting the police officer. They dragged her away and I could finally breathe from the alcohol reeking from her body. She left her ""NO WORKING"" phone on the counter. I picked it up and tried to fiddle with it because i was curious to what was wrong with it.

BrokenCyrax,191,355,yy8te,1083,"So, this morning has been an interesting morning so far. I was checking my reddit inbox and reading some suggestions with how to deal with the demon receptionist from the seventh floor of hell. 

Today I was nice:

Receptionist: Hey X, I'm having trouble seeing a document, can you come and help.

Me: Yeah, sure thing.

*Walk over to her desk and see an 'Access denied' message on a sharepoint document.

Me: Oh, I see. What document are you trying to see? 

Receptionist: Nothing special, I just need it to work.

Me: Sure thing, can you send me a link to the document please?

Receptionist: No, I've lost it. 

*I can see a filename and web address written on a post-it note on her desk, and I jot it down in my notepad*.

Me: Not a problem, let me see if I can get you access to the file.

Receptionist: Thanks.

*Back at my desk, checking what the file was. Turns out she was trying to access her husbands previous paycheck (assumption of filename, GW Payroll July), god only knows where she found the link for it. Back to her desk we go.*

Me: Hello. I've found out what the problem is. The file you are trying to access isn't allowed to be accessed from your department, only from finance, and I can't view it myself either.

Receptionist: But you can give me permission to see it, right?

Me: Yes, and no. I can give permission, but it would be invasion of privacy and a security breach. I'd be in trouble, and I cannot give permissions, sorry.

Receptionist: It is really important that I see this document, it is for my work.

Me: Unfortunately, I am unable to give permissions. If it is for your work, you can contact finance department and they can contact me. As far as I understand, your account allows all access to the files you need.

Receptionist: This is stupid, this is why you should have given me administrator access.

Me: Uhmmm...

Receptionist: I shouldn't need to ask to see company files. I work here.

Me: Hey, but...

Receptionist. You should just do your job. You are the computer guy, go do the computer stuff so I can do my job.

*That feel of rage, but advised to be subtle*.

Me: I understand that your job can be difficult, and mine can be too. For this reason I will need to contact Mr.Boss and speak with him about granting access for you. I'll happily oblige.

Receptionist: That isn't necessary, just click on my name and click ok. That's all you need to do.

*Her manager is walking past*.

Me: Hey derp, can you help us.

Derp: Sure. 

Me: Receptionist is having a problem here, she can explain it a little for you.

Receptionist: I don't have access to a file.

Derp: Oh, ok. X can simply fix it, right?

Me: I sure can. Let me go back to my desk and allow her access to the finance documents so she can view anyones payroll whenever she pleases. 

Derp: Wait, what?

Me: Receptionist, your husbands payroll document will be working for you in around 5 minutes when the server adjust to the changes (i lied, it changes instantly) so you will have to wait until then. Also, while Derp is here, can we book a time so we can speak about the Administrator privileges you need?

*Derp glaring at the Receptionist*

Me: I'm free after 2pm. Is that good for you?

*Receptionist with mouth open in shock*.

Derp: Yes, 2.30pm would be ideal. Receptionist husband should be present also.

And boom went the dynamite. Fellow redditors were a bit annoyed with me for calling her ""Just a fucking receptionist"". 

If that was bad, was this win? I won't be posting what we speak about in entirety, but the outcome will be posted.

She'd been trying to get the recording equipment working for the language oral exams, and couldn't understand why the device didn't want to respond to anything. I leaned over, turned it off, counted to 10 (yeah, I know it's not a router, but habit) and turned it back on again.

StrikefromtheSkies,77,352,16xrul,1080,"Long time lurker of this subreddit, first time poster. I work on a Service Desk for a Fortune 500 company. We support essentially everything in the company, proprietary software, hardware troubleshooting, cellular device ordering, VPN, you name it, we support it. This creates a problem where people think we literally support everything, payroll, paid time off...

We often get calls about people being unable to connect to the VPN, most of the time it is ""Hey it says I need to install *VPN Software*. Should I do that?"" Most of the time I want to ask them if they think it is lying to them, but I just respond ""...yes"" Anyway here is the story I came here to tell. 

Guy calls up frantically reporting that his workstation won't launch an excel file and that he needs to be able to use this excel file. ""Oh now I just launched Internet Explorer and that isn't coming up either, I sent the excel file to a coworker and he was able to open it fine.""

About then I'm pretty pumped, this dude actually tried to troubleshoot his problem before calling... this pretty much never happens. So I remote to his machine, and low and behold both Excel and Internet Explorer are visible, and immediately his problem makes sense to me. 

""Sir, please press the power button on your right hand monitor""

""We won't tell anyone about this. Have a good day."" I started laughing pretty hard and I immediately told everyone.

Years ago when I had a computer store, I got a call from a very upset woman with tears in her voice. ""My computer says I have performed an illegal operation, and I don't even know what I've done wrong."" She swore to me she hadn't been to any ""bad"" websites.

turkycat,247,388,xm0tl,1080,"I hold a summer job at a national retailer that does computer and electronic support on the side. We also have a couple service centers that we can ship stuff to in the event that something needs replaced we aren't capable of doing on site.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Yesterday I had a customer come into the store and approach me while I was working with another. As I finished up, I made eye contact with her and politely advised ""I will be with you in just a moment, ma'am"", her response was ""You'd better."" with a stern 'matter-of-fact' look in her eyes. I just smiled and nodded at her without missing a beat (I have nearly 10 years of experience in technical support with much more 'official' job titles before going back to school, and this is not the first time I have dealt with this kind of person, immediately knowing what would be required of me next).  
&amp;nbsp;  
When I was ready, I quickly changed face from my patented 'professional nerd' demeanor to my 'annoyingly nice' version, and approached her with the regular ""How can I help you?""  
""You need to fix this RIGHT."" again, matter-of-factly  
""Okay!"" I said, ""What seems to be the problem?""  
""Um, You guys sent this to your SERVER-center MONTHS ago and it has NEVER worked right. You said you would fix it and it took over a week to get it back and it STILL doesn't work. This was back in May and I haven't been able to bring it in because I am SO busy, but this has been such a major inconvenience for me because I am very busy and I need my computer and I think you guys need to compensate me for my all my wasted time... etc, etc, etc"" this went on for about 2 minutes or so.  
""Okay! What seems to be the problem?"" I repeated, exactly as before.  
""THE WIRELESS DOESN'T WORK!"" she exclaimed as if I was a fool for asking because this was clearly the only problem any computer could ever have. ""You CLAIMED to have replaced something before and even told me you tested it here before you called me which you CLEARLY didn't because it doesn't work and I've been forced to use my external wireless thing for months now and this is extremely unacceptable! I spent a lot of money here at _RETAILER NAME_ and I expect the things I buy to work!"" as if the amount of dollars spent was the only variable that determines the rate of component failure.  
On the outside, I continue to smile and nod as if everything she says is plated in gold; ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that! It sounds as if you've had quite the unfortunate turn of events! If you don't mind, let's take a look at the computer and see what we'll need to do to make this right for you!""  
&amp;nbsp;  
I did each of the following things without looking at her face. I grab her HP laptop, open it, and bring it out of sleep mode. Immediately, I notice a big red light on the F12 key next to a wireless icon (its the radio tower with waves coming off of it, pretty damn obvious, but I digress) which, when pressed turned green and immediately popped up a message saying ""connecting to XXXXX"" (proving that we DID in fact test in in store before) I opened her browser and connected to google.com. I looked up, without breaking character or batting an eye I said ""hmm, I seem to be connected to google, perhaps I wasn't listening... Did I misunderstand your problem?""  
&amp;nbsp;  
needless to say, the look on her face was priceless. She immediately changed her tone, but instead of apologizing said ""well if it's working now, I guess I'll just take it...""  
&amp;nbsp;  
Time for my revenge (I can be a devious little fuck). Without changing my tone from this perfectly innocent retail employee that would never harm a fly, I start playing ignorant as well. I say ""well, that can't be the problem, that was just the ON button for the wireless, I'm sure you tried that before didn't you?""  
""no, no I didn't""  
""...oh, really? Well that explains it then. It turns itself off to save battery life.""  
""I didn't know that""  
""Well, I suppose we all learn something every day! So from now on I suppose I'd recommend checking to make sure that it is turned ON before using it!""

bh3nch0d,163,245,1jn9jv,1082,"Longtime lurker, first time poster.  This is an encounter that I will remember for the rest of my life.

I used to be a contractor with the military doing mostly computer security documentation, one of which was tracking security vulnerabilities for our computer systems.  The agency that we fell under sent out auditors every so often to run security vulnerability scans to make sure we have all of our systems patched.

In this particular instance one of these scans checked for a vulnerability in Microsoft Office by checking to see if a particular file or registry entry exists; if they exist, then it's patched.  If the file and registry entry aren't there, it's vulnerable.  They ran the scan on one of our servers which did not have MS Office on it, so naturally the scan couldn't find the patch or the registry entry on the system.  After we went over the results, we marked the finding as a false-positive and gave it back to them.  This is the subsequent conversation between the auditors and we contractors:

**Auditor: ""OK, so I see you marked this as a false-positive. You need to change it back.""**

Contractors: ""Oh but we don't have Office on the server, so it's not vulnerable.""

**Auditor: ""Doesn't matter, you still need to install the patch.""**

Contractors: ""But we can't install the patch because Office isn't on the system.""

**Auditor: ""Then you need to install Office on it, then install the patch.""**

Contractors: ""But that would just introduce a whole slew of new vulnerabilities, not just this one.""

**Auditor: ""Doesn't matter, we can't mark the finding as fixed unless the scan finds the registry entry.""**

Contractors: ""So you mean to tell me that we need to INTRODUCE a vulnerability to the system by installing a piece of software with holes, so we can patch it, rather than just leave it without the vulnerability in the first place?""

**Auditor: ""That's correct.  And you need to do it before we leave or it will count against you.""**

*Contractors: Headdesk.*

dniMdesreveR,114,271,13vbmq,1076,"A while ago I went to a user who reported stuttering when watching video or listening to music. This could be a real problem, since the company, among other things, uses video or sound recordings when supporting ********. And he works in their support, so it is high priority.

When I get there he tries to show me the problem and starts upp one of the support videos. Nothing. No stuttering whatsoever. So he starts up a sound recording. No stuttering. I say ""Well, it seems to work now"" and get ready to leave when he stops me and want to show another thing.

He loads up a YouTube video, let it buffer and plays it. No stuttering. So he picks up the laptop and starts angeling in all sorts of directions, activating the HDD security. Ok, so now the pagefile and virtual memory are locked and can't be read, but the video is in the memory, so it still doesn't stutter, until...

He starts shaking his laptop. Violently. And lo and behold, the video starts to stutter. ""See?"" He puts down the laptop, and everything goes back to normal. ""That's what it did on the train today, so I couldn't watch my movie."" ""On dvd?"" ""No, I downloaded it yesterday."" ""I'll take it in to see if it can be fixed.""

I take the poor thing to our tech closet and call my boss and tell the story. He told me to take the computer back to the user and to tell him ""If shaking the laptop make videos stutter, you probably shouldn't do that. See it as an opportunity to read a book or take a nap on the train.""

tl;dr: Violently shaking the laptop make video stutter. Don't shake it, then.","Well, don't do that, then",1347
SilentDis,185,327,w62i0,1073,"Things continued swimmingly with Phil for the next few months.  [I could handle him](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w4fwu/angry_clueless_you_have_met_your_match/), and [I was his only contact at our company](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w54za/phil_2_electric_boogaloo/).

Most of his calls were still entirely outside our support boundries; he had a horrible time with printers, scanners, fax machines, and at one point his fridge that he was *sure* was Internet related.  Every time, I came down with the same firm response of 'Nope, we don't help with that.  Our stuff works, here's the number to talk to.'

I remember a few issues that I actually did help him with, but they were exceptionally few and far between.

Once, he'd manually renewed his domain through a 3rd party (saving himself $10 or so on our renewal fee), and he'd then given them incorrect pointer info, hosing his domain horribly in the process.  I did the expeditious thing and just took responsibility on that one; got the phone number for his support company, and 3-wayed him and myself in with them.  Phil verified security, and then handed off to me.  I efficiently listed off the A and MX records we needed, the other tech made the change, and we were done in less than 5 minutes...  I then took 15 minutes to explain to Phil how he's now waiting 48 hours for it to propagate down.  This set him off a bit, but I countered with the fact that he wanted to save the $10 and take all of it away from us, and that was fine, but that's what he'd have to deal with.  It shut him up, quick.

Another time, he installed AOL and hosed himself.  It was an older version that would bind itself up in weird and interesting ways to the various network adapters, causing no end to headaches for connecting with anything other than AOL.  I again explained to him that I could make XYZ work, but he was on his own with AOL, and if it happened again, we'd just keep breaking AOL to make XYZ work; if he wanted better, talk to AOL or ditch them.

This got frustrating to Phil.  He couldn't have his rousing hour-long bitch-fests in which he'd make people cry; or make people question the life choices that lead them inexorably to dealing with their lord and master, Phil.  Basically, I wasn't 'fun' to call, because I had the answers, and the process down to an art.

So, once the shiny of 'having my own tech to abuse' wore off, he started calling the general helpline again.  Usually, after being told to take his printer problem elsewhere from me.  There was a big flag on the account indicating that he didn't get support from anyone but me, and sometimes he just found himself cold-transferred to either my voice mail or to my line if I was in.  That was perfectly fine by me, not to Phil of course, who'd just hang up when he herd my voice and re-call the main line.  I knew it was him, though, as our Caller ID system was sweet in that it kept original data through cold transfers.  I'd just make a note that he'd called and hung up.

After a time, though, he would badger someone else on the helpline long enough to get them sucked into a call with him.  I'd gotten few, if any actual calls from him lately.  At first I chalked it up to 'Oh, I finally clue-sticked him into understanding', but upon checking his account, I saw other tech's logs popping up, at weird hours when I was out of the office.

Thing is, they knew they were supposed to dump him on me.  They knew they were supposed to not help him in any way.  But, there it was, plain as day.  *sigh*

I mentioned this to my supervisor, and he did his best to put a stop to it.  E-mails, coaching cube-side with the other agents, etc.  It was brought up at our monthly meeting, in fact (all techs for 2 hours in 1 room to go over general things like this, while Tier2 took calls directly); and stated in no uncertain terms that Phil doesn't get help from us, you dump him on this extension.  Period.

It helped little.  Many of you who've worked in tech know there's always a few low-hanging fruits in the group that just drag everyone else down.  When you have 75+ agents, it's bound to happen.  As good as management was about weeding these people out, they still managed to hang on, thanks to a corporate environment.

Of course, Phil pushes and pushes, and I have to give him credit where credit's due; he'd manage to suck a good number of people into his little game of 'make the tech rip their hair out'.  Eventually, he'd not call me anymore, because he found it much more fun to scream at the brick wall, or attempt the fun whack-a-mole game of finding the one bad (or poorly informed) tech to torment.

He got one, eventually.  She was a new-ish hire, so I can't blame her entirely.  On the floor for 2 weeks, and now reduced to a puddle of tears in the middle of the isle.  She quit that day.  I knew what happened even before I'd been told directly, and I was furious.  I felt like I had personally let her down (regardless of the fact that she didn't heed the rather interesting special note and popup that his account generated... the only account that, when you pulled it up, would also pop a full-screen bright red box with 40pt white type that told you to direct the customer to me and not help them).

The next day, my supervisor called me into an unused meeting room 1 floor up.  I was greeted by the director of the help desk, the lead Tier2 agent, the telecom hardware director, and the system administrator (who managed the webhosting servers/email servers/etc).  I'd met all these people, and they were really decent folk; but I'll be honest, I figured they'd decided to blame me for the whole Phil situation that happened the day before to that poor girl, and I was getting the axe.

Another person in expensive suit and tie walked in, and I was introduced to the CIO of XYZ, Incorporated.  Fuck.

They started out asking how I felt about the whole situation.  They all knew I wasn't one to pull punches, that I was very blunt, and when cornered, rather crass.

I believe the first thing I said to this meeting of the big-wigs was ""From what I can tell of the people gathered here today, I'm the lucky fuck who gets to have this shit storm hung around his neck, and you intend to each take an arm to make sure I land squarely under the bus?""  I ooze class when I'm cornered, I admit it.

Deafening silence ensues.  It lasts a good few minutes.  I take stock of the faces in the room from my little tirade; the systems guys are eyes wide, but bemused.  The CIO is slack-jawed (I don't think he's herd such an honest/crass combo before, cool).  My floor supervisor is hiding his mouth in his hands, attempting not to show his laugh.  Meh.  Let the fireworks begin, I'm going down with a bang, not a whimper in this one, I've decided.

The system administrator pipes up ""Umm... Actually... No.  But, I can see how it'll look that way.""  
""Well, that's all fine and dandy, could you clue me in before I go ahead and shoot my other foot, then?""  

This got a laugh out of my floor supervisor, and the tensions eased considerably.  The CIO cracked a smile, as well.

""Since you appear to appreciate bluntness, I'll return it in kind,"" the CIO said.  ""You're not fired.  We are, on the other hand, attempting to decide what to do about Phil.""  
""Since I'm not fired, and all these people are here, and you all know what Phil has done, I'd say it's pretty obvious 'what to do about Phil'.  He doesn't have more than a few thousand dollars a year in profit for this company, yet he's monopolized my time, and made a rather sweet new girl quit.  He is a horrible person, and should be kicked to the curb.""  Why sugar coat the obvious.

""That was our thought, too,"" began the telecom director.  ""But, we figured we'd try one other option.  Would you consider going 'on call' for Phil?  As in, we'd route his calls to a cell phone that you'd have 24/7.""  
""That depends, how big of a raise are you offering me to go with that?""

Everyone has their price, even me.  I'll deal with Phil 24/7, but it's not going to be cheap.

""Well, we wouldn't be able to bump your paygrade..."" began my floor supervisor.  
I cut him off.  ""Then that's not happening, is it.""

This illicited a chuckle from the CIO.  ""I like you, right to the point and honest.  But, you are going to make the call to Phil to tell him we're giving him the boot.""  
""After what happened yesterday, I'd be a little pissed if you didn't give that to me, considering.""

And so it came to pass.  A registered, signature required special delivery went out that very day, containing a legally-drawn up end-of-service notice.  I was given the tracking number, and watched it like a hawk.  I knew when it was signed for, and I even had a little digital copy of Phil's signature to prove it.  I gave him a half hour to read it, then called him up.

Me: This is SilentDis from XYZ support calling.  Is Phil available?  
Phil: Um... this, this is Phil. (He sounds... hurt.  How touching.)  
Me: Phil, I am calling on behalf of XYZ to confirm the contents of the letter you signed for half an hour ago.  We are terminating any and all services you have with us, due to the abusive nature of your calls.  Do you understand?  
Phil: You can't do this!  I pay my bills on time, why would you do this?  Do you know how much money you'll lose every month?  

This little tirade continues for a good 5 minutes.  It's normal Phil, though.  A little pop-up appears in the corner of my screen from my on-floor supervisor.  Apparently, 3/4 of the help desk, and much of the upper management is currently listening in.  I respond back ""fuck you, I don't want a goddamn audience"" which earns me a distant guffaw from over the cubicle farm.  I mute myself as he's continuing to rant and shout ""Don't you people have anything better to do?""  A chorus of chuckles and ""No!"" rings back.

Phil eventually runs out of steam on his rant.  He's not switched to legal threats yet, as that was never his way, amazingly enough.

Me: Phil, this is exactly why we're terminating our services with you.  You are abusive, you are rude, and you do not listen.  You cost us in man-hours more than what we make from the services we provide.  To top it off, you made a rather nice person quit her job after 2 weeks.  XYZ has decided that you are a liability to provide service to, rather than any sort of benefit.  Your service will terminate tomorrow at midnight.  At that time, we will make a final copy of your website, and of any e-mail sitting on our servers, burn it to CD, and send it to you via the same carrier we used to deliver the notice you received today.  I would still recommend backing it up yourself.""  
Phil: ""I don't know how to do that, I shouldn't have to!  This isn't...""  
Me: ""Phil, it is right, it is fair.  We, as a company, simply no longer wish to do business with you.  It's fine if you do not know how to backup your site, we're doing it for you anyway, and you'll get the CD in the mail.  Please understand, we will no longer help you with anything going forward, calls to this number will go unanswered, and we will not sell new service to you.  This call isn't to help you with anything, it's simply to inform you.  Good day.""  
Phil:  (he actually managed to respond just before I pushed release.  very meekly) ""Yeah, bye.""
*click*

The next thing I hear is thunderous applause from across the help desk.  The queue was basically forgotten, and had stacked up to the 20s, but it didn't matter.  Phil was gone.

We actually had a pot-luck party the next day, in celebration.  I brought a pie.

The saga continues.

The Owner has found an external hard drive that's 2 years old that used to be the backup drive, however it's apparently corrupted or something. She's sending it to me to look at it and figure out whether anything's recoverable off it.

We talked and she's done some investigating on her own, and basically she's scared shitless of trying to go into Tor and pay some nameless, faceless person what's now about $3k with zero guarantee of getting anything back. She'd rather pay to have a clean room recover her hard drive for $1k (the one she's sending me) since she'd know, at least, that the money was going someplace reputable.

Lastly, I logged into Teamviewer and grabbed the key and I'm trying to figure out what the passkey / passphrase is. If you guys want to take a shot at it, have fun. I'm doing this for her as a favor, but mostly because I want to see if I can do it.

campycapper,400,289,xev2e,1072,"I have a tale for you, of the teacher I may have to kill. 
For this tale I am going to call him Bob. 

Bob is a good guy except he believes he is a tech genius and that my job could be done by trained rabbits. Now I am going to have to back into this story a bit, so hold with me. 

A year ago I was able to get a grant and put new computers into every classroom in my school. (I am a teacher and a tech support) Every classroom either received laptops or really nice desktops. Now installing this computers was no issue, and in every classroom they have  worked with limited upkeep from me for a year. All of them except Bob's computers. 

Over the last year, I have had Bob do a ""emergency reformat"" on his own computers because he thought he had a virus. It was windows security essentials. He did the reformat and half way turned the computers off and tried to boot in the morning. So i come into work the next day with my boss yelling and freaking out that I have to go look at Bob's computers because nothing at all is working. 

I have witnessed as he has attempted to installed (Did not know at the time how he was doing this because he did not have permissions) different software that dates back to the windows ME timeline, because he must have the software because he used it last time he had computers. This again ended with him attempting to a emergency recovery of the computers. So the next day I walk in to my boss yelling that I have to go down and look at Bob's computers because nothing is working. 

For the networking cables that run behind the computers, he has cut the ends of them off because he thought they did not look good. He has also rewired his classroom by himself at night, and taken every cable hooked from my switch to the computer and feed it back into the switch. Did not end well for my switch and as  I walked in I received the all too familiar yelling that I had to go look at Bob's computers. 

But this summer took the cake, and I finally had enough of Bob and proceeded to do a bit of yelling myself. At the end of the spring semester Bob's unhooked his computers for storage. I had told him to leave everything alone so that I could clean up and do a bit of routine maintenance on his machines while he was gone for two months. He refused to listen. Well I thought to myself, at least he just packed up the computers, it will not take me that long to re hook everything and do the maintenance. No such luck. 

I finally was able to get down to Bob's classroom and all the computers were still connected, but there was no power going to the room. Bob had turned off the power breakers, so nobody could use his classroom. Not a big deal, but pain in the ass. I turn the breakers on and started the machines. The first machine I went to I tried to use the mouse and nothing, tried to use the keyboard and nothing. Checked the back of the tower and everything was connected and the board and mouse both had power going to them. Thought maybe they just did not recognize at first. Tech support 101, I restarted my computer. Same problem. So I decided to unplug the mouse and keyboard and replug them to see if they recognize. Sure enough familiar ping and new hardware installed correctly. 

My mind was boggled, so I pulled the mouse out again and started to switch it with another mouse, when it hit me. He had cross wired all the computers. So the mice and keyboard in front of a computer were all tied to different computers. I was furious and dumbfounded. What purpose could this have possible served. So I bite my tongue and rewire the classroom, and since I have seen this, I check my switch. Sure enough he has wired all of the network cables from the back of the towers to each other, and the computers on the end were tied back into the switch. Creating this giant loop of network cable ling that was tied and cut to make it ""good looking"". 

It was here that my mind started to explode, I had already dealt with this exact same ridiculousness once and yelled at him and he has done it a second time. Once I was able to get everything redone, new cables run and all the computers up and running it was time to leave. Now remember this is summer break, and Bob is supposed to be gone for two months. Nobody was to be in that room, it was locked up. Well I had to go on a business trip so I was going to finished updating and cleaning his computers once I got back. 

Then I went in yesterday. HE HAD DONE IT AGAIN! Every computer was cross wired. He had clipped the ends of the network cables, and turned it into a giant loop ring network. He had flipped the breaker and taken all the mice from the computers so that I had no mice. When I walked into the classroom blood poured from my nose and ears. Steam rolled from my eyeballs and I screamed the profanities of a thousand sailors. 

Bob no longer has computers. Apparently I was the only It guy willing to deal with Bob, and since I have made it perfectly clear that I am willing to put him out of his misery. The administration has chosen to remove his technology. He doesn't even get a teacher desktop.

Rather surprisingly, Monday last week I was asked if I could prepare some laptops for a conference that would be going on today. This came as a shock, because what normally happens is someone rocks up at my office first thing in the morning and says ""I'm just off to a conference now, and I need a laptop to take with me, can I have one please?"" which leads to the inevitable ""No, you can't, because you didn't give us any notice and they're all on loan to other people."" and then someone going away in a huff and complaining about how unhelpful IT are. 

This time however the brief was remarkably clear. We need 4 laptops, running linux, with all the departmental software that has been purchased by our research group installed.

Ok, so, actually, that's a bit cheeky, because the research groups have their own laptops they they've paid for and _demanded_ root access to, and are therefore meant to manage themselves. However, since they'd actually given me a whole weeks notice I decided to be nice and set up their machines for them.

This was a mistake. 

*""What software do you have licensed for your group?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Ok, what software do you _need_ for this conference?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Right, well, in that case, I'll do a default install and can you please get back to me if there's anything above and beyond that that you need?""*
*""That sounds great, thankyou!""*

So off I go, do the install, then call back on Tuesday. 

*""So, the machines are ready... can you just give me the licence keys for any additional software you need? I'll hunt down the install packages.""*
*""I don't know what software we have licensed.""*
*""OK... do you know who does?""*
*""I don't know.""*
/sigh. 
*""I'll call around.""*

So I called around a few members of staff and finally managed to track down all the things that they'd ordered through purchasing, and one thing that we happened to have a couple of keys for that they'd _not_ officially paid for through the department, but must have gotten from somewhere else. Installed all of that, and took the machines back Wednesday afternoon. Whilst I was there asked them to do one thing: 

*""Could you please find someone who's actually going to this conference and get them to check that everything they need is installed on here before they leave?""*
*""I don't know who's going.""*
*""Well... find out and get them to check, ok?""*
*""Ok.""*

Fade to this morning...

11.45, the phone rings.

*""Oh, hey, it's [person] from the conference group... [software] isn't installed on this laptop, and I need it for a presentation someone is giving at 2.""*
*""Ok... did you not check the laptop before taking it there like I asked you too last week?""*
*""Um... I don't know.""*
*""Do you have a licence for [software]?""*
*""I don't know.""*

At this point I'm wondering if there's anything they do know... like perhaps what day it is, or what their name might be.

*""Ok, well, as far as I can tell you don't actually _own_ [software] so it's not been installed.""*
*""I'm sure we do, we use it in the department all the time.""*
*""Yes, the _department_ owns that, but you're not _in_ the department right now, and even if you were, we don't manage those laptops, you do. You insisted on it. As I explained to you last week, those machines are stand alone, and you need a stand alone licence. That's why I asked you what licences you have. We've been through this. Who handles licencing for your group?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Find. Out.""*

...but I'm feeling pretty good natured this morning, and the staff room coffee is doing sterling work, so I decided to have a look-see if I could find out for her. Turns out I can. Attached to a ticket in the RT queue from 2009, repeated in 2010 AND 2011, cc'd to this very person is the following. ""You can generate licence keys for [software] by going to [website] and entering your email address and the following [code]. DO NOT LET [person responsible for licencing] lose them, like they did last time. AND THE TIME BEFORE.""

I forwarded this on to the user out at the conference site, and 5 minutes later the phone rang...

*""I got your email... I don't remember doing any of this before... [person responsible for licencing] says they've not done it either.""*

Really? seems unlikely, given that you replied to the email in RT, and in fact have done so every year for the last 4 years... but let's try and be polite.

*""Well, regardless, that's what you need to do. When you get the new keys they'll come with a link to the software download and you can install it yourself.""*
*""Oh, is it not already installed?""*

...give me strength. 

*""No. Please follow the instructions on the website.""*

...an hour passes. The phone rings again.

*""[person responsible for licencing] says they've been trying this for an hour and it doesn't work. Help!""*
*""Have they followed the instructions on the website that I sent?""*
*""I don't know. Can I just bring the machines back in? I'm only a 10 minute drive away.""*

...ok, it's like that then. I know I shouldn't do this, but Alright, lets do it. 

*""Sure, ok, bring them back, and I'll test the licence generating thing whilst you're on your way.""*

Which I did. And it works. Perfectly. There is however a proviso, waiting in the thankyou text. ""Please note that new keys will take 24 hours to come into force."" So, they're screwed either way with that one. But hey, this means I don't have to go through the teeth pulling process of finding out how many steps in the software licencing procedure she doesn't know about. Instead, we'll just install the network licensed copy, set up a VPN so the machines think they're still here, and everything'll be good, right?

So she shows up, I tell her what I'm going to do, she agrees that it's a good idea, and I get to work. In the mean time, could she please tell me who's going to use the machines so I can pre-configure the VPN connection for them? 

*""Um... I don't know.""*
*""Right, in that case I'll set them all to authenticate as you, ok? Are you registered for remote access?""*
*""I don't know""*
*""Fine... I'll look it up. What's your username?""*

...take a guess what's coming next...

*""I don't know.""*

So, whilst the install is going on these machines I'm looking up her username, setting her up with remote access, configuring the VPN and with 15 minutes to spare before the 2pm presentation, she's good to go and taking them away again. Feeling pleased with myself both for a job well done, and not murdering her despite severe provocation, I go to lunch, like I should have an hour ago. 

I return from lunch to 5 missed calls. 

*""Help, [software] isn't working! It's saying it doesn't have a licence key!""*
*""Did you connect to the VPN like I showed you?""*
*""Oh, I just gave the laptops to the guys giving the presentation.""*
*""Did _they_ connect to the VPN like I showed you?""*
*""I don't know.""*
*""Ok... can you go get one of the machines and I'll talk you through it over the phone.""*

Which I then had to do. Four times. 

Honestly, I think it would have been easier for everyone if I'd just murdered her after all.

I worked as a Apple tech at a reseller, basically hardware and software repair.

Someone brought in a laptop saying the classic informative 'not working'. it booted up fine, passed all the basic hardware checks, in perfect health. so the tech working on it called her up to ask for more details, and basically got told the same thing over and over (not working not working) with no elaboration despite his best efforts to get more details about the how its not working. he  ran some more intensive hardware checks for a few days. still fine.

She decided that this 1 second freeze meant that the entire computer is faulty beyond use and she demanded a refund (despite not buying it from us). At this point the tech basically went into a 'please pick it up and leave us alone' tactic, heres some of the (paraphrased) lines i heard directly.

sawser,285,247,17h4tq,1066,"This story popped into memory while writing my [previous tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/17gdap/sir_your_son_is_a_felon/) earlier today.

This one was bitter sweet, since in this case the 'bad guy' was quite awesome.

**Backstory, again:** Working tier 2 software tech support for an ecommerce payment company that works exclusively with higher education. Our department handles calls from university technicians and office workers, not students. We work with the same customers day to day, so we tend to develop ~~report~~ rapport and learn the quirks of our customers.


In this case, we got a call from a frantic bursar.


""Hey Sawser, does your guys software prevent someone from making repeated quick payments?""

""Uh, no Greg^fake , we don't. What's going on?"" 

""Well, it looks like we got close to 80,000 payments last night. Typically, we get around 300.""

So, I remoted into their system to check out log files, etc. Sure enough, they had roughly 85,000 individual transactions. Even better, they were roughly 10 cent payments, all to the same account.


A quick tutorial for those who aren't familiar with Credit Card merchants:
The merchant who takes your credit card generally pays a small flat rate per transaction, plus a few percentage points to a credit card processor. The rates change wildly based upon how much money your take in a month, if your system takes the ZIP code and CVV2 information, and if you negotiated your rates.
This school paid 9 cents + 2.75% per transaction. Which meant, every 10 cent transaction they took, they paid 9.002 cents to the credit card processor.

This student paid their $10k tuition payment in ten cent increments, but almost $9k went to the credit card processor in fees. **edit 2 update:** Since I clarified technical details below, I'll update this as well. 9k didn't actually go to the processor, it *would have* gone to the processor, had they settled the batch containing those transactions. 


After a few days of additional research, we found that what happened was a Computer Science student was screwed out of a class he needed, and was forced to wait an extra semester to graduate. This guy was not happy, so he wrote a bot to open up a few dozen windows and crank away making payments. He also told the university that Discover was having a promotion where for each payment he made, they entered him in a contest to win some big prize. I guess we can call that a win-win. The kicker? There wasn't any notices that bots weren't allowed, so he technically didn't abuse any of the systems and couldn't get in trouble.

We did write a script to refund all the transactions and put checks to make sure that multiple payments couldn't be made, but it just goes to show: Don't piss off computer guys.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of you bastards...

**EDIT:** To avoid confusion - we wrote a script to cause our software to ~~issue the ~85k transactions refunds~~ void the ~85k transactions. Thus, the money never left the student's account. 

In the end, the student's money was returned, no fees were paid to the processor, and the student paid his full tuition with a single payment (275.09 dollars to the credit card processor, I imagine). 

There wasn't any harm done, except a handful of sleepless nights in the Business office and a couple hours of a developers times to write the refund scripts. 


**EDIT 2:** I'm going to add more technical detail since this got bigger and because there are a few posts regarding the legality of what happened. I didn't elaborate on this before for simplicity, but it's become important. 

Credit Card payments occur in two steps:

1. The credit card is authorized - this is to ensure the money exists in your account, and when you look at your account balance and you see 'pending transactions', this is the state those transactions are in. The authorized amount hasn't been removed from the account but the money is frozen for 3-5 business days. 

2. The credit authorization is settled.  - this step removes the money from your account, and deposits it (minus processing fees) into the merchant's account. Generally, merchants are charged an additional fee per settlement - so settlements are grouped into batches. Thus, your authorizations may not be settled for 2 or 3 days, depending on the settlement habits of the merchant you paid. 

In this case, the school did *not* settle the transactions. Because there was no settlement, money had never changed hands. I used the term refund above for brevity, but in commerce speak, the transactions were actually voided. Because they were 'voided' and not 'refunded' and no money changed hands, the school was in the clear. 

It is not my intention to get anyone into trouble or embarrass the school.

Being the morning guy for saturdays (2 of us covered saturdays and sundays as those were our lightest workload days, I did 7am-5pm), it was usually the most uneventful day of the week.  I would usually bring in a dvd or a portable hdd (well, an IDE drive in an external adapter - this was in 2005) and watch movies most of my shift, as it was unusual to get more than 1-2 calls on Saturday morning.


This particular morning, I get in, and go through my usual routine and get logged into the ticket system and the various servers so I can get access to what I need.  Before I log into the phone, I check the radius server to see if anyone is having issues dialing-in, and notice that we have practically nobody online.

She said that the tech would call me personally tomorrow morning (the next day, Sunday) and explain everything, but that service wouldn't be back up until Monday because they had to bring in extra parts.  Ok, I can understand that.  Sucks for us and our customers, but it happens.


Come Sunday morning about 10am, I get my only call of the day.  It is the National Telecom CO field tech on the phone.  He apologizes for about 10 minutes before I can get him to explain what went on.  This is a paraphrased and heavily sanitized version of the conversation, ME, and TECH:
*****
ME: So, what can you tell me so I can pass it on to customers so they can understand better why our service was out?

TECH: Well, uh, uhm.... do you really wanna know?

ME: Sure.  It helps to explain to customers so they aren't so mad.

TECH: It involved chainsaws and bees.

ME: Wut?

TECH:  I was doing maintenance on the line and had to cut some limbs off a junction box.  While I was doing this, a limb I was cutting on happened to be hollow and full of bees.  As soon as I realized it, I panicked and dropped the chainsaw.  The chainsaw's deadman switch didn't work, and it kept running as it cut through the junction box and lines while I was diving out of the cherry-picker trying to get away from bees.

ME:  *stunned*  Wow.  I don't think the customers will believe it.

TECH:  My supervisor didn't either, until he saw the bee swarm when he went to get the company chainsaw that was still stuck in the junction box.

Techsupportvictim,189,597,1nw09i,1059,"Okey dokeys. It's Sunday at the big brand tech store. Shorter hours, shorter tempers. Oh joy.

So in comes DudeBro all swagger and such. Now we run by appointment and given we were closing in like 30 minutes with every appointment checked in, a 'slip you in' just wasn't going to happen. Especially since our system adds an extra queue for every 3 techs. So we had 4 techs each with 3 appointments (they are ten minutes) and 3 extras. All there. Yeah it's stupid but our managers just don't see the problem. 

I'm in 'hostess' if you will. Trying to get everyone served for their brand company phone or tablet 

I greet DB and he immediately launches into this profanity filled tirade about how his phone which he just got brand new is an f piece of s, how he doesn't want to hear any F BS about needing an appointment, how we were going to give him a new one blah blah. He's got an entourage of a couple of his dude pals with him and his girl who looks like she is probably a stripper in that get up.

I make the call that I'm going to try to help him since the techs have their list of names etc. So I ask him what specially is the issue. And he manages with several f bombs to tell me that he just picked up the phone at a carrier store cause we can't seem to have them in (they just came out about a week ago and anyone that knows our brand knows that EVERYONE wants one yesterday so we stay basically sold out for the first month). Right there that blows retail swap as an option even if we had it. And even though they haven't been out long enough for refurbs to exist he's yelling about he doesn't want one of the f'ing refurbs we pawn off on folks that come for service).

More bombs later he finally spits out that he can't make phone calls. My first thought is perhaps the carrier system was backed up and it hasn't activated or he was porting the number to a new carrier. Until he says, many more bombs, that he can dial the number but can't hear an f'ing thing unless he puts it on speaker phone which is f'ing ridiculous and he doesn't want the world to hear his f'ing business.

Now I'm getting an idea. So I ask real nicely if I can take a look at his phone. Once I get it in my hands I very calmly tell him that his behavior is childish and deplorable and if he ever comes into my store again acting like that I will see to it that he's banned not just from my store but every brand store in the area. I say it low, straight face and firmly enough that he doesn't think to question that I'm not a manager. Given I was kind of (nicely) bossing the tech staff around I was hoping he'd make that assumption.

Then I pull the dang shipping plastic off the front of the phone, hand it to him and tell him it's fixed. His pals were off looking at a demo but the stripper babe is right there and sees the whole thing. From the look on her face he's not getting any this month. 

He says nothing so I just say 'you're welcome' and then as he walks away I kind of loudly say something to the tune of 'and you might want to take the one off the back or all your mirror selfies will come out looking like they were shot by a drunk with cataracts' ",Wherein I made a ranting dudebro look like a moron in front of a hot chick,1656
thebornotaku,210,172,1hzxy7,1065,"So my mom used to work in IT, as a network engineer. She was very good at what she did and specialized in getting doctor's offices set up and running all the software they needed, but also had other clients too. This is the story of one client who decided he didn't need to pay for her services.

My mom was always very meticulous about planning out networks, taking lots of time to draw up diagrams of how everything would work, even using floorplans of the buildings to develop her plans so that she could minimize downtime and usually get everything knocked out overnight, or over the weekend. I occasionally helped her with this by either running cables, installing workstations, updating software, or whatever.

Well, she got a job from a gentleman, drew up her plans, and got them to order all their gear. Everything arrives and she goes in and builds this guy's whole office network. Servers, workstations, cabling, the works. She gets everything set up and running nicely over the weekend.

I'll take this opportunity to say that she always left herself a remote access point to the network, so if anything arose, she could troubleshoot it from home. Businesses loved this because it meant that she could get to the problem much faster and wouldn't have to take the time to drive to their location and solve software issues. She didn't spend a *lot* of time building networks and instead spent most of her time maintaining and upgrading things, and spent a lot of time at home, so her response times were pretty quick.

Anywho, Monday rolls around and the office is open. Everybody gets to work and my mom calls the owner about collecting on his bill. Apparently at this time, the gentleman (used loosely) told her that ""she had already set up the network and now there's nothing she can do if he doesn't want to pay for it"".

Oh, how wrong he was.

She decided this would be an awesome time to remote log in to the server, disable all the user accounts aside from the admin account that only she had the password to, and then issue a force restart command to all the workstations. *While on the phone with the business owner*.

The guy freaks out when he realizes suddenly all of his employees are now sitting at desks with terminals that they can't log in to. Guess what? Nothing's getting done. The guy doesn't seem to realize what's going on and asks my mom if she can come down there and see what's going on with their computers, since nobody can log on.

Her response?

""If you don't want to pay me for the network, then you don't get to use the network. I'll enable everything again once I get a cashier's check from you. You can either mail it to me and wait a few days, or drive it to me. The choice is yours.""

Apparently, he chose to drive it out to her right then. Smart man.

That, kids, is why you never refuse to pay the person who designed, built, and implemented your entire network.","Not mine, but my mom's. From her time as a network engineer.",1237

ReactsWithWords,176,286,17rxy5,1059,"Flashback about 15 years ago, when I was doing the looking-for-a-job-by-temping thing (btw, it worked).  One assignment was to make a simple database (basically payroll) for a company.  Of course they didn't have any database software, but they did have Excel.  However, The Boss ""didn't know Excel"" and had zero desire to learn it so I had to do it in Word.  Okay....


I then kludged a simple macro together for an input screen and made a simple-yet-does-the-job database in Word.  I then showed The Boss.

""Where is it?"" he asks.  I point to the icon of the file.  He clicks on it.  ""It isn't working!""

""You have to double-click on it.""

""That's too complex.  Make it so I only have to click once.""

I got up and phoned the temp agency and told them to take me off the assignment.

* Select file, press delete. Nothing. 
* Right click -&gt; delete. Nothing.
* Check resource monitor to see if a process is holding the file open... No activity on that file. 
* Command prompt, navigate to file, del filename. cmd.exe crashes. 
* Open command prompt as admin, navigate to file, del filename. CMD hangs for a couple of minutes... explorer.exe crashes.

----------------------------------

I had a user that used to lie to me a lot.  She'd complain about her computer being slow or not performing the way that it was supposed to.  The company, for whatever dumb reason, gave users local admin rights so they could install anything they wanted.  We made them sign an agreement when they were issued a new machine stating that they would not install anything without our consent.  Of course the user kept on installing private software and a lot of it was full of malware/adware.  Everytime I would troubleshoot her computer I would see the stuff and uninstall and ask her where it came from.  She always said she didn't know.  

Finally I got fed up with it so I wrote her an email asking the same question and detailing all of what I'd had to uninstall.  She responded saying that she had no idea how the software was getting on her system.  I responded with a CC to my boss, her boss and facilities management, raising the alarm that our building obviously had some kind of security issues.  Someone must be coming in and logging in on her machine after hours and installing software.  

My boss figured out what I was doing and played along.  Her boss and facilities took the issue very seriously and were even talking about calling in the cops, or talking to the firm that hired the cleaning people.  Gradually it escalated until one of them finally thought to ask how the saboteurs were logging on if they didn't have a password.  I said ""good question. We should look through the logs and see who has been using the machine outside of business hours.""

Of course nobody had been.  Keep in mind that the user has reasserted several times that she doesn't know who has been doing the installs over the course of all of these meetins.  So I say that the only logical conclusion is that someone in the office must be doing it.  Now we call in HR because we might need to fire someone.

Finally the user breaks down and says that the installs may have been something that she did by accident.  Thing is that on top of all of the crappy tool bars etc., she had been installing paid applications from DVD.  That doesn't happen by accident.  Now her boss and everyone who hadn't already starts to figure out what has been going on, and how much time she has been wasting for them.

She got 6 weeks notice and I got to tell this story about a million times to every user in my office.  They tend to be more upfront with IT now.","A scumbag user story, from /u/YouBWrong",1338

*****

**Calls 1-3.**  Can't get online.  After troubleshooting, diagnosed as dead modem.  Customer calls back later after getting the new modem.


**Call 4.** The customer was scared to death (a young, stay at home mother) of opening her computer, but once I put it to her in the following terms: ""If you can play Legos with your 3 year old son, then you can do this.""  That got her laughing, and she got out the screwdriver and opened up the side of the case while it was laying down on the floor.  


Unfortunately, I had neglected to make sure that she had turned it off first.  So, it was still running.  She turned her back a moment to set down the screwdriver, then I hear *kkkkrrrrrchhchchchchch* over the phone.  Seems her 3 year old son had discovered that the CPU Fan made a wonderful noise if you pour Fruit-Loops into it.  


After her panicking and me getting her quickly calmed down and explaining how to fix the situation - involved turning off PC, and using a vaccuum with soft brush attachment - she told me she would call back later after it was cleaned up.


Now, with those of you who have been reading my stories, you know that I haven't even gotten to the 'conversation' part yet, which means the best is yet to come.  What is better that Fruit-Loops in a CPU fan?


**Call 5.**  She calls back in a couple hours later, and wants to continue walking through the setup.  I asked her to grab the instructions for the modem and read them quick to see whether to install the modem driver first or the modem hardware first (it DID make a difference in those days - ugh, terrible issues if you got it out of order).  She says ""oops, left the instructions in the kitchen, I'll be right back!""  She set the phone down, and I hear her walk off to another room.


During this time, I hear her son toddle past the phone, giggle, and then hear something splashing, with LOTS of giggling during the splashing..  I assume he dropped his drink or something.  His mother walks in during the middle of the splash-laugh, I hear an audible *squeek* from her, a bunch of sounds of rushing around, her muttering under her breath, and then a couple minutes later, she gets on the phone with me.

*i make a joke at this point to help calm the situation*  Well, at least Fruit-Loops in the Heat Sink are the least of your worries at this point.

**Her:** He's ok.  You are right about the Fruit-Loops.  At least that was an easy clean-up.  Though the computer smells funny now and *GASP* OH LAWD IT'S ON FIRE!  NO SON, DON'T PEE ON IT TO PUT IT OUT!!!

cobysev,226,278,161g1p,1048,"Nearly a decade ago, I was working on a helpdesk at a US Air Force base in Japan.

Because we were just across the water from North Korea, we were constantly preparing for worst-case scenarios.  We call them ""exercises"" and they would typically last anywhere from a week to a month.  During an exercise, we would simulate a wartime environment.  We would have various simulated scenarios occur that we might see during an actual attack.  Unexploded mortars lying near the building; signs of chemical/nerve agent mist in the air; wounded victims lying in the streets; unauthorized people trying to talk/force their way into our secured facilities; etc.

One day during one of these exercises, our squadron commander, a Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol), showed up with a large plate of homemade chocolate chip cookies.  He came in early in the morning while the night shift was still working and he left the plate in the middle of the office where it would be highly visible.

He told the night shift not to eat any cookies and not to tell the day shift where they came from.  He then left.

Of course, the day shift comes in and instantly starts digging into the plate of cookies.  Nobody questioned their origin; most people assumed that someone's spouse delivered them.  Exercises are miserable times for us and sometimes spouses like to bring us baked goods to improve morale.

In the early afternoon, the LtCol returned to the helpdesk.  There are a couple cookies left on the plate.  He asks the room, ""Where did these cookies come from?""  No one had an answer for him.  Not a single person knew.

""Okay,"" he said, ""how about this.  Who's been eating these cookies?""  Every hand went up except for one low-ranking Airman.  This guy's rank was Airman (E-2).  This is typically the lowest rank you can have and not be in Basic Training or tech school.  So this guy was very young and brand-new.  Practically no experience and still learning his job.

""These cookies were poisoned,"" explained the LtCol.  ""Everyone who just raised their hand, you're now dead.  Go stand over in the corner.""  The whole room shuffled to one corner of the office and crowded around a large meeting room desk.  The lone Airman stayed put.

""You, Airman, are the highest-ranking person left.  So you're in charge of the entire helpdesk.  Good luck""  And then he turned to the crowd in the corner and told them, ""Remember: you're all dead so no talking and no helping the Airman out.  He's on his own, got it?""  Then he left.

That poor Airman ran the helpdesk by himself, in the middle of a stressful exercise, for a half hour before the LtCol returned and ""resurrected"" the whole office.

The moral of the story is not to touch any food that magically appears in your office.  If you don't know where it came from, keep it out of your mouth.

**TL;DR - LtCol secretly delivers ""poisoned"" cookies to the helpdesk during an exercise.  He ""killed off"" anyone who ate them (everyone except for one new guy).

Turbojelly,124,300,14dlj2,1046,"So my 1st call this morning was a user having problems with her email. She kept getting emails from the system administrator but was too scared to open them, could I help her? (obviously it was a ""your email is full"" message)

I asked her to select the emails and delete them, then empty her deleted items folder. This caused much confusion as she was unable to work out how to select multiple emails or how to empty her deleted items folder. (At this point I have placed my wrist pad in it's position, ready to receive my head falling onto it, multiple times.) So I start to explain to her how to select multiple emails but even this is a bit too much for her. I ask her if it's OK for me to remote into her PC and show her how to do it. She agrees, I remote in, and give her a warning that I'm about to take control (""Could you please take your hand off the mouse, I am about to take control of it, don't worry"")

Once I take over her PC she gives a little yelp of suprise/delight and then sits back and watches as I sort her email, delete the systemadmin emails, empty her deleted items and so on. All the time she is reacting positivly: ""oh that's how you do that!""

Gnarll,113,255,1fnh8i,1040,"So like the title says, I'm a cable guy. I really enjoy my job, and the work, although I loathe the company I work for..
I meet all sorts of interesting people and get in to some weird situations because of this job, but this one in particular has stuck with me.

A few months back I get a service call at an address, seems simple, just a faulty digital box so a 5 minute swap and I'm gone. 
Knock on the door and a small, fit elderly man answers. We talk a bit on the way to his living room, and I start swapping out the box. Old people like to talk, so I just nodded while I did my work. He starts talking about his recently deceased wife, how much he loved her, things like that. You get that a lot, it's best to listen but not seem too interested, because then they'll get teary-eyed and it gets REALLY awkward.
Turns out, he's been dealing with a rare blood cancer for 8 years. Every few months he gets a blood transfusion which slows the cancer down. It doesn't cure it, he's dying by inches, but he has a ways to go. His wife gets cancer 4 years ago and is gone in 3 years. 
I stopped working at this point to listen because...... Fuck.
He talked about meeting her for the first time, being married for 45+ year, she was the light of his life, his everything. No kids or anything, just her. You could hear how much he cared.... And then be said he hoped the cancer took him soon so he could go be with her, how he thought about trying to find a way to speed the process up.....
At this point I kind of wanted to remind him that I was just here to fix his cable.... What a hell of a thing to unload on a total stranger!!
As we were standing at the door saying goodbye I shook his hand (something I don't often do in this business, people are gross) and told him that I hoped whatever he wanted to happen happened as quickly as possible, and then I left.
I was a little upset as I drove away, that was a helluva love story to hear, and wrestled with telling someone what he'd said about speeding it up. In the end I kept quiet, told a few friends who thanked me for bumming them out, and hoped that he and his wife would be together, if there is an afterlife of course....

lemabeuf,184,285,1cebii,1044,"I had been informed (complained to) by a colleague that he was having error messages flash at him when he logged into our compute cluster. I'm not supposed to be support but as I have root, I end up doing a lot of the menial tasks so I had a look at it. 


It said [scratch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_space) was full, but it was Friday evening and not my job anyway so I pointed him to another server to work on and left it until Monday. Monday began with an email from UserJ to the whole user base saying ""I cant run anything on the cluster, not enough space. Maybe we should be investing in more space?"" (I'm not certain if she was referring to storage or RAM, but I'm not sure if she knows either).


So I went hunting. Our system is usually pretty full generally, but we've got 3.5T on scratch and it shouldn't be in that much use anyway as everyone has their plenty home storage. Discovered that the whole 3.5T was owned by one user (UserJ). Why she was doing all of her work on scratch I might never know, but I found large reference files (which would be of actual use) and two text files of 650Gb and 450Gb. Text files which I discovered contained millions upon millions of lines:
    ""Use of uninitialized value $filePath in string eq at program.pl line 19.


Turns out UserJ had been trying to run a script written about 6 years ago for small datasets on some new data without realising that it was throwing any errors. On top of that it appears out that she has turned nomadic, in that once full she moves the files to another area and runs it again, leaving digital detritus in her wake.

jamiephelan,181,279,tekjg,1032,"One of my clients is a large industrial supplier - pretty much the only respected manufacturer and distributor of its specific product in this country. I have spent the last month trying to get my head around an issue with the head engineer/draftsman's CAD laptop.

It all started when I was asked to upgrade the laptop to Windows 7 with AutoCAD 2012. So I did a full backup and upgrade. The engineer comes back to me, doesn't understand how to use the new software at all. Fair enough, not everyone's an expert. So we find the original disk and I install AutoCAD 2004 back on there. And then he tells me that his wife needs me to install this archaic piece of software, Microsoft Greetings.

I discover it's incompatable with Windows 7 and actually breaks the OS and stops it from booting if you try to install it. So I recover Windows. Then I install Windows XP Mode, and install Microsoft Greetings on it. Flash forward about a week. I get a phone call.

""Jamie! My computer's not working! Everything has just disappeared!""

Hmm.. strange. I take a look and sure enough all the software I installed is gone.

So I reinstall it all. I took an educated guess that the engineer had accidentally uninstalled AutoCAD because he told me he ""installed"" it when I had already done so.

A week later. Same problem again.

He brings his laptop into the factory and I have another look at it, it's all vanished. I open up System Restore to see if I can go back without having to reinstalll everything again. I see a few interesting restore points... specifically ""Undo Restore"" points. I realise that System Restore has run. I also see that in between each restore a ""Critical Windows Update"" has been applied.

So at this point, I'm stumped. I spend a day thinking about it, and come to the conclusion that this update must have a bug which causes this specfic software configuration to roll back to the last restore point.

So I decide to do a full reformat/reinstall and load the backup and software back on.

Then tonight I get a call. ""Same problem again Jamie, this is getting ridiculous, it was working fine until you touched it blah blah blah"". I disable System Restore using Group Policy Editor to make sure it can't happen again.

So I do it ALL again. We're all finished and I tell them ""If it happens again I'm just going to call this laptop a goner and get you a new one. As a professional in this field, I am stumped.""

About 15 minutes ago I got a call. ""Jamie, my wife tells me she can't find system restore. She uses it every time she's finished on the computer for security.""

-----

This happened many, many moons ago.  If I had to guess, it was sometime between 2003 and 2005.

At the time, I was working helpdesk for an ISP that was growing from the 'local provider' level to a 'regional provider'.  They'd buy up ISPs here and there, and roll them into our service.  In all honesty, they were a very, very decent company; good tools access for all the techs, our 'Tier2' at the time was all of 20' away in the cubicle farm and very affable to talk to.  Tours of our main datacenter were always available, and the kit they were using was top-notch.  On top of that, it was all very, very well documented.

We had a caller whom I'll call Phil.  Phil had a DSL line through us (with a backup/on the road dial-up account), with a couple e-mail addresses, we managed a domain and small (exceptionally simple) webhosting account (little, if any scripting support).  It was rolled into a 'business-class' billing structure, of course; meaning that he paid a bit more and his webhost was on a slightly higher-end server from the ""5MiB Free"" server, and they gave an uptime guarntee on his DSL.  Pretty basic stuff.

Phil, though, was anything but 'basic'.  He was horribly mean, nasty, and clueless in all things tech.  He'd also call for anything, multiple times.  I remember seeing a few items in the call logs for stuff like problems with various office equipment.  A good example was when he bought himself a flatbed scanner, and called us to help him with it.  I luckally didn't get one of those calls (somehow), but there was a good week straight where he'd call multiple times a day trying to get it to work; the ticket log would have ""Scanner Won't Work"" listed a good 100+ times, spanning a solid 10 days.

He was horribly abusive to other techs; women especially, as you may have guessed.  I herd stories of others leaving the floor in tears after, and during, calls with Phil.

I took a few calls from Phil, and I personally didn't have too much trouble with him.  The thing was, I was, and still am, an extreme stickler for process flow of calls, staying inside support boundries, being exceptionally clear (and hitting the 'call record' button) when I stepped outside them that people wouldn't get this help here ever again.  Phil, of course, tried every opportunity to yell, bluster, cajole, blame, and be rude to anyone who attempted to show him the slightest hint of leniency or kindness concerning linear tech support.

My first call with Phil was a model for all further calls I personally had with him.

Me: Good afternoon, XYZ tech support, my name's SilentDis.  May I have your name, please?  
Phil: This is Phil.  
Me: Alrighty Phil, how can I help you today?  
(Side note: I learned, long long ago, to just get a name and let the customer vent.  If I can't find their contact info from the Caller ID, I'll get it soon enough.  This makes callers feel that you're a human, and on their side.)  
Phil: I am trying to get the page you are hosting to connect to my printer and it won't connect!  What is wrong with your company, are you behind the times?  This is a new printer, why don't you support it!  I swear I'll take my service somewhere else if you people don't wise up and fix this mess and get it working!  
(I'm paraphrasing a bit here, but this was the tone, tenor, and reason for his call to a tee.  I pressed the *call record button* at this point, which will backtrack and record the entire conversation)  
Me: Ok, so you're having problems printing a website, is this correct?  (**Always** get that verbal contract)  
Phil: I just told you what the problem is!  Weren't you listening?  What's wrong with you?  (and on, and on, and on...)
Me: I just like to be sure I'm helping you out as best I can.  You are having problems printing a webpage, is this correct?  
Phil: Yes!  I can't print the webpage you are hosting on my new printer!  (Verbal contract established)  
Me: Ok.  We're not really able to help out with printer problems, but...  
Phil: Why can't you help me, what's wrong with you?  You're not good at your job, are you?  
Me: Sir, do not insult me.  As I was saying, We're not able to help out with printer problems, but I can help you make sure everything we do help with is working properly.  I've pulled up your account from Caller ID.  I see everything's in good standing, and I see no reported outages for your area.  Can you hold one moment while I verify the connections from my side?  
Phil:  Fine.  
Me: Thank you, be right back.

Welcome to the penalty box, Phil, population: you.  I telnet into the various switches and routers he's attached to, and see his modem as attached; physical layer is good.  Send a ping on the Data layer, fine.  Send a ping on network layer and don't get a response.  That's fine, firewall is in place.  I ask for the stats on that line, wait a minute, and ask again; they've gone up.  He's sending data over the line without any issue whatsoever; Golden.

I check his website; a Geocities-esque site selling various bric-a-brac.  Whatever, it comes up.  SSH into the server, and it shows a nice 200+ uptime.  Ping his site from the switch he's attached to, no problems there.

Phil's been in the penalty box for a good 5 minutes now, lets see how that's changed his attitude.

Me: Sorry about that, sir.  I list off all the tests I performed above, non-stop without break, throwing in a few technical terms here and there.  
Phil: Uhh... (perfect.  I've gooed his little brain, exactly my intent.)  
Me: Since everything's working on this side, let's make sure everything's working on your side.

I walk him through opening up a webpage, opening up his webpage, and checking his e-mail.  All work without problem.

Me: Now, that's what we support; your Internet connection is working, your website is working, your e-mail is working.  You stated, though, you're having problems printing; which is not something we support.  Who makes your printer?  
Phil: Umm... Hewlett Packard?  (he sounds unsure, that's fine, I don't really care anymore, my job is done)  
Me: Then, it would probably be best to call them.  If you want, I can give you their phone number.  
Phil: Yes, please.

I gave him the phone number, and away he went.  He, of course, attempted to call a few more times concerning the same issue, with varying degrees of illiciting the argument he wanted, but most techs were savvy enough to just pull his call record and ask him if it's the same issue; then why he's calling again about it, and off they went.

My boss later told me I was the only one who could 'stop' Phil when he called.

This went on for a few more weeks, before Phil got to another tech, and got them to cry.  It was decided, at that point, to just give Phil my extension, and deny him service if he called on any other line.  If I wasn't in, he got my voicemail.

TL;DR: I will break you, asshat caller.","Angry, Clueless... you have met your match.",1364

...and then I handed over the printed copy of the above email exchange that I had brought with me just for such an eventuality.  

...and then I went home. 


EDIT:

To clear up a few things and to give a rather disappointing answer to top comments there:

Software in question is basically for doing stats with, and [guy giving lecture] isn't teaching anyone how to use it, he's giving a lecture on statistics, and using this thing to provide examples. As it turns out he didn't actually seem to think it was that important, it was mostly just some people in admin getting terribly excited about somthing they hadn't actually taken the time to understand. The iPad problem was solved neatly by emailing the presentation to himself and picking it up the mail on the machine that was already in the room, so as far as I know the lecture went fine. 

I don't really want to get into a big arguement about whether or not him being in our building and using our equipment makes him our user, but technically he doesn't work here. He's a visitor who happens to have booked the room. Since shit like this happens far too often, we have a pretty straight forward policy regarding buying software for people that aren't actually employed by us. We don't do it. Ever. If he had actually been a member of staff, I would have gone to see him earlier in the week since yes, that would have been easier for all concerned.

We responded to a house fire and were the second truck on the scene. The fire had started in the kitchen and spread across the living room consuming most of the first floor. After we had knocked down most of the fire, we went back out to the front door to get some tools. I have a rule taught to me by an old fireman long ago: don't leave a house fire empty handed since there's always an important memory to rescue. So on the way out the door, I look to this burnt pile of debris and see their desktop computer sitting there. I grab the burnt, mangled tower, yank the cables off, and cart the computer outside. I hand it off to one of the engineers and tell him to keep it safe. 

After the fire is out, and we have finished tearing up the rest of the house finding hot spots, I find the computer, crack the case open and see the interior is pretty clean. I carry it over to the homeowners. She is a sobbing disaster: mid 30s, three kids under 4, and her house is almost destroyed.  Then she sees the computer and screams with joy.

eatmyheadset,268,336,xqvq4,1013,"This is a true story of technical support heroics.

I work for a webhosting company, and one of the most painful things in the world is helping people setup their email. For some reason they just can't grasp how to do it, and helping somebody with this over the phone is enough to make you want to eat your own headset indeed.

One day a client calls up asking for help setting up her email in Outlook, I believe (although it could have been Mac Mail). I go through the routine of walking through all of the steps, but it doesn't work. Alright...that happens often, people don't always put in the right information. So we go into her settings and double check everything. It all looks good. She tries again, and it still doesn't work. At this point she's getting anxious and pushing, demanding that I figure out how to fix it. We go through all the settings again...still looks good, but no email. At this point she is literally in tears, screaming and crying, demanding that we get the email working.

I let her know that she's going to need to calm down or else we aren't going to be able to get this working. She gets ahold of herself a bit, and I walk her through the settings one more time. I tell her everything looks fine, and there may be something on her network that is having email problems, and that she may want to contact her ISP. At this point she angrily hangs up.

She calls back in not 30 seconds later, and gets me again. (People do this occasionally hoping they'll get a different tech who will give a different answer. Especially hilarious when working a solo shift.) I explain to her again that we've gone over everything and I have no idea why it's not working. She starts sobbing and pleading. (Why people get so emotional over technology, I will never know.)

Enter our hero! At the time our technical support rooms had been running out of space, so we had a few rooms to overflow into. That day I was in one of the overflow rooms with a developer who had gotten promoted out of tech support about a month earlier (and didn't have an assigned office yet either). He had started listening when he heard the consternation in my voice and the client's wailing on the phone. He messages me saying to tell her that I will transfer her to one of our senior technicians to continue to assist her. This is all a mental game - people calm down when you say that they're being escalated. You could actually transfer them to the newest tech on a team, and they would still calm down thinking that they're being sent to somebody higher up.

Glad to get her off the line, I tell her I'm transferring her to a senior technician to help her out. He gets on the line and lets her know he would like to try some screen sharing software. We don't have any in-house screen sharing stuff at all, so sometimes we'll use the free service on join.me when needed. The problem is, with certain special clients like this one, **you practically need screen sharing software to show them how to setup screen sharing software.**

**Former Tech:** I'd like you to go to join.me in your web browser, please.

**Weeping lady:** What do you mean? I don't have any idea what you just said.

Please keep in mind that she has a WEB HOSTING account with us, and yet does not know how to go on the internet.

**Former Tech:** Um, do you know what web browser you have? It could be FireFox, Safari, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer...

**Weeping lady:** *starting to get tearful again* I have no idea. Please just help me!

**Former Tech:** You know when you get on the internet? Like, to go to your website? I'd like you to go to your website.

**Weeping lady:** I don't know how to do that!!

**Former Tech:** Alright...on your computer screen, do you have anything that looks like a blue lowercase ""e"" right now?

*good call, most people like this would be either using Safari on a Mac or IE on a PC.*

**Weeping lady:** Yes, I think so.

**Former Tech:** Great! Could you please double click on that ""e""?

**Weeping lady:** Okay, I did it.

**Former Tech:** Great, could you now go to the ""address bar"" at the top where you put website names in, and enter ""join.me"" in it?

**Weeping lady:** Please...*sniff* I don't know what you're talking about. I just want my email to work.

**Former Tech:** Alright, do you know how to get to webpages from here? Like, Google or your own website?

**Weeping lady:** No!

**Former Tech:** *moment of brilliance* What about FaceBook? Do you know how to get to Facebook?

**Weeping lady:** Yes, I know that!

**Former Tech:** Alright, I'd like you to go to FaceBook now.

**Weeping lady:** I'm there now.

**Former Tech:** Alright, up near the top there should be a white bar that says ""http://facebook.com"". I'd like you to replace that text with ""join.me"" and then hit enter.

I'm glad to report the story ends happily. They finally get join.me working, and then is able to see what she did wrong with her email. I don't recall what she had entered wrong, but it was something simple that he was easily able to fix when actually seeing it.

Her final parting words?

orlet,198,201,1g6t29,1007,"This happened back in 2008. Back then I was working as the Computer Exorcist (read: a computer technician) at this small IT company providing techsupport for a few local businesses on-site, servicing random users' computers at our office and running a small computer and related stuff shop.

So, one day a customer brings a PC for repair, saying it won't even boot to windows. The front desk girl documents it all, creates a ticket and hands the PC over to me, all the usual stuff. I do the standard diagnostics and, obviously, the HDD is dead: it doesn't even get recognized by the BIOS (no wonder it doesn't boot). I call the customer saying that he'll need a replacement of the HDD and ask whether we should attempt a data recovery off it (for an added price, of course), the customer insists we do everything in our power to retrieve the very important data stored on that drive.

I believe most of you know the trick with harddrives and freezers, where you put one into the other and it magically makes them work again (for a little while). It sort of worked this time as well, but the drive was old and would warm up pretty quickly, failing within minutes of power-on and not allowing me to do a proper data recovery off it.

So here I was, sitting at my desk after having the drive reunited with the frozen vegetables in the freezer once again, trying to think up a working solution for this situation, when my eyes wandered over a few bricks laying in the corner - we used them as a deadweight to anchor our outdoors banner on windy days - suddenly the gears in my head sprung into motion and a wild idea appeared in my mind. I immediately grabbed one of them and shoved it into the freezer next to the failing HDD.

Next day first thing in the morning I took the drive and the brick out from the freezer, connected the drive to the external pATA controller, put this whole assembly on the brick and wrapped everything up nicely with a big old towel to provide thermal insulation, as well as to keep the moisture away from the electronic components, and started the drive imaging process. Approx. an hour later the imaging was done and the drive was successfully retired (i.e. put into a big box with the other fallen comrades). And the brick went back into the freezer, because you never know when you might need one again.

scootersbricks,138,211,1coq67,1010,"As many of you guys already know from my previous posts, I served about 14 months time working for a company that we'll call ""Spring together with Lextel"" doing work on their Blackberry phones.  Early on in my call-taking career, I learned a very important lesson.

I fielded a call from an older gentleman who needed to upgrade from a Motorola phone to a Blackberry.  I had him insert the sim, swapped all the numbers over that needed swapped, and set the new phone to active.  All the lights were green, and this guy's phone looked good to go.

Now sometimes the customer will want us to explain how email works, or how to surf the web on their new phone.  But no matter what, the one thing we always did was make sure they could make a phone call.  If that worked, chances are we were at least on the right track.

The conversation went something like this:

Me:  Alright, Mr. John Doe, it looks like everything is activated with your phone.  Now that it's booted back up we're going to make sure you can call out with it.

Customer: ""Okay, it's loaded. Now what do I do?""

Me: ""Go to the phone option.  When you dial a number here, and hit Send, it will call that number.""

Customer: ""Okay, so what do I do?""

Me: ""Just type in a phone number and hit Send.""

Customer: ""Well what number do I put in?""

Me, getting a bit exasperated: ""It doesn't matter. Just put in any number.""

Customer: ""Oh, okay.""  

We wait a few seconds, during which time I assumed the customer was typing in the phone number of someone he knew.

Customer: ""It says, Call Failed.""

Me: ""Hmm.  That's odd.  Not a problem; we'll do a bit of troubleshooting and see what the issue is.""

So we did a bit of troubleshooting, and we tried again.

Customer: ""It says Call Failed again.""

Damn.  What the heck is going on here?  The phone has a capital LXTL (an abbreviated version for Lextel, where each capital letter means one of the four main pieces of service are working).  It should be working.

For the next 45 minutes we do more troubleshooting.  I can call him just fine from my phone. But he can't call out. Every time he dials a number he gets ""call failed.""  

Finally the customer asks, ""Maybe there's a problem with the number I'm typing in?""

Me: ""Well...I guess it could be.  What number are you typing in?""

Customer: ""Twelve.""

In my haste, I had told the customer, ""Dial any number.""  So he literally picked a number at random--not a phone number, but just the first number that popped into his head--and dialed it.

I learned an important lesson that day: it doesn't matter how good you may be at your job.  If you can't effectively communicate with your customer, then you've already lost.","""Just dial a number. Any number.""",1221
seventoes,225,329,17moxw,1009,"So we have this guy. Let's call him Reginald, because that's the best name ever. Reginald has some very important data on his server. See, he has some big name clients. These clients are big enough to brag about on the phone to the guys managing the server (us), but apparently not big enough to warrant shelling out money for the redundant hard drives we keep recommending to him. 

Or, indeed, paying for his last 6 months of hosting services. In general, we're very lenient when it comes to late payments. If you're not being a douche, we'll give you quite a bit of time to get your account paid off. We won't add interest, and we won't keep bugging you about it.

You can see where this is going. In the dead of night two days ago, about an hour before our daily backups run, it happened. We, being the good service providers we are, had the server back up and running within an hour with a shiny new hard drive and data from a 23 hour old backup, since the old drive was shot. Shot the client an apologetic email, and went back to our regularly scheduled ticket queue.

First thing in the morning, Reginald calls up. He's *shocked* that we would consider this issue resolved with 24 hours of **very** important data missing! 

**Reggie**: You need to get my data back immediately!

**Us**: We really apologize, but the old hard drive is dead. We don't have a way to recover it.

**Reggie**: Let me talk to &lt;CEO's first and last name&gt;

**Us**: CEO's actually in a meeting right now, I can have him ca--

**Reggie**: NO! Let me talk to &lt;CFO's first and last name&gt; then! This data belongs to some very important clients!

**Us**: He's actually in the same meeting.

**Reggie**: Fine! Have CEO call me as soon as he gets out, I can't tell my clients that 24 hours of work has vanished!

A quick word about our CEO. While he's on board with the leniency we have for late payments and is a very level-headed dude, he's going to be the guy to pull the plug. We all know this, and while the dude's being a douche, we don't want to have to resort to that, since his clients actually are pretty decently sized and we'd prefer to not have this blow back on them too much. But Reginald keeps calling at least every hour, demanding that we pull CEO out of his very long and important meeting so he can convince him to make us magic his missing data.

We keep joking about it internally, there's really no way to tell this guy ""You do not want to talk to our CEO. If you start yelling at him about this unsolvable issue, he's going to cancel your account because you haven't paid us in 6 months. Please just accept your fate.""

He finally did end up accepting his fate, but not before (actually) yelling at three or four different techs after they told him that yes, our CEO actually has been in a meeting for the entire day (which was 100% true), and no, we do not have a way to magically recover your not-important-enough-to-redundicize data.

As of today, he's still not paid his bill, and he's still not considering the redundancy that we've recommended to him multiple times throughout the day. It seems that we might value his clients more than he does.","No, you don't want to talk to our CEO. We're trying to protect you from him.",1338

Good morning, TFTS! Sorry about that, I tend to get a little... unstable... without my coffee in the morning. I really need to look into intravenuous infusions of caffeine and B12 blends. Maybe the anaesthesiologists can give me a hand...

Anyways, I digress. Today's tale is of people not listening to me - as usual, of buying cheap kit - as usual, and karma being a right bugger - as usual.

Let's flash back a few years...

**SIR, THE GOOMBAS ARE DANCING AGAIN.**

""And that's why you don't play Evelynn. Ever,"" I said, clicking CONTINUE at the end of the League of Legends game I'd been playing with a coworker and exiting.

""She's more useless than a solar-powered flashlight,"" he chuckled as he left the shared tech room.

Sure enough, the phone on my desk rang, and the office manager shot me an AIM message telling me who it was.

&gt;Hey, Dr. XXXXXXXXX is on the line. They want to start doing some new stuff, MXX wouldn't tell me what. Mind picking up?

I shrug and reply.

&gt;Sure, why not. It's not like she doesn't have my damn cell number SOMEHOW.

So I get on the phone, and sure enough, it's the doctor's wife, who just happened to be the practice manager.

""Hi, Jack! How are you?""

Oh, this was not a good sign. She was cheerful and effusive, and whenever a client is like that around me, I get very, VERY worried very quickly. Sure enough, my suspicions were warranted.

""I could be better, I could be worse, MXX. What's going on down in your neck of the woods?""

""Well, the doctor has decided that we're going to start doing remote clinics next month, and we need to be able to work remotely. We're also worried about his medical study data. When you come down, can you take a look?""

""... MXX, you're aware that it's the end of the month? When is his start date for the remote clinic and who's going with him?""

""Well, we're starting in two weeks at one of the local hospitals. We also have two techs who are going with him, and they need laptops. Can we get them iPads? That would be so neat!""

""MXX, give me a minute.""

I hit mute on the phone and opened up the 4U case under my desk with a pair of old P4 Xeons and a SuperMicro board in it. However, since the PSUs were dead, it was a perfect place to hide a bottle of Glenlivet, and after a swig of the wonderful elixir (which purged by fire the invectives that were pooling up in my mouth), I unmuted her and continued.

""Okay. I'm going to send you a quote. You're going to approve it, call our Derp rep, and get what's on it ordered immediately. Without it, you can't do secure remote desktop.""

""A server? Those are expensive! We were going to do GoToMyPC on their computers and then let our temps use their computers while they're not at the office so we don't have to buy new machines. Can't you do it without buying a server?""

My eye twitched, and I resisted the urge to reach for the 4U case's blessed contents again.

""We have to account for security, remember? You're passing HIPAA-protected info into the medical record software. On top of that, you also have your credit card machine on the network. Finally, GoToMyPC will take up the machine when it's in use. Your temps won't be able to do anything with the machines, and you'll need new ones as is. Seriously, you really need to have a proper server for this. On a not entirely unrelated note, did you read the e-mail I sent you about the echocardiogram storage requirements? Storing a year of ECGs on a single non-RAID'd hard drive is just asking for disaster.""

""Well, Jack, he needs to be able to view them anywhere, and sometimes GoToMyPC just isn't fast enough!""

""MXX, I've said it before, it's been in writing three times now. This firm will NOT be held liable if you keep doing that if - no, WHEN - you suffer data loss. You're disregarding the advice of people who've seen everything, and we've offered to build you a storage server for them for months, but you've turned us down on a cost basis. What's cheaper - a server and maintenance, or a data loss incident under HIPAA?""

After a bit of negotiation, she agreed to order the quote I sent out for the TS server, but not the storage one (they went through a terabyte of data a year of ECGs, and this was a few months after the flood in Thailand, so drives were insanely expensive). I specced out a cheap little TS box - hardware and licensing, plus Office Enterprise licenses, came out to about three grand US.

A few days later, it arrived at my office. Surprisingly, the two small Latitude laptops I'd put into the quote for TS purposes weren't in there. I prepped the box, set up everything, and drove it the hundred miles to their office to set it up at the end of a day.

**END USERS WILL BE ENDED**

- - -

I pulled up to their main clinic around seven or eight,
And I yelled to the cabby - 

Wait, I was driving, and I made it there around four or so. Once I got there, I took the server inside and unlocked the comms closet, then stared in disbelief at the contents.

My previously-pristine comms closet was covered in boxes of crap like old phones, P4 Sony laptops, and even an ultralight Toshiba Satellite P1 laptop.

I made room for the server, punted the old gear to the side on the shelving, and powered it on. After joining it to the domain, I did my normal checks on the already-in-place server, saw that everything was good - the SQL database was backing up properly, nothing foul was in the error logs, the usual.

After that, I beelined it to the practice admin's office and sat down with a cup of coffee in my hands. She was a typical WASP suburban lacrosse mom - blonde, mid-40s, rail-thin, cocksure of herself, refuses to take no for an answer, the kind of soccer mom you just love to hate.

""Look, MXX, I have the remote desktop server up and running. It's tested, and your users can log in remotely from anywhere. They have EMR access, Office, printer access, they can fax out from your giant MFD, the whole nine yards. My question is this - where did the laptops go? I quoted two out on the Premier quote, but they weren't there with the server.""

""Oh, well, we didn't order them, the techs said they'd bring their personal laptops and they could use those! And the doctor's going to use his iPad, too, so we don't need anything for him.""

""... right, okay, here's the reasons that's a bad idea. One: your EMR isn't designed for iPad use, so he would go crazy trying to use the thing over remote desktop. We went over that before when he tried it with LogMeIn to his desktop and the studies. Two: their personal laptops aren't under warranty, I'm not going to drive 100 miles each way to fix them when they break and can't work. That's why we buy Derp, because the hardware can be replaced next business day without me needing to be here. Three: you didn't upgrade your Internet tier like I asked. I'd asked you to get a static IP and to go to 30 down and 10 up, and Speedtest said today that you're at 8 down and 512K up. If you don't make the call, I'll do it, since you put me on as technical contact on the account last week. I'm going to do my regular support checks on the workstations here, and once I'm done, I'll be driving back to Austin.""

The clinic closed down while I was checking each machine, and as I had the alarm code, I could get out after I was done. I winced when I looked over the doctor's computer and saw the single 1TB WD MyBook was still there - the one with the year of ECGs on it.

Everything checked out okay, and I put it in writing, again, along with the results of all my scans and checks, that she needed to get the storage server ASAP. At that point, I buggered off to Austin, and fell asleep with the sleep of the just.

**OF COURSE, THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING WENT TO CRAP**

- - -

Two days later, at six AM, my personal cell (!) rang.

Not my office cell, my PERSONAL cell.

Blearily, I answered it, and the practice manager's shrill voice rang through.

""Our entire network is down! Your new server broke the network and we can't see any patients!""

After answering that nothing I did could have caused it, I showered, got ready, and drove the hundred miles to her office, after calling my boss to let him know that I had an emergency there that day.

I was greeted there with the sight of the staff lounging around, waiting for things to come back up, and one even sarcastically greeted me, calling me the ""best tech ever"" and the only hope for the office.

I would have gone Biblical on this - as in Sodom and Gomorrah, pillars of fire, the whole nine yards - but one staffer who I rather liked quietly passed me a venti white mocha she'd gotten for me from Starbucks when she heard I was rushing down there, and the whole thing about finding one good person and sparing everyone came into play. As I gratefully accepted it and took a sip, my anger mellowed, and I plugged my laptop into the network to try to get things working.

&gt;IP Address: 169.254.x.x

&gt;(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

DHCP wasn't handing out addresses, but I was damn sure I didn't enable the DHCP role on the TS box. Grumbling, I turned on my cell's tethering feature to get some connectivity without touching their network. The wireless scan on my laptop showed the network I made called GotRoot... and... wait, why is there a network named NETGEAR...

NETGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR

I loaded up a spectrum analyzer and started tracing the access point. Sure enough, one of the users had a cheap piece of shit WGR614 router with patch in the switch ports going to both his machine and the wall. The minute I ripped that out, the network came back up.

Confronting the user in front of the practice manager led to more rage - ""well, I wanted to use my iPad, but I couldn't find the wireless network, so I plugged this in, but it didn't work, and nothing seemed wrong, so yeah.""

The practice manager piped up, ""It's okay with me, I told him that he could put in wireless for his iPad! We didn't think we'd need you to do THAT, since all we needed was a wireless router, that's what the guy at Derp Squad said.""

""Don't. Do. This."" I turned to the practice manager. ""If you want wireless, I'll be glad to order and configure you a Cisco access point so that it'll work perfectly, and even give you guest wifi for the people in the front. This isn't the first time I've warned you about ordering and putting gear in without letting me know. If this happens again, my boss finds out about it. He's said that he's fired clients for that before. Meanwhile, I'm calling Slime Warner and upgrading your connection like I said we needed.""

I turned to her on the way out of her office.

""Oh, did you look over that quote for the storage server I sent you? That's better and safer than that LaCie RAID external I see sitting on your desk, the one that I most specifically recommended against buying.""

By the end of the day, I'd put a dent in her available credit card balance by purchasing a Cisco 1142AGN. After configuring it, all was good, and TW had upped their connection to something usable. I drove back to Austin, and crashed hard again.

I was working for a large Cable/Broadband Provider when a call came through from a very polite, yet frustrated older woman.

Situation:
She tells me her cable isn't working. She can't get a picture on the her TV screen. 

Story:
I do the standard initial questioning and probing for more information. Nothing raises any red flags. Screen is blank, power is on because she can see the clock/time. I have her reboot her cable box, still nothing. I can see with a tool that we used that she wasn't in an outage area and that she was receiving a decent digital signal. I found it odd that she didn't see any changes on the screen when we rebooted the box, so I assumed she had just changed the channel on the TV from 3 or 4 that would allow the picture to come through. This was not the case. I thought maybe she just needed to get back to aux input so I had her looking for the aux/input/video button on the remote for her TV. She keep pressing the buttons, but nothing changes. I had her try locating one of the aforementioned buttons on her TV itself. She said she couldn't see one.

This rant went on for about 5 minutes, and I don't think she took a breath that entire time. And she wasn't whispering, this was full-on screaming. I kept trying to interject, to no luck. At this point my boss (the engineering manager, several tiers of hierarchy above her) walks by. She proceeds to scream at my boss for another 10 minutes, again not letting us interject. Finally, she seemed to have run out of steam, and just began to furiously look between my boss and myself, and her black screens. After about 2 minutes of silence, I reach over and turn on her external monitor. It blinks to life, showing her login screen. 

I will never forget the look on her face (or those on the crowd that had formed) as my boss said ""if I ever hear that you've yelled at a 20-year-old intern for your own blatent stupidity, I will contact So-and-so (the accounting manager) and have you fired"". She never spoke to me again in the remaining 5 months of my internship.

I explained to her if she bought a refurbished system from a game store, it would only cost $70 and she would get extra cables and a controller. I thought this was the end of our exchange but she was very persistent. She told me if she bought a refurbished unit for $70+tax, it would come out to almost $90. Now I'm no mathematician, but with 8% sales tax, that's not $90. Her companion finally suggested she try a pawn shop. What happened next was even more unbelievable than the rest of our conversation. This grown woman began whining to her companion in a quiet voice asking why she couldn't just get this broken Wii fixed. Not knowing how to make this woman understand basic economics, I took her information, she signed the work order, and I asked for a $40 deposit. I'm not ordering a part and fixing a worthless Wii without some money up front. That was all it took to remove her from my store. After asking for the deposit, she was no longer interested in getting it fixed. She promptly went next door and purchased a used Wii for a much cheaper price and left me dumbfounded.

Our users were given some cleaning wipes for their laptop. They're intended for the screen but they're alcohol wipes so they get used for cleaning all sorts of other bits.

One user wanted to use it to wipe down his keyboard, which was a bit gross to be fair, so I understood that decision. However, he didn't want to go pressing all the keys whilst he did it, for obvious reasons. This is the kind of user who would accidentally turn his screen upside down with the hotkey and then turn his monitor upside down to resolve the issue. He had spent about ten minutes carefully cleaning each key with a feather-light touch to avoid pressing any down before he plucked up the courage to ask; ""how can I disable keyboard input on my laptop?"".

I turned his laptop off. He finished cleaning his keyboard and then turned it back on again. He was absolutely gushing in his praise for my ""clever solution"" to the point of almost being patronising.

Sometimes I weep for humanity.

I explain about how manufacturer warranties don't cover physical damage, he rejects my explanation, we go back and forth like this for a bit.  Anyone who's ever worked retail knows the conversation.  He takes the stance that the product was shoddily-constructed and didn't hold up to use.

So I ask how the damage occurred.  He said ""I just picked it up like this...""

There was a substitute teacher. They wanted to use a laptop outside but didn't have the wireless password.

erins5,169,334,xp7q7,1008,"So, I was just working as a cell phone tech support rep, and /usually/ the customer service rep provides the clients info so that the client doesn't have to keep repeating it. Now, this CS rep told me, quite bluntly that this lady is pissed and wanted a new phone, he also said he was new and didn't know where to turn; he just had to pass the call along to me. 

The call gets transferred over and immediately she starts ripping me a new asshole. I let her yell and get it all out, and told her that she needed to calm down or I couldn't help her because I couldn't understand what she was saying because she was screaming. She took a breath, and explained what was going on with her phone. I went through my usual steps to resolve her issue, which was that her phone wasn't receiving a signal and she was missing calls etc. I reset her on our network and had her turn her phone on and off, that didn't work. I kept following the steps, and I got to a question that pretty much asked if there was physical/water damage to the device. She replied with this (I shit you not): ""I was pissed at my boyfriend and threw my phone against the wall"".

I actually went silent for a few seconds and tried to wrap my head around her stupidity. I advised her that even though she was still within her warranty, it was void because of the obvious physical damage. She then started yelling at me, saying that she did this a while ago and the phone was fine and that this started the day before. I tried to explain to her that damage doesn't have to immediate affect the device, it can happen at anytime. 

She went ballistic. I mean she was like a bat out of hell. Her exact quote ""I'm going to come to your work bitch and shove my blackberry down your throat, you cunt"". I really wish someone took a picture of my face because it really must have been priceless. I got so angry that I let her have it. I told her that if she wasn't such a dumb ass, than maybe her phone would be working, and that maybe if she was a good girlfriend, perhaps her bf wouldn't have cheated on her (hence why she was pissed). Clearly, this didn't help and she escalated to my mgr. 

After my manager finished the call, he called me over and I was still livid. He told me that he ended up reasoning with her, telling her that she wouldn't be getting a brand new phone, that she would have to purchase one. Also, he told me that I wasn't allowed to yell at customers anymore.

TalesFromTechSupport,252,772,xtlhx,1002,"*Hi there fellow redditors. This is the first story of my 16 part saga of working at a local computer store from end 2006 to early 2009. I hope you will enjoy. I will try to get a new chapter out ~~monday~~. Let's make that next friday for you folks* 

**Please note that this story takes place in Germany, many people have been confused about this. I use American conventions for aesthetic purposes only.**

***

December 2006 was when I first started working at the local computer store. I remember it was a late friday afternoon and quite dark and stormy. My kind of weather. It was my first day, of what would be 2 years of being employed there. 2 years of dealing with rudeness, absurdity and stupidity to have it all ending rather abruptly and explosively.

Days before the IT-administrator at my school found out I knew my way around computers and offered me a job at his “Business Partners” computer store. They had started it together back in the late 80’s. While he moved on to a full-time job as IT-administrator for many schools in the area, he still did some work in the store and owned half of it.

Though my mom told me when I was little not to accept any offers from strange people -and especially not from 40-something severely overweight Ron Jeremy look-a-likes - I took him up on the offer. My Nomad Zen, a MP3-player I still to this day love, was showing it’s age and I needed money for one of those fancy new iRiver MP3 players.

After he made a call with his, again, “Business Partner” he gave me the address and told me to get there around 18:30 on thursday and he and the “business partner” would give me a formal job interview. The way he said it, especially the intonation on the “Business Partner”-part, sounded like I was invited to do a casting couch audition for some B-grade porno site. Still to this day whenever somebody mentions a business partner I cringe and feel disgusted and violated.

After finishing up my homework at the school canteen that thursday I set off by bike to the computer store. It was located in one of the cheaper neighborhoods of our small city. The store − and all the stores surrounding it for that matter - much needed a new layer of paint and a good cleaning of the tiles and signs. Somewhat reluctantly I opened the door and walked into the store. No turning back now. I am greeted by my future co-worker Jeremy, a 21-year old college dropout. ”How can I help you today, pretty girl” He asked. I ignored the pretty girl part and told him about my job application and was supposed to see Ron Jeremy and his business partner. He walked to the back to talk with them, leaving me in alone in the store. 

Looking around in the store I saw a lot of old damaged displays. Some obscure and mediocre burning software, sold for 49,95 mind you, had a huge cardboard display with a rather  B-grade category model printed on it praising the product. Most of the walls and tables were full of accessories. Mainly cheap Chinese and Koreans knock off brands, sold for Logitech and Microsoft hardware prices. A few PCs and displays with outdated component lined the walls and sold for absurd prices. The current generation computers were even more expensive.

The counter was made entirely of glass and was empty aside from the even older cash register and some USB-gadgets from questionable quality. The space under the counter hold a huge amount of games. This had to be the only shop where you could still buy every Doom game released for PC for the full launch price, years, even decades later. Guess it’s a niche market. We never really sold much of it, anyway. 

Jeremy came back and told me I could walk to the back. I walked around the counter and almost broke my neck over the boxes full of non-branded memory. Stumbling into the back I almost bumped into the business partner. The top half of his shirt unbuttoned showing a rather disgusting orange-like forest of hair and a golden necklace. Like Ron he was severely - even morbidly - obese and was so large he could block your path. Looking up at him I saw a disgusting smile, one that still is burned on my retina today. A smile of lust. I think this is about to mention I was a 16 year old girl that got hit by puberty pretty fast and hard. 

He showed me a seat and and they took their places opposite me. Jeremy shouted from the front of the store he was leaving and I heard the front door slam shut. Looking back at the two obese figures in front of me, I felt somewhat uncomfortable, my boobs seemed to have a gravitational pull as a twin par of suns with the eyeballs of the two obese man  circling around them as planets. They kept their distance knowing going closer would burn them.  

Ron starts talking about how he liked my work at school and thinks I can help Don with the store during nights and weekends. Don, not impressed by my “Mad Skills” yet insists on a series of test he prepared in the days before. Anyone worthy of working in his store would solve these problems in no time. While he says this I start looking at him for the first time. He strikes me as the love child of Donald Trump and Fat Bastard from the Austin Power series.

The first test he gave me was installing Windows XP on one of the “new” machines for a customer and making sure all the hardware drivers were installed. Nothing special in this regard, aside from time consuming installing on a Pentium 3 with 256MB of ram. Don seemed to agree and I had to flash the firmware on one of the actually new Wireless Routers he just got in and wanted to demo in the store. To make it extra challenging I had to find the new firmware myself on a poorly translated website of the Korean manufacturer. To this day I still think I acknowledged Kim II-sung as my dear leader for eternity when accepting the terms of service for downloading the drivers.

The third and final assignment was supposed to get make me go running out of the store pulling my hair. But really at this point no difficult assignment was needed to get me to do this.

I had to configure a Debian linux installation to run a cron task, start the apache web server and delete and move a number of files. Nothing to troubling, but with my limited Linux skills I needed some help from Google. Asking whether it was okay to use the internet to look up some of the commands and configuration details Ron told me it was okay. “It’s not hardcore mode like us pro’s do it, but we will teach you the skills girl” Don quickly added. I felt even more uncomfortable now. After some 25 minutes the third task was completed and they congratulated me with passing the tests.

A standard 3 month contract quickly got grabbed from one of their desks and my details filled in. My pay would by around $5 dollars, which was actually quite good compared to supermarkets and other shops. All I had to do was sign. Overwhelmed by everything and against better judgement I did. They already has a schedule prepared for me as Ron had already taken my class schedule from the school system to see my available times. This gave me the feeling of being stalked, but before this sinked in they slid the paper over the table. I was to begin tomorrow, friday, straight out of school from 17:00 till 21:00. 

* * *

I was to begin my first shift today. Jeremy was to be my mentor for the day. After changing into the way to small  company t-shirt he sat me down and told me what I was supposed to do. It would have been quicker if he told me what I was not supposed to do. I had to help customers, stock shelves, order components and accessories from our Chinese suppliers, clean the shop, work the register, answer the phone and repair the PCs brought in by our customers. Basically everything you can do in a shop.

He showed me how the cash register worked, how the store was (dis)organized and some other tidbits of information. Jeremy was actually very likable and smart. He could have done much better for himself, but suffered from a number of problems causing him to completely shut down when entering a prestigious university.

When we came to the back things became rather interesting. I already seen the back of the store, but did not touch any of the stuff yet. We had a few work benches for the PC repairs including most of the cabling. The power sockets where all ungrounded extensions cords were connected to each other causing the power to fail whenever a computer had a short-circuit. The UPS installed in a corner covered by layers of dust was useless in this setup. Though Ron always insisted that it was there for a reason. I would find out 2 years later.

The binders of cd’s were full of cracked software ranging from all version of Windows and Office to every version of Photoshop and Norton Ghost. The only genuine software was the burning software that stood prominently in the store, and was thrown in for only 24,95 for housewives, failed businessmen and seniors, our usual mix of customers, buying a new overpriced PC.

The network drive had even more illegal software, movies and music on it, not to mention customer data. In a feat of NASA equivalent engineering Ron and Don somehow managed to connect dozens of hard-drives to an Windows XP installation and create a few terabytes of storage with reliable and pretty fast data transfer rates. The Usenet client on the pc always had at least 5 items in queue.  Mostly dvd-rips from new movies and porn.

My shift ended pretty quickly and was nothing special in that regard. My next shifts for over 2 years would be.

This one took place less than a decade ago, (2000's) when web conferencing or remote desktop's popularity was still starting to pick up. Our business was still growing and we hired co-op students/interns back then to fill in the tech support void. Our 2 offices were separated by a road, because leasing another office was the most feasible solution for our booming employee base. As such, we had two server rooms --- one for each building.

We had a task for our intern one day: to take some backup tapes out from the server room across the street. He may have done so begrudgingly, as he trundled along to the other office. I was doing some routine maintenance on the servers back then, and heard our IT manager wondering where our intern was after a little while. I did not mind it much, as we know our intern was a bit on the lazy side.

I was working on the servers across the street, and VNC'ed on one of them when I noticed something strange: one of our servers who had a monitor, keyboard, and mouse hooked up on a KVM switch was displaying porn sites on it. Since I was on VNC, I can see that the session is still being controlled by the user who was there locally. I motioned our manager to come see my screen and asked him what course of action we should take next as I let him drive on my workstation. He chuckled a bit, took control of the session, opened Notepad and typed 'Big Brother is watching you.' We saw the mouse cursor move to close the open windows in a panicked motion.

Nonetheless, when the newbie came back from his task, he was a little red-faced. We also replaced our mouse and keyboard for that KVM switch...

One such job was working for the (at the time) biggest consumer electronics chain in New Zealand, founded by an Australian guy. We did all the usual, including upgrades and computer bits and pieces.

Store policy was that any upgrades such as RAM was at the discretion of the employee, if we were going to fit them to the customers computer. Basically, if we were competent and could do it, and we weren't busy, then why not, go for it.

One Saturday afternoon, when the store was fairly busy, a customer came in wanting a RAM upgrade for his laptop. I didn't really want to put it in as we were busy, but he insisted, and it shouldn't have taken that long anyway... 

So I popped the cover off on the bottom and identified the correct type, verified there was a free slot, and rang him up for the new RAM (about $NZ80.)

Put the new RAM in and tried to boot the machine. No go. Battery flat. Does the customer have the charger? Of course not, it's at home. I was feeling even more uneasy now, but let it (and him) go.

I had a nice relaxing day off on the Sunday.

Come Monday, I get a phone call from a very irate customer insisting that I must have stolen (not only) his new RAM, but the existing RAM also because his computer wouldn't boot. He had taken the machine to a friend of his who ""did computers"" and the friend had ""taken a look"" (removed the RAM panel underneath) and there was no RAM there.  I pointed out that I had installed the new RAM in front of him, and there was honestly no way I had done any such thing. I suggested that sometimes a dud stick of RAM could prevent the machine from booting, it fell on deaf ears. I invited him to come into the store and we could troubleshoot to find the problem, this time perhaps could he bring his charger so we can verify it works before he leaves the store? Of course not.

So my store manager had me drive into the city (about 15km) with my own car on company time (she did give me a petrol voucher after the fact) with cash to refund him (last resort) and 2 of every type of RAM we carried, just in case...

I opened up the bottom of the laptop and pointed out there were 2 covers, one for the HDD and one for the RAM... of course, ""friend"" had opened up the wrong cover... so I replaced the RAM I had originally installed and the machine booted.

Very frustrating.

photopteryx,60,233,154fzp,994,"I worked for a while at a retail business that sold plants. It was a small operation, and nothing about it had a ""corporate"" feeling. We had three employees, so we were all kinda responsible for everything, but we each had the freedom to play to our strengths. We had two small offices, a front counter, and a room where we kept seeds for propagation, in a small building surrounded by our plant nursery. We used a ""natural ventilation system"" more often than the AC unit, which is to say that we simply left the doors open pretty often. The most technologically advanced things we had were our touch-screened point-of-sale computer, and our 4-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system. [You know, like this.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-Camera-CCTV-System-Long-Range-Infrared-Cameras-and-8-Channel-DVR-/120980267929#vi-content)

You might wonder why such a small operation employed such seemingly unnecessary methods simply for keeping an eye on things, but I'll not go into the details about the coffers of our operation's benefactors. Suffice it to say that we had had some things stolen, and they saw a way to prevent things like that. So we got a four-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system. It got the job done, as overkill often does.

Now, to the meat (or tempeh, if you like) and potatoes of the story:

The DVR and TV monitor for our camera system resided in the ""seed storage"" room. So, while you were cleaning seeds you could keep an eye on the outside world or ""review the tapes,"" as it were, of past nights. One afternoon as we're closing up shop, I look into the room and see that someone has been cleaning Gaillardia seed heads to harvest the seeds. The scene resembles [this fine image that I stole from the internet](http://blackfootnativeplants.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/gaiari-seeds-web.jpg). Apparently they hadn't finished, but that's fine because nobody will be in here overnight to mess with it.

The next morning, where the pile of plant matter had been, the table is clean. *Spotless*, in fact. Not a seed left. I confirm with the other employees that neither of them had come in overnight to work on these seeds.

""Maybe they blew off the table somehow?"" A reasonable enough suggestion, but there are seeds neither on the table nor floor. Other ideas were briefly raised and then shot down with equally convincing counter evidence, and so we were forced to come to the conclusion that, though ridiculously unlikely, someone had entered the office and stolen our really abundant and not-all-that-valuable seeds. Fortunately, we have a four-camera, infrared, closed-circuit, DVR surveillance system! With it being a slow day that day, we all decided to sit around the DVR and watch what (if anything) happened the night before, and perhaps determine who came in and what else they may have left with. We kept a channel on live footage of outside in case we saw a stray customer.

So, we sat and watched (in 16x fast forward) the events of the previous night. Or rather, as it turned out, the non-events of the previous night. No person entered or exited the premises save ourselves at the already established times. We had a genuine mystery of missing seeds, and at that point it was way more about the novelty of the situation than regard for actual loss of property. It was then when I made a breakthrough discovery...

When I reached up to switch the DVR back to displaying live feed on all its channels, I felt that the box was much warmer than usual. When I looked at the side vents to see if the vents were blocked by dust or something, I saw that they were indeed blocked by something. Lots of small somethings, actually.  But those somethings were moving. To my keen eye, these appeared to be the antennae of hundreds of rather large ants that had squeezed themselves into the DVR unit through the vents and perhaps have made a new home inside. And I decided that if they were making a home, they probably needed building materials. It hardly takes a Sherlockian leap of logic to tie the two tales together. Our stolen seeds were stashed away in the very security device design to prevent thefts! I laughed at the irony of it, and the other employees then gave me funny looks. So, in lieu of verbal explanation, I unplugged the DVR from its cameras and TV, grabbed a screwdriver, and gently carried the box outside.

I unscrewed the shell of the unit from its base and peeled off the **Warranty Void If Broken** sticker sealing the gap between the two (shh, don't tell the manufacturer). When I lifted the top and rapidly backed away, thousands of carpenter ants emerged in a confused mass of indignation. The looks on my coworkers' faces bounced from confusion to shock and finally to amused comprehension as they saw that half of the tiny little workers were carting around our Gaillardia seeds.

I left the DVR outside for a couple hours and let the ants extract themselves from our electronics, and then carefully vacuumed out the mess that they'd left behind. After I sealed the box back up (sticker and all), we plugged it in back in the seed room and made a mental note to not leave potential nesting materials behind anymore.

WinterHill,205,232,18b7zo,996,"While I'm not an IT professional, I have built several systems for myself, and have always been able to tackle my own computer problems without issue. By far, I'm the most computer-literate person in my family.

As you can probably guess from the above description, this makes me the tech support wizard for my family (AKA: I have a magic computer-fixing wand). 

But what they don't realize is that when they have some minor issue like needing a driver install, or changing a setting in MS Office, or troubleshooting a printer, 90% of the time I don't know what the issue is off the top of my head, and I have to google it just like everyone else. Also 90% of the time, the solution that google presents is very simple, and doesn't require my knowledge or experience to implement.

But of course, it's much easier to just ask me to deal with it. Well, last night I got fed up with being asked to deal with computer issues every time I walk into my parents house, and instituted a new policy. Here's the conversation that led to the new policy:


**Sister:** Hey WinterHill (WH), can I ask you about a computer problem?

**WH:** Uh, sure, what is it?

**Sis:** Well, my laptop keeps overheating. I can feel that it gets really hot when I set it down, and then it runs really slowly until I prop it up to let more air in.

**WH:** Hmmm... sounds like you could have dust in the air vents, or the fan is broken. Let's take a look. Hmm, nope, looks like the vents are clear, and the fan is working.

**Sis:** Ok, what else could it be then?

**WH:** I dunno, I've never run into this type of issue with my laptop before.

**Sis** (w/ blank stare): That wasn't helpful. What are you going to do then?

**WH:** Oh yeah, I've got my magic wand in my car, I could go grab it.

**Sis:** Come on, I need help and I'm leaving for a 6 month trip tomorrow. (great time to deal with your computer issues, right?)

**WH:** Have you tried googling the issue?

**Sis:** No, I don't know how.

**WH:** (knowing she's full of crap) Oh! Well let me show you. First, you click up here in your browser, then you type www.google.com. And you see that big rectangular bar in the center? That's where you type your issue, and then press enter!

**Sis:** (being difficult) What do I type?

**WH:** Really? Type: 'laptop model number' + 'overheating'


She does this and... go figure! It's a common issue with her laptop caused by crappy thermal design. HP will fix it if you send it in, and there are several temporary kluges posted by other users. 

And because she waited so long to ask me instead of googling it, she has to deal with an overheating laptop on her 6 month trip! That ought to make the lesson sink in, right?


**Sis:** Oh yeah, also, whenever I open a new tab in Chrome, it goes to this new website instead of my homepage. How do I change it?

**WH** (blank stare): Google.

She had it fixed in under a minute.


So here is the new family tech support policy: ""To receive my help, you MUST google the issue, and you MUST try at least the top 3 links."" If that doesn't work, I'm genuinely happy to help.

So now when they call, I'm going to quiz them on the top 3 google links, and if they can't answer, tough luck! Google or GTFO.

[deleted],154,270,16msw1,990,"I haven't worked a full-time help desk in years, but one of the joys of working at a startup is that you pitch in with whatever needs doing - including taking the desk when needed.

Support's pretty simple - it's a hosted service, so 95% of the requests are password-reset or clarification of instructions. Having worked help desk before, I have some sympathy for a bit of harsh language -- if someone's opening a ticket, they're probably already frustrated.

But some of this stuff is really beyond the pale – and since I actually have some authority in this org, I get a chance to ""fix"" customers that treat our help desk like shit.

**Example 1: I'm not a girl, sir, and fsck you very much**

Our usual help desk person is a female. Some customers know this. After a failed reset (which happens very occasionally), I get this reply from a guy:

&gt; Your reset process never works and I cant take my training! I could lose my job for this you useles b\*tch, now make it f\*cking work or get a man on it.

(I censored the above, but it's otherwise verbatim).

This would be very not okay under the best of circumstances, but to add insult to injury, our tech is actually *very* good at her job, and is helpful and sweet to a fault.

My reply: *Hi, [customer]. You have not been talking with [tech] today, you've been talking to me: [l3gato], Senior Architect. I'm sorry you've had trouble with our password-reset system, but you won't need to worry about that for the next 10 days as your account has been suspended for abuse. I am cc'ing [HR dude] on this thread.*

*Regards,
[Company]*

I'm friends with HR dude - turns out the guy tried to argue that there was *absolutely nothing inappropriate* about his behavior because our tech is ""just some support girl"". He's been put on probation.

**Example 2: here's a free account with a competitor**

A customer opens a ticket requesting a reset, saying he got in fine a few months ago, but his old password doesn't work today. I reset him and close the ticket.

He re-opens claiming the reset doesn't work, so I do it manually and test the new password before sending him the ""please follow these steps *exactly* to log in, let me know if and when you get an error."" (I'm thinking it's a browser settings issue).

What I get back is unprintable in this forum, but basically boils down to a long-winded rant about how this is the worst service ever. I decided to call him and ask if he'd share his screen with me so I could better see what the problem was, and he agreed.

The first thing he does is open our competitor's website. Apparently he'd signed up for a 15-day trial there before deciding he liked us better, then *forgot* who he bought from. At this point, it's just amusing.  But if it stopped here, I wouldn't be sharing, right? :)

He proceeds to yell for a solid 10 minutes about how we should make the competitor's website redirect to ours if he's a customer. I try to explain that there's no acceptable way for us to do that, and that it might even be illegal for us to try, which earns me another 5 minutes of swearing.

Fearful that I might say something that would upset the partners, I just tell him that I'll look into a solution and get back to him.

So, the company in question sells diet food and weight loss products, and they're not Weight Watchers, if that narrows it down. They do a *ton* of business over the phone, driven primarily by a sales floor composed of 90% women, plenty of them no spring chickens either. This high-power force of feminimity starts *early* too, because if it's 4am here in Cali, it's 7 in New York City and time to make some sales.

So at 4am, in the super-spooky darkness of October, they all show up for work to find that nobody's keycards are working: the front door won't unlock. Calls are placed to the building owners, the security guards, etc, all of whom pass the buck off to each other on who's responsible for the doors. By this time everyone is *pissed*, these women can do $10k in business before the sun rises, so right now this company is dropping money faster than their clients want to drop pounds.

Finally someone coughs up that IT has some ability to administrate the door locks. IT is housed in a different building which *is* unlocked, but deserted. (Not a surprise, most tech world people I've known will *stay up* until 4am, but not *get up* at 4am.) But now they're really boned, because there's nobody to reset the doors so everyone can get to their desks and get on their computers to start worki- ....wait.

The way this scene was described to me, one of the women busts out that ""Wonderful Awful Idea"" Grinch face, and points out that IT's numerous computers and phones are in fact *right there.* All of the sales data and other vital information comes from a web interface, so there's no reason work has to be done on your OWN station....

The hardware had no idea what hit it. Having personally met most of this group, they are most definitely the type to need multiple walk-throughs on how to do things, never want to click anything unless specifically told to, and ask you what their Gmail password is even if you've never touched it. (not bitter.) Apparently all of that evaporates *really fucking quick* when there's money to be made. To hear how they went into crisis management mode sounded more like the crew of a ship.

* ""What are all these DOS looking box thingies?"" ""No idea. Close 'em."" (hope you were using SSH with screen running!)    
* ""My customer on the phone can barely hear me over the noise of all these fans, can I shut any of these computers down?""

Well my mom bought a new home and transferred service to there. Several months later, I lose my life (lost my job, my car, half my possessions from an illegal eviction, and insurmountable medical debt) and had to move in with her. Well, it was during this time that I noticed the internet would go down intermittently. At first it was during high traffic when people got home from work. Then I noticed it happened then, but also during different times through-out the day and night.

Often a call to their tech support resulted in the issue being fixed - but only temporarily. Now, whenever I called I was super polite and nice and before long I could just tell them what the problem was and we'd be back up and running in minutes. However, one call will forever stick out in my mind.

It was a typical call, I was nice and explained the problem. We got back up and running in now time. But at the very end, just before we were about to hang up, the tech support guy broke from his script and told me something that put the fear down my spine. That fear, was the fear that he would be punished for saying what he said.

What did he say? I quote:

* Tech Support Dude: ""Sir, before you hang up, I just want to thank you for being really nice to me."" At this point his voice starts to crack. ""It's been a rough day and everyone just yells at me. You are the first one I helped today that hasn't yelled at me. Thank you, I think I'll make it.""

I was absolutely floored. I told him I worked in customer service before, and while not as bad as his job I told him I have dealt with crap customers and refuse to treat anyone else that way. I told him to hang in there - gave him some quick tips that worked for me and reminded him why his job was actually important and how he will someday make loads of cash by moving up in the tech support world.

Later I was offered to do a customer survey. I rarely do those - but this time I did it and gave the poor man the highest review that I hope he ever got. I really hope he didn't get in trouble for breaking from the script and thanking me.

That was the sound of warning bells, about 10 years ago, when I was finishing up a stint on thin-client/virtualization crap where I was doing server donkey work on Windows. We were in the midst of layoffs, and as the juniorest donkey, I knew my job was the most at risk. Thus, anytime a manager asked me to be helpful, I was.

I consider the senior manager who asks me this, a woman I dislike and has zero tech competency. Then I look behind her to a terrified junior manager who lives near me, and who is actually God's gift to Windows Servers. Interesting.

""About six months ago,"" I reply, ""Back when I worked for [Mr. 1pm](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13c0dm/londons_calling/) I filled in for that sometimes.""

""And you know how IE works?""

""Yes....""

""Bobby's computer needs your cyber detective skills,"" sighs the junior manager. ""We think he was running a side business.""

That doesn't explain why everyone was so nervous, but I agree to check out the PC in question. About ten minutes later I have evidence he was selling used cars from work. We pull up emails, web history logs, and IM logs of it all. While I wait for someone else to check his phone history, I notice something a little weird.

Confession: I worked as IT for an escort service for about 18 months. I was in college, needed money, and my uncle used the service, just to make it skankier for you. The pay was excellent, however, and I walked out with zero college debt and a great appreciation for women. I also can spot an escort with little effort, and I know how to find porn on computers.

Bobby had a *lot* of porn on his work computer. I get one look at a big old vagoo and call for the manager. I show her the porn, and she cringes. 

""How bad is it?"" she asks.

I flip through a couple more pictures, ""Pretty bad-- holy crap, is that Derpina?!""

We stare at a photo that is far too familiar. Derpina sits two cubes in front of Bobby, and was rumored to be dating him. I stared at the photo in abject horror as I realized the awful truth. Then it got worse.

""Oh my god, they took that photo *right here in this cube*!""

I jumped out of the chair and ran for the bathroom. Never before had I had such a severe Silkwood moment, and I've had some Mike Rowe level jobs before. This was just vile. I scrubbed my arms and made plans to burn my clothes.

But wait! There's more! He had videotaped them having sex *in the very bathroom I had just used*.

Needless to say they were both fired.

tl;dr The call is coming from inside the house.

*ETA: At the behest of a commenter, I called in the jr. manager today, who reminded me that Bobby was the son of our CTO, who had been on leave for cancer treatment at the time. Yikes! Of course she was spooked!* ಠ_ಠ

*ETA2: The Silkwood bit was for the sake of hyperbole, much like when we say we'll bleach our eyes out. I did wash my hands, and I felt gross for having seen the snatch of an undesirable, unattractive, coworker whom I disliked already. It was a moral grossness. Seriously people, sex at work at a financial company? There's a time and a place, but this was neither.*",I need more bleach,1227
PoisonedAl,158,272,11qo5g,982,"This was quite some time ago but I still remember it. I had bought a new motherboard from a popular online hardware retailer in the UK (let us call them “Derpatech”) and I was having problems. The hard drive kept cutting out and it wouldn't recognise the PCI cards or USB devices at all. After I made sure the BIOS and drivers were up to date I deduced that southbridge was borked. It had a VIA logo stamped on it, so my diagnosis that it was a POS was probably a good one.

So I ring up Derpatech's tech “support.”

**Me:** “Hi! I bought this motherboard off you and I think the southbridge damaged.”

**Derpatech Monkey:** “Southbridge? Wassat?”

**Me:** “The southbridge. The I/O controller. You know, usually under northbridge.”

**Derpatech Monkey:** “I've never heard of a southbridge before!”

Ooookay, I'm clearly talking to the work experience idiot who's training consisted of: “can you say 'turn it off and on again'?” I ask to talk to someone in charge.

**Derpatech Organ Grinder:** “Hello?”

**Me:** “Hi! I was just explaining to your colleague that I think the southbridge on this new motherboard is broken.”

**Derpatech Organ Grinder:** “What's a southbridge?” 

**Me:** “...”

**Me:** “Look, can I please talk to someone who knows what they are doing?”

Time passes.

**Derpatech Organ Grinder:** “I've asked around the office and nobody has heard of a southbridge.”

**Me:** “...”

**Me:** “Motherboard no worky! Me want new one!” (or something along those lines).

Was I going mad? I was questioning if I was right because they can't be all be fucking useless... can they?

Cut to a day later when the delivery guy comes to pick up the crap mobo. We get chatting and he asks what wrong with the board. I explain the symptoms to the guy without getting technical.

**Delivery guy:** “Oh! Sounds like the southbridge is buggered!”

Cue chin hitting floor.

Yep, the delivery guy knew more about computers then Derpatech's tech support. He was trained in IT and was running packages until he could find a tech job. He was stuck in a van while group of trained monkeys were hired to by Derpatech to “help” their customers.

Life is so fair isn't it?

TL;DR If you want tech support, ring UPS!

**EDIT:** I called them up in the hope that I was wrong and the there was an easy solution I was missing, because replacing the board would be a pain in the arse. Back then I wasn't as sure of my knowledge and skill, but now after a few years I've learned not to care.

Back when I started in tech support, I began with finding my own place in hell - i.e. graveyard tech support for cable modems.  

I remembered hearing the wild tech support stories going around and thinking that people *had* to be making this wacky stuff up.  No way could any of these crazier tales be real. 

Then came the day when I found out just how wrong I was.

Through the headphones came an angry customer who was bitching and swearing at me that our internet service was too fast.   He was actually demanding that we slow down his new cable internet service.

My brains nearly fell out of my ears. Wait... TOO FAST?  

The guy then launched into a rant that we owed him a new monitor too.

Uhhhhhhhh....  ooooookaaaayyyy....

Somehow I managed to calm him down long enough to actually explain the situation.   He angrily explained to me that 3 days after his new internet connection was installed, his monitor caught on fire.   This was ""OBVIOUSLY"" because the increased speed of his new internet connection made his monitor heat up and burn.  

And dammit, it was our fault. Which meant he wanted a new monitor and a slower internet internet speed to go with it.   That way the replacement monitor would not suffer the same fate as the one he already had.

I spent 20 minutes trying somehow to get through to this guy that the one had nothing to do with the other.   Didn't work.

Finally he told me that his wife had told him that the cable modem had nothing to do with the monitor heating up.   I told him to go talk to his wife, and FINALLY he got off the phone.

That was the day I finally became a tech support believer.

branchero,208,249,1hbngq,971,"My first job out of college was working sales for a crappy IT shop. The owner was a complete moron and scammer. You may have seen previous threads about this guy. He was the one who hired felons and single moms because he knew they needed the job and would accept crappy pay. He would tell them this to their faces. 

So, to encourage ""margin growth"" he allowed all the techs to set hardware prices in the field, independently, without phoning home. This is a fine idea if you employ competent people. Him, not so much. The techs were paid a commission of 20% off the profit on the hardware sale. So the more money they made for the company, the more money they made themselves. Usually a decent sales compensation strategy. 

One day we got a call from a customer saying that they were not going to pay any more invoices. On top of that, they were going to sue us for fraud over previous invoices they DID pay. Why? Apparently one of our techs had replaced a laptop and billed them $85000 for it. This was some off the shelf unit from Micro Center. When confronted by the customer, the tech stammered ""This is how much we mark everything up.""

Procurement all moved through me after that-no more in the field procurement or even quotes.

Holovoid,117,220,1fnpas,975,"I've been requested to write up this story, so here it goes. This is another story from my last job as an outsourced tech support consultant in the U.S. To tl;dr it, I worked for a large cable/internet company on the East Coast. 

This was before I was a supervisor and still taking phone calls. My day consisted of taking about 40 calls a day from varying levels of idiots who don't know how to operate their TV sets, computers, cable boxes, routers, printers, and (on one occasion) treadmill.

This call was from a gentleman in California (yes I helped primarily the East Coast but I also did West Coast) who was having trouble with a wireless printer. I ran through the usual questions regarding the printer and the wireless as a whole. His laptop was having wireless connection issues, we we troubleshot that. After about 5 minutes of configuration we were able to get the laptop connected with the new WPA key that I provided him. However, when he input the new info into the printer, it still failed to work. It was a newer printer, so it wasn't a compatibility problem, so I told him as much and that further support would need to come from the printer manufacturer. 

Obviously, people don't like to hear ""Your shit's broke."" 

This guy blew up. I mean, full blown Hulk-mode. He started swearing and cursing and telling me he spent more on his printer than I paid for rent per month and that I was an idiot and didn't know how to do my job and that he wanted a supervisor. Well I am a bit stubborn on issues where my supervisor would say ""NMFP"", so I told him that we couldn't support 3rd party hardware/software and that everything on our end was fine. I politely reminded him that ""Your router's configuration is outside of our support boundaries to assist with further."" In response, he says ""Suck my dick you asshole"", trying to goad me into making a mistake. 

I reply, without skipping a beat, ""I'm sorry sir, but fellating you is outside my support boundaries, not to mention you are on the other side of the country. Is there anything else I can assist with today?""

He slammed the phone onto the hook so hard I was afraid he might have damaged it. I found out he called back later and got the same thing from one of my friends, and my story became a bit of a legend among my agents when I became a supervisor.

I reminded her of the motherboard issue, and she wants to know what I can do about it.  
I told her I would call her back.  I found an exact laptop on ebay for $150, so since she had paid me over $200, I would still be in the clear on it.  I bought the laptop, reloaded it fresh, and gave her a call.  A week or so later, she picks it up and within a week is calling me screaming at me saying that isn't her laptop.

So I bring the list downstairs and show my mom, explaining that I couldn't in good conscience give a 12 year old girl an ipod with that kind of garbage on it.  I had also known Pat (my mom's friend) my entire life and know that there is no chance in hell that the girl in question would have been allowed to listen to that stuff.

As a result, the girl gets grounded for about a month.  I then receive the ipod back and a much more abbreviated list of songs -- of the 250+ songs originally listed, only 42 made it past parental scrutiny.  So I pop her ipod in and get to work.

This may sound a bit odd, as I'm an IT guy, but I had never dealt with an ipod before this.  I never had the need for one, and nobody in my small circle of friends had one.  So I spent a couple of minutes fumbling around, half trying to figure out how it worked, and half out of the usual ""what does this do?"" curiosity that comes with a new device.  That's when I stumbled across her pictures.   And that's when shit went downhill.  Fast.

The very first picture that loaded up was a picture of her, completely topless, with only her hands covering herself.   Shit.  A million thoughts went through my head.  Do I call the cops, or do I call her dad?   Could this girl be being abused, or is she just doing some harmless experimenting?  If I call her dad and she's being abused, I make the problem worse.  If I call the cops and this is just a case of a 12 year old exploring her body, I could throw the entire family into unimaginable hell for nothing.  

I call my wife over and she looks at the picture.  ""Does she own a laptop or a webcam?"".  ""No"", I said.  ""Well, then there's someone else in that room, because she's got both hands on her chest, which means someone else is working that camera.""  Fuck.  She's right.

In a (probably misguided) effort to try to figure out what was going on, I looked to see if there were any other pictures.  And I stumbled upon a complete folder, several of which contained similar pictures, but also contained pictures of herself making out, topless, with a 13 year old boy, taken at the same time.  So at least we knew who the mystery photographer was, along with knowing the reason behind the pictures' existence.

But now here's the situation -- I've got to explain to Pat and her husband that her daughter's ipod contains pictures of their 12 year old daughter naked with (and possibly screwing) a 13 year old boy.   There is really no good way to explain this to anyone, ever.  

So I go downstairs and wake my mom up.  ""Just come upstars, Mom.  I can't really explain it.  You're better off seeing this for yourself.""  So my mom throws on her robe and starts stomping up the stairs, basically mumbling ""....wake me up on a sunday morning this had better be fucking imporOHMYGODWHATTHEFUCKISTHAT!?!?!!?""

My mom almost had a heart attack when she saw the pictures.  She rushes downstairs, calls Pat, and frantically starts trying to explain the situation, but isn't doing a very good job.  Unknown to me, Pat hands the phone to her husband so she can go and confront her daughter.  My mom then hands me the phone.  Here I am thinking I'm talking to Pat, when I'm now stuck trying to explain to her husband what's going on.  Needless to say, this was the most awkward conversation I have ever had in my life.  

I explain exactly what's on the ipod to an increasingly furious John.  Outside of the occasional ""mmm-hmm"", the only words out of his mouth were ""I'm on my way over"".  A few minutes later, here comes John.  Pat's in the car, with an obviously sulking daughter in the back seat.  I explain to John:  ""Are you sure you want to see this?  They're pretty graphic, and what you see you can't unsee"".  He looked at the first picture for about 1/8th of a second before turning away and saying ""Ok, I've seen enough.  Thanks.  I'm on my way to the boy's house next.""  I can only imagine how *that* conversation went.

The songs, by the way, never did make it onto the ipod.

[deleted],245,245,1edvml,955,"Hi, recently started working in tech support and it hasn't been long before I have my very own tale to share.

I work for the internal help desk for an electronics/computer retailer. We're obviously a tech-based
company so you'd expect our employees to be at least tech-aware, if not competent. However I'm sure you're all 
well aware that this isn't always the case.

The other day I had a call from User 'X', his problem was that he couldn't recieve emails from a paritcular user group 'Y'.
He could receive emails from other users, just not anyone in this group. Whenever they tried to send him an email, it bounced
an email back containing an error message.

Luckily for me, he was currently in the office with this particular user group. So being the lean, mean diagnosing machine 
that I am, I asked him to get a member of this group to forward me a copy of the email that they got whenever they tried to 
e-mail him. A simple request right? Forwarding an e-mail, nothing complicated.

So the user set about doing this; he seemed to be taking a long time so I asked him if everything was ok and he said he was just
sorting it out. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited for him to finish.

After a few more minutes he told me he'd sent the email and I saw it pop up in my inbox. I opened it up and I was gobsmacked by
what I found.

He hadn't just forwarded the E-mail like I'd asked. No; that would have been too simple.

Instead he'd printed the original email off. He'd then taken that printed email and scanned it back onto the computer and 
saved it as a PDF. He then attached this PDF to another email and sent it to me.

How does this even process in someones brain? In what world does it make sense to print something OFF the computer and then 
scan it back ON?

This guy works for a technology company. Makes me despair.

**TL;DR Rather than forwarding an email to me, the user printed the email off, scanned it back onto the PC as a PDF and then sent it to me as an attachment**

oniiesu,181,247,1opw8s,956,"Note: I originally posted this as a reply to an askreddit thread when I realized it would probably be a good entry for here. I'd like to note that I was not a tech when this story occurred, I simply worked on computers as a hobby. 

Without further ado:


Working at one of my first jobs, I was quickly identified as a computer geek because I would bring in my laptop, disconnect the fax machine, and used the line to play GunBound during my downtime (at the times we operated, all other offices were closed and we never got faxes from outside sources). Because of this every time something went wrong with a computer, I was asked if I could take a look at it, and usually I could fix it or identify what was wrong for our techs to fix it. Boss loved me for this, as I saved her a lot of money via the techs.

One day another coworker comes in and asks if I could look at her PC at home, as it keeps randomly shutting down and she thought ""maybe it's a virus?"" I agree to take a look and head to her house. The PC would boot fine and everything seemed to be going normally. I noticed Kazzaa and Limewire on their desktop and thought ""Yep, probably virus"" and run a virus scan. PC unexpectedly switches off during the scan, no warning, no bluescreen, just off.

Thinking it was the power supply, I told my co-worker as such and asked if I could take the tower home to try and see if I could find the hardware issue and find a replacement in my spare parts. She agrees and I take it home. I open up the case and inside is caked with dust, not unexpected, but I believed I had my culprit right there. I pulled out the hdd and stuck it in a spare PC, figuring I could have it do the virus scan while I worked on the hardware issue. I took the case outside and dusted it with cans of duster, took 2 full cans if I recall correctly. I then start visually inspecting the psu for a blown fuse (the model was that old) or capacitor. I find nothing, I even sniffed around the unit for that familiar ""ozone"" smell of fried electronics, not a damn thing.

Stumped, I head back inside to find the virus scan completed. I check the results: over 100 infected files removed, DAMN! I also noticed that several files were noted as infected but the scanner could not remove them, I check the directory and they're in the kazzaa downloads folder. No problem, I'll remove them manually.

The folder was PACKED with bestiality videos, most involving pigs. over 80% of the hard drive's used space was occupied by these videos, all with graphic and disgusting thumbnails/titles. I was mortified. Nothing to do but nuke the entire directory from orbit. I removed both Kazzaa and Limewire, as well as all of their downloaded files (I didn't even check the Limewire directory, I didn't want to know).

Finished cleaning their registry of the last few items the scan couldn't catch, re-scanned and the HDD was clean, or at least as clean as it was ever gonna be. Removed the HDD from my spare PC and as I went to put it back in the original, I noticed the actual problem: under all that dust the IDE cable had been badly crimped, somehow exposing a bit of wire that was managing to ground out to the PC case. Replaced the IDE cable and no more rebooting problems.

I returned the PC to my coworker and informed her that the problem was fixed. She paid me and said ""I knew I was right to ask you, my husband said I was stupid to trust you and that you wouldn't be able to fix it! He was SOOO nervous!""

I had no idea who was doing what or how much they knew about each other so I simply said ""Oh I think he might have been nervous about the peer-to-peer software, a lot of people use that to download illegal files as well as legal stuff. I had to remove it due to viruses, because those programs can spread viruses easily to those who aren't completely familiar with how they work. Just let him know that he should avoid those programs in the future because he had so many infected files.""

Until the day I left I wasn't very comfortable around my coworker anymore. Nothing ever came up, and I refused to work on home PCs again, but it was still weird.

TL;DR: Coworker asks me to fix their home PC, it's loaded with tons of human on animal porn. Surprisingly, this is not the cause of their rebooting problem.

Anyway, with this out of the way, I'm halfway through my second beer and my phone rings. Not my own phone, my work phone. This is a less than ideal event on a Saturday afternoon, but against my better judgement I answer the phone anyway. A familiar voice with a South African accent greets me. It's one of our dispatchers from our call center. ""I hope you don't have any plans tonight, you're required for an urgent job in &lt;town 150KM from where I live&gt;"". This is pretty inconvenient, I'm currently in a town 200KM in the other direction from home. I explain this fact, I also explain that where I'm meant to be going is well outside my area. It's OK though, he's agreed to A) the travel charges (We charge $1/KM), the after hours callout fee, and the after hours rates. Eventually I manage to get the job moved to today, at 3pm. I then proceed to drink far too much and make a mess of my new shoes.

Anyway, I wake up this morning incredibly hungover. I have a shower, jump in my car, get some McDonalds and head north to the job. 3.5 hours. 4 once I stopped to vomit a few times.

When I get there, there's a fairly new AIO HP PC with a message on the screen saying he's been lookign at illegal porn and the police have locked the computer yadda yadda yadda, you've all seen that one before. It's a 5 minute job to get rid of it. 

""Thank you for coming at such short notice, I'm waiting for an email from my mail order bride"" It was awkward. He looked like your classic mail order bride person too. 

Now, our rates aren't exactly competitive (however we are the best :P), and when it came time to the bill, I was expecting him to contest the bill. It was a nice $419.50. No worries, he opens his wallet and pulls out 4x crisp $100 notes, and a $20.

MoeFuggah,225,207,194ooh,954,"I was working for a company that dispatches techs for onsite support and they cover a wide service radius  of 8+ cities.   

The company has an excellent reputation and quite a bit of business. (wasn't uncommon to run 6+ dispatches a day)  

You would call the office, and the in house tech would schedule appointments and we would show up within 1 hour of the scheduled time. If it was a DEAR ticket (Drop everything and run) you paid a premium for the immediate service @ 3x standard rate on the first hour. (375$)

So I'm scheduled for 5 dispatches that day.  I get a call from the office wanting to know if I can fit in a sixth. ( I was paid commission so of course!)

So I sync to the dispatch board and find out the last appointment is scheduled for ASAP (something we usually don't do) since he did not want to pay the premium. (red flag #1) 

The dispatch explains that there are 5 more ahead of him and I will call as soon as possible.

So every hour on the hour I'm getting a message from the office wanting to know my status. The guy keeps calling wanting to know if I'm going to show up or not. (Red flag #2)

So I plow through my tickets and call him at 3 in the afternoon and let him know it will take me 45 minutes to drive from Whitewater to Indio in afternoon traffic and I am on my way, I could tell by the sound of his voice he was frazzled and desperate and angry. (red flag #3)  
   
I arrive on site a... convenience store -- we will call them pm/am. 

I brief the guy and its pretty simple, He needs to be able to see his cameras that he had just installed in the store on his phone (some cheap LG) as well as across the internet.  A couple simple port forwards and I should be out of there...  he's sweating like a hooker in church the entire time, and he's really irritated. (Red flag #4) 

 Turns out the guy is what you would call green.  He decided to reset the router he jacked the DVR into thinking it would make everything work... taking out pretty much every payment option except cash... ATM EBT, Credit Cards, Pay at the pump and the registration info between the router and the ISP costing the store a significant amount of business.

I ask him why didn't the In house IT take care of this for him since its a corporate network. (Red flag #5)   He has no documentation or authority to do anything with the network since he is a contractor and there's no manager there and he doesn't want anyone to know what he's done.
So I take pity on the guy and call the ISP and get the router back online, Port forward all of the payment equipment, configure the DVR credentials and make everything work, but the DVR only worked with Iphone then ask him for payment.

 He's telling me I haven't done the work since he can't see it on his phone.  I explain to the guy I'm sorry but LG phones aren't supported for the web access, and even bring it up on my laptop tethered to my phone proving my work. 
 
  After a call to the boss to fill him in with what was going on he tells me no good deed goes unpunished and to do what I feel.

I give him 4 options. Pay me, call the police and file theft of service, call the store manager ask them for my money and fill him in on what's happened (costing them even more money) or I could flash the router, format the DVR back to factory settings and let him explain to the store manager that he's killed the profits for the day as well as the network and take a wash.    

I packed up my laptop and notes,  reset the DVR and told him this is his last chance to pay up before I walk out the door, this part only takes a few minutes to fix and I won't even tack on the extra 30$ for the time.

His reply was ""I called you at 10 this morning and you didn't show up until 4! then you take 4 hours to do it! I can't see it on my phone so you aren't finished and you expect me to pay you almost 450$?""

At this time it's not about the money, I want satisfaction and I'm gonna make this guy sweat even if I have to take a wash and tell him ""if you aren't paying me you damn sure aren't keeping the work.""

 So I reset the router  borking the network again and he's right back where he started in the hot seat. The look on his face was well worth it.

 On the way out of the store the clerks ask if the payments are down again and I politely tell them unfortunately our friend her doesn't want to pay me so I'm leaving everything the way I found it and they will have to deal with telling the customers it's cash only and I'm sorry.

On my way out the door I notice that the store manager's number is on the front of the store and called him on my drive home, I informed him of what's happened and explain to them I have all the notes and could fix everything in an hour the next day as long as they would pay me for the time I was already there for as well as the next days time which was agreed to.

(remember, it's a Terminal Server) They delete the files and the other person just go in the Recycle Bin and drags it out to her desktop and work on it. She would then delete it again to put it back in the bin. At the end of the week, they would get everything out and place it in the shared folders.

I was shocked. I was trying not to laugh at the phone. She then asked me to get the files from the backup and I tell her that we don't take the Recycle Bin in our backup (they have limited storage). After much arguments, I had to ask her : ""Would you put important paper in your trash can expecting to take em back tomorrow? And would you call the trash collectors to get your papers back?""

MoeFuggah,234,220,196jj4,952,"So I start my own shop and offer your choice of onsite or drop off. Drop off is cheaper.

I have a couple bring me their desktop we will call Dick and Jane. I usually do the diagnosis before you leave and have you sign the all the necessary paperwork before I touch anything. 

After taking 10 minutes to do a hardware diagnostic everything tests out fine. XP takes another 15 to get to a desktop. The drive isn't jam packed so its not the page file it's obviously a bad infestation. The honorable thing to do is nuke/reroll for a flat fee since something that dirty will run up an hourly bill pretty quickly.

Dick and Jane sign off and away I go. 

So I roll the machine up patch updated installed drivers and AV and configure for best performance. More or less true barebones. No shovelware no unnecessary programs. 

Call Dick and Jane and tell them to come and get their machine it's ready. They are pleased it was finished in the same day and gladly paid signed off and left happy as clams.

I'm thinking great another satisfied customer who will spread the good word.

Fast forward two weeks later.....I get a phone call from Jane ""This machines doing exactly what it was doing before and I want it fixed again under warranty"" 

Now good children I do not offer any kind of warranty unless it comes from new hardware manufacturer and it even says so in the paperwork since there is no telling what they have installed or picked up off the interwebs but I do believe in standing behind my work.

So I tell her ma'am I'll gladly take a look. Bring it by and if it's something I have overlooked I will be glad to take care of the problem however if it's not my fault you will still have to pay me for the diagnostic and decide if you want me to repair it for you again. 

Here comes Dick and Jane a second time. 

Again the hardware is fine and I'm getting long boot times so obviously it's something they have done, either installed or picked up off the internet.

After explaining that I have to charge the diagnostic fee and it's up to them to decide if they want it fixed again, Dick is furious and Jane is more intrigued to know what is going on seeing as this machine was just repaired.

Dick is obstinate to the fact that he couldn't have done anything to mess up the machine and he shouldn't have to pay since he knows how to use a computer and Jane says go ahead she wants to know what's going on. 

So one of the first things I find is registry mechanic installed on the task bar and programs list. You know the so called Speed up/Optimize your machine software that is really masked malware. But good Reddit I'm obviously preaching to the choir here about the effects of such things. 

I politely explain to Jane that the malware was installed by someone voluntarily more than likely thinking it was a good program and give the ""Free click here are the most dangerous words on the internet"" sermon as I already optimize the config before it leaves the shop as part of my OS reload service. 

However, I must bill them for the diagnostic, and if they like I would keep the virus removal at a flat fee of 1 hour if they would like me to fix everything a second time. (half the cost of the last service they rendered.)

Dick at this point is flushed and Jane flatly says that this should be covered by warranty seeing as my build allowed something to infect her machine and that my antivirus didn't work yaddah yaddah. 

So I pull out the paperwork and show her that there is no implied warranty on the operating system but there is on hardware if any is purchased. And explain that no antivirus is perfect if it were there would be no viruses on the internet.

I launch IE to check windows update just to make sure its completely patched and behold the browsers hijacked to some free meet women stuff you see all over the internet.

This clues me into someone surfing pr0n. So I check the cookie cache and lo and behold its chock full of cookies from pr0n sites and state that the dirtiest places on the internet are these kind of sites. Dick is red faced and Jane's pissed seeing as the timestamps are when she's at work (LOL). 

Dick decides it's time to go and he's NOT PAYING ME FOR ANYTHING and Jane's pissed at Dick for obvious reasons. But he still thinks she shouldn't Have to pay me a dime even for the diagnostic. 

Well I don't touch a machine before the paperwork is signed. EVER. And tell them I will be holding their equipment until the diagnostic is paid. ( I Have paperwork signed agreeing to this)

He say's that my paperwork doesn't mean shit and tells me they are taking his machine and leaving so I simply say if you touch the machine and I don't have my money expect the police to come knocking on your door for theft of service and robbery after calling in the tag on your car. 

He's looking like he's ready to rip my head off. She's looking at him like she's ready to rip his head off and I show them the sign on the wall showing that machines left on open invoice after 30 days will be sold to cover any outstanding balance and they storm off.

An hour later they come back with my money and I send them on their merry way and thank them for their business but I'm not interested in doing anymore work for them.

A client of mine calls me up and says ""Hey NZOR, I've got a friend named Diana who just moved into her new apartment and needs help hooking up her wifi. She has the router and everything but I don't know how to set it up so she needs your help"". Shouldn't be a problem, all I need is a pen to reset the router, a patch cable, and my laptop... an easy $30 (yes my rates are dirt cheap).

I find Diana's apartment and knock on the door. It opens and standing there is an attractive Vietnamese woman in a see-through nighty and a pair of red lingerie panties... and that's all. Now having been a pizza delivery guy I've had my fair share of surprises when someone opens their front door, but not like this. A little background on me: I'm in a relationship of four years with a girl I plan on marrying... LORD WHY MUST THOU TEMPT ME SO. 

She shows me to her modem and router and asks me if I need anything. Trying to maintain my professionalism I say ""No thank you"" and ""This will only take a few minutes"". I set the SSID and a decent WPA2 password, and am connecting her Macbook and iPhone to the new network when she starts asking questions like ""What are you doing after this"" and ""do you have a girlfriend"". I tactfully inform her that I'm planning on marrying the girl I'm with and that I have to be somewhere after this (which is total BS).

At one point, our company had customers call in to set up their dial-up connection manually via Setup Wizard in Windows. For some people, this became a daunting task... so we made setup CDs that automatically created the connection. But there was an old lady that would always call in with some of the most basic issues, and her level of computer savviness wasn't the greatest and would easily trigger calls that could last an hour. She once called in to get her Internet manually set up, but it just wasn't working out. Couldn't right click, couldn't read, questioned everything, and made the call a real pain in the ass. After an hour and twenty minutes of agony and begging to just send her a CD (she wanted her Internet NOW), we finally got her to give us her address to mail out a setup CD.

A few days later we got another call and it's this woman again. The setup CD wouldn't work. We tried and troubleshooted everything to get the CD to run. Nothing. So we try to do the manual setup again. Again, over an hour later, I get frustrated. The woman then asks...

hameater,96,258,wi01e,946,"This story is a typical encounter I had with providing tech support at my first job.  I was the only one at my work that had any understanding of computers, so by default, I was the go-to guy.

~ ~ ~ *Wavy lines to indicate the backward journey in time* ~ ~ ~

Many, many moons ago, I worked at a highway service center, in the fuel bar section.  At the end of each shift, we would tally up the sales and count the cash, and enter all the data into an Excel spreadsheet.  One of the glories of being a 'shift boss' was that it was your responsibility to balance the shift.

I had been a grunt for awhile pumping fuel; then a shift boss.  I then worked my way up to managing the place.  It was a 24-hour business, so there was always work to do.  I would spend a fair bit of time in the office, preparing bank deposits, etc at the end of my shift.

One evening, I finished at 4, and wandered over to the office.  I was deep into my deposit balancing, when I got a call on my cell phone.  No one ever calls me on my cell phone unless its a work emergency.  So I answer the phone, and the guy who was working in the fuel bar starts rattling in my ear. ""The computer's broken ohmygodidon'tknowwhattodocan you heeeellp!""

I turned to the CCTV, and watched the poor chap as he begged for help.

""What's the problem?""  I ask.  I can hear a steady beeping sound in the background.

""I don't know what happened, but the shift end computer is beeping I think it's going to explode or something.  Can you come back and help?  I know you're probably at home relaxing and everything, but IDONTKNOWWHATTODOOOO!""

It dawns on me that he doesn't realise I'm still on site, tucked away in the office.  I can also see, in the CCTV, exactly what's causing the issue.

""You're seriously going to make me come back to work? Is it really that big a deal?""

He was practically in tears. ""Pleeeeeeease, come in!""

""I've already had a few beers, I would be drinking and driving, you know,""  I lied.

""Oh shit, whatamigunna dooooooo!""

""Relax, buddy,""  I say.  ""I'll be there as quick as I can.""  I add as much exasperation in to my voice as I can.

""Thanks buddy, I owe you one!""  he sighed with obvious relief.

I decided I would let him sweat for a few minutes.  I finished off my deposit homework, and closed the safe, and left the office, being careful to lock the door behind me.

I then strolled over to the fuel bar, until I got close, then I started sprinting - running as fast as I could into the fuel bar, panting heavily.

My colleague looked at me in shock - we had spoken only about three minutes ago, and I lived a half hour drive away.  

""I broke the speed limit getting here.  This better be good,"" I growled, as I ran up to the computer.

The computer was still howling away, in what did sound rather distressing.

Without breaking eye contact, I went to the computer, and gently lifted the book he had accidentally placed on the keyboard, which was holding down some buttons, which was making the computer beep because it didn't like the constant input from the keyboard.

The beeping stopped.

""Oh, shit"" he said, in a very small voice.

""It's alright, dude.  I was in the office when you rang and I could see the book in the camera.""

He didn't think it was funny that I made him wait three minutes with the beeping, in utter panic.

I was taking calls as per usual, when suddenly I was confronted with the following gem which warmed my heart and gave me a big belly laugh in the process.

""Good afternoon, this is RandomISP, KeithSqik speaking. How may I help you?""

An older lady responds, very cheery and very pleasantly.
""Yes I would just like to know my area code for the digital receiver? It appears to have reset itself to factory settings after yesterday's update and is now back on the first installation screen.""

Immediately I was taken aback. A person who knows what the problem is and immediately gets to the point. It was like a gift from God. (I am still amazed every time I come across one of these brilliant people. They make our job so much easier.)

""Ofcourse I can help you with that"" I reply jolly, with a big smile on my face and I proceed to ask her for her details and I give her the right area code.

""Would you need any other assistance with rest of the installation?"" I inquire. ""The menu can be quite tricky.""

""Oh no, that wouldn't be necessary, I installed my son's TV setup just last week.""

At this point I was awestruck! This is possibly the coolest person ever and at that point I felt a bit cheeky so I just had to ask ""I know it's rude me to ask but you sound like a lady who has seen a few summers, might I ask how old you are?""

To which she happily replied ""I'm 63 at the moment"" and at that point I just blurted out (all selfcontrol right out the window) ""Wow, may I ask how old your son is?""

""He just turned 41""

I was laughing so hard that I had to mute the mic. Then we ended the call properly, she wished me a nice day and all was awesome.

This year was no exception. I was out at the family farm, visiting my father and stepmother. After we'd been chatting for a bit and had a couple of glasses of wine, my stepmother mentioned that she'd been having computer problems.


""I can't download iTunes."" (no big deal, they're way out in the boonies and their Internet connection isn't very good. iTunes is a fairly large file to download on a poor connection.)


""I spilled wine on the keyboard."" (... Okay, you need a new keyboard. In theory you could try and clean it, but that keyboard is old, you've got the money, and a new keyboard is cheap. Not worth the effort.)


""Oh, and when I was trying to clean off the keyboard I hit something, and the monitor turned upside-down.""


That got a chuckle out of me. I used to use that keyboard shortcut (Control-Alt-Up and Control-Alt-Down) to mess with people, so I knew immediately what had happened. I say ""Oh, that's nothing. I'll go take a look at it."" Now I know why my girlfriend and I got a dinner invitation last week, just a couple of days before Thanksgiving.

rtmq0227,268,209,1fv72e,932,"Gather round, boys and girls, it's time for another rant.  Just yesterday, I had a customer come in to our store with a generic Presario desktop.  ""I want to upgrade the processor in this.""  A simple request, and we have processors in-store, so I say ""Okay, what kind of power are you looking for?""  I walk him through the different options and prices to give him an idea of what it's likely to cost.  Now it's time to open the rig to verify what socket type he has.

My heart sank as I removed the side panel.  I could see the tell-tale fan-less heatsink of a soldered E-350 processor.  I knew this was about to get ugly, but I had no idea what I was up against.

I looked up at him and said, ""Ah, I see you have a soldered processor.  Unfortunately, that means that if you want to upgrade it, you'll need a new motherboard that has an actual socket, so I can put a new processor in it.""  His response? ""When I called this morning, I was told you could just replace the processor""

""Ah, well, that's true of most computers, but your cpu is physically soldered to the board with advanced equipment.  We're not a manufacturer, so unfortunately, we don't have the gear required to de-solder a processor.  We can get you a new motherboard, a better one even, but that's the only way we'll be able to upgrade your processor.""

""The guy said you could solder it.  I used to solder all the time, why can't you solder it?""

I show him some pictures to explain the problem.  He seems to understand that we aren't going to be able to do this.  I quoted him $200 for a good, solid upgrade (including labor), but told him that he'd likely need an OS re-install afterwards, because switching Mobo's can sometimes cause issues.  He says he needs to make some calls first.  I thought it was to discuss if he could afford it.  Nope!  This is what he tells me when he comes back in:

""I just got off the phone with WorstBuy, where I got this, and they said they can solder this new processor in, no problem.  I'll take this over there and have them do it.""

In case you didn't know, the E-350 processor is less than 2cm on a side.  He wanted an AM3+ processor.  I point this out, but he's convinced that ""NerdSquad"" can pull it off.  I advise him that if he brings the processor back damaged, he can't return it, and that they'll likely quote him more than it would have cost to let us do it.  He goes through with it.  I go back to my desk and imagine his face when NerdSquad tells him they can't do what he wants.  A grin makes its way across my face as I return to work, the schadenfreude keeping me entertained until closing.

tl;dr: That bottom-of-the-range computer is going to end up costing you more than you think.

I work at my Uni's tech support center, and I think that's the reason I haven't experienced the ""OH GOD WHY"" moments you all talk about. I'm not saying that being in college makes you better at computers (I think you guys prove that false with the Medical Doctor and PHD stories), but we tend to have a younger crowd than the general populace, and that seems to mean less I-know-absolutely-nothing-about-this-magic-box people. But we still do get some, as evidenced here.

It's a normal Monday morning, when I sit down at my desk, pull up reddit, and wait for my shift to start. You're not supposed to start working until the official office hours, to discourage people from calling in too early, but we get quantitative brownie points if we show up early that can be used as a buffer if you fuck up. It's juvenile, I know, but the help desk employs us college kids, so whatever. Anyway, I pull up my support queue, and one of the entries catches my eye: ""My computer won't stop ejaculating"". I reread it a couple of times to makes sure that my brain's not just screwing with me, and open up the details of the ticket. Obviously, there are none. So I call up the number, as we aren't allowed to close tickets for insufficient info, and here's my conversation with the girl who picks up:




Me: Hi this is $UNI tech support, I'm calling in response to the ticket you submitted yesterday.

Her: Oh my god! Thank you for responding! I can't get my computer to stop ejaculating!

Me: [At least she's polite and grateful] I'm sorry, can you please describe what's going on?

Her: It just won't stop ejaculating! I tried turning it off and back on, but it just starts ejaculating as soon as I log in.

Me: [Well, at least she tried rebooting] Err... Can you tell me exactly what it does after rebooting?

Her: I'm really not good with this computer stuff, can you just come down and fix it?




I talk to my supervisor, who laughs, and since it's a slow day, tells me to go down and check it out. I'm pretty sure I know what she means, but if I'm right, I'll have to go there anyway. So I head over to her dorm room, and I can hear it as she opens the door. It's her CD tray, constantly opening and closing. After correcting her on the usage of ejected vs. ejaculated, I take a look at the computer. It's a tower, which surprises me, since she has a macbook on her desk, and she doesn't seem like the type to have use for a tower. Apparently, there are some files and programs on there that she needs, but they're too big to email over. Facepalm/headdesk, but whatever, I'm not saying anything as long as she's happy with it. The problem turns out to be some program that keeps tying to burn a disk, and put itself in startup. I kill it, and the CD tray is exorcised (circumcised?). She doesn't remember installing this program, and I've never heard of it before, so I scan it, but it doesn't seem to be a virus. Since she doesn't need it, I ask her and delete the program anyway. I also run mbam, since she her browsing habits must be awesome if she managed to install whatever that was. Not really an eventful story, but it makes me chuckle.

You know how the X-Men's Kitty Pryde destroys electronics when she phases through them? My mother only needs to glance at something more complex than a toaster and it implodes.

But my mother is not stupid, oh no, she knows all the computer terms. And me being the designated computer-fixing-guy of our family, I get the brunt of it. This includes her knowing such ""programs"" as ""Meekrosoft"". Meekrosoft, that's how she pronounces it, apparently produces everything. So whenever something's broken, I get a phonecall like this:

**X, you need to help me right now. My Meekrosoft doesn't work.""**

Not this time, though. This time around, she had entirely different issues. Naturally, it's some impossible time as I'm about to leave for work and my phone rings. Mother. Her calling at this time can only mean one thing: Her computer is broken yet again. I pick up the phone.

**Her:** X, You have to help me. It doesn't work.

**Me:** What doesn't work? Meekrosoft?

**Her:** No, Meekrosoft is working.

Now, this is the first time her Meekrosoft was working a-okay. So surely this had to be something that couldn't be fixed with a simple reboot or some minor thing that I've told her a million times before. So I sit down on my computer to mimic the steps she has to take as to exactly reproduce her error.

**Me:** Colour me interested. What's the matter?

**Her:** The inter. It doesn't work.

**Me:** The Inter... I see.

**Her:** I think I know what's wrong.

Holy shit, this would be the first time in about fifteen years of her owning a computer and turning to me for tech support that she actually knows what's wrong. I finally might have made some progress and she could have learned something. In retrospect, I should have known better, seeing as her problem was with The Inter and not Meekrosoft. So it was a whole'nother animal altogether.

**Me:** Right. Brilliant. What is it?

**Her:** My Firefox isn't servering with Google anymore.

Yup, there it was. Bomb dropped. She has learned absolutely nothing. Fifteen years and counting of working with computers and the best she can come up with is ""Firefox isn't servering with Google anymore""? Seriously? You'd think she would have picked up at least some lingo in the one and a half decades of slamming fingers onto a keyboard. But no, Firefox isn't servering with Google anymore, but thankfully, her Meekrosoft is still working.

**Me:** ... what?

To spare you the painful details of about twenty minutes of me trying to figure out why ""Firefox isn't servering with Google"" anymore, here's what I - after minutes of painfully horrible talk - have figured out. She had typed www.google,com and not www.google.com.

Basically one of our techs attaches a radio receiver to your roof, points it to a tower within ~10 miles of your home, and runs a cable to whatever router or PC you want.

Our service isn't as reliable as cable or DSL, but is actually pretty stable in severe weather like blizzards and such. However, I'm not sure if our sales team is selling it in correctly or not but people don't seem to realize that this service is largely line of sight based. If it is snowing so bad that you can barely see 4 feet in front of you, your service might have some packet loss.

This particular story takes place in the summer of 2010. A fairly large forest fire was burning in one of the areas we serviced. My co-worker (whom I will refer to as Nate) took a call that happened to be in one of the cities listed in the fire, but didn't think much of it at the time. Surely, if a customer was calling about an internet issue here, they were in an unaffected part of the city, right?

(The following is summarized as it's been a few years but you'll get the idea):

**Nate**: ""Thank you for calling ISP, this is Nate, how can I help you?""

**Customer**: ""Yes, I'm planning on leaving for a trip soon, and I'm having difficulty pulling up any websites to buy tickets.""

(Nate can hear some mumbling in the background but nothing he can make out.)


**Nate**: ""I'm sorry to hear that, miss. Let me pull up our equipment and we can take a look. Have you tried rebooting our-""

**Customer**: ""Yes, I've reboot everything, just as I've done a thousand times before. Your service is never up when I need it to be.""

(**Background voice**: ""......must.......now"")


**Nate**: ""I apologize that you've had repeat issues, let’s see if we can figure out what is going on.""


According to our system, her radio is not responding at all. If she has already reboot the power supply at this point it's looking like we'll have to send a tech to her house to check the equipment.


**Nate**: ""Miss, it appears your equipment isn't responding. If you've already reboot the power supply as you said we'll hav-""


(**Much louder background voice**: ""Whoever is on this line, this is the fire department, hang up, this woman needs to evacuate NOW"")


**Customer**: ""No, I NEED these tickets today, or I'll miss my conference! When can you get a tech out here?""


**Nate**: ""Miss, are you in the fire evacuation zone?!""


**Customer**: ""Yes, but I need to take care of this before I leave, it's very important!""


(**Voice**: ""WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW!"")


At this point, Nate had pulled up the most recent evacuation map from the local news and checked the customer's address. She was in the middle of the emergency evacuation area as the fire was burning towards the direction of her neighborhood.


**Nate**: ""Miss for your own safety I'm going to have to disconnect this call. I'm very sorry.""

**Customer**: ""NO! I need these tickets now!"" -click-


I never would have believed him if I wasn't sitting next to him listening to his half of the conversation at the time. I never did find out if that woman's house burned down, but based on reports it was pretty obvious to us that her service was down because of the dense smoke in the area.


The fire burnt down a lot of homes, and we ended up replacing a lot of equipment that was damaged or completely destroyed with homes. Sometimes, even in tech support, I'm surprised at how oblivious people are.",Apparently surviving a fire is secondary to purchasing plane tickets.,1158
OldPolishProverb,165,182,1lekqn,928,"Felicia_Sexopants' story reminded me of one from my youth back in the late 80's. I was working IT tech support at the national headquarters for a rapidly growing company. IT was in charge of the computers and communications, including the hard wired phone switch that was common to that era. A lot of stuff was strung together like a Christmas tree because we expanded so quickly. We had tripled the non IT staff in three years. We were slowly sorting all of this rapid expansion mess out, cleaning it up and documenting it. It was one the reasons I was hired. 

The company went through a lot of departmental managers and we were getting new one in charge of the customer support department. He wanted to physically rearrange the personnel in the call center. A new physical layout to enhance communication among employees. Annoying, but not unheard of. Not too big of a problem either because the center was one large open concept floor. A little bit of muscle and some new cables and we could move anyone anywhere in the room quickly. 

""When do want to schedule the move?"" we in IT asked the new manager?  

""Oh, I told maintenance to do it immediately. They should be moving the desks right now."" he said.

Red flags going up in our heads, ""But what about the computers and the phones? IT is suppose to be the only ones allowed to move them?""

""Yea I was told that but what's the big deal?"" Flags and bells now going off in our heads.

""I had my staff just stack their stuff in the corner of the room. You can plug it back in later."" 

Sirens now going off in our heads ""What about the phones?""

""Oh, I just told my staff to unplug them and plug them back in at their new location.""

My boss ran to the call enter but it was too late. Every device in the room had been disconnected. Every unlabeled, hard-wired, multiple-lined, minimally documented because we had not gotten to it yet, hand crafted phone tree component, every call forwarding enabled device in the room had been touched. Every desk in the room was in a completely different location from the day before. 

If he had just left it all plugged in we could have rearranged it with minimal effort through extension cables or just tracing down a few circuits as needed. But we now spent the next three days with line tracers going through the jumble of wires on the floor tracing back to the wiring closet each phone circuit and then determining who it originally belonged to. The call center was down for four days. The new manager lasted less than five. 

The manager of a call center thought you could rearrange business phones like they were in a home. Unplug from one jack and then into another. ",Business phones don't work that way,1110
mephron,72,264,1b8h7v,924,"A number of years ago, I worked for one of the Big Banks.  You've read about them in the news.  I did work in different groups, moving around, but at this time I was in account management.  At the time, i was also followed around like a friendly, old, and terribly stupid dog, by a system for the legacy Internet firewall access and email address forwarding system.  So if you sent an email to the old name of the bank, it would forward to the person's account at the newer name; some of them were for specialized systems or internal groups that wanted their own separate mail servers.

I pick up the phone, answering as I always did ""Access Control and Internet Registration, this is mephron.""

""WELL?"" came the angry voice.

""...I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what you're waiting for.""

""I was told I'd be connected to someone who would fix my outside mail address, and I got you, so are you going to fix it or not?""

Aha.

""Did the person you talk to give you a ticket number, sir?""

""Why, did you lose it?""

Ahem.

""Sir, the person you talked to transferred you to me without saying a word to me.  My phone rang, and the first thing I said was greeting you.  I can't lose what I didn't have in the first place.""

His voice changes immediately:  ""Wait, he cold-transferred me over?  That son of a bitch!  Hold on, let me see if I wrote it down...""  Yeah, realizing what happened made him calm down a lot towards me.  As he was saying this, I pulled up both ticketing systems (yeah, the company used two different ones, which is even less fun than it sounds like), and then said,

""Okay, he did at least open a ticket, and I have it here.  Hold on.""

Typing happens.

""Okay, I see the problem, this was set up in a ticket earlier this morning, and this system updates at 1 AM Eastern time every day, so it won't be working until tomorrow.""

His voice is now actually pretty amiable.  ""And no one told me that, either.  Thank you very much, sir.  I'm very sorry for being angry, but I wasn't told things, and I expected it to be different.""

""No problem, sir, have a good day.""  I hang up.

I print the ticket.  Then I go find the original set-up ticket and print that too.  I look at the people who opened the ticket - we don't take front-line calls, and TPTB decided that the helpdesk shouldn't have access to the tool for managing the older firewall.  One of them is... not the sharpest tools in the shed - in fact, they're the toothless saw.  The other, the one who cold-transferred to me - is new.

I tell the other guy on shift I'm going down to the helpdesk for a few minutes.  He grins and gives me a thumbs-up.  I head to the elevator, go down to the helpdesk floor, head to the helpdesk, swipe my card, open the door, and walk in, smiling.  As is standard procedure, I go to the manager on duty, who sees me smiling and says:

""Who's getting the second one today?""

I go over the situation, he shakes his head, he calls the guy over.  I inform the guy, smiling the whole time, never raising my voice, and never straying into any kind of language, precisely how badly he screwed up, precisely what kind of bologna-brain does cold-transfers of irate customers in tech calls, and that I am leaving it in his manager's hands as to what happens.

As I walk back towards the door, I hear the guy say, ""Who does he think he is, God?""

And the manager says, ""No.  God *forgives*.""

my79spirit,202,190,17kdg0,924,"I have a short one from about 6 years ago. I was an IBM contractor (F&amp;*% you Lotus Notes. F&amp;%$ you.) at a large Telecom company. I have many stories about my insane lead, and one of my repeat offender users.    
    
This is one of the few times my lead was genuinely cool, and helpful. I had a ticket come in from our Tier 1 help desk saying ""User Johnathan Doe cannot connect to Server Drive X. Please do the needful""   
    
I call the guy's cell and leave a message. Do this twice more over the next 2 days. No user response within 3 business days. Closed ticket. Of course he immediately calls it back in and is furious we would close it ""without troubleshooting"".    
    
Call him back, and again no answer. He calls me back while I am at lunch and leaves me a message on my desk line. ""This is John, call me back. Now."" No other info.    
    
Finally get him on the phone, and ask a few questions. Network drive not showing up on or off of VPN.     
    
Me: ""Ok, I will need to remote in to your machine via Netmeeting.""    
     
Him: ""No. You are going to walk me through this.""    
    
Me: ""Actually I do not have the kind of time to allow for that. I will need to get remoted in.""    
    
Him: ""Not gonna happen. I un-installed Netmeeting. It is a virus.""    
    
Me: ""What? In what way is our approved software a virus?""    
    
Him: ""You obviously have no idea what you are doing. It is well know that it is a virus. Is there someone else there I can deal with?""    
    
(By this time the team is at my desk and I am letting them hear what he is saying)    
    
Me: ""I am the only one avaialbe right now, and my lead has let me know that if you will not let me remote in, you will have to ship your laptop in to be diagnosed and repaired.""    
    
Him: ""You are just being lazy. I want you to tell me what is wrong, and how to fix it. IS THAT SO HARD?!?""    
    
I put him on speaker at this point, and asked my lead to give his two cents.    
    
Lead: ""Sir, you are in possession of a company owned laptop on our domain. You will follow our instructions, or we will need to have it sent back to us. Those are your only choices.""    
    
Him: ""I am going to the VP of Schlucent Technologies! YOU WON'T TOUCH MY COMPUTER!""    
    
At this point I am done. I put on my ""Happy voice"" and say: ""Sir, at this point there is no assistance I can offer you. I will let our Director of IT know of your problem, and let her make the choice of what to do from here. Thank you for your time.""    
    
Director of IT decided he could do his job without a laptop. His Manager had to fly out to get it from him. I don't know what happened there, but we got the laptop back and there was Trans porn all over that drive. Dude was let go the next week.

until that point, something was strange because ALL of our laptop had a dvd burner.

dalgeek,114,214,1dh0ik,926,"When I first got a real PC back in '92, I quickly discovered online games (mostly MUDs, then eventually Doom and Starcraft).  In hindsight I probably spent an unhealthy amount of time playing online games, and it quickly got to the point where a second phone line was necessary.  It bugged my mother to no end, but little did she know that online games would eventually pay off and launch my IT career earlier than expected.

I went to college for CE/CS, where I was also accepted into the Honors College.  The honors kids had several perks, one of which was their own computer lab that was open from 7am-5pm, but was available after 5pm for pretty much anything that wasn't against university policy or international law.  This normally meant ""play Starcraft and Quake II until your eyes bled"", after which we would go play in the reflecting pond until the campus police chased us away.  Yeah, honors kids are weird.

The other key event in 1998 was the appearance of [NetBus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBus).  Originally designed to be a malicious backdoor program, it was quite handy for remote access.  I even had it installed on my work PC so I could remote in and download stuff on the fat Internet pipe instead of my poor 28.8k modem connection then copy it off the next day.

One fateful night, in the middle of a tense game of 4v4 Starcraft, something strange happened.  At seemingly random times, computers would alt-tab to the desktop (freezing the game) and random web sites would open up in the browser.  It wasn't just one computer, it was happening to pretty much every computer in the lab.  At first everyone thought it was a virus, but since I had some experience with NetBus a little lightbulb went off in my head.  I pulled up a command prompt on one of the misbehaving computers to run netstat; sure enough there were telltale signs of NetBus running, such as open ports (12345) and connections on odd high ports.  Whoever was controlling NetBus saw what I was doing; they closed the command prompt and opened up ""netstat.net"" in the browser to show that he was watching.  I unplugged the network cable, dumped the netstat output to a text file, and contacted the ISP where the connections originated.

I get a terse ""we took care of the problem"" response from the ISP the next day and shrugged it off, figuring it was some random kid.  The day after that, a guy I know from a couple classes comes up to me and says ""Sooo I work for &lt;ISP&gt; and my boss wants to talk to you about a job.""  Now this is where things get fun ..

Apparently the guy in my classes was the one who installed NetBus on the lab computers as a joke.  He worked at the ISP where the connections originated, and it turns out his friend was in charge of the abuse department.  When I sent in the abuse complaint, it was copied to his friend and to the president of the company.  They both immediately recognized the IP address in the complaint as one of the workstations in the office and knew exactly who was responsible.  Instead of firing the kid they told him to get my contact information so they could offer me a job.

That was 14 years ago.  Due to some seemingly random, minor coincidences and a little bit of knowledge applied at the right time, a college prank launched me into a rather successful IT career at least 3 years earlier than planned.  And my mom always told me that computer games were a waste of time.

Phyco126,109,186,1bui9y,923,"So a few years ago I had an employee who was 77 years old. Dude was sharp, fit, and despite my youth and fitness level he could probably still run circles around me and could easily drink me under the table (as a matter of fact, the reason he refused to retire was because, and I quote ""social security retirement and my retirement account still isn't enough to allow me to go camping with a few packs of beer every week"". I'll shall call him Sir Awesome.

Anyway, Sir Awesome found out I am going to school for IT and that I'm really good with fixing computers. He explains how his computer doesn't connect with wifi. After knocking out whether or not his computer even supports it anyway, I tell him to bring it into the office and I'll have a look see.

Now I'll admit, the guy is 77 years old. I figure the issue was going to be with him being too technologically inept to use his computer correctly to do something as simple as connect to a wifi network. I deal with it all the time - 90% of all issues is due to the user.

So his next shift he brings in the laptop. I look at it and start going through the basics. Turns out the dude knows his stuff - he already did the basics (restarting), then tried different drivers (old and new), tried different networks, tried his old laptop which did connect to his network, reset his home router, etc etc etc.... After looking at it we both concluded that the card itself was dead so I told him what adapter was the best to buy for the money and I offered to set it up for him if needed. His response ""Nah, that's okay - it'll be a piece of cake to set up"".

Later I asked if he got it all working. Yup, he sure did - and like he said, it was a piece of cake. Isn't often I look up to people, but this man is my role model.

tuxedo_jack,214,336,1aiyvc,912,"It's been a while, TFTS. I've been pulling 60-hour weeks laying out electronic medical record systems for my employer (which is a novella in and of itself, including climbing over mountains of monitor stands, wheelchair races in hospital parking garages, and accidentally setting fire to a coffee machine, all with the added bonus of being hourly with OT), but as I'm stuck watching doctors train Dragon Medical 10 today, I figured I might as well throw this up.

The year was 2008. I was driving a black-and-white VW for the poor bastards who got ruined by the blueshirts. My day was 11 AM to 7 PM, which was a fairly relaxing schedule, and I serviced mostly rich, comfortable areas of town, basically places where I blended in easily thanks to my upbringing (private schools, Boy Scouts, et cetera). These places had clients who were mostly pretty good - intelligent, very good conversationalists, quick learners, and those who were willing to pay what was necessary to get the job done properly (e.g. not skimping on parts).

Mind you, this was AFTER the [crackhouse call](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/155217/computer_care_in_crackhouses_calls_for/), before the [gropey molesting old lady](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16avvy/the_gropey_molesting_old_lady_sfw_has_euphemisms/), and WELL after the [vodka-barf keyboard](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/158prt/sloshed_simpleton_spews_sickening_slush_on_system/).

BUT I DIGRESS.

It was near the end of my day that day. I'd set up a few wireless networks for users in their houses, and cleaned a few nasty CWS variants off one machine (without CWShredder, too). I had one last repair on my schedule for the day, for a client who I would have sworn I'd seen before. It turned out I had, which I found out when I pulled the logs for him in our scheduling system, but I didn't recognize him offhand.

I did, however, recognize his house when I pulled up to it, and I thought *Oh no, not this guy again.* Seeing the house, which was in the Memorial section of town (a rich old-money part of Houston, or, as Tycho and Gabe say, ""Rich Mofo Street""), reminded me of the crazy that lay therein, and I shuddered and went to work.

I knocked on the door, and a semi-elderly man (mid to late 50s) opened the door and let me in after confirming he was who we thought he was. He showed me to his computer (a 2004-era P4 beast with 256MB of RAM and XP Home SP0), and after perfunctory software diagnostics, I figured out the BSODs he'd been having weren't software based (as much as I'd have liked to blame AOL dial-up for it - and yes, it was on his system - I couldn't). Virus scans came up negative, too.

Meanwhile, Senor Crazy was downing tumbler of whiskey after tumbler of whiskey. It wasn't good stuff, either - from the smell, it was some execrable *blend* (so sue me, I'm a whiskey purist, and my premier stock is older than my fiancee, which means that either like Tuxedo Mask, I like the young stuff, or I have *excellent* taste in whiskey. It's the latter. I went for the cheap pedo shot to get a laugh. LAUGH DAMN YOU).

I ran hardware diagnostics, and after Memtest tripped a few times, I started checking the BSOD logs. It was verified shortly that it was bad memory, and before I had a chance to explain it to him, he started ranting about me taking too long to repair the machine. One of the lines he used was ""you better hurry up, or I'll start calling in my friends named Mickey and Vinny and they'll do to your legs what happened to this machine!""

Again, I raised an eyebrow, and kept working.

After more diagnostics finished, just for verification purposes, I had my personal laptop there (a D600 running XP), and I'd confirmed that his machine was out of warranty AND out of his service plan, so he would have to pay for parts on his own.

I explained what was going on to him, and he was FURIOUS. He started ranting and raving, telling me that I was full of it, and that I shouldn't ""tell that shit to an Airborne Ranger who had 179 kills in 1972"" while still downing whiskey. He even pulled a Bob Dole and ranted about a war wound while rapping on his skull (it actually rang, meaning he had a metal plate in it - pretty cool with the sound, but the crazy was offputting).

At this point, I went up on the company forums and started begging for a bailout.

""Don't look on this as a weapon of war, look at it as a piece of art.""

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

Sure enough, the crazy bastard had pulled out a locked case, and when he opened it, he pulled out a bolt-action sniper rifle. 

Again.

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

He picked it up and started waving it around, pointing it at me a few times, and when my phone rang again, I took the opportunity to get into his backyard (I have NEVER been so grateful for Sprint having crappy signal in so many areas) and instructed the Agent on the other end of the line to impersonate my store's manager. I told her to say that the police were at the store in regards to a previous client and some ""misplaced"" equipment (didn't exist at all, of course, but any port in a storm), and they needed to talk to me ASAP.

I passed him the phone when I went back in, told him that he may want to go to the backyard, as the reception wasn't that good, and once he was out of sight (in his kitchen, then in his backyard), I threw my laptop into my embroidered laptop case (a gift from an ex who modeled for Suicide Girls), grabbed all my other gear (excepting my phone), and tiptoed out to the VW quietly. Once I got there (I'd unlocked the doors from the front porch via the keyfob), I threw my laptop case into the car, started it up, and dropped the transmission going into reverse, then peeling out of the driveway and onto the main road.

As luck would have it, this guy's house was a mile and a half from my grandmother's, so I drove over there, and with her permission, I downed a few shots of whiskey to steady my nerves before calling centralized IS to wipe my phone (he'd started calling previous callers - coworkers - after I'd left), then the police over Skype. Once I was done with them, I called corporate and had him blacklisted from in-home service forever, dashed off an e-mail to my managers and basically table-flipped the whole thing at them, and sat back with a cranberry ginger ale while waiting for callbacks and responded to the thread on the forums to let people know I was okay.

The Memorial Villages (a subcity inside Houston, which has its own police force and such) police pulled up at her house shortly thereafter with my phone (PPC-6800 - not a bad little phone for the time), all his documentation for them, in the original folder (which is still on my trophy wall today), and the statement that they'd talk to their bosses and to the Harris County Psychiatric Center about a temporary involuntary commit. It turned out that he was on meds normally and had gone off them by choice.

They also, in a remarkable stroke of brilliance, TEMPORARILY CONFISCATED HIS FIREARMS!

When he called the 1-800 number to rant and rave at them (and he used racial slurs at the rep, who was a rep for them since the day they got the call center account), they calmly suggested that he would need to go in-store to resolve any issues he had, then blacklisted his number in the PBX so that he would get redirected to corporate for any inbound calls.

The next day, he stormed into the store at Bunker Hill and I-10 (not my home store, but the one where I started), and ranted at the senior there for about half an hour, including the phrase ""NERD HERD TOOK MY GUNS!"" It was HILARIOUS. The senior, who was a friend of mine, went back and looked up his logs, then cheerfully informed the man that he was banned from not merely all in-home services, he was banned from even going into a Buy More under ANY circumstances!

I didn't get anything special from corporate for dealing with him, but the fellow line-level techs were all supportive.

phlogiston,293,247,ttje5,916,"In addition to being a bench tech I also used to go onsite to small businesses and do basic network admin work.  Nothing too complicated, usually less than 25 PCs and a server or two.  In doing this I soon realized that most small business networks were pretty much the same.  A closet somewhere had the modem feeding a blue Linksys router with 8 port switches added on organically as the network grew.  I'd update and clean it up, usually with a Cisco PIX and a big enough unmanaged switch to allow room for growth.  Then I'd go through and neaten up the rest of the network and reformat the worst of the workstations.  Usually less than a week's worth of work and the client was very happy with the result.  It was fun. 
 
My favorite task soon became the initial visit to create the cost estimate.  I had some neat software on my laptop with which I could map out all the devices on the LAN.  I'd then make a physical map of the network layout, combine it with the logical map and present this to the customer as the ""before"" diagram of their network.  I'd sometimes encounter an early adopter who had some really old tech either gathering dust or actively in use.  The following account details one such early adopter that knew too much for his own good. 
 
As I walked into this exceedingly ordinary law office in 2007 I was greeted by a receptionist who might have been pretty some 10,000 cigarettes ago.  Being a tech, the second thing I noticed was the old, discolored CRT monitor sitting atop an old discolored tower.  It was covered with sticky notes with various web sites along with the username / password for each.  [sigh] It was going to be one of those jobs.  I explained who I was to which she replied ""So you're our new tech this month, huh?  OK, let's go meet Mr. (Head Lawyer)""  Not a good start. 
 
As we went down the hallway I glanced into each office seeing people working but not using their PCs.  This struck me as unusual.  Each PC was as old as the one used by the receptionist.  At the end of the hall were 5 or 6 larger offices, each containing a lawyer.  After a minute one came out and introduced himself as Mr. Head Lawyer.  The next thing he said will forever send a chill down my spine.  ""I know all about computers and networks.  I just hired your company to help with some of the heavy lifting.  Keep in mind we don't want to spend a bunch of money if we can help it.""  I briefly considered throwing my laptop and tools over his shoulder hoping it would distract them long enough to make my escape. 
 
Another lawyer read my mind and silently moved to block my exit.  ""I'm glad you're here.  We have lots of computer problems and the last tech was not able to do much to help.""  I was outnumbered and flanked.  Might as well take a look around before I flee.  I said ""I'd like to start in your network closet.  Show me where you keep all the network stuff.""  This question prompted some polite, yet puzzled expressions.  Head Lawyer:  ""I'm not sure about that, do you want to see the server room?""  The server room would be lovely, thanks.  Let's start there. 
 
Calling it a server room was a bit of an overstatement.  I was expecting a closet, but this was a crawspace under a stairwell.  In it was an old desktop PC, a 10 mbit hub (collision indicator blinking frantically), and a power strip.  Attached to that hub were three network cables - one went into the wall on the right, the other to the left.  The third went to the server.  While I'm taking this in, Head Lawyer proudly said:  ""Some years ago I upgraded this office myself from the old coaxial ring to these new ethernet cables.  We were the first business around here to have a network.""  Coaxial rings... I vaguely recall reading about token ring networks.  They were literally arranged in a ring weren't they?  I only started doing this about 1999 so this was all ancient history to me. 
 
I plugged in my laptop and didn't get an IP address.  I asked where the router was, which evoked another puzzled smile.  ""Nevermind"", I said.  ""I'll just walk around and figure it out myself.""  So I went into each office and took a quick look around.  Every room was the same: an ethernet cable came in one wall and went into a hub.  Another cable went out of the hub into the next wall.  A third cable was plugged into the PC.  All PCs were running Windows 98.  One room had a new-ish PC with XP Pro. That room had the DSL modem connected via USB and was sharing the internet connection out to the rest of the network.  No DHCP, everybody had static IPs.  The printers were old, the server didn't work (never even learned what it was for), the internet didn't work, it was a mess.  The last office I visited connected back into the ""server room"" making a complete ring.  Wow. 
 
I decided I didn't really want the job so I was going to tell Head Lawyer the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  I knocked on his office and sat down.  He asked me what I thought.  I said ""to put it bluntly, everything in these offices that runs on electricity whose primary purpose is not to provide lighting needs to be replaced.  No exceptions.""  He frowned and told me the last tech pretty much said the same thing.  ""Listen"" he said, ""the girls here are used to Windows 98, let's keep it like it is.  Just fix it.""  I told him this was not a traditional network layout and I was not willing to support it.  ""I wish you the best of luck in finding somebody who can support this.  I would love to replace all this for you and build you a modern setup, but I can't do it and keep anything you currently have.""  I shook his hand and reiterated my desire to build him a real network, then left.  I went home, washed my hands, and then upon further recollection took a shower.  I spent the rest of the afternoon thinking hard about my life.","The girls here are used to Windows 98, let's keep it like it is.  Just fix it.",1163
earsore,84,207,13kvf6,911,"I hope this story is acceptable under rule vii. Although it innocently messes with one person, it definitely helps out a lot of other people, and it ultimately helps him out too!

Our office has That Guy. That Guy who walks around the office, leans on your office/cubicle wall, and tries to start a conversation with you. It's usually about his tween daughter's achievements/follies, or how the gub'mint is squelching his freedom to own guns, or how people these days aren't as wholesome as they were ""before"". I'll call him Bob. Bob, a salesperson, is an aggressive conversationalist who often traps people without escape for up to 2 hours. It's kind of his job, but the rest of us wish he didn't do it to us. While I feel no compunction in brusquely telling him to fuck off, the rest of the office is less confrontational and usually surrenders to his blathering until someone takes pity and pulls the hapless victim into a ""meeting"". The employees all agreed: something had to be done. IT (well, me) threw itself at the project like no other project before, and the extreme rescue dialer was born.


When a victim is trapped by Bob, the victim, or some other good samaritan in the office, can trigger the rescue system by discreetly visiting a webpage. This will cause a phone call to ring Bob's desk phone, and he will drop everything to sprint back to it, giving the victim time to escape to the bathroom or lock their door. Since Bob is a salesperson who often does B2B cold calls and leaves messages, he is always hoping for callbacks - his face just lights up with glee when he ""gets one"". The system spoofs its caller ID to a different number each time, so he doesn't figure it out. To further avoid discovery, the system waits for him to pick up and say hello, then plays one of several severely garbled messages (like a really bad mobile connection) saying ""hello? hello... are you there?"" etc., then hangs up. Bob will excitedly try to call back several times thinking he has a hot lead. However, since the system has hooks in the PBX it will intercept his calls to that fake number and redirect them to a fake message machine, which also varies its prompts to match the number used. This usually keeps him at his desk doing actual work for another hour or two, so his productivity increases.


The rescue dial system has been a rousing success. Cruel? Perhaps. Hilarious? Definitely. Since we have to use it so often, Bob now thinks his cold calling skills are more effective than they actually are, so it's boosted his confidence and has had the unexpected side effect of increasing his sales. It has certainly saved thousands of dollars in wasted time. Even the executives approve and have used it. Nobody has leaked the existence of the system to Bob yet, even though several people in the office were personal friends with him for years before the company even started...


**TL;DR: IT creates rescue dialer to save victims of annoying guy's stories. System calls annoying guy's desk phone with fake caller ID and fake voice before hanging up, intercepts his calls so he doesn't realize it's fake. Ends up indirectly helping him!**

**EDIT:** Sorry dudes, I can't share this code because it's really specific to our PBX. The application runs on a Freeswitch using flite TTS. If you want to do this on your system (illegal to modify caller id when calling numbers you don't own) and you know your way around Freeswitch, it will only take you a few hours to hack together.

rhymes_with_chicken,145,271,1nubbw,907,"I'm a bit of a gun-for-hire. I wear a lot of different hats for different clients/customers. Two days of the week I'm technically *Marketing Director* for a very low budget outfit (4 full-time employees) in town. Even though they have an outside IT department that is responsible, if I'm in the office I'll handle mundane things like turning on a second monitor, replacing batteries in wireless mice, or tapping the numlock key A) because I'm there and qualified to do so and B) in the words of my boss, I'm cheaper. Whatever, I'm hourly. As long as I'm not talking to retail customers, or in direct contact with fecal matter I'll use any skill in my possession at the negotiated rate. It's often a welcome change of pace anyway.

So, there's one user that's absolutely notorious for ruining machines. And, by ruining I mean utterly infecting the drive with every known bit of mal and/or bloatware. Show him a link, and he'll click it. Deliver him a payload, and he'll accept it, open it, install it, fork over his SSN. If there's a device in place to stop it, he'll unblock it. In two years, he's had 5 new workstations delivered to his desk.

Why is this tolerated? He's the boss' elderly father.

Great guy. Everyone in the office gets along great with him. He's very stereotypically grandfatherly. Personable on the phone. Good guy to have a beer with. Just not the greatest with computers.

The official IT company is no help really. It's in their best interests to bill for new machines when fixing the old one would be more billable hours. They're doing us a ""favor"".

Mention imaging a drive to them and it's like the conversation never happened. Not my place to make recommendations like that anyway. Trying to explain the concept to anyone else in the building is like trying to teach a cat algebra (and IT knows this).

The situation does take him down for extended periods, though. And, it affects business. The IT co is offsite. When he fouls a machine, it's at least a day or more for a loaner to show, plus downtime while it's being installed. Then repeat the process when the new machine is ready. And, he is tier one customer service.

Two months ago he took down another machine. My boss (the owner) is visibly and audibly agitated. After IT installs the new machine, he berates his father loudly in the office. This is completely unprofessional, inappropriate, and embarrassing and awkward for everyone present. After he simmers down I offer him a solution.

me: Would you like me to handle this permanently?
him: Yes!
me: Done.

That's really all the approval I needed. I grabbed a 2-machine KVM and a 10' CAT5 patch cable out of the supply closet, the last 'ruined' machine, and loaded the latest build of hexxeh's chromiumOS build to a flash drive. tucked all that shit up under the user's desk and booted to the flash drive.

Disabled network access from the production workstation via any of the installed browsers, and removed the shortcuts from the desktop. Told grandpa ""if you want to use the internet you just have to tap the control button twice"". Stood there and watched him toggle back and forth a couple of times. ""Got it? Good.

CrazyGitar,106,312,16qyy7,905,"So I live in the UK but I have been quite involved in a few online communities for some competitive online games and gotten to know people all over the world which is something that I love about the internet.

There was one girl who lives in America I'd met on a forum and had added on Skype/Twitter/etc. and she knew I was quite good at general PC troubleshooting, seeing as it's my job and all. We'll call her Cassie.

Cassie sends me a message asking if I could look at a problem her friend in Australia was having and linked me to a tweet he had made to a blog post detailing how his PC was no longer booting. Quite a convoluted way to get details of a problem I know. I read through the post which explained the following (in a little bit more detail):

 - Windows crashed the day before and would not boot  
 - When turning on the PC it would get to the Windows flag and then loop  
 - The PC **did** boot into safemode but neither the mouse or keyboard would work at all

Now a few people were giving their tidbits of advice saying that it was clearly a failed hard drive and he needed to re-format the whole thing, that all of his data was as good as lost. Someone else even commented that he had a virus that was locking him out and every time he put it in safemode it was allowed access to his private information. **Read: ¬,¬'** Ignoring all this I decided it couldn't *just* be the hard drive if safemode worked but the mouse and keyboard didn't work.

It was about here that the friend, we'll call him Ozzie, was added to the Skype conversation and we started talking it through. I clarified a couple of points and asked his make/model of the PC or it's parts. I'd been looking at the issue for maybe ten minutes by now and decided that there was either a corrupted USB driver or device causing all of the issues described and asked Ozzie to unplug everything out of the back of the PC and put just the keyboard in the front (as nothing was plugged in the front and if it's the driver for the motherboard that's gone wrong the front panel may work).

True enough he gets into safemode without a hitch and can use the keyboard perfectly. I then ask him to try Windows as normal and then plug in the keyboard to the back panel and try again if that's successful as well. Works both times. He's very excited at this point. I tell him to take it easy as it may mean that one of his devices (two of which were external HDDs filled with videos he had created for his YouTube) was at fault. He needed to plug them in one at a time so we can know which it is.

Thankfully once everything was in it was all working perfectly. I put that down to the driver/device in question having been put back in a different port and resolved whatever driver issue that had afflicted it.

Ozzie was thrilled and spammed his thanks to me. I checked what time his blog post went up and it was about 55 minutes before I produced the solution for him.

Not bad from the other side of the planet having never seen the computer in my life. I do admit it was because I got good information from him, not some of the usual user details we're all so very used to...

taylorofcanada,149,317,11sg43,908,"So, I'm from a small town. I went to a tiny highschool. I was basically the go-to guy for IT amongst my peers, neighbours and family.

We nerds have always been given a stereotype of being betas; second tier citizens. I never really felt this way; like I said, the town was small so we were all pretty close.

Anyways, my highschool at the time was really lacking in IT investment. They had the same computers that were there when I was in grade one. They also had deepfreeze installed on the computer, which reverted all changes made to them every reboot. This meant that editing documents made on newer softwares (EG: MS Word) would not open, and you couldn't install any software to do the job. The computers also ran IE6, so Google Docs and SkyDrive were a no go.

One thing we all had, though, were laptops. Let's be honest; that's pretty standard among students nowadays. The only thing is, there was no Wi-Fi, and being in a small town, reception for tethering was absolute crap.

One of my clients (as I did IT consulting in highschool) was a medium-sized medical clinic. They had an old box full of routers that they were just going to throw out. There were nothing special, but I figured that a box full of dome-shaped Apple AirPort Extremes may come in handy.

Then with a friend, I went around taping these access points under desks and daisy chaining them with the workstations. Next thing you know, my high-school has a secret Wi-Fi network that administration took a while to discover (and never manage to dismantle; yes they tried).

I received many props from teachers, classmates, and kids in lower grades that I had never met, and that was one way my epic nerdiness caused positive ripples throughout the school, while getting around the beaurocrats and their inefficiencies.

For those who are wondering, the network's hidden SSID was called SkyNet. Many jokes and references were made.

So.  9:10 this morning, I'm bleary eyed and still in bed (no uni at the moment, so I'm the queen of lie-ins).  My phone starts blaring ""Pinky and the Brain"" at me.  It's Uncle Cluless, owner of a 5+ year old WinXP desktop that performs like a tortoise trying to walk through cement.  I have done tech support for Uncle Clueless before, and he's a technologically impaired middle-aged chap, when it comes to computers the phrase ""explain it like I'm five"" could have been invented for him.  He does tend to listen and follow instructions though.  What on earth could he want at this time in the morning?  I cough and blink a bit so I sound a bit less like I've just barely woken up, and answer.

**Me:** Morning!

**UC:** Hiya.  Quick question - do you have any tricks to make a computer turn on?

**Me:**  Um, what?  Well yeah, lots.  Start at the beginning, talk me through what happens.

**UC:**  When I press the button, nothing comes up on the screen, usually there's some writing and the windows logo and so on.  It makes some long beeping noises and then nothing else happens.

**Me:**  Ok, off the top of my head that sounds like hardware failure for some reason (in my head at this point I'm going through the list of things most likely to fail).  It doesn't sound like a typical hard drive failure to me as I'd expect it to get a bit further along before dying (I think to myself ""PCI graphics card?  Maybe not, think his machine has integrated graphics.  Could be the RAM, it's always the RAM...), so on the bright side if it's dead there's a decent chance we can get your data back.

*Pause.  Inspiration hits me.*

**Me:**  Wait, have you ever cleaned the fans?

**UC:**  No, why?

**Me:**  That machine is over five years old, you have two dogs, you keep it in a tiny room wedged under the desk and the weather is really warm at the moment.  If you've never cleaned out the fans or had someone else do it, they'll be full of layers of ancient congealed dust.  It's probably overheating.  If you think you can manage it, turn it off completely, go grab a screwdriver, take the side panel off the tower and have a look, it should be pretty obvious if that's the problem.  Be really careful not to touch any of the circuitboards as you can kill them really easily.

**UC:**  Ah, I can probably manage that, I've seen someone else do it before.  You really think that's the problem?

**Me:**  If you're careful, there's no harm in having a look.

**UC:**  All right, I'll have a look and ring you back and tell you what I've found.


*An hour and a half later, my phone rings again*


**UC:**  Yeah, ok.  It was completely choked with dust.  There's a fan over the bit in the middle of the motherboard - is it called a heatsink? (at this moment, I'm beaming with pride that he's used a vaguely accurate term to describe something)  That was the worst one, it looked like it could barely move.

**Me:**  Well, that explains it.

**UC:**  Yeah.  I went and found a little soft brush and got the worst of it out (at this point I winced a bit), then spent about half an hour trying to hoover all the gunk out of the carpet.

I'm absolutely floored.  This is the man who damn near had a heart attack when Internet Explorer stopped working properly, and I teamviewered him, couldn't fix it, installed Chrome instead and showed him how to use it.  When I was a kid I changed the colour of the boxes around windows on his Win95 computer and he thought I'd hacked it.  He thought the printer info box that came up when you booted was a virus, and was scared of msconfig.  He thought he could use a power cable from a desk lamp to extend the length of his ethernet cable.  And suddenly he's perfectly ok with delving into his computer innards to diagnose, and then fix the problem on his own initiative.  And he's absolutely thrilled that he was able to make it work, and then says that he's about to try and back up his stuff onto an external drive in case it fails for real next time.  I'm overcome with joy and pride.  Then he ruins it.

xhc,132,182,18idke,902,"So, this is the story of a call I took at the very start of my first job. 

I was working for an ISP in Australia doing level 1 support, fresh out of training and taking calls. I had a senior listening in on the call too. 

Joe User calls and the first thing he utters is ""my torrents are going slow"". Alright, sounds like an interesting one so far! Obtained all his details, and again: ""my axxo torrents are running slowly and I need you to fix them NOW! This is urgent"".

In the back of my mind, I'm thinking that this guy must be crazy to call his provider and tell them he's downloading illegal content. Then he said it, a sentence which still makes me giggle slightly at the thought of it. 

""Listen, this is unbearable. My torrents are only going 3 kilopascals per second. FIX IT!""

I let out a little giggle but managed to  keep my composure. I looked over to the senior listening in, and he's unable to do anything but laugh. Being the smart ass that I am, I said something like ""there seems to be a bit of pressure to get this fixed, let's start with the basics"". 

The senior was beyond recovery now. For the rest of that call, he sat with his head in his hands, not doing much aside from laughing. 

And I still think of that call all these years later.

# **A Bad Start**

So a few years back, shortly after graduating college, I caved to my parents and gave up doing freelance work in lieu of getting an actual full-time job. Thing is, this was right after the economy imploded, so things were scarce (the massive global financial company where I'd interned in IT was still in a hiring freeze, but that's a different story). Adding to the issue, was the fact that I wanted to do get more into the programming side of things as opposed to support, but almost all of my previous experience was in support. So finding jobs was, shall we say, difficult.

In my desperation, I turned to Craigslist, and found a promising job. My first red flag was when I arrived for the interview. Looking for the building where the company was, I'd come to a narrow doorway in between two Chinatown knockoff shops, with a rickety elevator. Wary, but undeterred, I gave it a shot, hoping to avoid getting mugged on the way there. Getting off at the floor I was directed to, I was surprised to find it completely renovated, with wood floors, glass doors, Roman style columns, the works. The effect was jarring, doubly so as I looked out the window to find a very obvious sweatshop across the alley. But nonetheless, I walked on.

During the interview, performed by the two business partners (the CEO and the CTO), they made noises of uncertainty regarding my experience in the field, so we struck a deal: I'd work for $5k less than the advertised salary, and I'd get bumped up to it if they were happy with my work upon my review 3 months in. In retrospect, I should've got that in writing. But they signed me up and I began coming in.

*****
# **The Job**

The job itself was going to be building landing pages for ad campaigns and doing some light IT support around the office. When I started, however, I found that there was already a part time IT guy who was still in college, and who they obviously intended to replace with me doing occasional support work and part time programming. I felt this was *not cool*, but I needed the job.

I was disappointed to find that, contrary to their claims of working with ""big name companies"" they were actually a middle-man for online campaigns. The types of pages that you get either when you click on an ad, or that come up in a popup, with a form asking for your personal information that they **promise** will be kept confidential (hint: they resell it).

The job was made difficult due to the fact that everyone was running old eMachines running single core Celerons with about 1 gig of RAM (this was 2 years ago, and I'd already had a quad core at home for a while). I'd sometimes spend dozens of minutes waiting for it to complete operations, like the painful process of opening Photoshop files (on their poorly pirated copies of Photoshop). I should also mention that their Verizon line would die about once every 2 days, resulting in hours on the phone with Verizon and having the boss yell at all of us as if it were our fault they were too cheap to upgrade to a proper business class connection.

There were also rumblings. You see, there were only a total of about 8 employees, including me and the CEO and CTO. But not one other than them had been at the job for over a year, despite the company being 3 years old. Legend had it that the entire former staff and up and walked out one day. Hard to believe, as the economy would've already been bad by then, but management's paranoia seemed to reinforce these things. At one point, while they were at a convention, my coworkers insisted that they had listening devices around the office and were eavesdropping on us, because one of them made a comment about something someone said to themselves while alone in the office late one night. They gave me this warning written on a piece of paper, which they immediately threw out once I'd read it. Internet was monitored, mail was monitored, you had exactly 45 minutes to take a lunch, no exceptions, etc. All of this can be yours, plus a low salary and a grand total of 8 days off a year! Did I mention that we were sometimes required to work from remotely from home... on weekends?

*****
# **A Not So Secret Code**

Anyway, I put up with it, because a job's a job. I slowly worked out all of the IT issues to the point where things began running smoothly, and in my off time I began helping out a coworker whose sole job was to run reports. Massive reports he'd spend hours on, pulling in data for a dozen sources to try to figure out how much money we should be making compared to what we got paid, and how much we should pay out. It was incredibly tedious and frustrating, and I figured hell, what are programmers for other than to turn the tedious and frustrating into something quick and easy? 

So I automated some data calls for him, and wound up getting stuck at the major bottleneck: decrypting data that's manually done through a 3rd party system that provided no API. As it is I was screen scraping for some data already, and the site was painfully slow at times, with no batch decryption available. I stared at it frustrated... and noticed a pattern. Sitting down with a pen and paper on my lunch break, I figured out that the encryption was actually 3 sets of encryption algorithms that substituted numbers for sets of letters, with a delimiter in between number sets, and a key appended at the end representing the encryption scheme. Made a bulk decoder for it, and was proud to realize it worked, and that I'd actually just decrypted something off the top of my head with some guess work, because this 3rd party was too incompetent to use an actual encryption scheme. My coworker's morning reports went from taking 7 hours, to taking about half an hour. 

My only concern was that to do all of this I needed to use a user's credentials. For testing I used my own before asking my boss for an account for tools I built. She shrugged it off, remarking that it was unnecessary, and to leave it as is. I told her I'd really be wary of that and that it really SHOULD be its own account. 
&gt;""No and that's final, we can't afford to go around making tons of user accounts on this system.""

Of course, there were half a dozen already there under our company for employees who didn't even work for us anymore, so I knew this was BS immediately. Oh well, I'd warned her. Other tools followed piggy backing on this which would literally cut out work by days every week, freeing us to do more useful work, and productivity soared.

# **The Lithuanian Word for Hell**

I did similar automation for our newsletters, all of which while churning out landing page HTML templates on a daily basis, and eventually my boss let me work on our custom CRM and CMS systems. I've, to this day, never seen such a nightmare. They were written by a Lithuanian programmer who learned to program as he went along. The first 3 sections had no functions. All the code was copy-pasted and duplicated for reuse. There were also no comments, no proper indentation, no includes to break up the code into chunks, nothing. Also, the variables were Lithuanian words abbreviated, to things like *kzh* or *vzb* or *skazd*.  Also, some of the 3 or 4 letter abbreviated variables differed by a single letter or swapped letters, such as *kreas* and *kraes*. I began wondering what sort of war criminal I'd been in a past life to deserve this.

You could clearly trace the path where he learned about things. Like one page stored the date in the db as a Date object in SQL, while another stored a date as ""MM-DD-YY""; which lead to problems like sorting by month across several years when you sorted columns by date (ie, 01-10-09, 01-10-10, 01-11-09, etc). I figured if I could decrypt something offhand, I can figure this out... and I mostly did, albeit painfully, tracing every single variable manually, fixing plenty of bugs along the way. I even managed to update it visually (Had to add a proper menu since I more than doubled the amount of tools available), and added a proper per user permissions system for the tools that was granular and easy to use. And of course, I integrated a lot of disparate systems together to give my coworkers more data to work with, and again, had to user my user account, after double checking with the CTO again that we weren't making a separate account for it.

*****
# **The Hammer Drops**

Eventually, it was time for my review... 2 months later than scheduled. My bosses praised my work and the results. They said they couldn't be happier, and that I was WAY better than those amateurs they'd hired before me (their own words). They saw a lot of great and promising work we could do together. Then they began getting up to leave. 

&gt;""Hey, before we forget, you mentioned a salary bump if you were happy with my work by my review?"" They slowly sat down, and the mood changed. 

&gt;""Oh, you see, you misunderstood. We meant that when we reviewed you, you'd get health benefits. Those are worth about three thousand per person.""

&gt;""But you said the job had an $x salary and benefits. Even assume you're including benefits, which is not the case according to how you wrote this, that's still $2k short of the stated salary.""

&gt;""No, you don't understand. I know you're new to the business world (I wasn't), but this is how things are run.""

Needless to say that I was not happy, so I immediately began job hunting. Unfortunately, I couldn't quit as I had a mortgage to pay, and worked so late that I barely had enough time or energy to do actively look. It was around this time that a lot of template work began really coming in. It was mostly for those for-profit online ""universities,"" some of which can be rather shady, and they had massive forms (University of Phoenix alone had thousands of interdependent items in dropdown menus) and short deadlines. Additionally, a bunch of the tools I'd built pointed to fraudulent data being passed, which my boss made my number one priority to weed out daily. 

At this point my job became largely mind numbing data entry. I offered to try to automate removing fraudulent data with an algorithm, but wasn't allowed time to do so on top of daily filtering by hand and template building. Additionally, that'd require access to our data management system that all of the forms submit too, and which builds the form processor. It had some serious bugs in it, and I'd offered to help fix it countless times, but was never given access, and informed that it was strictly maintained by a contractor, who works off-site, and who I wasn't allowed to speak to. When I dug up his info from a carelessly forwarded email from my boss to me, in order to contact him about a massive failure he'd caused by checking in a typo, I got yelled at by management. 

&gt;""You don't seem to understand, in the real world, all of this stuff is segregated. You have to get used to not being allowed to talk to other programmers about problems.""

Of course, being my first programming job was not the same thing as my first job. I knew plenty of coders and had done IT work for them before, so knew she was full of shit, but said nothing. The job had just become mind numbingly depressing, by then, and I was too drained and demoralized to find a better job.

We'd had a turnover rate of one person a month since I'd been hired, and were down to a total of 5 employees, including myself and the 2 ""executives"", by this point. And every single one of my coworkers hated working there, myself included.

*****
# **The Other Shoe**

There's always a breaking point. For me, it started when my mom got cancer, and I'd requested 2 days off of work, 3 weeks in advance, to take her to the hospital for thyroid surgery. It was approved, we went, and she made it through ok and is now much better. But it set into motion the end of my employment there.

You see, 2 months later, I'd finally scored an interview for an interesting company, that I'd be excited to work for, and asked for a day off under the guise of a doctor's checkup, to go to the interview. I was called into the management office, and proceeded to get chewed out for, I'm not making this up, 3 hours (the CEO was one of those people who legitimately enjoyed yelling at people at the top of her lungs). They complained that my attitude had become negative (no shit), that I'd been taking an hour at lunch instead of 45 minutes, that I'd been consistently 10 minutes late to work for the past 3 months (starting right after my review), that I complained too often about not getting access to fix broken system, etc. Then, they proceeded to deny me that day off, citing that I'd ""... already taken plenty of days off recently."" Now, I've been working there for 9 months, and had taken a grand total of 4 days off: 2 for being sick myself and 2 for my mother. That's right; they were chewing me out for taking days off, which I'd earned, planned in advance, with their consent, to take my mother for cancer surgery. 

It was at that moment that I decided that I was done.

*****
# **Fallout, or, ""I told you so""**

The day I'd asked off for finally rolled around, and I sent an email pleading sickness. My email was dripping with sarcasm and melodrama. I didn't care. 

I went to the interview, and proceeded to bomb it. Months without talking shop about relevant coding practices left me knowing most of what I needed, but unable to describe anything or remember fundamental terms. I walked home as depressed as ever.

It was at this point that my phone alerted me that my email account was offline. Figuring that they'd decided to ""punish"" me by firing me with no one to replace me, I suddenly found myself slightly relieved, to my surprise. I was free. A terribly depressing weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I went home for a nap.

I woke up 2 hours later, to about a dozen missed emails. By this point, they'd disabled and deleted all of my account credentials from all of their systems... which brought half the CRM and all of the reporting systems to their knees, since, like I told them months earlier, they were all using my account credentials for their hooks. Truth be told, even I'd forgotten all about it till that point. Authentications for automated processes failed across the board, destroying their ability to monitor their income based on traffic reports, which was problematic, as they'd previously fired the company accountant, who was the only one other than me who knew how to assemble those up by hand. The entire company came screeching to a halt. And since no one else knew how to code, or access the code, or where in the code the credentials were, they had a hell of a time changing it.

My coworker called to inform me that the bosses had been screaming at one another in their office for over 2 hours, and that this was the best day he'd ever had since he started working there. 

The company survived, after being down for several days, somehow, though I don't know the details of it. My coworker found a new job shortly afterward and that was my last contact at the company. With the looming specter of my mortgage looming over me, I lived off of my savings, and I'd managed to find a new job about 3 weeks after leaving, for better pay, salary, environment, people, and benefits, and am still working there to this day, having just received a raise and a promotion to boot just a few days ago. And where I work now, they actually listen to me when I tell them we need exclusive system credentials. Because when they don't, I have a story that I tell them...

disturbd,215,215,15hvzw,895,"So today was a crazy day at a big box store where I work as a computer tech.  Super busy with people buying new PCs and tablets left and right.  About halfway through the day, I noticed a woman standing at the ""Returns"" till with an HP box that looked like it had just saved this woman's life in a drive-by shooting.

I submit as evidence: [Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/ynPY3.jpg?1)

and [Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/v4wUp.jpg?1)

Now I want to inform you that these are not just scratches to the box, but full out punctures.  

She proceeds to pull out the laptop stating only that her machine ""has a problem"".  No shit, lady.  As she sets it on the counter, I can tell immediately by the number of scratches on the top of the LCD panel that the machine was *still in the box* when those punctures were made.  She opens it up to show me that the LCD itself is shattered and the fan is making a lovely grinding noise in the tune of D flat.  

[Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/WU6OG.jpg?1)

I'm trying to bite my lip at this point from blurting out ""Well there's your problem"" and simply ask to see her receipt.  Purchased exactly 1 month ago from my store.  Great, this is going to be a fight.  I see that she had purchased the accident forgiveness plan and call the claim center to get a case number.  Everything ok so far.

Next I have her accompany me to my tech bench so I can create a ticket to have her machine repaired.  I place the damaged box on the counter behind me and turn around to the computer to create the ticket.  This is where it gets good.

""It came like that""

Wat?

I look up from the computer I'm typing on and look at her for a second, then look over my shoulder at the mangled box, then back at her.  

""It didn't leave our store looking like that.  If we tried to sell you a box that looked like that, you would never have bought it or at least asked to see the machine before buying it.""

""Well my son never used it.  It was a Christmas gift.  Maybe it got dropped moving from house to house.""

At this point I excuse myself and take the machine in the back, turn it on (yes, amazingly it turned on) and hooked it up to an external monitor.  On the monitor is the log in screen showing a first and last name and a password.  

""So who is John Doe?"" (Names changed to protect the not-so-innocent)

""My son.""

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

""Well it must have been used by someone, or there wouldn't be a name on it.""

At this point, she gets salty that I wouldn't just give her a new machine since this one was ""only a month old"".  I ask if she would like to speak to the manager (I really just wanted someone else to see how crazy this lady was being) and she says yes.  

The manager comes over and I explain the situation, point out the tattered box and keep typing away while he diffuses the crazy.  He tries to equate it to her wrecking her car and then going back to the car lot for a replacement. Shit don't work that way.

She rambles something about going to a different store for better ""customer service"" which the manager and I both just shrug off and we finish our business.  If she thinks anyone is going to return a month old laptop that has obviously been deliberately destroyed, she is in for a big surprise.

So I'm writing some software to control a motorised stage and lock-in amplifier.  Simple task, GPIB on the amp and ActiveX controls on the stage so nothing technically challenging.  Spent a few hours writing the code and another testing it and wringing out any potential bugs (including different OS etc), everything went better than expected and I delivered the job to spec and on time.  Great I thought.

Two days go by.


*Phone rings*.

**Me:** Hello?

**User:** Yeah this program you made doesn't work.  I'm really not happy.

**Me:** Ok can you explain a bit more?

**User:** DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME??? IT. DOESNT. WORK.

**Me:** Ok but if you....

**User:** EVERY FUCKING TIME I DEAL WITH YOU SHIT JUST DOESN'T WORK 

(nb: this is the first and probably last time I have ever worked for this person)

A bit more back and forth before I have to capitulate

**Me:** (sigh) No problem sir I'll be right down to check it out. *click*


Turns out that when the code executes, the motor goes full speed in one direction and doesn't stop when it reaches the end of the stage making a horrible grinding noise.  Something that I've never seen before.  At least I know it's getting instructions from the program so I can rule out bad cables. His OS is the same as mine so it's not a compatibility issue there.  To work with the stage the program calls up a lookuptable and searches for the serial number of the device it's controlling.  This serial number is down as a user input but I made it difficult to change and fixed it to the device the user told me they were needing it for.  The serial number *hasn't* been changed, so another suspicion eradicated.
I check the code, it's absolutely identical to the one I know works on my computer so he hasn't messed with that.  To double check I even use my laptop with the program and lo and behold the equipment works as requested.  Well this is odd.

Then the user, who has been making snide remarks the entire time, tells me how the supplier of his motorised stage had tried to screw him.

**User:** Those pricks sent me the stage I wanted but had deliberately underclocked it (his words not mine) so that I would have to pay extra to make it work better.  They sent me one that could only move 100mm but it's like they didn't know I could read and saw that the config file contained drivers for the 200mm stage.  Those idiots just thought they could screw me and I wouldn't figure it out.  Saved over the file with the new one like a pro.

**Me:** O_o



Recap. The user had bought a 100mm stage.  It was *physically incapable* of 200mm movement, you'd think the rule on the side that read from 0mm to 100mm would've been a clue.  But no.  This user had discovered the lookuptable I was talking about earlier and learned that it mapped serial numbers to drivers.  He was smart enough to read the serial number on his device and saw that it mapped to the 100mm stage drivers *like it was fucking supposed to*.  But no.  He decided this meant he was being screwed and **edited** the file so that his serial # now pointed to the drivers for a super expensive 200 mm stage.

So my program worked perfectly and loaded the drivers it was told to, which in this case meant the *wrong* drivers and so the stage did not behave as it was supposed to.

Fixed by simply copying over my config file (since the idiot had overwritten his).  No thanks, no apologies, just a grunt and a dismissive hand gesture.

fires0ng,89,172,175cug,901,"I've been consulting for about 13 years, SMB market mostly. This happened about 3 or 4 months ago.

I get a call from one of my long time clients that they've hired three new employees, they're set to start Monday, and I need to get everything setup for them to start work after lunch/orientation. I config the PCs take everything out get it all setup and just hang out for a couple hours while these guys finish up their ""training"". 



I head out to grab some lunch and when I get back I'm just walking around checking in with everybody and I come across ""Mr. Awesome"". Mr. Awesome is sitting in his cube grumbling at his computer. I poke my head in and ask him whats up, he responds with ""F*cking IT didn't set my computer up right.""  I just kind of smile thinking hes just trolling me or something.  I offer to take a look at it since I'm ""pretty good with this computer stuff."" I spend about 30 minutes showing him how to get around on the network, how to use email, word/excel shortcuts, all pretty basic shit. Every third word out of the mouth of Mr. Awesome is, you guessed it, ""Awesome."" I think he even said ""Rad"" a few times but I refuse to believe anyone still says that. 



Anywho, after all that he seems happy and tells me how I should really just take care of the computers for them instead of whatever else I do because ""The f*cktard IT guy never even showed up."" He spends about 10 minutes making sure I know I'm awesome and the IT guy ""Sucks donkey nuts."" I finally pick up on the fact that he just doesn't know I'm the IT guy. At this point I don't want to mention it to him so I just shake hands and walk away from Mr. Awesome. I check in with management get signatures on the paperwork and head out after letting Mr. Awesome's supervisor know his new employee should get a placard on his cube entrance with his title of Mr. Awesome. I didn't tell him why, I didn't want to get the guy in trouble.


So about three hours later I'm just finishing up something when I get a call from Mr. Awesome's supervisor. Hes stuck between coughing and laughing as relates to me how Mr. Awesome came in with a tale of this awesome guy who should fix our computers instead of the ""IT Douche No Show"".  After figuring out who he was talking about he started laughing and told him that I was the IT consultant. Mr. Awesome freaked out and projectile vomited on his boss.  Needless to say everyone knows why Mr. Awesome got the nick name. Mr. Awesome actually showed up for work the next day and still continues to work there.

Skip ahead to a day where Professor XX calls me with the offer of a Rochioli Pinot Noir (go look it up) -- I walk in and she is looking at her computer frustrated because she keeps losing connectivity.  Of course she had already called the moron IT guy who couldn't figure it out and just gave up.  This is a Mac, so it wasn't going to be something complicated on the configuration end.  Cable plugged in, network settings apparently good, internet working anddddd its gone.  Web stops working, email doesn't check -- I go to the network settings and its showing the network is down (but connected).  I'm frankly a bit stumped, and figure its probably a hardware issue (bad cable, ethernet going dead, something like that).

I tell her to give me a day or so (she had another computer that was working), and went googling (yahooing?  whatever we used in 1999).  Of course, all the sites said: check your network settings, check your hardware.  Not much help.

So, I was about to go downstairs and tell her she'd probably need to take it into a repair shop so they could run some diagnostics, when I overhear a different professor, Professor XY, complaining about the internet not working to the IT guy.  Professor XY wasn't one of my normal ""clients"", but I did stand around listening to them for a bit.  IT guy goes and tries to fix it, reboots the computer, it starts working, and leaves.  I drop in on Professor XY a bit later and ask if the problem was fixed.  ""Nope, it lost connectivity again.""  I ask him if I can check his computer -- maybe there is some hint to the problem.  So, check the cables, check the network settings, looks all -- wait a minute...  I scribble the network settings down, and run downstairs to Professor XX's office and pull up her ""broken"" computer's network settings.

Both of the static IPs were set to the same number.

Rolling my eyes, I walk up to the IT guy's office and knock on the door.  ""Um, did you know that you set both Professor XX and XY's IP to be the same number?""  ""Yeah, we ran out of IP addresses.""  ""Uh, you know that means that those two computers were booting each other off the network every time.""

Laezur,84,206,1jwb9w,889,"Ok - you guys keep me entertained all day - so I want to help by contributing a few stories.  This is one of my favorite that might give you a good jumping off point to understand what I am dealing with in this environment.

We deal with a lot of users (tens of thousands) and therefore have very rigorous SLA numbers.  Well recently we migrated to Outlook and the call center numbers have been in the shitter - but that is to be expected and the parent company knew this well in advance.  However they still want to keep some normalcy to the process so they still go over SLA numbers on a call once a month.

One of our SLAs is time to answer calls - which with how busy its been has obviously been very very low (much lower than it is supposed to be).  We plug these numbers in to the parent company provided spreadsheet and then discuss it on the call.  For this particular month we noticed a problem with how their spreadsheet is set up - if we meet the number it turns green, if we are below it is red.  The number this month was SO LOW (think call volume 10x more than what we are used to - which was expected) and so close to 0% that the spreadsheet kind of freaked out and showed it as green - no big deal, right?

Well during the meeting they congratulate us on meeting the number - we inform them that ""we are sorry, and hopefully things will get better as the dust settles, but actually our numbers this month were so low that the spreadsheet just THOUGHT we passed - in reality this is one of our worst months"".

They come back with ""well - they put a lot of work in to this spreadsheet - I think as long as it comes up green it should be fine - we will mark it here on our end as a pass for the month"".

Well SHIT guys - if you just want it to be green, I can make it green.

QA_Avenger,129,249,1iovm7,888,"This is a story that didn't happen to me, but it was a legend from a place where I worked as a lowly QA Technician and it is a tale which my Team Leader found great pleasure in telling.  
  
**The Legend:**  
I was working at a well known games publisher where we made a series of popular sporting games that were enjoyed all around the world. While the *Great Console Wars of 2005* were being fought, these games had such a following and reputation that our next title in the series was selected to be displayed as part of an international tour that a certain console manufacturer was running for the lead up to their product launch.  
Our game was still in its early stages and there were several issues that had yet to be ironed out.  
  
**The Feature:**  
You could choose the location for international matches when setting up a match in the game. On the same screen, there was a map that displayed the country of the stadium/pitch/court where you would be playing. One of these countries was India.  
  
**The Calm:**  
The tour was going well and the game was being publicised. It was becoming as popular as the console it was being demonstrated on. The tour moved on from region to country, to continent until it reached South Asia. Delegates from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were all invited to the same event on Indian soil. Even I still have difficulty coming to terms with what happened next...  
  
**The Storm:**  
It was a normal day in the office. People were working at their usual pace, unaware of the impending chaos that was raging overseas.  
*A wild email appears!* The leader for the QA team on the project reads it carefully and precisely, jaw dropping lower with every new line. Upon reaching the end of the email, he bursts out in shocked laughter and informs the team of the current situation.  
In a moment of brilliant thinking, the individual performing the demo of our game selected a match location in India. After a few seconds, outrage came from the delegates of India, followed by anger from the delegates of Pakistan. The map was incorrect. Kashmir had been drawn as part of Pakistan.  
  
**The Fallout:**  
The email explained in no uncertain terms that this game was not going to be released on their console unless the mistake was corrected *immediately*. They also demanded a fresh build of the game was sent to them before close of business. The situation had apparently become so heated that threats of war were being sent around the room and the delegates were also accusing the country of the console manufacturer of 'blatant political bias'.  
The QA team had to work late to get them a new build.

pcx226,129,239,1fxpxj,886,"didn't know this subreddit existed. subed. anyways here's my post from tales from retail. 

I worked student IT support for a university. We handled phone calls for pretty much any technical problem a student has from internet not working to computer problems to their passwords expiring(this happens every 6 months if you didn't change it).

And finally we used to sell students computers. They were setup under our domain so that the login would be their school username and password and sync everything. By the time I started working, this was getting phased out because they finally realized it was a terrible idea.

Anyways our manager had left for the day and I was left in charge for being senior tech. This was also my last month working here.

Ten minutes before closing on Friday an alumni calls. My coworker initially answered the call. The alumni had let their password expire and could no longer login to her computer. A simple password reset would fix the problem. The thing was, we needed a special code off her student ID card to reset the password.

Of course the alumni had already thrown it away. This is a common occurrence so we have the ability to manually reset her password through active directory. However, we require 2 forms of ID to prove that it is the actual user and not someone else. At hearing this the alumni started yelling and made my coworker start crying.

At this point we're 5 minutes from closing. I tell my coworker to transfer the alumni to me and say she's transferring to her manager.

me: how may i help you?

alumni: i need my password reset so i can get into my computer. hopefully you can be more helpful than the b*tch i was just talking to.

now i'm pissed. no one gets to yell at my newbies like that and call them names just for sticking to our policy.

me: i see. we either need a code from your student ID or you need to fax or email in 2 forms of ID so we can verify that you're who you say you are.

alumni:i need you to make an exception for me.

me: no

alumni: I DEMAND YOU FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY OR ELSE I'LL SPEAK TO THE PRESIDENT AND GET YOU FIRED.

(president of the university)

me: Be my guest. My name is pcx226. Tell him I said hi.

The alumni keeps on ranting about how we suck and should all be fired and that the school never seems to hire competent help.

During all this I take a look at her account. It turns out this alumni's account was supposed to have been deleted last year. we phase out old accounts a year after graduation. I'm not sure why her account was still active so I go ahead and flag it for deletion. This process is automatic so her account would be deleted at the end of the month.

At this point we're 5 min past closing and everyone is listening to me on this call.

Me: Well I just took a look at your account. Turns out it should have been deleted last year. Since you have been such a joy to work with I've taken the liberty of deleting your account for you. You will no longer be able to login to anything associated with our university including your university email. Have a nice day. If you have any additional problems call us during our office hours Monday through Friday 9-7.

And then I hung up.

I texted my boss who told me that was hilarious but if she makes a big fuss I'll have to let you go. I told him I know, I'm leaving at the end of the month anyways.

Fast forward to Monday. In our fax machine was 2 copies of the alumni's IDs. Along with a letter apologizing for her behavior and asking me oh so politely to undelete her account.

I reset the password and call the alumni back. I tell the alumni that we have reactivated her account and she has until the end of the month to set up forwarding on her email and retrieve any important emails. Also I sent instructions on how to remove her university login from her computer so this problem wouldn't happen again.

TLDR: alumni yelled at my cowoker, i told alumni i deleted their account, alumni freaks out and apologizes profusely.


edit: my boss wouldn't have actually fired me. 
to be fair i'm pretty sure my boss would have only ""let me go"" because i was already leaving. it would give the department a small ""PR"" boost at no cost to any of the involved parties.

had i been staying i have faith that he would not have fired me. he's pretty much the best boss i've ever had.

SkraeNocturne,117,185,1nwt00,884,"When I started at my current job, my client company, despite wanting us to log our work and wanting their on-site ""IT generalist"" to use our ticket system, was averse to us requiring users to email our help account, help@mycompany.com, valuing turnaround time over being able to keep track of work.  They also want us to drop everything if someone's CAPS LOCK key is turned on.

I've been slowly and secretively teaching people that if they want help, they should email our help account so it gets autologged in the system.  I work with the door to the office open so that people can see me typing and think I'm doing something (the only thing missing is the green text on black background).  The method of training I've been using has been to ignore the workers in the next room when they say my name, forcing them to get up and ask me to fix the problem (the moment I hear my name I start to look busy).  

When they ask, I look them in the eye and tell them that I've got projects I'm working on, and if they would mind emailing so that I've got a reminder when I have a moment.  This has been working to an extent; the most guilty culprit of ""Skrae!  HALP!"" has actually been logging tickets without me having to ask, although she titles the emails ""Ticket,"" but, hey, baby steps.

-----

**Story Time**- gather 'round old EDC and listen good

One of my first IT jobs was where I learned that lesson. It was a small company, I started out under two other people doing shitty desktop support. Over time those two people quit and I was left running the whole show but still only getting paid for desktop support. I asked for a raise but was told ""What, just for fixing our computers? That's what you've always been doing and (the guys that quit) were WAY overpaid!"" I stayed for several years though- I didn't it mind that much, I just kept my head down.

Our setup was ancient. When WinXP hit SP1, our servers still ran NT 3.51 (the one with the Windows 3.1 interface) and the desktops ran pirated Win2k. The backup was a squeaky DDS drive (literally- it squeaked when the tape backhitched) and the backup software was installed from floppy discs. I practically begged them to upgrade, but was always denied. The boss drove around in a brand new Benz, but any money for upgrades was out of the question.

One day, server crashes. It was probably a virus, everybody had the admin password (""we have no secrets in this office!"") and used the server for stupid shit. Either way, server OS is totally borked. Naturally half the squeaky DDS tapes don't work, which didn't matter because the floppy discs with the backup software are full of bad sectors. And I can't get them replaced because that company went out of business back when NT4 was the next best thing.

I put in a FUCK TON of overtime fixing it, but I did fix it. Took the better part of a week and a whole weekend, but between reinstalling NT3.51, finding an old 'warez' (remember that word?) of the backup software on IRC, stripping the DDS drive and cleaning the heads with q-tips, restoring the backup, removing the traces of the virus before they could activate, etc etc I got *every last byte of data back* for those guys. They were down a couple days, but lost *nothing*. I was very proud of myself and expected at least some gratitude, because if they lost all their data they'd pretty much have to fold the company.

Instead, boss refuses to pay for ANY of the time I spent fixing the server. His justification- ""You broke it, we lost money while it was down, I shouldn't have to pay you for fixing it."" Nevermind that I did NOT break it and was in fact in my car at the time and it was down for a week because he ignored my recommendations about good backups. He refused to pay for ANY of my hours fixing his server.

Shortly after that, I quit and was almost instantly hired by one of his clients for double the pay. I offered to take my two weeks updating the documentation at the old place and helping with a transition plan, but the boss said no thanks just don't come back in on Monday.

**Moral of the story- if you aren't being valued, leave while you can. A workplace that doesn't value your services will bite you in the ass sooner or later.**

Karma justice- I had to stop by a few weeks later to give back my RFID entry card (as they had no idea how the door locks worked or how to delete an old card). They'd just hired the cheapest support company they could find, and between onsite support (which they needed constantly) and useless transfer-to-India phone support, they were now paying more than triple what they'd paid me and were getting shitty service- always a different tech, none of whom knew the quirks of their duct taped ghetto-rigged system.

**""See, these sites don't work either. It just doesn't know it's me. That's the problem.""**

I finally reason with her to try and remember her password and she types something in for her email and it throws the wrong password exception. Then she throws out this little gem after she initially insisted she didn't remember her password.  

**""I know that is my password, that's not the problem. It thinks i'm someone else and isn't letting me in. Why in the world would someone put this kind of security on a school email.""**    

I told her that I will go and talk to our IT staff and get back to her later in the day. I ended up resetting her email password and had my supervisor deal with her. Anti-climactic ending, I know.

Now read on...
   
  
   
All good things must come to an end, and the replacement office manager was an enormous dick who had been exiled from the State office in order to live out his remaining career in charge of a region which was (a) large and prestigious enough so he couldn't complain or start pointing out the skeletons in their closet, but (b) so far away from HQ that it was obvious he'd been put out in the cold.

He did not like the situation at all, and pretty much handed the day-to-day running of the office over to a triumvirate of section managers, while he concentrated on being a dick to people. We clashed many times over many things, and eventually he exploited a loophole which enabled him to oust me from the tech support position into a bottom-rung gofer job.
   
  
   
This is not the story of how he forgot to line up a replacement first.
   
  
   
This is the story of the first couple of days afterwards, when I was happily acting as though I'd been dropped on my head and couldn't possibly give *unofficial* technical assistance or, indeed, remember how to do anything I hadn't been officially trained on. After all, the job level I'd been transferred to was supposed to only exist for trainees, not staff, so I couldn't be officially expected to actually know anything.

Heh heh heh.

On of the triumvirate was a manager I'd bumped heads with before over various things. Mainly her wanting special treatment and me telling her to get back in her box. I got assigned to her for the training that the employer red tape said had to be done for everyone entering the bottom-rung level.

She saw it as an opportunity to exercise power over me. I saw it as an opportunity to play so exceedingly dumb that she would have to waste hours and hours going over basic procedure while I grinned at her and fielded queries from people who would interrupt us to ask me extremely complex questions.

One of my favorite memories from this time was making her show me, over and over, how to record a corporate-TV transmission off the satellite onto a VCR tape. Considering that I'd set up the entire AV system during my time as the tech there, and written the complete instructions for doing everything on it (which had mysteriously gone missing the day before), it was so very sweet to make her have to keep getting up from her Desk Of Supervision and trot over to the other side of the building to push VCR buttons in front of me.

After a couple of weeks of this, she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and I got transferred to the audit division I'd helped out before, under the manager who'd overseen the IT position. I was about ten feet away from the Office Manager's new office, and it's amazing the things you can do which stop just short of outright harassment, or which never get reported because someone's on too much of a power trip to ever let it be known that a bottom-rung employee was getting to them.
   
  
   
However, the story of the failed replacement for me, and the advent of the Guy in the Tie, are a story for another time.

soundknowledge,74,224,1gefnr,874,"Heres a quick and simple one:

So at work, I am the go-to guy for all Computer-related issues. My colleagues refer to me as having a midas touch when it comes to electronics. I like to maintain this appearance as much as possible. Below is one story of how I did so:

A Colleague needed to borrow a flash drive off me. No worries, I grab the dual Flash Drive / MicroSD Reader off my desk and give it to her. 
Now, the thing about this drive is, for whatever reason, it takes longer than normal to get recognized by the PC, especially on a slow machine, which hers is.
So she takes it away and plugs it in, and returns a minute later saying the stick isn't recognised. she turns it round to face me, and as she does so I see the explorer window pop up as the laptop finally recognises the stick. 
SO, I stare really hard at the laptop, and do some ""magic hand waving"", and tell her it should work now. She turns it round and looks, then gives me a little ""wtf"" look. I turn round and resume my previous activities.

[deleted],121,174,1d0dbh,872,"I'm sure we all have hundreds of stories of users being dumb, lying, or *the classic* not plugging in the device... but I only have one story like this one: 

I had a client who was doing rather well and opening new locations for his business and was giving me quite a few billable hours.  As he got bigger, he passed his invoicing off to some third party and suddenly I wasn't getting paid as quickly.  He was a big client and getting bigger so I didn't want to complain too quickly so I was patient.  

A few weeks go by and I've built, delivered, and installed several new computers for his new office and the bill was getting to be several thousand dollars.  So I ask him about the bill.  He gets extremely angry at me for no discernible reason... 

He goes on about how his ""guy"" will cut me a check every Wednesday... I tell him several Wednesdays have gone by and no check... This infuriates him and he picks up a monitor I just installed and tried to throw it across the room at me!  

The monitor was on one of those long 10 ft VGA cables so it got some distance before the VGA cable came taut (the power cable popped out).  This sent the monitor to the floor very hard and destroyed it!  Stunned... I walked out of his office and called the police (they were no help, he told them I threatened to kill him, they didn't want to get involved in he said/she said bullshit and left...) 

I left, sent the invoice to his billing address, they paid all my previous invoices including that one **and including the now destroyed monitor**.  He called later to try to get some more assistance (he forgot his windows login password which I had reset for him about 5 times...) I refused to help him and refused to give him any information.  He stopped calling after a few weeks.

maumacd,174,164,vr9db,873,"So, I know around here there are a lot of big name companies we all love to hate on this board, but this a story about one of them, and our year long battle with them, and how it ended up getting resolved.

Our ISP is the only one that services our area with high speed internet. We literally have no other options, which is why we even ended up fighting this for a whole year rather than switching to another provider.

We had been having an issue where our internet would go out randomly, for about 5-10 minutes, and then it would come back up and be all hunky-dory. At first we were like, well that's certainly annoying. After it started happening EVERY HOUR we began to get really upset.

Unfortunately, due to the large customer-service-hell automated phone system, we were NEVER able to actually get a service rep on the phone while the issue was actually occurring.

**Them:** Well, I can ping your modem and I don't see any sort of problems connecting...

**Us:** We know! It comes back after 5-10 minutes! We can't get you on the phone before it comes back!

**Them:** Well, we're not seeing a problem so there is nothing we can do.

So this exact conversation goes on for months. Which is REALLY frustrating. Especially when we got flagged as a repeat-caller. Ever call began with, *""are you STILL calling about that connection dropping issue?""* with a weary sigh from the unfortunate tech we got on the phone.

After one night of attempting to stream a movie on netflix and restarting the modem/waiting 10 minutes/restarting the modem about 6 times, I lost it. I had been dealing with this nightmare for about 10 months at this point, and I just couldn't take it any more.

I called the ISP, and I cried. I just let it all out on the poor support guy. As someone who works in the support area, I knew what I was doing was wrong, and this poor support guy not only had nothing to do with causing my issue, and that this poor guy simply did not have any tools at his disposal to help me. But it didn't matter. I cried for like 30 minutes on the phone with this guy about how frustrating this whole thing had been.

Then he told me the loophole. I could upgrade to the ""business class"" of service (which is about 3.50$ extra a month for the level we were at already) and they would send a service tech to our house for free for any issue, and if I was ""unsatisfied"" with the solution (or no solution had been found), they would keep sending someone out until I was ""satisfied."" 

Up to this point, we had someone out to check our cables about 4 times already, but we were charged each time, and there had been no real work done. The first time I think they just walked in and replaced the modem, the second time the ran some tests, couldn't confirm the issue in the 15 mins they were there so they left, etc.

So I tell this poor guy that I have been completely losing my cool on for like 30 minutes that I don't honestly see how that could help. 

He then tells me that those service calls cost the ISP a lot, and if a business customer is racking up a lot of them, they GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED so they can stop sending people out. Apparently, he used to work for the dispatch part of the ISP who calls those guys out, and he knew that after 3-4 call outs on a business client who is not paying for each one, it gets escalated up the pipeline fast.

So I say, sure, sign me up for the business class and send someone out.

After the 8th service guy was sent out, THEY GOT SERIOUS. 

At this point they had:

* Replaced our modem 4 times 

* Added 3 different line-filters to weed out other signals disrupting the line

* Spent hours sitting in their van waiting for the signal to go out and then ""running tests""

* Rewired our house to the pole

* Rewired the entire neighborhood's pole system

After all this, they decided it was time to send out the big guns. We were told that ""Scott"" would be coming next time. 

What we didn't realize until he got to our house was that Scott was not an ""on-site"" tech. He was the type of guy that didn't have to deal with this shit. He was a big kahuna, and all the other techs lived in fear of him.

What was the problem Scott diagnosed within about 20 minutes? Our neighbor (Who had never complained about their service) is a retired guy, and a big fan of tinkering. He had created a bunch of things for his wife's garden (which IS a very lovely garden, and VERY designed and meticulously maintained) that she could turn off and on remotely, or change settings about how they moved/ran or actually program things to do a certain ""dance"" every set period of time. Think windmills and faeries and other yard art, and fountains with different settings. What no one had realized in all their visits, is that all the tinkering stuff he set up completely fucks most wireless signals, and throws crazy interference over the cable line back to all the other people within range... which is only us, because we are the only two houses on our pole.

Once he figures it out, Scott goes over to the neighbors house, and spends the next 4 hours drinking our neighbor's beer and talking about all the cool stuff my neighbor has made for his wife, and how he can fix it so it stops fucking over our internet.

Now, every time our internet goes out, the first thing we do is poke our head to look at the neighbor's garden. Is there a new gnome?

McLower,343,188,1m0ooo,871,"In my Computer technologies and literacy (CTL) high school class, there is one know-it-all-better-than-everyone kid. We will call him dingbat, or DB for short.

You see, dingbat had Mommy and Daddy buy him a fancy Alienware Desktop with all the bells and whistles for a small price tag of around $3500.

DingBat claims that he built the Alienware by himself, saying he put in such parts as ""Custom Crossfire SLI graphics sticks,"" and ""a 7 core intel processor."" In case it wasn't clear, DingBat has NO IDEA what he is talking about.

Anyways, you can earn a credit by building a PC using donated or recycled parts. DingBat decides to do so, taking several weeks and countless questions to do it. After finally finishing it, we learn that the system he built doesn't do much more that light up the power LED and beep. After going through it for a few minutes, he gives up and drops it onto my workstation begging me to fix it. After going through it for a while and making sure everything's plugged in properly inside, I decide to pull and re-seat the CPU.

He put thermal paste in the socket. IN. THE. SOCKET.

Upon the teacher's decision, we just scrapped the motherboard and processor instead of trying to salvage it. DingBat shortly after dropped the class due to some deserved ridicule.

TL;DR: Kid's parents buy him an Alienware, instant tech guru. Puts thermal Paste in processor socket. Comical anarchy.

So after a few weeks I upgraded someones drive and had one spare, put the drive in and installed windows and told her to put the license key in that shipped with the laptop when she bought it. Posted the laptop back at cost to me (it was a heavy bit of kit), months go by and she doesn't enter the license key she keep pestering me asking for a key I keep telling her to look for the COA that shipped with the laptop, eventially I give in and give her one of the keys on one of my boxes as I have long ago migrated to Linux..

Working for a large hosting company here.  Conversation usually goes a little something like this:

Customer: MY SITE NAME IS NOT BRINGING UP MY WEBSITE!!!

Me: Ok, your domain is not bringing up your website.  Let me look into that for you....It looks as through everything is in order, your website and domain are connected.

Customer: WELL, WHY CAN'T I BRING IT UP ON GOOGLE?!?!?!

Me: Oh, well, showing up on Google is a bit of a different story. (I go into the spiel about how *Company I work for* suggests submitting domains with search engines to guarantee showing up on them).  But, if you type your domain into your address bar, your site will come up.

Customer: THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING!!  TYPING IT INTO MY ADDRESS BAR AND IT DOES NOT COME UP!!

Me: Well, if you are getting search results, you are typing it into a search bar.  You would want to type it into the address bar.  That would be the long white bar at the top of your screen.  Next to the forward and back buttons in the top left hand corner.  

After many attempts of trying to guide the customer to find the address bar I finally ask, ""What website are you on right now?""

Customer: Google.com

Me: Towards the top of your screen, where it says 'google.com,' that is your address bar.

Customer: Oh, ok.  (Customer types in domain).  There's my site.

It has been quite awhile since I have had a chance to post anything here on Reddit. It is pretty much due to me posting here at TFTS. No, my employers didn't find this and go crazy, but instead, it was you guys who helped smack some sense into me.

I wouldn't leave this organization because I was super concerned that they couldn't thrive without me. And I defended that mindset while several of you in the comments encouraged me to see the light. Thank you...thank you so much for encouraging me to look elsewhere.

I come from a smaller city and didn't think I could ever find another IT place around. It just so happened that after you guys said look elsewhere, I did actually look. And dang it, the local Hospital needed a Network Technician. So dang it, I got myself a new job, and it was because you guys encouraged me to. So now, instead of having to awkwardly handle a midlife crisis woman, I handle two hospital locations and have also received an increase in salary.

Now read on...
   
  
   
So there we were, in this big government department, having just had all our Wang terminals replaced with Windows 3.11 PCs running mainframe emulators. And being a government department dealing with very sensitive personal information, our security was locked down tighter than an eel's ass. We had to lock our screens every time we stood up from our desks, and the keyboard shortcut for doing so on the Wang terminals had been ingrained into the employees' reflexes, sometimes for decades.  
   
  
   
When we got these newfangled things, I had a poke around them and noticed a couple of points.  

* Firstly, the mainframe emulator was an off-the-shelf model with no special security built in. That was all handled on the mainframe end.  

* Secondly, Windows 3.11 vanilla installs included this little applet called Windows Recorder. For those who weren't around at the time, this was basically a keystroke macro recorder. A keylogger, in other words.  

* Thirdly, the management being unfamiliar with the new systems meant that many people were still reflexively using the mainframe screenlock key instead of the Windows screenlock when they walked away from their computer. And given that most of them were running the mainframe emulator fullscreen, the result looked enough like what they'd been trained to expect that they would indeed walk off leaving their PC (if not the mainframe session) wide open.  

* Fourthly, Windows Recorder would save its macros in files which were unencrypted, and thus (if you looked at every other byte) human-readable with a little practice.  

I think you see where this is going.
   
  
   
So I wander down to the office manager, who is something of a blustery bloke and not really technical material, and tell him there might be a security issue with mainframe passwords, and could he give me his opinion on it? He's willing to give me ten minutes, so I ask him to log onto the mainframe - just to the main menu screen is fine. I then ask him to lock his screen and step away as he would normally do. ""OK,"" I tell him, ""imagine you've left the room for a couple of minutes. Someone comes along and does this."" - and I step around to his keyboard, notice he hasn't locked Windows, and fire up Recorder and hide it - ""Then you return to your computer, log back on to the mainframe"" - he does - ""and continue on your merry way. OK, lock your screen again. At some point, whether it be that same day, or your lunch break, or even a week later, you're not in front of your computer for five minutes once more, and the person who was there before does this."" I call up the background Recorder, stop it running, pull up the macro file in Notepad, and scan for his userID, then the string of bytes immediately following it. ""And hey presto.""

I hand him a piece of paper with his userID and password written on it.
   
  
   
Now at this point I am a cocky kid who has just *apparently* cracked national security in thirty seconds flat for a multibilliondollar organisation whose privacy controls are matters of national politics. Oh, and as far as this manager knows, I can access any level of security in the mainframe at will, including everything logged under his userID. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have stood there grinning and looking entirely too pleased with myself, or let the manager decide which channels to escalate this information to.

As a result, that afternoon I am hauled into his office in front of a number of very unsympathetic, unsmiling people in suits who have never graced our office before, and dragged over the coals. There ensues something of a verbal brawl - they're trying to determine if I have already compromised the mainframe which controls billions of government dollars, or leaked the information to anyone else. I'm annoyed at the way I'm being treated because I was the first person to actually bother to tell them about the very easily identifiable giant-ass security hole THEY shipped out to every office in the nation. I should have been getting a goddamn commendation, as far as I was concerned. Maybe a medal for, as I may have put it in a heated moment, ""Doing all your lazy-ass jobs FOR you, and apparently doing it better!""
   
  
   
So, eventually all the shouting dies down and the suits realise they have to actually do something about this because we're a civilian, not a military department, and there is nothing stopping me from walking up the road to the local Member of Parliament's office and regaling him with enough juicy material to win him headlines well into the next electoral period. They can't even fire me - the union for that place was a six-hundred-pound gorilla and its hobby was jumping up and down on managers. The intimidators have nothing to work with. All they've accomplished is irritating me.  

Oh, and a last point. This was the mid-90s, well before flat-panels became common. As the security detail is shuffling out, I toss at them ""Of course, you realise that even if you fix this, we still don't have [TEMPEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST) shielding.""

They go bananas. They want to know where I heard that term, what I've been doing, everything. But fuck 'em, they already blew their chance. I tweak them a little further by telling them that most computer people have known about it for years - didn't they keep up with the industry? - and that it was frankly none of their goddamn business what I'd been doing in my personal time. Finally, as they'd made *perfectly* clear over the last hour, IT security wasn't my problem. It was theirs. *I* was going to have a really good night's sleep that night.  
   
  
   
Then there was the time I made a manager I disliked spend her time personally training me to press three buttons on a VCR...

Haybuck_Pony,212,223,12e96o,869,"This morning, I walk into the office to a ticket labeled ""Broken Laptop"". Clicking it open, it's from a manager that is well known in the IT Department here for being technologically illiterate. And even more so, most of the folks he manages are as bad, if not worse than he is. The ticket text is completely blank, so I figure it's not hugely urgent. Brew my morning cup of coffee, and then swing over to the lab area where he and his employees work.

I find him pacing out in front of one of our smaller labs. He explains that this is a critical issue, as one of his employees can't work at all. I nod, ask him who, and he points over to the corner of the room. Gerald (not his real name, of course), he says. 

As we begin to walk over, he begins to elaborate. Apparently this month, they are doing cross-training between receiving, technical support, booking, shipping, and ordering. So all of these employees will be jumping from workstation to workstation. Something slowly begins to tick away in the back of my head. That something is very wrong in paradise.

Now, this warrants a little backstory. At my place of employment, we use Dell Laptops exclusively. Each laptop has a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (on occasion a USB Hub or set of Speakers as well) hooked up to a docking station. We primarily use Latitude E6400's and up, so for the most part all of our laptops use the same docking station. However, there are a few cases where they do not. For example, the folks in shipping use Latitude D630's. One of our older employees in Booking uses a Vostro.

As I walk over to the machine, around the corner and up the slight incline, I can already see the issue. But, hearing it from this manager's mouth just really put the icing on the cake.

""When Gerald came in today to work in Booking, his laptop wouldn't fit on the docking station. I figured it was just weird, like there was a piece of plastic in the way or something.""

Continuing to walk forward with this explanation, the laptop is indeed on the docking station. A Vostro. On a D630 Docking Station.

""So, I figured a little elbow grease would do the trick, right? Got over there, and pushed. It was a tough little sucker, but it finally went on! But now the monitor won't light up. I have no idea what's wrong.""

I pick up the entire unit, laptop and docking station, removing the wires from the dock. The laptop is skewed from the back of the dock at about a 10 degree angle. There is a faint rattling sound as I lift the machine into the air. And the machine really, really is not coming off of the dock.

shoot_photo,191,265,18l3rj,869,"Alright so a couple of years back i was working as a tech sales/support/technician at a computer store. An old woman walks in. She wants to buy a laptop and being the kind and helpful person i am, i take her to the laptop aisle. She then proceeds to ask me for every laptop we carried (28) if she can surf the internet and use the built in webcam to skype even though i told her all of them can do that.

Then it turns uglier as she asks me all kinds of questions and repeats the same questions for every laptop we carry. After 40 minutes of hell, she settles down on the cheapest clearance open box TOSHIBA SATELLITE laptop. Because she was so annoying, i just didnt ask her if she needed anything else and grabbed the unit from the locker and took her to the cash register.

BUT, once at the cash register she then asks me the same questions again and by that time a few people had lined up behind her waiting to be cashed out as i was the only one around the cash register. Somebody sigh'd and the old woman turned around and said sternly:

""EXCUSE ME BUT I AM BUYING MY NEW COMPUTER. WOULD YOU PLEASE BE PATIENT?""

A manager heard that and he ran to the next cash register next to mine and started cashing out the furious customers in line.
At this time everyone is pissed and she then asks me the dumbest question I have ever been asked:

At this time, i am half mortified and holding my breath to not laugh. My manager and the customers chuckled silently. Then i told her:

""It connects to a satellite called Ourouboros and orbits the earth at an altitude of 600 miles""

Old lady: ""Oh thats nice to know. Would you please write it down on the back of my receipt so i can show my son?""

Me: ""Sure"" and i write it down while some of the other customers were struggling to holding back laughing at the whole situation. Then she went.

My manager facepalm'd then called me to the office to give me a lecture to not do this again but he then patted me on the back.

Worth it!

TL;DR: Annoying grumpy old woman comes into store, wastes my time and other lined up customers' time by asking stupid questions.

neurohero,155,239,17osan,871,"I haven't done tech support for about 15 years, but reading some of these tales is giving me some serious 'Nam flashbacks.

I worked tech support for a small ISP back in the days that dial-up was king. One day the higher-ups decided to change our POPs and Authentication mode. An email was sent out to all of the users well before hand, though some obviously fell through the cracks. All that they needed to do was to change the dial-in number and add ""@myisp.net"" to their username.

One such caller happened to call while I was on shift. The gentleman in question was of the older persuasion and only had very rudimentary knowledge of English. He called because dial up networking was telling him that his password was invalid.

Over the course of the next hour, I managed to talk him through changing the POP number. It took another half an hour to explain what the @ symbol was. Here is a snippet of the conversation:

**poor guy**: What to do?

**me**: On your keyboard, at the bottom left, there is a button that has ""CTRL"" written on it. Do you see it?

**poor guy**: It say ""Connect"" e ""Cancel"".

**me**: Yes, that is on the screen. I want you to look at the keyboard. It's the thing in front of the screen with all the letters on it.

**poor guy**: ""Connect""?

*Fade to later in the call*

**me**: Right, now just above the CTRL key that we found, there is a key with an arrow on it pointing up. That's called the ""Shift"" key. I want you to put your finger on it and hold it down.

*I hear the computer trying to dial*

**me**: Okay. Click on Cancel on the screen. We need to find the CTRL key on the keyboard again. That's right, the keyboard. In front of the screen.

*continue in this vein until we get to the fullstop in "".net""*

After a further 15 minutes trying to explain what a fullstop, dot, small black circle, point etc. is, he puts his wife on the phone **who speaks English**

Two hours after the call started, I had them successfully dialing in.

During my very next shift, I got another call and recognised poorguy's voice instantly. 

**me**: I'm sorry, is your username poorguy@myisp.net? *I look over at my supervisor* Could I please speak with your wife?

BDM calls me for a pri3 and I proceed to tell him his issue is no more important than a pri1 .  After 20 minute argument, refusing to escalate the call to pri3, BDM threatening to get me fired, and issue resolution, I get him off the phone (Saturday).  Monday morning, I get a call from my Bosses boss.

Told him that certain websites (I didn't use the word porn, it's something his father should discuss with him) or installation of ""free"" internet (read free virus) software or cracks for games can contain malicious programs and how I got rid of them.

XannBlack,106,254,1aevdc,864,"I spent a holiday season working for a now-defunct electronics store in the computers / gaming / digital cameras / you're everyone's bitch department. I came out of it with some great friends and several good stories, but one in particular stands out.

A couple, let's call them WASP Douche Dad and Soccer MILF, come into the store looking for ""the Internet our son can use to play games."" A little bit of digging revealed that they wanted to get their son an XBox Live package (this was in '04, so we're talking original Xbox). Their son's birthday party was that night, and they wanted to surprise him by having the account set up when his friends got there. WDD obviously thought this was a waste of time and money, so I dealt mostly with Soccer MILF.

At that time, Live packages were actual cardboard boxes that contained the subscription card and a headset. After chatting for a bit, I also determined that they would need to pick up an ethernet cable, and a rather long one at that, given SM's description of where the modem was in relation to the XBox. 

I eventually get them squared away, and as they're checking out, WDD says something about ""home installation."" I inform him that this isn't the sort of thing our install guys do, and even if it was, he'd be paying a ridiculous amount just to have them plug in a cable. He then demands my cellphone number in case things don't go smoothly; I tell him he can call the store and ask for me. This entire time he's been talking about how he won't hesitate to ""return all this crap"" if he can't get it set up properly.

Jump ahead 20 minutes, and I hear my name over the PA saying I've got a call from a customer. I pick up, and sure enough it's SM trying to get this hooked up. Apparently her husband had tried and failed, but she managed to get him to agree to let her call me before he drove up demanding a refund. I ask where she is in the process, and she's done well: The cable is plugged into the modem, in the right port even, but she can't find the jack in the back of the XBox.

XB: There should be a hole in the back of the XBox that looks just like the ones in the back of your modem.

SM: I'm looking at the Game Box, but I don't see that hole.

XB: Make sure it's facing the right way. The front should have four slots for controllers, and the back is where the power cable plugs in.

SM: I see the four joystick holes; one of them is plugged in. And I see the power cord and the TV cord. But I just don't see that hole.

At this point, WDD takes the phone from her and starts railing at me, accusing me of ripping them off, demanding to speak to my manager, etc. He no longer is talking about a refund, but rather has moved on to how this will ""ruin his son's entire birthday"" if it doesn't get sorted out.

SM eventually gets the phone back, and asks if she can bring the ""Game Box"" up to the store, since she still has to pick up some more things for the party later. I say sure, though I can hear WDD in the background ranting about what he'll do to me if they ""come all the way up here"" and I can't fix it.

I don't know if they had a fight on the way, or what, but when they finally show up WDD is fuming. I'm with another customer when he barges up, drops the console on the counter with the cable, and says ""Ok, smartness, let's see how smug you are now.""

I look at the console, look at him, and excuse myself from my current customer. I walk over to our main desk where my lead and manager are, set the console down.

XB: Can one of you please go tell this jackass how to plug his ethernet cord into this XBox.

Supervisor: *In tones as serious as can be* XB... that's a GameCube.

XB: I know it's a fucking GameCube. But the only way I'm telling him that is if I get to beat him to death with it.

Turns out their son had multiple consoles, and WDD was convinced the GameCube was the XBox because ""it's the only one shaped like a box."" Apparently SM had been wary from the start, and had even pointed out that the actual XBox had a giant green ""X"" across it's top, but WDD would have none of it. She had actually managed to bring the XBox along, but he had made her leave it in the car at first; that's why he was so pissed when he got there.

TL;DR I sold some dick and his sweet, hot wife an original XBox Live kit, and he tried to hook the cable up to a GameCube instead. His wife tried to call him on it, but he stubborned his way right into getting laughed at by an entire sales staff.

jaydude025,157,303,1qw7lx,857,"My partners brother is a complete moron.

I fixed a computer that was crashing and rebooting all the time by switching out the power supply with my old one and replaced the ram, while I was at it I also changed the thermal paste on the cpu as the pc had not been used in years and was all dried up. After about 2 hours of switching out parts and reinstalling windows and software I finally get the pc running normally again with no problems.

Now this is where the dipshit and his almighty knowledge of the gods comes in.

He is convinced that because I fixed it, it must still be broken because it was not him who fixed it, he takes my ram out and replaces it with new ram he just bought and the computer starts crashing with blue screens again.... 4 DAYS he is trying to fix that computer because he is convinced that the ram he JUST brought is not the problem despite the fact that is was working perfectly before he fucking changed it.

And so he finally buys new ram, And now cannot seem to install windows from a usb, absolutely refusing my help he spends the next full day staring at a blank screen like he is going to fix it using only the power of his mind!

Now it has been a few months since all this happened and it is working again, but only now has he realized that my power supply in still in there and he has brought a new one, he is also going to remove all my thermal paste and replace that to.

Now here is the good bit, I replaced the wifi card in it with a 300mbps one ""it only had a 150mbps card in it"" and now he thinks the new wifi card is too powerful for the computer and it is going to ""short it out and blow up""

And this is what I have to live with for the next several months.

PS: It is not his computer its the pc in the lounge room, I fixed it so my partner could use it.

Edit: He reinstalled windows because I installed my copy on there, and not his.

randommusician,33,181,1io5wo,857,"OK, so at my day job, there is a little old lady we'll call Sue.  Sue is the sweetest lady, and is very good at her job.  Unfortunately, there are two downsides to Sue-


1. *Everything* is an emergency.  Her reaction to a typo and a gunman shooting up the office would not be noticeably different.

2.  When it comes to technology, she's so dumb she could fall into a barrel full of nipples and come out sucking her thumb.  


Now, I'm not Sue's supervisor on paper, but I handle a particular project for one of our clients, and that project is generally about half of her work week the first half of the month, so she spends a fair amount of her time reporting to me, and I've ended up helping her with a few computer issues along the way.  


On this particular afternoon, I was stuck on a conference call I *really* didn't want to be on.  I'm a ""satellite"" member of this team (the only one in this office) which basically means I pick up overflow work occasionally and/or give advice on getting a unique project up and running. 


 The rest of the team consists of 5 people who really like to hear themselves talk, and the salesperson and manager in charge of the team, who really *really* like to hear themselves talk.  Hence, my relative lack of enthusiasm to be on the phone with them.  


So at this point, I'm focusing about 10% of my attention on the call, in case I am asked a question or someone actually imparts some useful information (and browsing reddit), when I get a stream of IMs from Sue

HOW DO I FIX?


I calmly type back ""What is the problem?""


I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID!!!!


CAN YOU FIX IT???


I CAN'T WORK TILL ITS FIXED

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Greetings, fellow tech support soldiers! 88 here with another tale of that most blessed of lists, the Black List. For those not in the know, one of my previous positions had this idea implemented. At this time, my boss was an awesome guy, and he'd listened to my idea of The Black List, had me get the numbers together, and pitched it successfully to the C_O level. The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever. This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us (with proof) that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication.

This would end up being my defining incident in the time I spent at FirstAid. It came on the heels of a very bad professional incident in our department, but in my personal life things were going great. I was dating Heavylegs, and happy as could be. Of course, we all know what happens in IT when things are going along smoothly and happily.

It ends.

It started with a massive cock-up by a Level 3 engineer that, to this day, I maintain was not at all an accident. L3 was on his way out, and had decided to screw over everyone at the company. Of course, he did this in ways that most users wouldn't know or care about. Group Policy edits were made to completely remove the data limit in Outlook for storage. File servers and networked file storage had their access rights either cleared, preventing access and requiring repair, or cleaned such that anyone could access anything.

Did I mention that FirstAid was a medical facility with several dozen clients of medium or larger size? This was a major problem. Had we not been on the ball and, in fact, on the lookout for L3 to pull this, we'd have been seriously hosed. As it stood, we barely managed to fix things overnight before the next shift. 

We missed something.

Remember that meat-grinder department I so do love telling stories about? We met [my erstwhile companion](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1l9auo/the_black_list_broken_hearts/) there, as well as dealt with [a not so small problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lqild/the_black_list_alpha_counter/) there. This department was, of course, led by one person, and that one person reported to the C_O level. We shall call her Anna.

When Anna decided to come in for work early on Day 1 of what would become War, she decided to start her daily routine of getting into everyone's business by making her way to the shared network drives and seeing what she could find. Depending on the data that she accessed, she could have been fired and sued, or even arrested.

So, of course, she decides to look for a certain legendary file. What does she find, there on that network share? A copy of the Black List. Our CIO required a digital copy of the black folder that Awesome Boss kept, and it was a simple spreadsheet of names, departments, and dates of submission for the B&amp;hammer. The CIO did not, sadly, keep this file somewhere relatively obscure.

Yes. Anna was able to get into IT\BLACKLIST\ with no problems. She made a copy of this file on her desktop and decided that it was time her people got removed from the list. As she scanned her department, she noticed that Heavylegs was now freshly in the clear; she had just been removed from the list the previous week, and we had celebrated that fact with... well, I'll tell you when you get older, TFTS.

This could not do, and Anna was at the front door of the office as Heavylegs and I arrived. I was not even in the door before Anna was screaming at me, and us, telling me that I was setting a horrible precedence for getting off of the Black List. I gave Heavylegs a kiss and told her to go on inside, and when the door closed behind her, I responded to Anna *very* politely.

**88**: I've just arrived. What the fuck are you talking about, Anna?

**Anna**: IT IS CLEAR THAT ANY WOMAN ON THE LIST CAN GET OFF THE LIST BY SLEEPING WITH YOU!

Nope. Not even going to fight this one. My cellphone is in my hands as she screeches, and Awesome Boss is called. As he had just gone home not more than a few hours before, I apologize for waking him, retrieve HR Girl's number, and give her a call.

As Anna continues to gripe at me, I inform HR Girl of the situation and request that she send someone out. Ending the call, I see HR Girl exit her office inside and come my way, stopping to lean into an office door and linger momentarily before she heads my way.

Followed by the Director of HR. 

DHR was as tall as I was, six foot five. He was far better built than I was at the time, and probably could have doubled as a granite statue if he so chose. In hindsight, it was probably good that HR Girl brought him, because she would not have been good backup as Anna described how it was bullshit that someone had to provide sexual favors for Black List removal.

As DHR exited the building, Anna turned to continue her tirade. She fell silent at DHR's upheld hand.

**DHR**: Anna, there is no reason to be screaming at this employee as he is coming in for work.

**Anna**: This man is perpetuating a list of sexual favors to be allowed to work!

**DHR**: So you decided to go around the chain of command and confront him directly? 

At this point, HR Girl comes over to me and escorts me to my desk. Our conversation is about how baseless the accusation is, until it hits us both as Girl Power, my current L2 apprentice, comes to meet us.

*How in the hell did Anna access the List?*

As GP begins to update me on the status of the file permissions, it hits us. A check of the logs later and we see the truth. Before the rights were fixed, she managed to get in. *She made a copy.* I rolled my eyes, and shook my head.

**HR Girl**: I'll speak with DHR after this and let him know.

I began the holy procedure of Cover Your Ass and gather all of the information necessary to prove that this list is not exclusive. HR Girl lets me know that DHR would like to see me, so I collect this evidence and gather a few other bits of information, just in case, before I head for HR with GP in tow.

As I approach, I see Heavylegs in the windowed office, and she is in tears.

Rage. I know exactly what is about to happen, and it infuriates me. I turn to GP, and she knows. 

**GP**: 88, you don't have to do this. 

**88**: You're right. I don't. I'm going to go in there and fight. What I need you to do is call Awesome Boss and let him know what's happening. Tell him I owe him a bottle of the good stuff, but it's time to call in a favor from Nick.

**GP**: Nick!? What does the CEO owe us? Why are you going right there?

**88**: They're about to fuck with my relationship, GP. I'm not going to let them. I'm going to go nuclear in there if I have to.

With a fist bump, we part. I turn back to the room and move to the door, opening it. Immediately, conversation stops, and the only thing I have is the scene: DHR and the Director of IT, sitting across from my now-weeping girlfriend. On the side of the Directors is Anna, smug and practically dancing in her seat.

I am told to have a seat in the chair next to the Director of IT. I politely decline, and move down to where Heavylegs was attempting to control herself. I kneel, and whisper words to her. Those words are not your business, but they helped to start the calming-down process. I kissed her on her forehead and sat down next to her, placing the rather-large folder of evidence in front of me. 

**DHR**: 88, we're here to address some serious accusations towards you and the IT department regarding the Black List. Could you tell me what your relationship is with (Heavylegs)?

**88**: My relationship status is none of your business. However, the requisite paperwork for dating a coworker is on file with your office. I have copies here of it, including your signature.

They aren't expecting this. DHR shifts uncomfortably.

**DHR**: That will not be necessary. The concerns here are that sexual harassment is occurring with women on the List; specifically, that if they sleep with you, they will be removed from the list.

**88**: Patently false. I am not even involved with the process for removal. You are. In fact, I have here a list of Black List removals, which are signed off on by HR Girl and yourself. I also have the original Black List documentation stating that the approval and removal processes both go through your office. Are you telling me, DHR, that you are also accusing me of violating the rules of this list, designed with mutual cooperation between our departments specifically to avoid this type of conduct?

*Director of IT is smiling. I am not. Rage is coursing through my body like a venomous bite looking to burn me out.* We go back and forth, DHR attempting to get me to admit to sexual harassment, and my refusal. He gets progressively madder and progressively paler as I present my evidence: 

Transcript of the meeting where Heavylegs was removed from the list. This meeting took place between Awesome Boss, Heavylegs, Heavylegs's Boss (Oh, that's Anna, isn't it?), HR Girl, and the Director of HR. It included signatures of all attendees.

Defiant001,266,192,1i2xy9,856,"This incident still bothers the hell out of me, it happened a few weeks ago.  This is by far the most disturbing thing I've ever seen in my life and makes all other ""annoying users"" since then not seem too bad anymore.  

Some context first, I work for a company with locations in many countries.  I had been sent to one of these overseas locations to get the Help Desk in order (I am a technician myself, the techs there were not following procedure/doing tickets on time, etc..), they were also having a raised floor/new AC installed in the server room and since I had nothing else to do in this country (in a remote small town area) I stuck around to watch it with the IT staff there.

It was on a Sunday night around 8pm, and there were 4 contractors we had hired to do the work in the server room.  They were being checked in on every 15 minutes or so to see their progress and things were going a little slow, but the work was good.  We had just left the server room and went to the IT section right next door when it happened.

There were loud cries for help (in another language) and screaming, we ran to the server room to see the three contractors surrounding the other.  He was laying in the floor motionless with blood around his mouth and on his head, he looked dead.  I've seen this sort of thing in movies, but I was not prepared for it in real life.  The IT manager with me was in shock as was I, but I snapped myself out of it and got him to contact Security immediately (they had medics on site).  The medics came and then eventually an ambulance showed up, which took him to the hospital.  By this point he was conscious and moving, but irrational and trying to fight anyone who came near him, he had to be sedated.

What the hell actually happened?

As soon as Health and Safety cleared us (took about 2 hours), we left for the hospital.  The three contractors were outside and were furious at us (misdirected rage because of their hurt friend), I had to calm them down as they were about to literally kill the IT manager (one took him by the arm behind a van and screamed in his face).  To make a very very long story short that I've had to answer and explain to about two dozen managers/directors/VPs and health/safety staff over and over, the injured contractor had opened the door on a large rack size UPS, removed the bottom security panel, stuck his head in the bottom of the UPS while reaching for something.  His head came into contact with the 220 Volt rails, and he was electrocuted.  At no point were they supposed to be near the UPS (they were well aware of this), and the next morning when we went to check on him again (bringing the whole IT dept this time, as backup) he refused to answer why he went near the UPS.  Thankfully last I heard, aside from a big burn on his head and hands, he is going to be alright which was a massive relief.

There are other details we have found out since then, but I can't say them publicly, this whole thing was a stressful compounding mess and I didn't sleep for days after it.  What a nightmare, but the contractor is alive and well, and since then other contractors were sourced to finish the work.  I'm relieved this is all over with.","A life was nearly lost, the server room upgrade gone very wrong",1048
cobysev,144,251,ua2ee,855,"A little background: I work IT for the US Air Force.  This happened about a decade ago, when I was young, low-ranking, and ambitious.  IT customers had yet to whittle away at my motivation back then.

At the time, I worked in a network security position at a base in the Pacific.  Managing firewalls, anti-virus, etc.  One day, while manually pushing anti-virus updates to stubborn PC's on the network, I noticed a potential flaw in our security.  Instead of downloading the latest anti-virus updates directly from the company's website as soon as they were released, a higher level of the Air Force would download them and test them before releasing them for the individual bases to download.  It was the military's little bit of added security - make sure the anti-virus company hadn't been hacked and were releasing viruses instead of updates.

The problem with this process was that the Air Force testers were slow.  Really slow.  It would be anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks before the latest updates were ready for us to implement.  I trusted our AV company, so I figured I'd help speed up the process.  I wrote a little batch script that would check the AV website daily and compare their update with our servers. If it matched, the script ended.  If there was an update, it would download and automatically push to all servers and PC's.  This also saved me the trouble of burning the Air Force's copy to a disc and moving it to our servers (this was before flash drives were popular).  This saved me about 30 minutes of my morning and ensured our network was always updated and secured.

Fast-forward a few months.  There's a huge malicious outbreak in the world (a trojan, if memory serves) and people without top-end protection are finding themselves quickly falling prey to it.  All our bases in the Pacific seemed to catch some form of the virus and are losing network capabilities.  All bases, that is, except mine.  Other bases are working long hours, days on end, trying to purge the virus from the entire network.  My base network never so much as hiccuped.  Because I alone had downloaded the latest updates.

Naturally, when the dust settles, the higher-level Air Force sends in a team of techies to investigate.  They want to know what we did to stay operationable.  Suffice to say, they found my batch file and they weren't pleased.

According to them, I had violated a direct order and circumvented an official process, running my own personal unauthorized scripts on their network.  I was threatened with a court martial with guaranteed jail time for ""using hacking tools"" on a gov't network. (Seriously?) They even suggested that the virus outbreak might've been my fault.

Eventually, someone with some technical knowledge actually looked at the script and realized what it was doing.  Cooler heads prevailed and the Air Force got a chance to really evaluate their system.  They realized that I wasn't a criminal, but a hero.  I had single-handedly kept a base operational while all the others were losing valuable time, money, and manpower trying to get back up and running.

In the end, I was given a slap on the wrist, told not to implement my own personal scripts on gov't networks anymore, and sent back to work.  No court martial paperwork ever came down for me.

A few months later, I find out that I was hand-picked out of all my peers across the entire base for an early promotion in rank.  When I asked my supervisor about it, she said she submitted a recommendation that basically stated that I had ""single-handedly saved the base from complete and utter destruction"".  For once, an IT guy was given greater recognition than the pilots who are actually flying missions all day long.

Me66,119,243,153ow8,853,"My first job was in the municipal IT department where I lived. I worked there two years as an apprentice.

A few months after I had started there was a viral outbreak in my old school where I had attended 8th-10th grade 2 years earlier.

A few of the administrative computers were infected so I was tasked with cleaning up the mess (since the school [IT manager was inept](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/153nsp/internet_cable/)).

One of the infected computers were the one in the principals office so I was sitting there fixing his computer. The principal had left due to not being able to use his computer so I was alone in the office. Then walks in my old teacher.

The look on her face was priceless, seeing me sitting in her bosses chair, she was at a loss of words. So I pulled this one:

Me: ""Hi, can't you see I'm busy? Please talk with my secretary.""

Her: ""I... What?""

Me: ""I don't have time for your nagging today, miss herp. I'm still not convinced your students low grades isn't a direct result of your poor teaching skills. I hope you're ready for the review board meeting tomorrow.""

Her: (a bit stunned for a second) ""What are you doing here?!""


I couldn't hold it togethere anymore and started laughing. Shes a great teacher, but a little stuck up, but she took it in good sport. I used to be one of the few students who didn't give her hell each day so I thought I would just get my turn.

insufficient_funds,140,248,tgf54,851,"A bit about my Grandpa - he was a VA State Trooper for a longass time (basically from when he was old enough to be one, until retirement). After he retired from the force, he worked in an HR dept at a regional trucking company. I remember going to his office once - they didn't have computers, just paper and typewriters. He worked there until the company shut down, which was about his retirement age.

Since then, he and my grandma have only ever had a desktop (it's changed a few times, but always bottom of the line). He never used it, unless one of the grandkids were helping him look for a new car.

Anyways, a few years ago I was visiting and he came up to me with a sale add from Best Buy or Circuit City or some store like that and asked me what I thought of a particular laptop.

I looked through the various laptops at the time, and the one he picked out was easily the best one available. I asked him and he was like ""Well it's got suchandsuch CPU, XXgb ram, a big hard drive, and the screen is big""  of course this stunned me. Someone that's never really used a computer, and he knows what the hell all of this is? Totally unheard of!

A few months pass by and I never hear anything more of it.  It's about 6 months later and I'm visiting again. He comes to me with his new laptop, that I didn't even know he had purchased btw; asking me to help him fix his antivirus software.  It had the factory installed Symantec/Norton trial which had just expired.  I look at the system, and he's installed Office, uninstalled some of the vendor apps, and been using it wonderfully for a while.

Then I also realize that when he bought the laptop, he also bought a wireless router (previously they only had a wired router b/c only had a desktop).  So not only did he figure out **on his own** how to install and uninstall stuff on his new laptop, but he also was able to read &amp; follow instructions enough to setup his damn Wifi and have it functioning correctly.

My grandpa is in his 70's now, and is a better PC user than some of the people in their 30's and 40's at my office.  I guess it goes to show that some people really can comprehend how to read instructions, read messages on the screen and follow a logical path to figure things out.

Oh, he's had that system for about 3 years now and I've not once been called to fix anything on it (I've checked with the rest of the family as well - he hasn't called any of them either).

campycapper,190,186,1oflip,850,"Well I received a message from a user asking me to update my tales from Bob, the most hated evil bastard teacher ever. So I thought I would share what my last year has been like with him. 


The back story comes into play here. 
http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/xev2e/the_teacher_from_hell/


And when I finally lost my shit at my administration because of them allowing Bob to continue his destructive warpath, here. 


http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/z5ew4/i_hate_bob_part_ii_an_update/



Over the last few years working as an IT guy in a public school system I have witnessed a destructive force of nature that feeds on technology and the tears of IT guys.  The single greatest horrors I have endured have been at the hands of a maniac, who is so self-deluded that he believes he is a God among the technology professionals. He teaches social studies, and his name is Bob. 
I hate Bob. 



I left you last time with the glorious revolution that his technology was going to be pulled from his classroom. Unfortunately that lasted only a very short time. My administration quickly informed me that he is a long lasting and respected teacher and that my soul was worth less when compared to his teaching. So I was forced to replace all of his technology and allow him to begin his process of torment yet again. But to be fair he has learned many new things and has finally left some of his old destructive ways in the past. I have not had a single cable cut in over a year.


So I will begin with the first story, about how he crashed the entire network.  We moved to a new system and I am no longer the network admin, but I still run all the IT work throughout the school I just do not manage that network.  It was a Wednesday and I had just made it home after a long day of teaching/it work/and my second job (They pay teachers and it guys junk so I work other things) when I received a distressed message from the new Network manager. 


His entire domain was crashing because our site was pulling so much bandwidth. I knew exactly what the problem was right away but not before I got blamed for wiring something wrong or using our network to pirate material.  I had to come back to the campus late at night 
so that he could load up my desktop and view what I was running. Of course I had nothing running, I do not pirate nor utilize pirated material at work, as that would be really stupid. After that I made him walk with me to Bob’s classroom. In his infinite wisdom Bob had found a spare cable in his classroom and decided to plug it into the two unused network outlets. (We removed all switches from the classrooms and built a network closet and installed tons of new outlets. It is beautiful) 


So Bob had created a giant loop in the network and crashed the entire domain. This was only the third day of the year. That was only the beginning. 


By the end of the first week I was reminded that Bob has a master key to the entire building, and even at my request it was not taken from him. I have an IT storage closet where my entire wonderful well organized inventory sits waiting to be placed into classroom or utilized throughout the school. It is not a big closet but it is mine, mine, mine!


I had organized the supplies in the closet the day before so that I could install a couple of smart boards and run wiring for projectors. Now I am a bit particular when it comes to technology my cables are organized my drawers are organized and everything is inventoried so that I know where it is and what I have. 


Then comes Bob. 


I do not know if he comes in at midnight in a drunken rage and has a personal vendetta against me or if his mental capacity is limited in another form but he is a nightmare. When I came to work the next morning I immediately went to my closet to grab the well placed supplies for the day and begin work. Went I opened my small IT closet an avalanche poured from its interior. Bob needed a monitor cable and decided he had the authority to grab it out of my closet himself. It was if a tornado had entered into the room got in a fight with a flock of angry ducks and shot with a smoothbore canon.  Cables that were hanging from hooks were in giant knotted balls lying underneath brand new projectors that had computer towers thrown on top of them. Every drawer in my cabinets was left open with the contents appearing as if someone threw my grandmothers mixer on high speed inside them. 


It was chaotic, and he was still without the monitor cable. He stated he could not find it and that I should make it easier for the teachers to find the pieces that they need. I now have a master lock on my closet and a lock on all of my drawers. What boggles the mind on top of the filing cabinet was a tub with clearly marked on side monitor cables. 


But wait there is more. There is always more with Bob. God damn it I hate Bob. 


This is the story of the missing computer, and Bob’s gifting. 


I was called in one days to Bob’s classroom something was not working appropriately which is normal in a school setting  a plugin needed to be updated for the material he was using. As I walked into his classroom I was immediate struck by that feeling that something was off. I just could not put my finger on exactly what it was. Now whenever I am called into a classroom it is without fail more problems than just the initial request. So I expect to spend a good 30 minutes dealing with a variety of “small” problems. Like Bob’s headphones have stopped working so he tried to splice two headphones together so kids can sit on one computer and listen to the same lecture. But as I am sitting on a computer dealing with a broken mouse and failed Java update it finally clicks in me, one of my computers is missing. To be specific the entire setup is missing. 


I immediately grew concerned as no technology is supposed to leave the classroom that I have assigned  without my permission. Now Bob has a habit of giving things to other teachers that he thinks will help them so I assume that he has done this with the computer. When I asked Bob what had happed he informs me that the computer was not working so he gave it to a student to take home and fix. 


Holy hell the words escaped me, I wanted to cuss and raise hell about how incredibly stupid it is to send a brand new computer home to a student or even that it could be dangerous to do that but I am out of energy. Bob has beaten me. I track the student down; he had the computer going on for a week or so. When I finally got it returned the student had removed capacitors from the motherboard and opened up the hard drive and PSU. I never learned what was actually wrong with the computer, as it went straight to the trash. 
Bob will retire in two years. He is old and will hopefully die a few years after that. When it happens I will dance on his grave and decorate his tombstone with cut network cables and broken motherboards.


 May the devil see him in hell where he will be troubleshooting his own stupidity for all eternity. 


I hate Bob.

I was ripped from the blanket of joy that was my nap by the piercing screech of my cell phone's emergency ring.  On the other end was the company bookkeeper.

I retyped and it was still one dot short.  I looked at the keyboard and there was a paperclip stuck under a key keeping it from going down all the way.  With a roll of my eyes, I grabbed a pen and popped the key off, which freaked her out, and I yanked the paper clip out.  ""You can take those off?"", she asked in a state of bewilderment.  ""Nope, YOU cannot take these off, I can though.""  I then pulled up her email with no issue.

macbooknudes,149,237,1hhl3o,844,"I'm in software writing and design but usually I'm everyone's go-to for computer-related questions at work and with friends. Not too long ago I was approached by someone I know who had problem with iPhoto her 2007 MacBook with ancient OSX (she thinks I'm a wizard since I got Office 2011 installed on the same machine before).

The problem: iPhoto would instantly going into ""spinning beach ball of death"" mode whenever it was launched and cause a tremendous slowdown to the the entire system. To the point that Force Quitting the application was useless, nothing would respond and you had to hold the power button to do a manual reboot.

I took a quick peek at Finder and found the probable cause: some 90,000 photos (NINETY THOUSAND, not even an exaggeration) in the default Photos folder, including a few obvious thumbnails of nude photos of herself and/or her boyfriend towards the top of the folder (I also may have accidentally clicked and viewed several of them in larger size on the preview area when she wasn't looking, just to confirm what I was seeing). Anyway I couldn't fix her problem - and that her system was so old and clogged, she probably needed a reinstall or new computer - and advised her to take it to the Apple Store.

At the Apple Store, one of the geniuses confirmed my guess and said they couldn't fix iPhoto and her MacBook would need a reinstall. He tried selling her a 500 GB hard disk for $100+ for backing up her data, which she gladly bought despite my advice that she could get double the space for less elsewhere, 'because it's her money'.

The Genius said she could leave the machine with them overnight and that he could do the backing up for her before doing a reinstall. Knowing better than to leave a computer loaded with personal data (especially with what I saw earlier in the thumbnails) with any technician, I asked her if she was sure that she wanted to do that and subtly hinted to her backup her data onto the disk now and erase everything on the local drive before she handed it to Apple.

Now, this young lady isn't exactly known for her intelligence but reassuringly said ""it's fine"", even after I asked her ""are you SURE you don't anything important or confidential on there that you don't want anyone to see?""... to which she replied ""no of course not, I have nothing important there (in my Macbook)!""

I work for a company that produces medical devices. One of the functions of my department is defective device returns: When one of our products fails in the field, they send it back to us and we get the pleasant task of reproducing the problem. Once upon a time two of my coworkers were tasked with just such a return. They suit up and get into the lab to find a horrendous sight.

Normal protocol for packaging a return that has been used on a person is to drain it of blood, rinse it thoroughly, seal all ports, encapsulate the device in an airtight container and then put it into the box. It is immediately apparent that whoever processed this return had done absolutely none of that. The box before them is soaked in human blood.

Upon opening it up, the cause is immediately apparent. When the device, a plastic container the size of a pineapple, was identified as a problem it was pulled from the system while filled with the patient's blood. Instead of draining the device, or trying to recover any of the patient's precious bodily fluids, the guy responsible for any of this merely clamped off the incoming and outgoing tubes, looked at his work and proclaimed, ""close enough"". Please note that this is a catastrophic failure to obey not just universal protocol (which is to treat all blood as if it has Wizard AIDS) but common sense itself. Well, surprisingly, the clamps had not held in transportation and here we are with the mess that is sitting on the lab bench before our heroes.

In their paper gowns and nitrile gloves, they open the loathsome package and get right down to work. The actual issue is long since shrouded in mystery but the work proceeds normally. They arrive the next morning to find a few very serious-looking men in suits and their manager asking them to sit down for a meeting. It turns out the package they worked on yesterday came from a patient with Hepatitis C.

Hepatitis C, if you didn't know, is a nasty old illness. Not only is it incredibly lethal and easily transmissible, the virus itself can live outside of the body for up to ten days. There is a very good chance my coworkers have been exposed. So they are subjected to a hefty dose of antivirals, the facility is scrubbed down with bleach, and the company comes under investigation.

Now I wouldn't tell this story if it didn't have a happy ending. Both of my coworkers came through with clean bills of health. The Department of Transportation investigated the matter and did not penalize my company. The hospital that sent us the package is now blacklisted from using their preferred mail carrier.

PirateGloves,149,187,1po9jt,846,"So this story is from about two years ago. I had been working doing hardware support for a large company for only a few months, getting the hang of everything. Mostly my role was swapping HDDs from faulty laptops into working laptops, or replacing faulty HDDs in working laptops. Nothing terribly cerebral, but enough to keep me busy.

Our fleet at the time consisted of Lenovo R400s with the oh-so-glorious Accidental Damage Warranty. This story is about the single greatest Accidental Damage Warranty claim I have had the privilege to be a part of.

So back to me, bright eyed and chipper young techie looking forward to all the wonderful opportunities afforded by working in a large corporation (HA! Sorry, that's another story), working hard, fixing laptops, and closing tickets, when a ticket arrives in my queue from the helpdesk ominously titled ""Laptop Damage"". Detailed notes only said that the customer (not allowed to call them users, official vocab guidelines) had damaged their laptop over the weekend and needed a replacement.

No worries, thinks I, Lenovo laptop, accidental damage, swap HDD and send damaged machine to Lenovo for repair. Piece of cake. I call the customer to arrange for them to come to the workroom and they're already skirting around the cause and extent of the damage, saying they'll be in as soon as possible. Well, not 5 minutes go by and she's at my door, laptop bag over her shoulder, and a thoroughly harried expression on her face.

Now, accidental damage isn't uncommon. Usually it's just been knocked off a table or had a glass of water tipped on it.

No.

Nothing could have prepared me for what i saw when I pulled the laptop from the bag. To this day I regret not taking photos.

The right hand side of the laptop base was demolished. Keyboard shattered, optical drive hanging out, shards of plastic everywhere. The frame though... it was impressive. It's difficult to describe but the frame had been bent down so the side profile of the laptop was semi-circular. Fascinatingly enough, the screen was intact.

I stared at this thing on my desk for a few moments just taking it in, then for a few moments more considering whether or not I should even ask. Curiosity got the better of me and I just said ""This is impressive, what happened?""

Her response came quickly and with some irritation.

""I was out visiting my parents at the farm and the kids were playing with my laptop then a horse stepped on it...""

The sentence rang in my ears... *a horse stepped on it.*

What possible chain of events could take place for a horse to step on an open laptop?

At this point, I decided it was better that I didn't know, informed the user I would get them a replacement laptop. I guessed from the extent of the damage that even if the HDD wasn't completely destroyed it was at least on deaths door, so I opted to image a new laptop and transfer the data, which was the right call as the HDD died half way through the data transfer.

I think the best part was when I called Lenovo to book it in for repair. The guy on the line asked what was damaged so I said ""Base cover, chassis, optical drive, keyboard, palmrest, top bezel, HDD, and mainboard""

He was silent for a moment and finally said, ""What happened?""

""A horse stepped on it.""

Another moments silence then an uproar of laughter as the guy completely lost all sense of decorum when faced with the absurdity of it.

He informs the lady she needs power before everything comes back up. So he tells her to go turn power back on..as he's on the phone waiting he hears her mention to another employee they had a fire this morning. The tech being a local fire fighter asks her if the power was off because of the fire. Her response "" yeah the fire Marshall turned it off because of an electrical fire in the breaker box"" he proceeds to stand up and yell at her until everybody is looking at him and managers come out to see what was going on..

lwdoran,71,231,1gio7z,844,"A short, but sweet tell of my adorable wife...

Flash back a couple of years ago.  I come home after a long day at work to find my wife sitting on the sofa reading with the TV off.  Though the act was not odd, it was for my wife; she unwinds at the end of the day with the TV, much in the same way as I unwind with Reddit...

So I ask, ""Why is the TV off?""  
Wife:""I accidentally sat on the remote and it started speaking Spanish.  I didn't understand it, so I turned it off.""
Me: ""You probably just changed it to a Spanish station. Did you change the channel?""
Wife: ""Pffft. Of course I did.  That was in Spanish too.""

At this point, I figure her rump had magically enabled SAP on the TV, so I turn the TV on and prepare to inverse-rump the audio.  When the sound comes up, sure enough, it IS in Spanish; of course, I would expect that from Univision.

It turns out that she butt dialed the TV into the middle of the 3 or 4 Spanish language channels provided by our cable operator.  And she was only using the channel up/down buttons to fix the problem.

I change the TV to ABC, kiss her forehead, open the laptop and begin to unwind...","De nada, mi amor.",1075

One of my residential clients has a slowly progressive form of dementia, with the attendant memory loss. Change in any form is disorienting and upsetting to him, so for many years at his wife's direction I have faithfully kept his computer environment exactly the same.

Compuserv dial-up, Office 2000, XP with classic interface, small-format square monitor, etc. He can check his email, read a headline, and is happy doing so. He is not going to learn anything new, because he cannot. Needless to say, I am not upgrading him to Windows 8. I hope Compuserv sticks around a few more years.

Me:  I'm not sure who it is that set the policy, but I'll be happy to help you if you're having trouble with your password.

User:  No, I'm not having trouble, I think it's funny watching the Attending across the hall struggle to invent a new password that the network will take.  Since I'm having so much fun I thought I'd send the person in charge of the policy a bottle of scotch.

Me:  (Suspicious) Is this your computer?

User:  Of course, and now that I've been recorded saying that, you have no reason to worry about it coming back on you.

Me:  Is it a hospital owned computer?

User:  Maybe, which would make you happier?

Me:  If it's a hospital owned computer, you enter your credentials and then log in normally, so long as it's on the network it should verify who you are and let you in.  If it's not a hospital owned computer, then I'm not allowed to help you with it since we don't want to risk damaging a PC we're not responsible for.

User:  Oh don't be such a wuss.  Fine, I found a laptop in the park, I just want to log into it to see whose it is so I can give it to them.

User:  I can tell, there's no point in denying it, I've talked to almost everyone at the help desk, I think there's only one person there who'd pass a drug screen.  I have a patient refusing chemo because she can't stand the sickness, so I need to make her some of my special brownies.

**Background**:  I am not nearly as smart as most of you, I never went to college, just took some begininer (PC Repair &amp; Networking) classes at a tech school, and then studied certifications on my own.  2 weeks ago I was promoted from a temp position to a full-time IT position, in a company with no in-house IT department.  I've never had an official fix-it job, I freelance when unemployed, and have always been the resident my-mouse-is-possessed-help-me go-to, so this is a huge step for me.  Our company has been RAPIDLY growing and expanding over the past year, so much that no one can keep up, and they can't hire people fast enough.  We have almost a dozen separate IT firms contracted, each one for something different.  One for email, one for helpdesk, one for internet, one for voip, one for each piece of proprietary software, etc.  Shit's crazy.  They have discovered about 3 years too late, that this isn't going to work, and we need our own IT.  Enter me.  I am starting out by supporting our brand-new, custom-made software that goes out to our facilities.

I always assumed it was just ignorance, not pure stupidity.  That all people needed was a chance to learn, and they'd eventually be okay on their own.  *Stop laughing at me.*  So here, are couple from these last two weeks that completely blew my mind.

Lady: ""I open the thingy, click my name, and click the login button.  It's giving me some error.""

Me:   ""Did you type in your password?""

Lady: ""What's a password?""


Now the best part of this: The very first time you attempt to login to this software, it forces you to choose a password.  You cannot ever use this software without personally setting up a password.  I look into her user profile, and it's (I swear I'm telling the truth) ""suckdick12345.""  So, 1.) she has obviously logged in before, and 2.) I am not allowed to do password resets (IDKwhy), I have to tell them their password over the phone.  Ugh.


**Another lady calls in.  The billing reports are all screwed up.  I find out that she can see the future, and is effectively discharging patients before they've received any treatment.  I don't know how this works in her head, because the patients don't leave until they're ready to leave, so.. uhhh.  Anyway, I tell her this, and she says:**

Lady: ""But I like my way.""

Me:   ""I understand, but this is how the system works.  Wouldn't it be much easier to do it right the first time, instead of having to go back in multiple times every day to edit the patient?""

Lady: ""No, because I'm right.  Also, I don't like the color of the software, can you make it pink?  I think if it was pink people would be much happier at work.  And add a link to Facebook so I can check my friends when I'm bored.""

Me: ""Alright, do you get any kind of error message?""

Customer: ""Yes, I get the no such number tone from the modem, and 'the remote host did not answer' on the computer.

I own a local IT Shop in a small town of about 11-12K people.  I am the only established shop in town with a storefront.  We service both residential and businesses for IT issues with PC's, Networks, Smart Devices, ETC.  If you want to utilize a competitor, you have to call someone in a neighboring town which is about 25-30 miles away and most likely will charge you an additional fee for travel time.  My company charges only the hourly rate with a minimum of one hour starting at the time we arrive on-site.

My tale begins today with a business customer's office manager who I'll call Phyllis Lou (PL) who is trying to cut the cost of our services as she see's fit.  (IE: On December 22nd, you came out and did work and it only took forty-five minutes.  Why do we have to pay for an entire hour?)  Two things to note:

1.  This customer has a special discounted rate of $45.00 an hour since they have been a customer since we started the company.  Our regular business rate is about $30 more per hour.

2.  My personal home is about 1/2 a mile away from the client-site, my office is about half an hour across town.

I receive a call from Phyllis Lou at about 12:30 p.m. today because her computer won't start up.  She wants to know if we can come take a look at it.  I remind her of the minimum one hour charge and she agrees to come have me look at it.

I travel the half-hour trip to her office and find her PC running with no video.  I check the monitor and the power indicator light is not showing.  I press the power button and presto the monitor comes to life and her desktop appears.  The following conversation ensues:


ME: ""Do you have anything else for me to look at while I am out here?""


PL: ""We're not paying you for that, you didn't fix anything.  You just pressed a button.  I could have done that!""


ME: ""Phyllis, you called me.  You could not figure out what was wrong with your computer.  I am running a business, just like you are.  You requested my services, I provided the service.""


PL: ""Well, I don't think I should have to pay an entire hour.  I will pay you for the one minute you were here today and that it took to fix my problem.  If you want my business, you'll treat us fairly.  If not, I'll call Max Freelance.  He will only charge us $40.00 per hour!""


(Max Freelance is a guy that does PC Repair out of his home in his spare time.  He also works day shift at a factory from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. Monday through Friday in a neighboring town about 45 minutes away.  This is not a viable threat, because their offices close at 5:00 p.m. and she would have to wait around for him.)


Me: ""Do you think that Max Freelance would charge you less than a dollar for his time?  Plus you are going to have to wait for him to get off work.  Is the extra hour and a half of your time actually worth the $5.00 you would be saving?  Now if you have anything else that you need me to look at, I'll be happy to look at it for you.""


PL: ""Well, you were on your way home anyway.  I don't know why it should be counted as service call since it was on your way home anyway?


Me: ""Phyllis, it is 1:00 p.m.  My shop is open until 6:00 p.m., I will be returning to the shop after this service call.  I explained to you on the phone that it would be a one hour minimum charge for me to come out here.  Now if you have anything that needs my attention, I will include it in your one hour rate charge.""


PL: ""You might as well leave.  You can bill whatever you like, that doesn't mean we are going to pay it!""


I leave, and will be billing them an hour as per our agreement on the phone.  If they don't pay it, no more service.  In this case, I would consider a win.

PKLKickballer,144,203,18drcf,834,"I once worked as the sole tech support person in an academic department.  My job involved desktop support, as well as maintaining a file server.  The job was always a bad match... I didn't like them and they didn't like me.  I did a good job though while I was there, but finally jumped at the offer of a job elsewhere.

While working in this department, my most difficult user, Stacy, was the department secretary. She was a big fan of downloading every piece of junkware she could find and slowing her computer to a crawl.  Worse still was that she managed to integrate whatever utility the software enticed her with into her work flow, so removing it meant re-training her on the right way to do things.  I wasn't allowed to lock down her computer, as she might find that demeaning... this was the official policy from our mutual supervisor.  It was bad enough that I kept an identical computer ready to go, and would just transfer her files to it when her computer became unusable, then re-image the ruined one and keep it ready to repeat the process.  Suffice to say, Stacy was not a friend to computers.

This is not my tale, though.  Upon getting a job offer elsewhere,I spent my last weeks ensuring that there was foolproof documentation for everything.  Disks were organized, passwords and serial numbers were listed, processes were detailed... they were left in a state where most small problems could be dealt with until they hired someone to replace me.  I even gave them my phone number at the new job, just in case they needed help finding a piece of info, or a tip on an easy repair.  This was my mistake.

Stacy was designated to fill in for me while I was gone.  As bad as that might have been, she actually stepped up to the challenge fairly well.  I got calls, but they were usually of a nature of looking for a piece of software or needing contact info for someone.  I had no problem giving them a few minutes of time here and there.  It was going well.

After a couple of weeks though, she called with a much more serious issue... the server had crashed and wouldn't restart.  Crap... they have a lot of important stuff saved there.  After a few questions I determined that the drive array was dead. I don't know exactly what was wrong, but it just wasn't detecting a disk.

Stacy asked how to fix it, and I told her right off she probably wouldn't be able to.  I said they would need an IT professional to properly diagnose and repair this.  Not to be dissuaded, she tried framing the question multiple ways.  She tried reminding me how important the data was.  She proposed her ideas for solutions, such as asking how she could restore from the tape to make it work.  I just kept explaining that until there was a working drive array, none of that would be possible.  I'd end calls and get another an hour later.  This went on for days.  She'd call and ask if I could walk her through fixing a drive array over the phone.

This was no longer a simple matter of filling in the blanks with a two minute phone call.  I finally had to tell her that if they hadn't managed to hire a new IT guy, then they would have to bring in a repair service, and there was no way she was going to be able to handle this repair alone.  The calls kept coming, though, from poor Stacy who wanted to be walked through recovery from a catastrophic server failure.  I finally just had to ignore all outside calls until she stopped.

lbruiser,148,154,10tmbg,829,"TL:DR I helped a customer whose ISP was screwing them. They gave me a gift to thank me.

Little back story. I work in a small IT shop. We handle both small/medium businesses and home users. I mainly work on businesses but some days I take care of home users if we get backed up some.

So I get a job working for a family where the husband is clueless about computer and the wife knows enough to read the instruction and install their router. One problem though, it doesn't let them connect to the Internet. So wife (actually a smart user) contacts the ISP. Unfortunately this ISP has no competition in this area so they can get away with anything they want. ISP has kinda a name for themselves for poor support. After a few days of wife working with ISP, she gets to the point of crying. She has been paying for two months for Internet without ever getting on (someone had open WiFi in neighborhood). This is where I come to play.

I get the call and end up going to their house. They live about an hour away from my shop. Not a big problem for me. I get there and find wife setup router correctly. So I start looking at its configuration. Router not getting external IP. So I go through the usual diagnostics and find we are not getting external IP. A call to the ISP later get a scheduled technician out there next day. Note, ISP tried to 'confuse' me with techno babel. I stopped him in mid B.S. and explained what I did. He quickly realized I did this for a living and not a user that he could shift the blame around with. I leave site giving my cell (nice people) telling them to have ISP onsite tech call me when he shows up. Was there past my working hours, decided not to charge extra because they were really cool and offered to feed me dinner.

Next day I get the call. Tech guy says everything is working now, and he doesn't see a problem. My money is on they found a problem with the account and fixed it before tech went out. I have my user double check everything. I then instruct user to connect router. They are now working. He thanks me up and down.

I go on about my business just happy I was able to get them going.

Friday rolls around (last week) and the husband comes in. ""Oh shit"" I thought to myself. Something isn't working. I mentally start going though all the possible problems. He start telling me how happy he was with my work, and how his wife is finally not angry/crying over this, and now everything just ""works.""

Background: Small two person IT support team that does everything from Tier 1 to Tier N+1, including SysAdmin duties for a SMB. 

One of our remote users calls up and reports that her laptop is running slow and has been getting slower for a few days now, ever since it fell off her desk. 

And now you're thinking ""Wait, your user told you she dropped her laptop? You didn't have to drag it out of her?!?"" Yup! I meant it when I said my users are awesome.

""OK!"" says I, ""odds are the drop damaged your hard drive and the drive has been degrading since, which is why it's been getting slower over time. Is there any other damage that you can see, like a cracked case or screen?"" 

No other damage, so I write up the ticket and promise to overnight a replacement. We change her password to a newly generated PW that we both know (laptop must be joined to AD and have AD user cached before going to remote location.) 

""OK, we're all set. I'll have the replacement laptop to FedEx by the end of the day. There will be a return label in the box. Save the box and use the return label to ship the failed laptop back to HQ, any questions?"" 

As promised, I get the replacement shipped before the end of day, in time to make first AM delivery even. Not bad. The next morning I get a call from the user...

""I logged in and all my files and settings are here!!! You even have the picture of my dog as the wall paper! Thank you so much I thought I would be starting over and would get nothing done today! I'll get the old laptop shipped to you today. You guys are awesome, IT at my last job was awful."" 

Aww yeah, having spare equipment and proper endpoint backup (CrashPlan PROe) rocks. Thank you VP of IT for approving the budget. 

So a couple days pass and I get a delivery. A little soon for the bad laptop since return shipping was the cheapest FedEx Ground option and we're not expecting anything else. 

Waiting for me at the front desk is an Edible Arrangement with a thank you note from the user. I was on PTO when this user started and never met her face to face, but she went out of her way and paid her own $ to send a delicious fruit arrangement. 

A few days later the failed laptop arrives. No visible damage, pop in the Lenovo diagnostic DVD and the laptop promptly fails every hard drive test. 

TL;DR: Awesome user sends Edible Arrangement as thank you for great IT service. My users are awesome!

insanemime,203,201,184z3k,831,"I work for a university as their computer lab manager and I have recently been updating some small dorm labs around campus.

A little backstory:

I am lucky enough in my job that I have a very loose dress code, so I do not have to wear a button up shirt and tie or even business casual. Most days I wear jeans, a t-shirt, and possibly a hoodie if it is cold. What I am getting at here is that I look like a student or some other random person. I have no id badge or anything identifying me as a staff member unless I show my staff ID in my wallet. My ensemble for today consists of a pair of jeans and a monty python themed killer bunny shirt.

So I arrive at the next dorm that I am to do updates to and find that it is one of the few buildings on campus that does not have a card swipe access. The attendant inside sees me try to open the locked door and proceeds to let me in with just a ""hello"". So I then proceed over to the eight computer stations and begin my work.

One of the stations had been tampered with and was wanting a bios password before it would boot up, so I disconnected the CPU and opened the case (piggy back mini tower Dell 745) to find that the password reset jumper is under the hard drive cradle which has to be removed with a phillips head screwdriver. Since there is typically another department that deals with hardware issues I do not carry a screwdriver with me at all times.

So while I am dismantling this computer, the dorm attendant is walking around doing random things. She sees what I am doing to the computer but says nothing. I then ask her if she has a phillips head screwdriver. She digs around and finally finds one and I proceed to take the plate off as she walks off to do something else.

So I end up finishing the lab update and I decide to say something to this woman who is supposed to be watching over stuff and is obviously not a student worker. First I tell her how the login has changed (moved the units to AD). Then I say:

**Me**: Not trying to get on to you, but you really need to be questioning anyone who is obviously taking computers apart...especially if they ask you for a screwdriver to do so.

**Her**: Oh...yeah I was watching what you were doin'. You probably saw that I was starin' at you (I didn't). But I saw your ID card so I didn't say anything.

**Me**: (looking puzzled) But...I don't have an ID card.

She proceeds to point at a lanyard that I have hanging out of my pocket that I use for my keys. I then have to explain what a lanyard is, that a lot of people use them, and they are not an indication that the person is with the university or the computing center.

One of our responsibilities is to lodge faults with contracted technicians for faults such as no sync or PPP failure; whereupon the company contracted will dispatch a technician to the exchange, and then usually to the customers premises.

I spent fourty minutes on the phone with an absolutely unreasonably furious Indian bloke, who was tearing shit out of me purely because I was female and he was 'sure there must be a man who could help him'. I told him that I was equally as qualified, and that I could confirm his issue was a misjumpered port, and that a technician would be dispatched to the exchange and then to the house. I advised him that the technician would most likely attempt to contact him before visiting the premises to give notice.

Finally I got rid of him.

Two days later I get a call back from him, please note his accent was awfully strong which, in the heat of the moment, infuriated me even more so. 

Me: Hi you're speaking with Chloe, how can I help you today?
Him: Hello. It is Mohammed. From 73 Example Avenue.
Me: [OH. DEAR. GOD. NO.] Oh hello Mohammed, how are you? Did your fault get resolved as per my booking on Tuesday?
Him: NO. It did not! The technician arrived at my house. And did not call me! He turned up, and did not call me I tell you!
Me: Oh I am very sorry to hear that sir, I understand that they do sometimes visit the premises whilst in the area and are not always supplied with all contact information if they are doing a dropby; I do apologise for the inconvenience.
Him: He turned up on my property! He did not call me! This is bloody illegal I tell you! (please apply thick Indian accent for effect). 
Me: I do understand how you feel, however you agreed to the technician as he needed to visit the premises to resolve the fault. 
Him: (this is when he started yelling) HE CAME TO MY HOUSE. YOU HAVE BROKEN THE BLOODY LAW. I WILL CALL THE POLICE.

Me: No. Sorry sir but you are wrong. I advised you of the technician, and you agreed. They are contracted out so you will have to lodge a complaint through them.
Him: NO IT IS YOUR FAULT-
Me: YOU ARE AN IDIOT. AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE.

Me: STOP TALKING. YOU CAN. NOT. ARREST. ME. I DID NOTHING WRONG. YOU ARE THE REASON WE HATE OUR JOBS. YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE INTERNET, AND YOU SHOULD NOT OWN A COMPUTER.

I work at a small company as a programmer, and am often called upon as impromptu tech support. Now, as a little background, the CEO of the company, is an older gentleman who used to be a programmer (punch card era). He is rather tech savvy, and often 'experiments' with his machine, leading to... interesting results.

A few years ago, I set his machine up with voice recognition, because it was faster for him than typing, taught him how to use it and all that. He never used it, to my knowledge. Fast forward a few years and I get called in to his office. Him, the president and the head of IT are there, all looking a tad worried. The CEO informs me that his machine is typing by itself, and that this means someone must have taken over his computer.

I look over, and to my surprise, an excel spreadsheet is open, and various fields are being filled, emails being opened, etc. The president asks if perhaps the CEO's daughter might have logged in remotely somehow to do some work, and as if to confirm the suspicion, I notice her name being filled out in one of the field on the spreadsheet.

I call the daughter in question, and she informs me she is in fact NOT logged in. This is when I notice some of the words being typed. More specifically the fact that they match what I was saying. Turns out voice recognition got turned on somehow, and the computer was happily listening to the whole meeting, writing down what was being said, and interpreting things as commands.

Needless to say, I disabled the feature, and rolled back the changes to the spreadsheet. Strangest issue I have ever had.

Me: OK step one is to click down here and connect to your wireless.

Her: But I don't have internet at home!

kc7wbq,217,231,11coj6,828,"A little background:
I work at a company that employes about 40 ""programmers"". Some of the programmers really are programmers, with degrees and/or industry experience. But many times someone who has worked for the company for a long time (for example a project manager) will decided that programming looks easier and pays more. Management moves them on over to programming and gives them a raise. 

I work on a team that develops tools specific to our industry and company. Every couple of months we offer a few days of hands on training to anybody who wants to learn or brush up on the tools we offer. 

Let me tell you about 3 (out of 6) of the people we had in our last training.


1. New to the company, but has been a programmer for many many years (or so I assume he said in his interview). He's trying to follow along but keeps falling behind. I go sit with him to help him catch up and start to see the problem. Let me just sum it up with this example: *He didn't know how to cut and paste.* I swear to god he didn't know how to cut and paste.   

2. This woman has been with the company for over 20 years. One day she has a question and comes over to my laptop and asks me to look at something for her. I pull it up and she says ""No, pull it up in Notepad++"" (our standard editor). ""This is Notepad++..."" I say confused. ""Pull it up in the one we normally use, the white one."" Oh, now I get it. I was using the Deep Black theme. Because I wasn't using the default (white) theme I wasn't ""programming"". 

3. This one has been with the company around 30 years. Long time project manager, wants to see what programming is like. Shows up the first day with out her laptop. She says she'll follow along and catch up tomorrow. The next day she shows up and wants me to spend the day helping her catch up instead of teaching the class. I have someone else start teaching and sit with her. I say ""Okay, log into [the Unix box]."" ""How do I do that?"" ""You do have an account on the [Unix box], right?"" ""Oh yes, right here."" Long story short, she's trying to use her Windows laptop user name and password to log into Unix. Not something I'd demand a project manager to understand (they should, it's part of the business), but something pretty crucial to an aspiring programmer.  

Okay, so here's the kicker. They all make more money than I do, a significant amount more. Because they are ""so experienced"" they are making anywhere from 10% to 25% more than I am. 

Thank you for giving me a place to rant. 


**Edit**: Some clarification - **A project manager is not a manager of people, they manage projects**. They do things like work with the client and programmer to nail down a time line. I work in a manufacturing industry, so they are also responsible to make sure supplies are ordered and available in the warehouse at the time their project is ready to hit the production floor.

I informed her that it was super slow, to the point where checking email and browsing to Google were *painful*. She asked me to hold while she checked on something. When she came back, she informed me that they are 90% to their bandwidth limit, and so they're being throttled.

An employee has been complaining for a while that his laptop has been crashing, every time he uses anything 'heavy'. On elaboration, we determine that even though we can hear the fan spin up,  it's a CPU overheating issue and decided to monitor the laptop in our work area until it crashes. After spritzing out the fan intake/out guards with canned air, we leave it for a day with it in our plain view, while running Prime95 for CPU stress tests. Laptop never crashes. So we give it back to him stating we can't see why it's crashing, but with a note to bring it back as soon as the crash happens, so we can try to glean some dump info off it.


About an hour goes by and he returns saying 'it happened again'. Mind baffling that in one hour he was able to reproduce the overheat/crash that we where not able to in a full day. Anyway, I go to take another look at it, and decide to take the palmrest/base apart in order to clean out the fan, and re-apply some thermal paste. 


 **This is where ~~shit~~ gets nutty.**


After about 45 min of work, I finally get to the fan on this laptop (a model where you have to remove the entire MB to get it). I see little bits of plastic under the fan, and was thinking 'huh, something got broke off into it, maybe it can't spin'. On a closer inspection I notice that all the pieces of plastic are black, and uniform in shape. I take out the fan assembly, and there right beneath it is every single fan blade broken off the central hub.... The fan spins the hub, but **no blades are on it!** I look at the metal guard on the heatsink and see it is bent in nearly the exact width of a small screwdriver diameter. He stuck a screwdriver into the fan guards and broke every single fan blade off of it. As if this was not enough, the reason the CPU didn't overheat during our tests is because we had the laptop in a normal room temp range. Derp employee had his laptop in his office, three inches from a desk heater on high.

A backup of their entire account is made every night, and we keep one of those backups as well for up to a week, and another for up to a month, so at any given time they have 3 potentially different snapshots of their data that they can download, and that we can also restore from. Totally free. Whenever I get a call about restoring something from a backup because something broke, I make sure to point out this tool and say USE THIS SHIZ, YOU WILL THANK ME SOMEDAY. Because I work with probably 10 people every week that think that ""once it's on the internet, it's on the internet forever"" actually applies for paid hosting services. Nah, bro - you stop paying for storage space, we stop storing your crap.

Think of it like renting an apartment in a busy college town. Rent is cheap and everything is great. And then think about what happens when you go on a backpacking trip to Europe for 6 months and don't pay your rent. Your landlord probably hauled all of your stuff out so someone else can move in and actually pay rent. Your stuff is long gone, and there is not a thing that your landlord can or will do about it. Yelling at them that those were YOUR belongings and the landlord had NO RIGHT to get rid of them is kind of silly, because it's actually the landlord's property and when you stop paying the rent on it, if you didn't care about your stuff enough to take it to a storage unit or drop it off at your parents house, as far as the landlord knows, you just don't care about your stuff. It's abandoned. If you wanted it, you would have moved it somewhere safe, and that landlord probably has no sympathy for your stupidity either.

But alas, I stumble across this ticket. It has gone back and forth a few times and I've had the honor of talking to this guy.

**Customer:** Hello, I need you to send me all of the emails from my email account from January 2011 to January 2013.

I check his account. What does it say?

    ""This account was deleted on 02/16/2013 at 12:59:05pm""

    02/16/13 12:59pm - - - - - Automatic Note - - - - - DELETED!

**Me:** I'm sorry, but it looks like your account was deleted in February. My notes show that you contacted our Billing department, requested to cancel, and completed the cancellation form. The cancellation form states ""I agree that I have backed up any important files, and that once I cancel my account, these files will be deleted from my account."" You did that on 2/15/2013. We no longer have any data on your account that we could restore.

**Customer:** WHAT?!?!?!?!?! The last time I contacted you, you said you have these backups:

&gt;Daily Backup (February 10, 2013)

&gt;Weekly Backup (February 6, 2013)

&gt;Monthly Backup (January 14, 2013)

Those files should definitely be able to be restored! Restore them IMMEDIATELY or send me a copy of the backup!

**Me:** I'm sorry, but we do not have any files in your account - backups included. We are not a free storage service. You agreed in the cancellation email that all of your data was not only backed up but that you knew we would delete it. We don't have enough storage space to keep backups for people who are no longer paying for data storage - and if you'll see our terms of service at http://our-company-site.com/terms we also state that our backups are a courtesy service. That service is limited only to paying customers. You have not been a paying customer for almost 9 months now. We do not have any data to restore for you, and those backups are long gone.

**Customer:** YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! I AM BEING SUED AND THESE EMAILS ARE BEING SUBPOENA'D AS EVIDENCE! YOU ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THEM!

**Me:** Actually, we aren't legally required to store anything for people who are not  paying for service, and you are the one who is being subpoenad for files you didn't back up. There is nothing we can do to help you. You agreed that you had a copy of your files and you agreed that you understood your entire account was being deleted when you canceled, that means backups too. We can't help you.

**Customer:** YOU GUYS ARE IMBECILES! What a f-cking joke! You are a storage service and I know you have backups! Just send it to me! 

**Me:** I'm sorry sir but [I simply have to disagree with that.](http://i.imgur.com/mFEpWWK.gif) We only store data for people who pay for that service. We have backups for paying customers ONLY. Which you are not. Furthermore, even if you WERE a paying customer, our backups would only be daily, weekly and monthly, so even if you paid the bill today, files that were deleted 9 months ago would be gone. You haven't been paying for the storage space, so we haven't been storing anything.

**Customer:** This is the WORST customer service I have ever seen!!!!! I can't believe the nerve.... how dare you delete those files, they were my files! 

**Me:** If those files were important to you, you should have used our Backup tool to download a copy of those files to your own hard drive, or your own data storage account with another service. You're right. They were your files. So why don't you have them? They're not our files to keep if you're not paying for the space to store them.

**Customer:** Ok... I'm sorry... please... just please restore the backup... I know you have it. If I paid for my account again would you be able to restore it? I am desperate, these files could save me thousands of dollars in this lawsuit.... please....

**Me:** Even if you did pay for your account again, it would be an empty account. The only way that there would be data in it is if you had downloaded your own backup and used our tool to restore that backup to the server. We have nothing to restore for you, regardless of if you are a paying customer right now or not. That data has been gone since February. 

**Customer:** Wow... just wow. I can't believe you won't restore my files. I guess it's time to post this email history on forums everywhere so people can know what a horrible company you are... you guys are demons.................... f-ck you dude...! F-CK YOU!

**Me:** Yes, please go post on the forums so people understand how important it is to download a free backup through their account with us, we would be delighted to see other people learn from your misfortunes and use this free backup tool to make copies of their important files. Have a great day, and good luck with your lawsuit. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**So, folks, I hope you learned his lesson: If something is super important to you, have multiple copies of it.**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR When you say ""deleted"" you must actually mean ""if I act like a total fool and call you an imbecile, the files will magically reappear"" ........right?",Not even lawsuits can restore files that were deleted 9 months ago. Much to this ex-customer's dismay.,1029
kvidmar,105,268,1202s5,817,"Hello /r/talesfromtechsupport,

Stumbled across this sub the other day and it made me think back a few years to my tech support days.  I was doing helpdesk support for a GOVT agency in D.C, the end users were ridiculous and had a trigger finger to call the support line.

I had calls for broken coffee machines, AC units, ""Need more Printer Paper"" but I remember one call in particular.  This woman was a VIP, amazing how the VIPs suck more than most with computer skills.

--------------
VIP: I have a huge report due in 10 minutes and my computer just powered off! I didn't save any of my work!

Myself: Well I am sorry to hear that, what exactly happened prior to the computer shutting down.

VIP: IT JUST WENT BLACK, send someone to fix it now.

Myself: Alright one second..
(... sure lets just do no troubleshooting for your time sensitive project that I may be able to fix in 10 seconds.  Lets just send someone....some people.  I look up the users location because VIPs get w.e the fuark they want.  *FACEPALLLLLM* She is in a remote office nearest desktop tech is 40 minutes away. GREAT.)
Myself: Unfortunately the tech wont make it out for 40 minutes.

VIP: NO i need someone to fix it now.

Myself: Well, you are in a remote office, unforunately we don't keep anyone there because that office is generally empty.

VIP: This is unacceptable..

Myself: Look let's just go through some troubleshooting steps real quick.  First, can you turn down your music real quick so we can run through some steps. (she had some soul music in the background made it hard to concentrate.)

VIP: I can't my pandora crashed when my computer turned off.

Myself: (Interesting... pandora still running while computer is off.  Magic pandora.) What color is the monitor showing on the LED in the bottom right corner.

VIP: ORANGE, why does that matter?

Myself: Can you look under the desk real quick and tell me if the computer is on... you should see a green light on the power button..

VIP: yes it is green 

AHHHHHH she must have just unplugged the VGA/dvi or bumped it or something...
I spent 5 minutes trying to convince her the computer wouldn't eat her alive if she just went to the back and plugged the wire behind the monitor.  She finally worked up the courage and of BAM the computer turns on!

VIP: WOW MY COMPUTER REBOOTED SO FAST AND MY WORK IS HERE.

...rebooted fast... whaaaaa okay I will just let her think that... I give up.

Myself: Yeah they are fast... Have a good day.

The worst part was that now the VIP had me on speed dial... every day with her powerpoint questions, my font is too small BLAH BLAH BLAH... ugh at least those days are behind me.

It all ends with this chapter. It’s been heartwarming reading all your comments, and well; I hope to see them here again. 
* * *

I was staring at the screen for what have been minutes. I was looking at an FTP server software package. It was one of the FTP-programs that we sold actually. I opened it and was met with the default screen. I knew how the program worked and re-opened the previous session. It gave me a directory with thousands upon thousands of files. You could not know what the files were from the names. 

There were many pictures, videos and RAR files scattered around, judging from the extensions. I didn’t know what to do. Do I want to know? Can I now? Should I know? What if it is nothing? I did not feel well and my legs had become rather heavy. I grabbed a chair to sit down. I stared at the files once again; I decided that they could not have expected privacy here. When Ron still worked at my school he had always copied my schedule, even adjusted it to suit his purpose and I never felt that my personal folder or school records stored on the school network were safe from his prying eyes. He has said some things in the past that he could only know from reading my school record. 

My throat felt like it was being chocked when I opened the first image on the list. It was a picture of a full nude woman having sex with a man - it looked like it was taken by the couple themselves. Like most of the porn that I’ve seen in this store I wasn’t particularly excited to see it. I looked at another 12 or so pictures, randomly sampled from the first 100 items I could see. It were more pictures like these, but with different people. I wanted to stop before I hit on one featuring Ron or Don. Or both.

He probably ran some back alley porn website for people with rather poor taste. Questionable yes. Illegal? No. I was calmed down by now and felt easier, when I saw a 13th image was still loading. The download seemed stalled because of connection issues but when I tried to cancel it it suddenly loaded and opened. It was a picture of a kid. A cute girl I have to say.

It was strange to see a picture of a kid among all this pornography. I downloaded the next few images that were on the list to see what was going on. As they started opening one by one on the screen my entire body went in shock. I quickly tried to turn off the monitor and by doing that even knocked it over. What was displayed on that screen was gruesome to see. Everything I did not want to see that kid do was there on those pictures.

I went into what I will still call shock. I didn’t really respond to anything for a few minutes. I was just sitting there, watching the screen that had fallen over. I did not want to know how much more was on there. That was the only thing going through my head. How much more was there? Did Ron did this? Did they touch that kid? Was this part of a whole network? How long was this going on? Who knew about this?

I must have tried calming myself down for over 15 minutes before trying to walk over to Jeremy to tell him all about this, whenever I closed my eyes the pictures were still visible to me. I did not get very far, sitting back on the chair again .

It wasn’t until I saw a figure come in that I freaked; The cage was open, the papers were scattered on the ground and the monitor was knocked over. I looked up and was happy it was Jeremy. Jeremy wasn’t so happy seeing me in this state. He kneeled down be me to ask me what was wrong. I didn’t say much. He would be back in a minute, he closed the store door and got me some water.

It took him some time to get me talking and after I told him he was the one that didn’t say anything for a while. He sat with me for a while before he walked over to the computer and put the monitor to its feet again. He didn’t doubt me. He just needed to know if it was just those photo’s or if there was more. Even accusing Ron &amp;amp; Don with something horrible as this was something they didn’t deserve if they didn’t do it. He walked back to me and said “We are going to the police, there are thousands”. He acted strong for me but I knew full well that this was getting to him as well.

We walked to the police station as it was only 10 minutes away. When we stood by the counter an agent started talking with us. Jeremy did the word as he seemed to still be able to make himself sound intelligible. The agent took us seriously and walked us to the back to one of the offices in the building. He gave us something to drink while we waited. Cheap disgusting office coffee, I can still taste it in my mouth. It was my first coffee and my last.

After 15 minutes another agent came in with a woman who introduced herself as a detective. She would be taking our story as the accusation was something they took very seriously. I snapped “It’s not an accusation! I saw it with my own eyes”. She understood my anger and took the time to calm me down and explain everything. We had been at the police station for over 2 hours when my parents were called to pick me and Jeremy up.

The police seized all the computers and hard disks in the store the next morning and Ron &amp;amp; Don were arrested. From what I heard Ron was going mental when he was arrested. Don was going silently. 

* * *

I obviously had quit this job by now, and so had Jeremy. In the days and weeks after we were being interviewed by about six detectives about the store, Ron &amp;amp; Don, and what happened that night. I was still underage at that moment and needed to have one of my parents with me. I had kept so much about the store from them, for better or for worse. I told everything. My father visibly was breaking apart from all of it. He would’ve made me quit before I had even started if I had told him everything.

Frank &amp;amp; Richard were also questioned by the police and from talking with them later were for the first time in their life silent for more than a minute. Even they had not suspected anything and were genuinely concerned about me and Jeremy. The interviews with the police were really heavy on Sarah who only found out when the police came to the front door. She was just starting to get her life together. Johan and Marcel were questioned as well from what I heard, but wether they had anything to tell, I don’t know.

The store was sealed off after Ron &amp;amp; Don were arrested. Weeks had gone by and I hadn’t seen or heard anything from them. They were still in custody. `When I walked with Jeremy past the store it had been boarded up. Last year after being empty for years it was demolished to make place for a new housing project.

It took months before the trial against Ron &amp;amp; Don started and the police stayed quiet about any progress they had been making in the meantime. Jeremy seemed to have recovered quite well from all this, probably because he wasn’t the one that discovered it. He knew what he was going to see and was mentally prepared. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it does not. I don’t know.

For me it was something that kept me up at nights. I went into therapy for this. My view before all this was that therapy is for the crazy people that couldn’t deal with the world. I was hesitant to go and be labeled as a crazy person. Nothing was further from the truth. I was processing everything that happened and was finally letting go.

When I went to the trial it was the first time in months that I saw  Ron and Don. By now I was done with school and  trying to enjoy my summer vacation before starting at my new school. Ron &amp;amp; Don looked different. They had lost a lot of weight and looked tired. They had on suits which was a strange sight. Ron looked at me with an intense hate in his eyes. He blamed everything on me I suppose. Don didn’t look at me. He looked like a broken man, I started to feel that he had nothing to do with it. He wasn’t the noblest of men but this went too far to make a profit, even he had standards.

At the trial I learned that Ron had been hosting the FTP-server with the content since the late 90s. Around that time the store was doing rather bad and he needed money. One of the people he knew had hired him to set up the site that was still being used. He was a facilitator, not a producer.

None of the content of the site was original content according to Ron’s lawyer. Nor had Ron ever created or looked at any of the content. I was happy when the prosecution did not challenge this fact. It meant that it was probably true. According to the lawyer Ron had simply rented the computer out to the third man that was on trial as well. I didn’t know him, I did not want too. 

When it came to the users of the server; there were a few dozen of users. Every user is of course one to many, but there was little to no money to be earned from it. Ron and the 3th man netted about a few thousand a year. Not something you would risk everything for. But they did.

 I must say I was happy they weren’t professional. 

The lawyer had tried to get the judge to dismiss the server evidence as it could have been tampered with by me and Jeremy or anyone else for that matter. I was relieved when the judge didn’t accept it and went on with the proceedings, barely acknowledging the attempt from the lawyer. It should not have mattered much as at Ron’s home 16 more hard drives with the same content were found. Back-ups according to the lawyer. Evidence according to the prosecutor. Ron was sentence to four years for possession and distribution of the material. The third man was sentenced to 3 years for possession, as his contract with Ron for the server could not be proven.

When it came to Don the proceedings became fast. The prosecutor was sure of his guilt and participation in the crime. But the evidence did not reflect it. He never was near the cage and there was no any activity from him logged on the server. His house search had turned up nothing.
The judge did not find him guilty. I still don’t know wether or not he knew. I hope he did not knew.

* * *

As for me and Jeremy, we stayed together after this but broke up later because he stopped going to school again. We still talk, but nothing like we used to do. He has his own life now. As do I.

Sarah recovered completely in the months after. We still speak and hang out on a regular basis. She now works with an IT-Company that provides software services.

As for me. The therapy had helped immensely and  I moved out of the town after the trial was over to go to a new school. Not heaving learned my lesson I took another job about 9 months later that again involved customers and a rather chauvinistic boss. But that’s a story for another time.",Chapter 16 - When things fall apart Pt. 2,1203
natureruler,99,193,1kkaby,819,"This is a tale of family tech support. My younger brother calls me up and says that a certain website is not loading in IE on his new laptop. I know he prefers Chrome, so this is our exchange over the phone:

Me: Why aren't you using Chrome?

Brother: Every time I download it I get a virus. 

Now, I'm thinking that maybe he is not downloading Chrome from a legitimate source. Me: Try downloading it from somewhere else. 

Brother: Like using someone else's wifi?

Me: ಠ_ಠ No, like from a different website.

Brother, after trying that: It is still getting this virus every time I try to use Chrome.

So I tell him that I can't help him until the next time I see him. About a week later I try to solve his problems with Chrome in person. I install it fresh directly from Google. Test it out, it loads the website just fine that isn't working in IE. I give it back to him. Five minutes later: Look! Look, its doing it again. He hands it to me and I can see that tabs are opening, toolbars are loading, general chaos is ensuing. Then I notice that he is signed in with his gmail account. I open up the Google Dashboard under settings and see that he has tons of apps and extensions set to automatically sync when he signs in. I click the button to Stop and Clear all synced data, then give the laptop back to him.

TL;DR My younger brother thought that his synced Chrome settings were a virus.",Chrome has a virus!,1012

Yesterday i got a call from a user that had an issue creating a shortcut.
In order to make things easier i ask her if i can remote control her computer.

Normally, user simply have to double click on an icon on their desktop.
(It's web page shortcut for the remote assist tool)

Also, keep in mind that their desktop are suppose to have only 4 icons.
 
Me: In order for me to connect to your computer you will need open the ""user center"" which is an icon on your desktop.

User: I can't find it are you sure it's there?

Me: Yes, It's a small red circle called user center.

User: I can't find it, wait maybe it's on the floor.

User: It's REALLY not there!! 

Me: Sorry for the confusion, it's on the main screen of your computer with the background and some more icons. Do you see it?

nameless912,251,170,13icjr,821,"Background: I work as a student helpdesk tech for the engineering college in my university.

A few days back, I had my first experience of truly moronic tech support. My responsibilities as an L1 tech in Engineering IT usually only went as far as quota issues, password resets, basic hardware support, software questions, etc.

Then, there was the professor.

This guy is apparently notorious in our department as being verbally abusive and absolutely moronic when it comes to asking for help from us. So, when he walked into the helpdesk with a brand new Retina MacBook Pro 15 inch, I immediately got worried.

My fears were not unfounded.

*Prof*: ""Where the hell is the start menu on this piece of shit?""

*Me*: ""Sir, it's a mac. It doesn't run Windows, you won't get a start menu. But if you'll let me show-""

*Prof*: ""**WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S NO FUCKING START MENU. WHAT DID YOU DO.**""

*Me*: ""Sir, I'm sorry, if you had bought a Windows computer, it would run Windows. There's not a lot we can do-"" (at this point, I'm not going to bother to explain Bootcamp to him)

*Prof*: ""Well you better fucking fix this or I'm going to your fucking manager to get you fired.""

At this point, he drops (yes you read correctly: DROPS his $2200 machine) onto my desk and storms out of the office. I open up the lid, and the screen is quite obviously slightly cracked. Angels descend and let out a single tear, and then I reluctantly pull out a Windows 7 install disc and look up his purchasing ID and charge the cost of a professional license ($30 through the university) to his account.

He comes back the next day, already angry because of something else totally unrelated. I tell him that I had to install Windows through boot camp. He then proceeds to ridicule me.

""How come it can run Windows now when it couldn't run Windows yesterday?""

He then opens up the lid, and all hell breaks loose.

**""WHY IS THE FUCKING SCREEN CRACKED? WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO? THIS IS BECAUSE YOU INSTALLED WINDOWS ISN'T IT!?""**

""No, sir. The crack is because you dropped it on my desk. I am also required to inform you that the license to windows cost $30 and it was charged to your professional account-""

(Now, this was probably an awful time to say this)

""You what? **YOU FUCKING CHARGED ME? WHAT IS THIS SHIT? HOW THE HELL DO THEY LET MORONS LIKE YOU CHARGE ME MONEY? THIS IS BULLSHIT!**""

""Sir, it was $30, I'm required to charge it to your account.""

""**IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT THERE'S NO START MENU, WHY DON'T YOU PAY IT YOURSELF?**""

And that's when I killed him officer.

**tl;dr smashed a brand new mac because it didn't have Windows. Blamed my installing of windows, then flipped a shit when informed that Windows actually costs money.**

edit: WHOA People like this story! a few more details:

1) I reported the guy to the dean of engineering.

2) He's tenured which means he can't be easily fired, however his employment contract is up for renewal early next year so that oughta be interesting.

3) the reason I didn't slap this guy across his sorry face is because I legitimately wanted to help the guy, and I knew he was frustrated. I tried my best to keep my cool. Yes I know it was abusive and not cool, but I'm too idealistic to give up on a customer I guess.","""GET ME MY START MENU BACK!""",991
crazylefty,175,293,wjl8q,816,"So my little 8 year old buddy and I had a discussion tonight about viruses.

He was asking questions that most of my users wouldn't begin to understand.  I even told him that he was more computer savvy than most of the users that I support.  Questions like ""Can viruses attack hardware?  Like your motherboard?  Or the hard drive?"", or telling me instances that he comes across on the web, like fake virus alerts and such.  Which got us talking about the evolution of Windows and security along the way.

KeithSqik,141,305,1dxclq,816,"**Welcome**

I've been a long time lurker but a first time poster on this subreddit and now I'm currently commuting to my lovely job as a tech support agent, I thought it would be lovely to share a few of my stories. Obviously over the years I've had your basic problems like ""I've bought a new wireless router and my pc can connect to it but don't have access to the internet."" ""Have you connected a cable from your modem to your new router?"" ""No, why should I? It's wireless isn't it?"" &lt;/insert facepalm&gt; but a few really stick out for different reasons and I'll share them with you

I've been in techsupport for over 7 years now and I've done it all, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and everything beyond that and right now I'm working with a team of 6 others setting up a entire new customer service desk for a brand new ISP. But I digress.. On to the juicy stories, minion!

**Invoices and inevitable doom**

Let us start at the beginning, this is a story of my first day about 7 years ago in customer and tech support, and as you can imagine I was quite nervous throughout the entire day but I quickly found my groove.

""Hello, this is *BigDutchISP* *KeithSqik* speaking, how may I assist you?""

And a really posh guy answered *""Hi, I've been having some issues with my Digital television as it doesn't appear to work on any of my settop boxes.""* And I thought *Ok, this dude has more then one settopbox and none of them work, so it could be a splitter problem or something to do with the signal* and I collect this guy's customer information. And much to my dismay I saw the problem right away and to be honest I panicked. I seriously started to stutter and to sweat and thought to myself *""Ah, man! This guy is going to freak out on me and it's only my first day.. I don't want to handle this shit"". So I swallowed my fear and said *""Well Sir, I euhm.. I.. I've seem to have located the issue and it seems that you have two unpaid invoices that are due with a total sum of 3500 euro and that's why your television services have been temporarily suspended until the invoices are paid.""* 

Let me just briefly explain that I've been trained to handle your basic household subscriptions and the average people spend on their monthly services is around 60 euros, so I was just gutted to see the sheer amount that this guy still owed us.

And I thought this guy was going to ge berserk and he replied *""Ah, ok then I know who to call, thanks""* *click* and I was stunned, WTF!? just happened? I thought this guy would go mental!


It turns out after I did some digging that the customer in question was the owner of a hotel and in every room there was a settop box for video on demand and such and his accountant neglected to pay us. Pfew, dodged a bullet there.

**Finding out your son is gay, the hard way** (No pun intended)

This is a story of how a tactical error on my part caused severe repercussions for the customer in question. Oi.. here is goes.


""Hello, this is *BigDutchISP* *KeithSqik* speaking, how may I assist you?""

""Yes, well I would like to know why my invoice of this month is so high, normally I pay around 100 euros but this time it's over 300.""

""Well I understand why you would want to know that Miss"" And I collect the customer information and pull up the latest invoice. Immediately I see that a paid *""service""* number has been called quite a few times. (and I mean service in this case in the broadest of terms) and I tell the lady that if she logs into her account she can see the same invoice I'm currently looking at and that she can see that her invoice is so high because of her phone usage."" She told me that she lived in a three person household, just her, her husband and their 17-year old son. And she had spoken to her husband and he claimed not to the made the calls.

She informed that her PC was up for repairs and inquired if I could look in to it. I told her that I couldn't give her the number due to legal reasons and I advised her to log in via another pc to check the invoice herself.
That's when she got smart.
She asked me if I could see the number which I couldn't deny because I told her I have the same invoice in front of me that she received via her account.
She asked me if I had access to google, to which I replied *""well, yeah""* I saw where this was going and I was not amused..
She asked me if I could google the number to see what kind of *""services""* it provided. So I did and I was not disappointed. 
*""I've googled the number but I would like to ask you to confront your son about this phone usage, because if your husband didn't make those calls and you didn't, it might have been your son. Because these calls definately placed with your landline.""*
*""I want to know what kind of services have been dialed, you googled it, you have it in front of you, I wish to know!""*
*""Consider said services, I press you to speak to your son concerning this matter. If you really wish to know. I will provide you with the information but at your own risk.""*
*""Please tell me""*
*""Ok, the number that has been dialed of which the costs are in excess of 200 euro's this month are to a Gay Sex Phone Line""*
*""but I didn't know my son was gay...""*

I really hope it wasn't her husband that called those numbers. If you enjoyed these stories, I'll add more.

[EDIT] - Included a bit of background info about the second call and thinking about it.. If the boy in question was 17 at the time.. that made it actually illegal for him to call those numbers since they were 18+ lines.. Never pondered that and I added a TLDR.

[EDIT2] - Fixed a typo and changed wish to hope. As a non native English speaker I was never taught the difference and I thought the words were interchangable.

Smith6612,90,178,1a0ojg,814,"There are some days where I never understand what is going on in a user's head while they're using a computer. Years ago in an Enterprise support environment for a company I used to work for, I received a message via a page saying a user at so and so extension left an urgent message for me. I was already working on at the time a rather critical project after hours to avoid user impact, so of course, it's also the only time something ""urgent"" shows up. I give the user a call after checking voicemail from a mobile phone to see what the matter is which of course accomplished nothing, and the conversation begins with the user along the lines of:




Me: ""Hello, this is Smith6612 from the IT Department, just returning your message, how many I help?""

User: ""WHERE IS MY DATA?!""

Me: ""Your files? Have you looked in My Documents or on the file server for them?""

User: ""No, and I don't want to look for them! I just want to get my Excel file open!""

Me: ""Where exactly are you trying to open your file up in the first place?""

User: ""From the Recent Files menu in Excel. Every time I click on my file it says File not found!""





From this point, I'm a bit confused as to what is going on with the user. I'm getting screamed at like no tomorrow, and I'm a 15 minute walk from their location. Anyways, to continue onward, the call begins to escalate further. I maintain a calm attitude as I automatically head towards the user's desk since I knew from experience something like this wasn't going to end well, whilst remaining on the phone with them to try to sort this one out. I continue to ask them where they think they last saved the file, if they moved it around and so on. I was eventually able to get out of them ""My Documents"" after a lot of resistance from them, and I had them check the My Documents folder after getting the exact path out of Excel. The user states they see files, but not the one they're looking for. I have them use Windows Search to find the file name elsewhere in the computer, and no results appear.

At this point it's clear to me that they've moved the file, renamed it or have otherwise deleted it and I inform them I'm on the way to sort out the issue. When I asked them to check the Recycling Bin and the Modify dates for their files for safe measure, they got furious. I received an earful of some colorful words, followed by ""NEVER MIND, NEVER MIND, BYE! -click-""

Five minutes later after getting hung up on, I arrive at the user's desk to find the user not present. Their computer was also missing, with the mouse and keyboard scattered around the floor. The keyboard was missing some of the keys as they had scattered on the floor, and the monitor (A CRT) was turned and nearly about to fall off of the desk.

I found the computer moments later around the corner from where their office was in a hallway. It was laying on the ground with the side panel busted open (they are locked shut for obvious reasons), the front panel coming off, a small dent in the side of the case, the PS/2 plug for the mouse connected to the back of the machine with the rest of the cabling missing, and well, you can get the picture. On the inside of the machine, the motherboard tray was damaged, missing some of the plastic risers holding it up, and some of the add-on PCI devices were also coming out of the slots due to the motherboard. Nothing else looked damaged.

In the back of the machine I found of all things, a USB Flash drive. I take this drive along with their newly destroyed computer back to my office/server room/workshop and begin to find out what exactly happened. I was fortunately able to get the hardware out of the case, install it in a ""test bench"" scenario and get the hardware to start up without issue and survive a small stress test so that was definitely a relief to me at the time. For their hard disk, I installed that into a known good machine and began to run some forensic software on the drive to search for previously deleted items. I connected the USB Flash drive to another machine, and upon the device being recognized and mounted I see the missing file, perfectly intact with a modify date from the day prior sitting right in the root, clearly not at the path the user had mentioned on the phone. The forensic software also returned back with that same file, showing identical dates and data to what the flash drive copy had but in a deleted state.

Rather annoyed at this point, I copy the file back to the hard disk and ensure it opens. I rebuild their system into an extra case, deliver it back to their desk with some Kensington locks and then resume the project I was working on prior to the temper tantrum. I also filed a report for intentional destruction of company property as required for such incidents, which was swiftly handled by management the next day.


TL;DR: User moves file from computer to Flash drive, gets upset that they lost it since it wouldn't open in Excel from the Recent documents, and smashes computer.",Surprisingly it wasn't the monitor...,992

terahurts,105,189,zjviz,809,"Most of my working life has been spent in IT support, so I'm naturally the first person in my family that gets called when something goes wrong.  This usually includes my own kids, who generally pick the most inconvenient times to ask me to fix something.

So a couple of nights ago my son (18, knows how to install Windows but as far as I knew not so good with TS issues) appears at the door with a problem.  His PC keeps shutting down after being powered up for a few minutes.  Given that his room is usually hotter than the surface of the Sun I'm pretty sure his PC is overheating so I tell him either I can take a look in the morning or he can have a go at cleaning all the crud out of the CPU heat sink, but if he has problems he'll have to wait till the morning for me to fix it.

I don't see him again so assume he's blown the dust out and everything is ok.  The next morning he wanders downstairs with a bunch of screwdrivers, fans and cable ties from my box of spares and I ask him if everything is working ok.  He replies:

'Yeah, I cleaned the dust out, but it still kept overheating and shutting down, but the big heat sink thing was cold..... I thought that was wrong so I took it off and cleaned it and put some of that thermal paste on it and put it back on again.  It started getting warm then and the PC stayed on, but games kept crashing. I had another look inside and the graphics card fan wasn't spinning so I tried turning it and it was really stiff.  I tried spinning it in my fingers for a bit but it didn't make any difference so I borrowed a fan from your box and cabletied it the card, now everything's working OK. Thanks Dad.'

nedyken,164,172,yb4j9,804,"I didn't know this subreddit existed until a minute ago.  Off the top of my head, this is the first ""tech support tale"" that comes to mind.  Sorry if this is cliche or common.

I worked at Comcast as phone tech support for the internet.  So basically, a lot of resetting modems.  I got a call from a middle-aged woman who said her ""internet was broken"".  I started to go through the common troubleshooting steps and quickly realized she had no idea what I was talking about.  She seemed frustrated from the start and was instantly giving me attitude.  She seemed completely baffled when I asked her how many lights were green on her modem.  She didn't seem to have any idea what a modem was. 

She did, however, say ... ""My TV is black"".  

This confused me, because I was tech support for the internet, but it was possible she intended to call tech support for Comcast's cable television department.  I asked her to clarify if she was having an issue with her cable box....

**HER:** ""Look... it was working fine earlier today... now the internet is broken.  My TV is black""

**ME:**  ""Are you having trouble getting television channels, Miss?""

**HER:** ""NO! ... MY INTERNET IS BROKEN""

**ME:**  ""Sorry... I mean to ask, are you having trouble with your television service as well?  I do not show that there is an outtage in your area, but if you have pr--""

**HER:** ""IT'S MY INTERNET!  It was working earlier today and now it's BROKEN!""

**ME:** ""Ok, I understand... I'm sorry for the inconvenience.  So it's not your cable service.  You are having trouble accessing websites and your e-mail?""

**HER:** ""IT's just black!  My TV is black.  Nothing.  It's just BLACK!!""

**ME:** ""Miss, everything is going to be fine.  I'm going to take care of you.  Let's try this... look on the back of your TV... can you tell me how many cables are coming out of it?""

**HER:**  ""Two""

**ME:** ""Ok, great.  Make sure they are plugged in nice and tight.  Next... can you do me a favor and just very carefully follow each cable to see where they lead?  We just want to make sure they haven't come loose""

**HER:** *Sigh* ""Fine... but I'm telling you it's broken.  *Pause* Ok, one is going into the wall.  *Pause* ... The other is going into the big box under the desk""

**ME:** ""That's your computer.  There should be several cords going into the back of it, right?

**HER:**  ""Yes"" 

**ME:** Does it appear to be on?  Any noise coming out of it?  Are there any lights on the front?

**HER:**  ""Yes.  There are blinking lights on front""

**ME:** ""Ok Great.  Here's what we are going to do.  Look on the FRONT of that ""TV"" screen that is black.  Towards the bottom there should be buttons.  Sometimes they are a little hidden on the bottom of the screen.  You should be able to feel around for them.  One of them is a power button.  It might have a symbol that looks like a circle with a dash through it.  Go ahead and press that button when you find it.

Completely empty store, all 6 employees looked up from what they were doing and no one wanted to help Housewife of blah blah county.  Bleached hair, tan, fake boobs, prada purse, long pink glittery nails and sparkly heeled shoes - this was princess of earth right here.  All 40 something years of her.

The verizon employee stutters, tries to explain, but she's already lost.  The woman looks around for someone else to help her and no one else wants any of it, especially since the rep she was talking to was the manager.  So I, knowing I could help and say what they couldn't if need be, walk over.  ""You know, I've had the same problem with my phone"" I say to her, she smiles and says ""yeah, this woman here tried to tell me thats not the case and look, here is someone else who has had it"".  I ask if I could see her phone, tell her I will log in to her email from her browser and get her phone email password set up.  She hands it to me, gives me the info, logs right in on the browser.

VERY_LOUD_USERNAME,108,154,1ad0wm,803,"Long story, bit of setup:

I sub-contract for a guy (which we'll call Joe) that provides internet services for hotels. The ISP brings a line in, and he gets it from there to their offices, front desk, and to the guests over wireless. He's from a city a couple hours away. Generally, I cover his clients in my city (which we'll call Loudtown), he covers the clients in his (Joetown).

He's on vacation. I'm covering all of his calls.

So I take a call: ""Hey, we're having some issues with internet on all the PCs in the office.""

Basic questions follow.

""Okay. I'll connect in and take a look from my end and give you a call back.""

I can connect into both of their routers. That's a good start. The one that handles their back office is show a fair number of dropped packets. I'm getting a lot of timeouts pinging the load balancer from the router. The other router seems fine. Figure maybe the cable's bad.

I call back.

""Okay, from my end I'm showing a lot of dropped packets between the router and the load balancer. I suspect it might be a bad ethernet cable. Do you have any spare cables around?""

She hunts one down, calls me back.

I start trying to walk her through identify either end of the cable that we're going to try replacing. The load balancer is a little DrayTek device that looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/COLqxMe.jpg) minus the antennas.

Given a description and the fact that it says ""DrayTek"" on the front... She can't find it. But she can find the router. I'm logged in. I can see the connection to the load balancer is on port 1.

""Okay, can you see the cable that's plugged into the port that says ""1"" on it?""  
""Yeah.""  
""Okay. I need you to follow that to the other end, that will be plugged into the 'DrayTek' device.""  
""It doesn't go anywhere.""

...

I don't have any diagrams, so there's a possibility that the cable doesn't go directly into the load balancer, but it sure as hell goes somewhere. I can see the packets flowing through it.

A few more rounds of this same question phrased different ways, and she gets frustrated and puts some other guy on the phone. Instead of it ""not going anywhere"" now

""It goes into the big machine.""  
""Sorry?""  
""The big loud machine.""  
""Does this big loud machine have a door and shelves inside?""  
""Yes."" (Oh ffs.)  
""Okay. I need you to open the door and look in there. For the 'DrayTek' device.""

(It's a rack with a door, btw.)

It's about this point I get a ""hold on"" expecting him to start looking. Instead I hear some muffled voices and some other guy picks up.

""We have a support contract. This is ridiculous. Our whole office is down and everyone's standing around unable to work and we have to get our accounting done. You need to come in and do this right now.""  
""I'm sorry, Joe is away on vacation right now, and I'm in Loudtown. If you'll let me try and assist you, I'm sure we can resolve this.""  
""Let me speak to Joe right now.""  
""I'm sorry, as I said he's away on vacation right now and away from any sort of phone service. The only contact I have with him right now is e-mail.""  
""Okay. You need to send him an e-mail right now.""  
""I can certainly do that for you, however he's only able to check it every few days, so we'll have to wait a couple of days for a response.""  
""That's not good enough. Someone needs to come in, this is totally unacceptable.""  
""I understand your concern, however there is no one in Joetown right now to come in. I am the only person available, and I'm in Loudtown.""  
""Why didn't he get someone in Joetown to handle his calls?""  
""I don't know. You would have to ask him that. If I had to venture a guess, it would be because I've worked closely with Joe and I am familiar with his equipment and methods and he has full trust that I can handle any issue that might crop up.""  
""No. Someone is going to come out or we're cancelling our contract. We're cancelling all of our contracts."" (This guy owns and manages about half a dozen large hotels.)  
""If you'd just let me-""  
""Someone better be here by 5 or I'm cancelling my contract.""

Now, this takes place at 2:30. It's a 2.5 hour drive, city limits to city limits, on a good day. I'm still sitting around in sweats, and the weather hasn't been great, so the highways probably aren't pristine. There's no way anyone is getting there by 5 unless they have a secret teleporter or a time machine.

""There's absolutely no way I am able to get there by 5, but I will come this evening.""  
""If someone's not here [blah blah blah hot air].""  
""Yes, I understand. I'll be there this evening.""

Now, if this were one of my clients I'd tell him to take all his hot air and blow it out his ass. But he's not one of my clients, and as understanding as Joe is, he probably won't be pleased if he comes back and I've lost him a half a dozen contracts within the week.

So I pack my gear up, toss some spare parts in my car, check the oil, check the tires, fuel up... And hit the highway.

It's pretty good for the first 60 miles or so, then the highway turns to a skating rink for the remaining 95. I make it there by 6.

They've left no instruction with the front desk. They've left no access to their offices. I can get in the comms room, so I go in and plug away a bit. Everything looks okay. I need into the office to figure out what the hell's going on.

Some phone calls later and they've revealed a hidden key to the front desk girl to get me in with explicit instructions I'm not to be out of her sight while I'm in there.

A little offended, because I know that's not SOP with Joe, but okay.

We head in, and I'm chatting away with front desk girl while working out loud to kind of fill the silence.

I pick a computer. ""This one's fine.""

I pick another. ""This one works.""

I pick another. ""This one works too.""

I pick another... no connection.

I interrupt the conversation with the front desk girl. A little unprofessional, but I was annoyed as all get out. I'd relayed a large part of how I had come to be there by this point. (to a response of ""Yeah. That sounds like &lt;boss&gt;. He's a jerk."")

""Whose desk is this?""  
""That's Carla's. She's the owner's assistant.""  
""Does... Does Carla do the accounting?""  
""Yes... Oh my god.""

I pull the cable from the PC, plug it into my laptop. Line's dead. Like, dead dead. I pick up the VoIP phone it's plugged in to... Still has a connection. I replace the cable from the phone to the PC. No connection. So the PC port on the phone is screwy. I spin the spinny chair. There's a spare port in the wall.

I measure, cut and crimp a new patch cable. I plug it into the empty port. I plug it into the PC. It works.

I ask if they can comp me a room since I've driven all this way. Because the highways were bad coming out. Because the highways will be worse going back. Because it's dark out.

They won't.

I stop by a fast food joint and eat a quite meal by myself. Did I mention this was my birthday? It was my birthday. I spent it alone eating a hamburger hours from home.

I used to commute on the highway. I would drive home when it was blizzarding so badly I couldn't see the hood of my car for 80% of the trip (as long as there's a bit of clear view once in a while to re-align your car with the road, it's okay!). On days when the highway was empty because no one else dared venture out, I'd still keep up ~50mph.

I was doing below 20mph at points, and never broke 40mph. There was so much snow on the highway I couldn't distinguish road from ditch. I resorted to simply eyeing some signs a ways ahead and aiming in between them, hoping they were the signs on my side of the highway. It was a nightmare of a drive.

They wouldn't take the support provided, and demanded a higher level than what was actually required by contract. Joe doesn't eat the cost for their unreasonable demands and passes my bill onto the client.

I generally don't bill time spent driving (just mileage), but reserve the right to. I bill that time.

I generally don't worry about billing callout fees or minimum callouts, but it's part of my standard agreement. I bill both.

By the time the day is over, I've wasted over ten hours and they've paid around $2000 to have someone come and plug an ethernet cable in to connect their PC to the wall.

All because they had to be melodramatic instead of giving me a proper description of the problem in the first place.

But hey, that's the price of being demanding and lying to your IT support.

(I know this reads less as a tale, and more as a rant. Because that's what it is. Hopefully it's still enough in the spirit of the sub.)

After I talk her through the process of locating the computer name she reads it off to me and I notice right away it's nothing like what the client uses.

**Me:**  Wait, this is a strange hostname, it doesn't even show up on the network.

**Caller:** Can you just come over and look at the computers then, I was told you can come over.""

**Me:**  Let me get some information, what department are you in?

**Caller:**  We're in no department, we're at Apostles Glory Bible Church on Herp road.  

**Me:** What, you called in on the help desk line for a financial services company.  I'm afraid I can't help you.

**Caller:** But John Smith (Not his real name) gave me this number and said you'd provide us with free help.

**Me:**  Sorry, but that's not the case.  I'm going to have to let you go now, but you'll have to call a computer tech for your problems.  Good luck.

I end the call, and write up everything in a detailed email to my boss and send it over to him.  No sooner do I send it than I get an IM from one of my peers that they have a caller on hold asking for me.  I take the call. 

**Me:**  Help Desk, this is wonderweirdo.

**Caller:** This is wonderweirdo?

**Me:**  That's right

**Caller:**  This is John Smith, I was just contacted by my church and told that you refused to help them.  You need to reconsider given that this is supposed to be an act of charity to them.

**Me:**  (Annoyed)  Mister Smith, this act of charity you're talking about comes at the expense of your company and at my time.  If you want to donate to your church, then why don't you pay for a tech to come out there and work on their network?

**Caller:**  Why would I go through all that trouble when we have tech support right here?  You have to consider that this is for a church, can't you understand that this is a moral obligation?

**Me:**  (Now really annoyed)  Mister Smith, I'm in no way morally obligated to help your church.  I'm not even religious, I'm going to end this call and make sure that my manager pulls the recording to go along with my report.  Have a nice day.

I hang up and email my supervisor again, this time I get an IM from one of my peers that the church has called back two more people asking for free tech support, and the story is the same.  

My manager is already on the phone with the client about this issue.  The calls stopped coming in, and towards the end of  the day I find out that John Smith is being dealt with by his managers.  The church did call one more time, and my manager had them transferred over to him where he explained that they should not be calling on that line since Smith had no right to volunteer our services to them.

I will begin my journey through the horrors of tech support with you where it at all began for me....

I was 18 and finally old enough to work anywhere I wanted without restriction, so where did I apply first!?! Best Buy tech bench, of course. Yep, I was an original 'black shirt' as they called us before 'freak' squad came to be. I had my newly obtained A+ cert and was ready to conquer the tech world with my broad knowledge. On my 3rd day behind the bench, a lady brought in her top of the line E-Machine (HA!) in for us to look at because according to her, it was making 'loud grinding noises' and then powered down and never would come back on. In these days, we would take the effected machine to the bench (in plain sight for all to see), run a few tests and diags to determine what may need done. So I told the lady to give us 15-20 minutes and come back and we should have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. So I take the lovely E-Machine back to the desk and the first thing I want to instinctively check was of course the PSU (for any non techys, that's the power supply in the computer). As I attempt to take off the side panel, I realize that something is catching the slots and making it really hard to get the panel off. After some tugging, the panel came off to reveal a makeshift magazine rack. Yes ladies and gentleman, someone had been rolling up and stuffing their Hustlers inside the computer case. So not quite yet knowing the material that the magazines contained, I started pulling the rolled up magazines out of the case, unrolled one and got an eye-full of hoo ha...and so did the people lined up at customer service. Awwwkward. I quickly put the magazine out of site and take the PC into the adjacent office and show my supervisor that immediately lost it. This wasn’t the hard part, the hard part was explaining to the customer what went wrong with her machine. 

After some deliberation, we decided to tell the customer the truth for the shits and gigs that we knew would proceed. So the customer returns and the conversation went something like this:

Customer: So what did you find out!?

Me: Well, there were rolled up magazines stuffed inside the computer case itself that caused the fan on your power supply to fail and in turn burning it out. So you need a new PSU. 

Customer: Magazines?! What kind of magazines!? 

Me: Um...

Customer: It DEFINITELY wasn't me, so it could only be my husband!

Me: Adult material...So would you like us to...

*Before I could finish, the customer informs me she will be right back*

*Within a short period of time, she walks back up to the desk with a mortified looking man*

Customer: Tell HIM what you found...

Me: Um, I, Uh...there were...um...porn. 

Embarrassed guy: Oh...

Customer: You are completely disgusting derpy derp herp derp 

At this point, she is shaking and whacking a rolled up Hustler at who I assumed was her significant other in front of everyone on a busy day. 

This would be the first of a hand full of rather awesome tech stories to come out of Best Buy.

howardljones,42,183,1m2c4w,800,"Working in an IT department can be a little bizarre.  Here's something that happened about seven years ago.

Once upon a time, my department had their own office far removed from the rest of the company.  It was a quirky little office, with stairs that seemed to double-back on themselves, windows that gazed out onto brick walls, and secret rooms tucked away to the sides.  Anyway, our supplier was a complete douchebag and would deliver all our Dell kit to random locations all over the country - sometimes to the user directly (unimaged), sometimes to the regional engineer, or sometimes simply left outside the main gates of the office.  Thousands of pounds of Dell kit sat on the streets, begging to be taken.  Our main admin lass - let's call her Babs - throws her toys out of her pram, gives a good beating to the delivery company, and then sends an email to everyone commanding that ALL deliveries must go to her, and also to keep an eye out for rogue deliveries.  Quickly after that, the delivery company sorts its game out and thus dozens of boxes pour into the IT office as requested.

One morning, the IT building's overly-protective super/janitor (I used to call him Fireman Sam; his fire drills were works of art.  He would study the evacuation in action then give long boring speeches about who could have evacuated faster/better) arrives at the office to find a dead cat in the middle of the road outside.  He goes to the recycling bins and finds a complete laptop box, scrapes the cat into it and leaves outside the gate for the council to pick up later.
One of our Service Desk guys - let's call him Timmy - rolls up to the automatic gates later that morning and, while waiting for the gates to open, spots a Dell laptop box sat on the roadside.  Cursing the delivery company for leaving an expensive laptop on the road, Timmy brings the box in with him, noting that there must be a laptop in the box since it has some weight to it, and takes it to the named person on the delivery sticker; Babs.  It's still quite early and Babs is not in yet, so he leaves the box on her desk.

A couple of minutes later, Babs enters the office.  Apparently, she's a bit confused as to why there's a laptop box on her desk as she's got no outstanding orders.  It's also missing its delivery note, so she rips open the box and peers inside.  I was sitting just diagonally from Babs, tapping an email and nursing a little bit of a hangover; first I almost fouled myself as Babs let out an ear-splitting, blood-curdling scream.  Then I almost wet myself when the remains of a sad one-eyed cat flopped out onto her desk.

krashmo,192,177,1hsg0g,804,"/u/politesarcasticthing suggested I make a comment from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1hqyoo/sometimes_i_hate_being_a_female_working_in_tech/) into it's own post. I hope you guys enjoy it. The first part is a copy/paste of my comment.

Alright then. First off let me say that I am one of two employees at my company. We are a small ISP with about 200 customers. Anything related to our network is my responsibility, including tech support.

**First incident:**

We have our main router set up to redirect users with an outstanding balance to a page that says ""pay your bill if you want your internet to work"". The boss doesn't tell us to turn people off until they are at least 3 months behind on their bill. Anyway, this girl calls in and I remember her from when I installed her service about 4 months ago. She is complaining that her internet is shut off. I look up her information and sure enough, she hasn't paid her bill since we turned her service on. At this point I would normally tell them to pay their bill and I will turn their service back on. However, she gives me a sob story about how she needs her internet turned back on to do her schoolwork (it is the week before finals). I guess I felt sorry for her since I was in the midst of finals madness myself, so I told her I would turn her service back on but that it would be limited to 128 kbps. Enough to pull up webpages for school but not enough to dick around on YouTube or NetFlix. She starts to freak out on me like I did something wrong. She says, ""why would I want that? This is just going to make me not pay my bill ever"" I'm trying to explain to her that what I suggested is against company policy, and is purely out of the goodness of my heart but she isn't having it. ""You shouldn't have turned my service off in the first place!"" She said some other stupid things that I don't really remember but eventually it got to the point that I told her that I was leaving her service off because she didn't seem to understand the concept of paying for services received and that if she wanted to use the internet, she would have to go to the university library or a coffee shop. At this point she asked to speak to my manager. I told her to wait a second and I would put him on. I yelled at my boss, who was in his office, that a woman who hadn't paid her bill was complaining about not having internet access. Seeing as this was the first time I had been mouthy with a customer (I'm pretty sure he could hear everything I said to her), I wasn't sure how my boss would respond. My boss picked up the phone and without missing a beat said, ""If you want internet access, pay your f***ing bill. Now stop harassing my employees."" Then he hung up on her. It was the best outcome I could have hoped for. I think she ended up canceling her service with us a week later. 

**Second incident:**

The end of this incident occurred about a week ago, and it still makes me mad to think about. We have a customer that lives out in the country. He's got a few horses that run around his yard because he is too lazy to build a fence. We are a WISP, so our equipment is generally mounted on the roof with a CAT-5 cable running inside somewhere. Well this guy didn't want anything on his roof because he didn't trust me to seal the holes from the roofing screws properly. Guy lives in a crappy little trailer house but whatever, I'll make him happy. I tell him that I will mount our equipment to a light pole about 25 feet from his house if he promises me that he will bury the cable after I leave. I warned him that we have had problems in the past with cows and horses chewing on the cables. He says, ""No problem, whatever I need to do to keep it off the roof."" Perfect. I do my install and then I go on my merry way. Around a month later I get a call from this guy that his internet isn't working so I head back to his place. Once I get there I find that the cable was never buried and his horses have chewed the cable in half in three different places. He tells me he thinks his friend ran the cable over. I point out the teeth marks on the cable, but for some reason he still doesn't believe that his horses did it. A funny side note about this guy: he's an electrician. When I got there he was confused that his equipment wasn't powered on. When I reminded him that the cable was cut in half, he said ""I thought it was wireless?"". I wanted to tell him that as an electrician, he should know better than anyone that wireless power is not a thing yet, but I held my tongue. Anyway, I ran a new cable for him, reminded him of his promise to bury it, and headed home for the day. A few weeks later I get another call from him. This time he tells me a trailer got pulled over the cable and broke it in half. I begrudgingly go out to his place and run a new cable for him again. This process wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to climb the light pole to get to our equipment and run the cable underneath his house to a hole in the floor. Again, I politely remind him that he needs to bury the cable or this will keep happening. A few months later while I was on vacation, my coworker had to go out to his house to replace the cable a third time. This got me pretty pissed off. I mean, how hard is it to bury 25 feet of CAT-5 cable? By the time the fourth call comes around I am livid. I go out to his house and have my coworker talk to him while I run yet another cable for him. This one had been chewed by the horses again. After I finished with the cable I went inside and had this conversation with him.

Me: ""What are we going to do to make sure this doesn't happen again?""

Him:""Well... I guess I'll bury the cable..""

Me:""Why didn't you do it after the last three times we were here?""

Him:""Well I think that since you are providing the service, you should be the one burying the cable.""

As he was saying this I could feel my blood boiling.

Me: ""I put our equipment on that pole under the condition that *you* bury the cable. Do you remember that?""

Him: ""Yeah, but I don't think I should have to.""

At this point, I'm ready to throw something at him.

Me: ""I don't care what you think. I'm telling you how it's going to be. If you want to continue to use our service, you will do what I tell you to do. You are costing us money every time we come out here, all because you can't follow directions.""

Him: ""Well I'm not going to bury it.""


Me: ""You will if you want to keep playing XBox Live.  I know for a fact your only other option for internet service is satellite and that won't cut it. If this happens again, you will no longer be our customer.""

Him: ""We'll see.""

I had to leave after that or else I would have started cursing at him. I told my boss about it when I got back to the office. He laughed and said, ""What a jack*ss.. Sound like it's about time to fire another customer.""

If I ever have to go back to that guy's house, I'm going to set something on fire.

NDWolfwood5268,103,213,1cviok,796,"Short one, I thought people may find amusing. 

So over the weekend, I get together with some friends to do some good old Dungeons and Dragons. One of the girls there was trying to download some game materials on her laptop, but it wouldn't let her save to her D: drive (her primary storage drive, apparently). She said she had almost 100G free just the other day, so she didn't  understand it. She thought maybe a hacker or virus had downloaded stuff to he computer, or something.

I take a look at it, and download WinDirStat and have it set off on it's duties. Less than 5 seconds later, it shows me the culprit. 1/3rd of the drive was taken up by a windows backup file. Turns out, Windows told her ""Hey, maybe you should backup your stuff!"" and thinking it was a good idea, she had it do so, but decided to backup to the same drive as 90% of her important documents and files. 

I go in and delete the backup and explain that she should get an external drive for backups in the future. She now had nearly 80G free space to use again.

Bonus: Her fan started clicking and whining while I was using it, so I took it apart a bit and found a random piece of plastic the size of a small bead caught under her fan. She said she thought fans just sounded that way when they're on for a while.

KazumaKat,152,169,z0feu,798,"I've been on the down-turn lately on my on-call end-user tech support job, as I'm not as young as I used to be and remote assistance, the more prevalent tech shops in my area, and the general IT IQ increasing for my clients overall have made it so that I''m starting to look at other sources of income with my skillset. Thankfully, a couple of friends do owe me favors and can sweet talk me into some jobs, but I rather not tap them until I'm in a bind. Anyway...

A recent client call has made me reconsider the aformentioned career change, at least for the near future.

I had a case where a rather hysterical middle-aged-sounding woman called me up and asked if I could recover deleted pictures. I'm sure you guys with any experience pretty much know the scenario. Aged mother, accidentally deleted kid photos, is hysterical and wants them recovered.

So, seeing that I could not get her to calm down over the phone, I went ahead and paid a house call (which is already seldom for most cases like this for me).

What greeted me was a bit more than expected, but not outside the norms. She looked like a trainwreck, and was obviously trying to hold back the tsunami of grief she was about to burst on me. Being a man who recently lost a mother (2 years, fuck cancer), I had to put my best ""dont worry, I got this"" face on. Her husband was no better, having his hand on the computer like he wanted to will the photos back.

It seemed to calm her down when I did the usual QnA with her, and found she has 2 drives, the second being the one needing help. Husband was a retired civil engineer, and was a nice, if somewhat sullen guy.

Taking out my normal tools for the job (I normally use a liveCD Linux distro for this, reduces HDD handling and thus, to me, increases chance of a 100% recovery, also impresses people when they actually look and see me typing in Terminal), I quickly found the directory she stated and managed a 100% recovery of it all. I double checked and made copies of it all on my external DVD and recovered the actual photos for her hard drive. 

I then told her the photos were safe, and she now has a second copy of them, as I handed her the now filled DVD.

I was expecting waterworks. I wasnt expecting a full-on double hug and the Hoover Dam breaking.

So I was standing there with a crying mother and an apparently grateful father letting it all out for a good 10 minutes before she calmed down enough and she found all her pictures again. I was feeling good about myself and other than my (reduced, not every day you claw someone's day from the jaws of despair to a bright new hope) fee, the rest were free.

So as I was concluding business and was on my way out, I just off-handedly asked where her children in the photos were. She all of a sudden got that sullen look on her face and just said ""They're in a better place now.""

Didnt hit me until the husband saw me out, and thanked me for ""recovering the last bits of their kids."" I manned up and asked where the kids were and he then told me they all died in a car accident years ago.

I was stunned.

Just yesterday I recieved a box of homemade cookies from the client, and a nice card thanking me. Still wasnt as sweet as recovering the memories of two parents who shouldnt have lost their kids.

**TL;DR: Potentially one of my last house-call tech jobs leads to me recovering pictures of the clients children, who are no longer with us. Best feeling ever.**","Just had one of those moments where I'm glad I do what I do for a living, even if my job is going to the wayside...",967

jon6,305,232,1l6o7g,800,"This goes back a fair few years (and I'm wondering if I have retold this story before). But anyway, it's worth mentioning again.

It's 2003 and the powers that be appoint a stupidly expensive contractor and several people ""of particular insight and caliber"" - or as I read it, utter numpties who don't know how to shut up - to investigate how we can be more environmentally friendly and cut waste and CO2. Apparently, putting fancy jpgs to prove how much you care in your email signature just doesn't cut it anymore?

The Environazis set to work. Nowhere went unpunished. Our particular area had our normal two bins removed (one for waste, one for paper) with 7 different bins, together with emails about how they should be used. These emails would later be followed up with scathing rants, CC'ing every director imaginable, due to some fool putting a crisp packet in the wrong bin! 

Oddly, my ingenious suggestion to label what you COULD put in these bins was seen as being clearly against their environmental agenda - paper and tape hurts bunnies apparently? We did wonder if any of these bins could themselves actually be recycled, but thought better than to question it.

One of the big things was that the post room had a document scanner installed. Well, I say installed. It was an older decommissioned bulk scanner but it still worked; word around the water cooler was that it was decommissioned in the first place due to it being a stupid idea. However, the numpty squad decided that the office was to be 100% paperless. A few postmaster officials were ordered to open business mail, scan the pages and deliver the mail to the recipient via PDF. Now, you can only imagine the sheer hell that broke loose with this arrangement, namely trying to match names to employees, separating out directors' and MD's mail for delivery, various forms of turnaround documentation that would require returning, the delay in actually getting your mail... you name it.

However, the crux came at the end of the mad season. When the contractor had finished and collected his monstrous paycheck and the inhabitants of the numpty squad were satisfied wagging their fingers at anyone who dared throw something away. the true effects of their unworkable strategies began to crumble one by one. 

See, the big machine that scanned all these documents used a page separator which was a slightly thinner, smaller sheet of paper. Now, at the end of the run, the postmasters would sift through the huge pile of documents to retrieve the separators. Their boss, being rather unimpressed with occasionally having to give time in lieu due to rather large runs, decided that retrieval of page separators which cost less than half a penny was uneconomical and that they would be disposed of in the same way as the arriving mail.

Hence, in order to become paperless the company ended up doubling the amount of waste paper it produced. Even better than that, they solved the turnaround documentation issue by ordering people to simply reprint it from their delivered PDFs, fill it in and mail it back. The act of keeping turnaround documentation aside for delivery was again too complex and costly to implement.

Up until the date I left, several weeks later, the numpty squad was still nit-picking and sniping at every opportunity. One particular member of the numpty squad called down to support on my last day. Ironically, complaining of a broken printer, after resolving the issue at his desk I discovered that he had printed a list of repeat offenders intent on taking up matters with their managers. He then decided that the text was too small and was now reprinting it on A3 so he could properly see it all.

FWIW, this guy drove a company-supplied Land Rover. As far as I know, he didn't live anywhere near a farm. Or a field. Or anywhere even slightly hilly.

Fine he just needs to have adobe reader installed, just let me check a few things first.

I copy the URL from IE and open it from google chrome.  It works fine, probably because Chrome has a pdf reader preinstalled.

This was a while back, when the Sims 3 was released for PC. My cousin, who remembered playing the Sims on PS2 many yesteryears ago, decides to buy it. She had an Acer netbook at the time.

I try to tell her in Layman's terms that her laptop will not run the game properly as it is not powerful enough. She snaps at me telling me I'm an idiot and I don't know what I'm talking about. FINE, F**** YA THEN.

She called EA and started screaming at them. This call went on for ~30 minutes, with the tech support guys at EA telling her the exact same thing that I told her. The netbook wasn't up to snuff for the game.

Cue epic #wtfragequit. She tells the EA guy 'Where to go and how to get there,' slams the phone down, grabs her netbook, fires it across the room like a damned frisbee, and walks away like nothing happened.

A few months ago however, that changed.

It was the usual story.  The user thought that the Recycle Bin was the perfect place to store her files while she was moving from one desk to another. Then someone came along and emptied it and she lost all her files and needed them recovered.

Plot Twist! The files were hard copy!

She actually put her paper files into a cardboard box near her desk and failed to notice the box was labelled Recycle Bin.  Then the cleaners came overnight and emptied it.

Cue major panic from the user next morning.  Luckily her files were found in the backup storage unit (the big bins in the basement) and restored with minimal packet loss.

Sir:  Unfortunately it seems my son has also a knack for this sort of thing.  So basically every block I have put in place to stop him downloading this material/going on dodgy sites has failed.

Me:  Right.....

Sir:  So I'm wondering if you could help me with this conundrum.  If you were to send me a strongly worded email regarding this, perhaps with some mention of prison sentences for seeding this material etc I can use this to my advantage.  I know you probably aren't allowed to do that sort of thing but it would really scare the shit out of my kid and hopefully put an end to this.

Gesuhs,83,178,14w6vl,796,"So this is from a few years ago, but I thought I'd share.

I was working in a call center where the majority of my job was helping people with internet connectivity issues at hotels.

One day in the Summer of '08 I took a call from a frantic woman.  She said she was staying in a crappy motel chain in Iowa that we supported.  I gathered that she had no connectivity with the wireless routers they had available and that the motel staff were clueless as to what needed to be done.

I logged into the server remotely and discovered that there were some catastrophic errors that could only be solved by a tech coming to the location and servicing it or replacing it.  It was a complete no go.  She was screwed.

I relay this to her as easily and calmly as I can.  She absolutely loses it.  She starts calling me names and swearing at me in English and what sounded like German.  Normally, I would have informed her that it was our policy to end the call with a customer if they got to this point, however she started crying by the time I was responding.  Not just crying, but an utter **breakdown**.


After a minute or so of this, I asked her if she had tried any other hotels or WiFi hotspots like Starbucks in the area.  Again, more tears; every hotel is booked and all the local businesses are closed because she's in Cedar Rapids, where a massive flood has just occurred.

Not only that, but she is an insurance agent and she has to get her clients claims in by 11PM that night or they won't be accepted (no leniency for the situation, I asked).  She is completely despondent at this point and is fearing not only for these poor people's life savings and possessions, but also her job and her own livelihood.  I can hear it in her voice that she's about to lose it.

At this point, I had been on the call for about 20 minutes.  My call time was something that my supervisors tracked, so I needed to keep it down as much as possible, however for this call I couldn't have given one fuck about my stats.

I pulled up our area support map for Cedar Rapids and looked for nearby hotels in our network.  I managed to find another one of the same chain only 5 miles away.  Then I checked on the internet service there and found that it was up and running perfectly.

These cheap motels are franchises so the internet service you buy at one of them does not work at another one just down the road.  She had purchased a card with an access code on it, but it would not be usable there, so I gave her the free access (for corporate peeps) password and sent her over to the other motel.

In total it was a 45 minute call that really screwed up my stats for the week, but 3 hours later my supervisor came over and had bought me lunch (from Wendy's fuck yeah) because he got a call from her stating that she had filed all the insurance claims and that they were all successful.  She was responsible for around 40-50 people and now they would all be getting their insurance money.

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 


* * *

The first few weeks at the store were rather dull. Don mostly assigned me to work the register and help customers finding what they needed. Restocking and cleaning the store was a task that befell me from the moment I started working there. The shelves were high and stocked from the floor to the ceiling. I had to kneel down low to fill the bottom shelves and reach high to fill to upper shelves. While I felt uncomfortable knowing customers and especially Ron, Don and - were watching I decided to ignore it. I hoped the novelty would wear off.

That was until Don called us all in for the monthly store meeting. Everybody was there. Don and Ron stood at the head of the table, with me and Jeremy on the left side. On the right side were Richard and Frank, the store idiots. How they got their jobs I still don’t know. How they lost them, I know.

Don had great news, he said with a cheery voice and a big smile - like a fat man finding another french fry on the bottom of the McDonalds bag. “With Leila joining us me and Ron felt that we are a big enough team to change the store around a little”. My mind was only thinking “Fuck” at this moment. Ron took over - “We got ourselves a new house style for the store, a brand-spanking-new website and matching uniforms. No old T-shirts anymore!”.

Richard and Frank giggled like little girls, knowing something that I did not. Jeremy kept silent, looking away from me almost as if he felt sorry for me. Ron and Don took the new store billboard from the box. The house style was done by Ron’s nephew, who was one of those prodigy children that are good at everything they touch and revered by the entire family. Unfortunately he took up web design, so our website looked like it belonged on Geocities in the 90’s, but then again so did the store. I should give him credit for staying so close to the source.

Don took the word again and opened up another box and pulled out the new uniforms. Polo shirts with our logo stamped on them. They looked reasonably fashionable. It was better than the small shirt I had til now - maybe I could actually breathe in these. My hope was short lived as I saw Ron and Don looking towards me. “Fuck” was the only thing my brain could utter again. They got a white bag from under the table, looking at it my first guess was that it contained clothes. It did. My uniform was in there.

“We ordered both male and female uniforms” said Ron, “but they won’t deliver the female ones until two weeks from now”. I looked at them and their faces told me everything - it was either a planned delay or the box was somewhere hidden in their offices. “So we got Frank and Richard to make sure that til the shirts come you will have some matching clothing”. I don’t even know which of the two said it. I expected the worst, based on Frank and Richards giggles. I got the worst. My new uniform was the Hooters uniform with our logo ironed on it. What creeped me out the most was the fact that the uniform fit perfectly. They apparently knew my sizes.

Feeling like a teenage hooker I went back into the store, selling hard and soft wares for the remainder of the shift to our usual mix of customers. Most of them middle aged men that needed large hard disks to store their “video projects”.

Most of them were regulars that bought all their computer hardware and software from us, including the B-grade burning software and virus scanners. They were always happy with it. It was so easy to use and really did not slow down the PC! However none of them ever bought any of the video editing software we had on shelf from the same company.

They spend hours on end scouring the internet for movies and pictures of their favorite adult actresses. They did not seem to stop until they knew they caught them all. To have the very best. They however also caught viruses and malware that their B-grade virus scanners failed to detect, warranting a trip back to our store to fix the problem - leaving their pictures, videos and browser sessions on the PCs. I learned my sex-ed from their computers.

Jeremy understood my shame in walking around like a teenage hooker for at least two weeks and covered my store-shift so I could work in the back whenever he could. Me and Jeremy usually worked the Thursday and Friday evening shifts from 5pm to 9pm and Saturdays from 9am to 6pm.  Don was usually not around during the evenings so it worked out fine, except when he made a surprise visit to check up on us and sent me back to the store to help our customers with their needs.

* * *
I was working my second shift dressed like a teenage hooker and was cleaning up the store that have been left like it had been ransacked by an angry mob. Ron told it was a busy day and they had no time to clean it all up. I had to clean up the store. Great. 

I checked the register first and looked at the sales we made. Seven sales, all small items. It had been a slow day. Why the store was such a mess I don’t know and could not check the camera system for we had none. It would not be for another year that Ron became paranoid and we got a state-of-the-art extremely expensive security system. Like the UPS, I would find out later what it was for.

To get back to the story; I was cleaning up the store and still dressed like a teenage hooker when a regular customer walked in. I was bent over one of the tables, causing him to ogle and stammer out that he needed a hard disk. Obviously. I helped him get a hard disk and went to the register and he paid. Before he left he had a question - “If I want to put this one in, do I have to take out the 2 other big drives?”. I lost it. I cannot even begin to understand how he even came up with it, but I knew what it meant. Looking at him I saw he was proud of himself for saying it; as if he practiced for weeks. He then saw that I took offense and quickly wiped the smug expression from his face and mumbled “Nevermind, I’ll find out myself” while walking away. I hoped I’d never see him again, however he was nothing compared to the next one a few days later.

It was about 2 hours into my new shift when a new customer walked in. He looked at me, sizing me up and smiled. I braced myself and walked over. “How can I help you today?” I said, keeping my distance. He kept silent for a bit and then told me that his computer had crashed and he needed it restored. Sure, no problem - we offer recovery services. “Where’s the computer?” I asked. “It’s in my car” he said. “Can you help me get it out, girl?”. The way he said it alarmed me enough to not do it. “You get the PC out of the car and I’ll get out gear out of the back so we can see what is going on” I said and immediately walked away to the back, getting Jeremy to help me out with this one.

The customer returned and brought in an ancient PC; it looked ravished and dirty, as if he just picked it up from the street and walked over to us to get it fixed. Jeremy hooked up the PC and tried to boot it. It booted but had trouble in loading the Windows environment - always hanging in booting process and none of the safe boot options helped. We quoted him for data recovery and reinstallation of the OS and applications. The total was about 85 dollars or so. Jeremy walked to the back to print out one of the forms our customers had to fill in to waive any liability for when we were not able to recover the data.

With Jeremy in the back he stepped closer to me and took a 50 dollar bill out of his pocket and took a pen out of his other. He wrote down something and folded the bill twice, making sure I saw the 50 on it. He leaned forward and whispered into my ear, verbatim: “A girl like you should not work in such a store”. He put the 50 dollar bill between my breasts. I was completely shocked and frozen at this moment. He paused briefly and continued - “My number is on that bill, if you want work that suits your qualities more give me a call”. 

Jeremy came back from the back with the waiver and the customer quickly walked away from me turning his attention to Jeremy. He signed and put down an upfront payment of 30 dollars or so; I can’t remember. It took only seconds for all of this to happen. He turned around, winked at me, and walked out. Jeremy now sensed something was wrong with me and asked me what was wrong. I told him everything. He calmed me down and called one of my friends to pick me up, covering the rest of the shift alone. He worked on the computer that night and got it working. 

When I got in the next day my company polo had suddenly arrived. Jeremy probably told Ron or Don and they knew they could not withhold the polo any longer. When Jeremy saw me he walked over and asked me if I wanted to know something about that customer. I said yes. He told me he was the owner of an adult webcam site. He had tried to hire me as a performer. 

**TL:DR** we got a new store uniform. Sexual harassment ensues. 

**Challenge:** Find the new Pokemon reference.

**Question:** I’m looking to improve my writing. If anything about my story could use some more work please let me know in the comments.

TechGurl8721,110,201,1r7yxz,791,"Hello all,

Today one of the sales guys comes to me and says that people can't hear him on his company mobile phone. He can ring people and they can hear him fine but when they call him and he's the one answering, the sound is muffled and quiet on both ends. 

So while he's standing in the office I ring his mobile phone and sure to god he picks the phone up, answers it and places it to his ear *the wrong way round*. Microphone was completely covered by his meaty fist and all the things required for a working phone call pointing in the opposite direction of his face.

I don't even know anymore. He's blaming the fact that his new phone is black and shiny on both sides. O_o

ffsno,150,161,1fwmd1,791,"Halfway through shaving, his phone screeched a desperate ring and he grabbed a towel for his head and a bigger one for the rest of him as he ran to grab the line.

""Now my printer does not work... what did you do to it?"", says a customer on the other end of the line.

He'd worked on her system remotely after 5 the night before dealing with an issue unrelated to printers, printing or customer cultivation.

""Nothing... didn't touch your printer or print anything."", he managed smiling while he talked to help it come through the lines and make his tone sound more like a helpful person rather than an overworked troll. ""What is wrong? Are there any error messages?""

""NO"", she shot her words like bullets and her gravely cigarette tortured voice grated against brain and made his head feel like it could split at any second. ""NOTHING... It is -not- printing and it -was- printing before -I- left and -you- went in and -worked- on it.""

As she was speaking he wasn't listening but pulling up her desktop into a remote support session. Her screen was filled with the web browser and she was playing some game on Facebook. He grabbed her cursor and minimized the mess telling her at the same instant, ""I have control.""  In his mind he added ""ma'am"" but he didn't say it aloud.

She tried to open Facebook again and he said, ""I've got it now just hold tight"" as he pulled up her browser and typed in the address of the printer. As the printer control came up in the browser he saw a red flashing error on the status indicator. 

""Do you see the error?"" he circled the red area with the cursor and she said no... ""..right here on your screen... the red error that is flashing?"" Again she said ""No"" and continued saying ""I'm not at my desk now""

""Could you please go back to the desk?""

""In a minute... I'm busy""

""OK... When you get back to your desk let me know?""

""Aren't -you- going to fix it? Why do you need me? Can't -you- just fix it""  She croaked. God, her voice was like a rusty dental drill. ""This -remote stuff- never works... you waste my time.""

""Just let me know when you are back at your desk""

He spent a few seconds running down the hit list on a Mobster's game on line. Killing and stealing as much as he could till his stamina was depleted. 

""Okay. What? What am -I- looking for?""

""Do you see the error?"" He circled the red area with the cursor and she said no... ""..right here on your screen... the red error that is flashing?"" Again she said ""No""

""Do you see the cursor moving?""

""On the printer? There is nothing moving on the printer."", she sighed. ""It will not print...""

""OK... Look at your monitor in the middle of the screen and tell me if you see... ""

""You're in my system, aren't you? I see my thing moving""

""Yes... Yes... thanks.... OK Now..."" and again she interrupted. ""My thing is moving. You are moving my thing""

""Yes... Yes... I am moving your thing... Now..."" He hurried. ""Do you see the red flashing thing there where your thing is moving?""

She stumbled, ""The red error box?""

""Yes there... right there... please watch the screen..."" and he clicked the red error box and it opened a pop up box that said 'TONER EMPTY'.  ""Can you read that part where it says that the toner is empty?""

""This printer was working last night... Now my printer does not work... what did you do to it?""

He held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall and imagined for a moment the certain cool peace of the inevitable void then continued... ""The printer is out of toner.... it is empty of the black stuff that goes on the paper and makes letters...""

""I am not doing a letter. I am doing mailing labels and I just don't understand why it is that every time you work on my system I have another problem...""

There are people in this world, some in positions of power, that are so dense and brain dead that he wondered how they managed to breath and not suffocate and why...

""Please listen to me for one second and let's work together to resolve this issue"" He used every bit of his mind not to sound like the most sarcastic fellow ever to grace the earth. ""I am on your side. I am here to help and I need your help to help me help you solve the problem.... OK?"" He continued without pause. ""Do you have a new toner cartridge?""

""Yes,"" she said, ""I have plenty of toner""

""Great... I knew you could come through with a solution now please get the toner and change out the new cartridge for the old one... I'll hold""

She finally agreed and the remote experiment in dentistry neared closure.

As he held and listened to her fumble and grumble another line rang. He checked the caller ID and answered quickly. ""Hey man, what's up?"" At least this guy wasn't a complete tool.

""Look man, we have a crisis. I knocked my computer off my desk and it was fine but I rebooted and not it doesn't work"" 

Oh my precious goodness, he thought. 

""..and anyway, it has this document on there and I was working on it when it crashed"" 

It crashed... priceless, he grinned.

""...and if I don't get that document in the mail before 6pm the IRS will eat our firstborn and then send us to the bad place... we have a crisis. Can you fix it?

""Yeah man, I'll do what I can just don't touch it""

""Don't worry"" said the user. ""I won't touch anything. I've already tried rebooting and using the recovery disk and it didn't get anything back""

He held an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall, once more.

""OK....!"" The customer was back. ""I changed the toner but the light is still flashing""

""OK..."" he said, ""Great. You did great we're almost done""

The phone rang again... it was another 800 number... he let it go and continued ""Just hit the clear error button on the top of the printer...""

""I am not -at- my printer. I am -at- my desk"", she hissed. ""Can you make up your mind?""

""Yes... Yes... Yes, I'm sorry, go back to your printer and clear the error and come back to your desk and talk to me."" Wow, this woman was starting the day nicely.

Again the phone rang... unknown number... no time to answer unknown calls. He let it go to voice mail.

She came back to the phone. ""OK -your- error light is off"" 

""Good"", he said, ""Notice on the remote panel on your screen... it says Printer Ready?""

""Yes, I see that..."" Her exasperation dripped from every word and she started moving the cursor but he grabbed it back...""

""Wait... just one second and let me check the process and make sure we are not chasing our tails. OK?"", he said still smiling a fake smile that probably sounded like fake helpfulness over the phone, then he printed a test page to the printer.

""OK, did anything print?""

""It's making a noise but it is -not- printing...""

He could pat her on her precious little head, now. ""Good... We like noise. That means the printer is warming up... just give it a second""

She growled, ""If I don't get these labels printed I guess I'll have to hand write them""

""Is anything printing?"", he asked.

""Something is coming out. I don't know what it is.""

In his mind he imagined her biting off her own smoke stained tongue, choking on it, gasping for air and turning blue but he said, ""Could you check for me?""

He heard her huff and bang her way to the printer. She had the most blank grey eyes that seemed to reflect her thought patterns. He tried to think of a happy place to calm his... the phone rang again... another 800 number. Another call he wouldn't answer 

""It is still not printing... all I have is a page that says 'Windows Test Page'... what did -you- do with my labels? "" 

""OK... great! We'll print your labels now."" He looked at her recently used documents and pulled up the first in the list. It was a label sheet but there were only 8 labels out of 30 that should have been populated, so he asked her, ""are these the right ones? Is this the right document?""

She rattled, ""Yes that's the one that you broke... now they wont print!""

""Oh, I can print them I just wondered if it was complete since there are only 8 addresses"" She broke in, ""Yes and those are our most important donors and board members. I've worked for weeks to put this mailing list together and now -you- can't print it.""

""Just hold on one second and we'll see what we have, now."" He clicked print and asked her, ""Are your labels printing now?""

""Something is printing, I don't know what it is. I guess you want me to go look again?"" She was an amazingly fast learner for a blithering brain damaged idiot. She picked up again. ""OK... my labels printed.""

""Wonderful"", he said. ""Just give me a call if you have another problem""

""I still don't understand how you broke it last night"" Her voice was like fingernails on a chalkboard

He held, again, an imaginary gun to his head and blew his imaginary brains into the wall. ""The printer was out of toner.... it is working now... Talk to you later.... Have a nice day"" and he ended the call.

This is worrying, because we don't know if she's made backups of the data on the network. She -should- have, she's intelligent enough to follow procedure and knows how important it is, but you never know. It sounds like the files are gone, or the USB drive has gone bad.

As she is working with a laptop, we do not have the setup to remote into her machine, but thankfully she's three doors down (WILL YOU STILL CALL ME SUPERMAN?), so my colleague goes to check it out. He says hi and sees the laptop, and the USB key next to it.

The lady sits down, opens 'My Computer' and says, ""See? I can't access my files, I can't see the USB key.""

My colleague looks again. Then he takes the key and plugs it into the computer.

The lady says ""Oh! It has to be plugged in?""

CaptainReallyObvious,129,200,1f2vrm,788,"So our company has several professional Facebook pages, which are maintained by the managers in their local store. I'm not actually from IT, but all internet and social media related problems land at my desk. The majority of shop managers is male. I'm female. 


The other day, an assistent-manager calls in a complete panic. 

""There's porn on  Facebook and I don't know how to get rid of it! ""

Me: ""Alright, calm down. Which FB page are we talking about and I'll take a look at what's wrong.""

Him: ""Store X'""

I look on the page. Nothing. The next ten minutes are spent trying to determine what he sees. Then another 10 in how he can take a screenshot and send it to me. 

Finally I get the screenshot. 

Indeed, there's porn.

A porn ad, to be more specific. 
C
As you might know, FB tracks all the stuff you do on the internet, links it and shows you ads based on that. So to me it was pretty obvious what happened, the user just likes to look at porn in his spare time and that's why he sees the ads. 

No biggie, right? Well: wrong. I see something else that made me dread explaining this. 

Me: who's currently logged into FB?

Him: Our store manager. (His boss). 

Me: [Um....](http://stickerish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NothingToDoHereBlackWithTextSS.png)

I ain't explaining to you what your boss does in his spare time. Gave him a story about targeted advertising and forwarded this to the IT guys to explain next time. (Sorry). 

**TLDR: Too chicken to explain to employee his boss watches porn.**

Edit: There's been some suggestions in the comments that it wasn't a porn ad. I am 95% certain it was, so tomorrow I'll upload a copy of the screenshot (edited for personal info) so you can see for yourselves.

Edit2: Here's the ad: http://i43.tinypic.com/10p7mv5.jpg

It's in Dutch. I'll translate:

1. Men Only!
*Only 18+ men may enter here. [Click here]


2. Challenge yourself
*Reach your target distance with smarter training schedules on MY ASICS.
*Use now

3. Beenmode.nl (leg fashion)
*Smart, sexy and fashionable, from socks to stockings, for every man and woman.

Edit3: Went and talked with IT and they assured me that it couldn't be malware. They gave me several reasons that sounded plausible (to me). I hope I can reproduce them correctly.

1. We're on Citrix servers, which are supposed to be a secure environment. All program data that isn't part of the user profile is wiped whenever someone logs out/in. Only user files and settings are saved.
2. Citrix servers get rebooted every weekend, so even if some type of virus/malware lingered, it'll be purged during the reboot.
3. USB-ports from computers are closed.
4. Internet outside of Citrix isn't possible, except on one computer at the service desk. All employees can access internet from there (to look up product info, I guess). This computer has no access to secure information (which is all stored on Citrix).
5. The person who called me was not on that particular computer but on a secure computer in the back-office.

Edit4: Now I'm wondering: is it possible for the user to download malware at home, have it affect his Facebook profile, which is then saved and displayed on other computers? Or is that crazy talk? 

Edit5: I've spent an hour on Reddit now. Going offline and back to work. I'll check in later.

Edit6: Thanks for all the speculation. I had a blast. Our IT guys assure me everything is fine (I showed them this thread and all your explanations) so... I'm going to go ahead and trust what they have to say. They'll keep an eye out for suspicious stuff and we're sending out a memo to never log into another user's Citrix profile. ","""Help!

seimungbing,134,150,17qhd7,789,"A buddy of mine who worked as network IT just got layoff from work early January. According to him, the company is losing money, so the CFO hired a consultant to ""trim"" the company of useless parts. After couples of months of investigation and interviewing, it is decided that the IT department is not making any money and out all the problems reported from the company, only 3% is IT related. Now any person who remotely understand how IT department works, will know this IT department is doing an AMAZING job keeping all the servers and equipment working flawlessly, but the consultant is not just any person, he is the anti-Christ of IT. His proposal to the CFO: IT department is bleeding money with useless equipment purchase and not recycling old equipment, and since only so little problems are IT related, it is recommended to trim the IT department.

Fast forward to January, the 3/4 of the IT department is handed the pink slip on the first Friday, ONLY the tier 1 support is left (people who assign reported problems to appropriate personnel). To make things sweeter, they were in the middle of a major network upgrade, only paused from mid-November to end of December due to holidays and people taking vacation, and literally EVERYONE from the department who are working on the transition with Cisco are fired. Under the contract, Cisco only needs to hook up the cables to the switches, and all the tuning and migrating are done internally to save money.

The entire project was ongoing for more than 6 months with minor hiccups to migrate users to the new network. On the very first Monday after the IT department was sacked and left, all the servers went offline, none of the non-migrated users can access the internal network, and all the sites the company hosted for other company are inaccessible. First, the company tried to get the Cisco people to fix the network, but under penalty of fines and imprisonment, they are not allowed to touch anything. Then under frantic management, the CEO and CFO contacted the entire original networking IT crew, tried to rehire them, including my buddy. Already foreseeing this will happen, they ALL refused the offer, and only agreed to return as contractors with 5x the hourly pay + overtime (vs. salary that has no real OT pay). With no other viable choice at hand, the company gave in to the demand, and the consultant was promptly ""let go due to extreme budget constrain and cut"".

I was still working for Ron replacing all the computers in the school, and the execution of my revenge plan on the two boys was still a few weeks away. By now, most classrooms had been installed and I was given a huge stack of DVDs to image all the computers.

A very boring job, but at least he gave me more than one disk so I could image at least one or two classrooms at a time. I used the downtime to snoop around in the classrooms. What else would you expect from a 16 year old girl?

There wasn’t much to find, to be honest — just some random strange stuff in drawers, the answers for a lot of old exams and chewed up chewing gum (a lot of it, and not just on the desks). Then there was a diary. It belonged to a girl from my class that I had not particularly hated or liked. But some high quality intel on this girl would not hurt. I opened it up and read through it, focused on deciphering her sloppy handwriting.

I was startled when somebody walked into the room. It was a school concierge. School was to start in 2 weeks again and needed to be cleaned. The concierge (let’s call him Fred) was a moron. Not just a regular moron; he was designed to be a moron. He always did things wrong and said the most inappropriate things. And now he stood in front of me. I put down the diary; there was nothing interesting in it anyway.

“Leila, was it? Ron told me I should look for you, saying you could help me,” he said. “Help with what?” I replied, a bit dazed. “My computer is broken and I need to order new cleaning supplies,” he said with with urgency in his voice.

I had no choice other than to walk down with him to his office. I then realized why this building was in such a bad state. He was like Ron, breathing hard and irregular when we went down the stairs. Once at his office, he launched himself in his chair and took a sip of his Diet Coke. I looked at him disapprovingly. He responded by chugging the entire can down. Apparently, being civil wasn’t motivating him to just let the Coke can stand.

He pointed at his computer (the oldest one we had in the school), a Windows 98 machine with an ancient monitor attached. He opened Internet Explorer and tried to browse to the website to order his cleaning supplies. The site refused to load and an error popped up. It was just an error number. Great, just as well might not display anything. I decided to open his history folder. It was packed full going back years. “Did you ever clean the PC?” I asked. He answered proudly “I dust it off everyday, if that’s what you mean.” Good God. He was right, though: the computer looked like new.

“You also have to clean the PC every once in a while of files that are not necessary anymore — like cleaning up your desk from old documents and cans of Coke.” His world had changed. “You can do that!?” I showed him how to clean up the files and empty the trash and wrote down the instructions so he would not forget. The error was resolved, and he could get his cleaning supplies now. I am still amazed at how easy he was in all this. He showed the problem, let me do my work, followed my instructions and thanked me. At times like this, I just wish everybody was a moron.

* * *

I was now on the first floor again, just walking around a bit, delaying going upstairs. I wanted to do something other than putting a DVD into a computer and slowly watching the computer being imaged with a new installation. I walked around a bit on the ground floor taking in the emptiness of the school. I stopped and saw the cellar door. Nobody was allowed there and it was always locked. But I had the key now. I could go in.

I did go in.

The cellar was poorly lit. Many of the lights had died long ago. I picked up a torch light that was in a bin next to the stairs. Fred did not come down here often enough to actually fix them, so putting a torch light down the stairs was his way of fixing the problem.

The cellar was huge. It spanned the length and width of the ground floor. Next to me were heaps and heaps of paper: storage, old exams, and files. I took out a few boxes. They went back at least 15 years from what I could see. Nobody even cared to throw them away.

I walked further down to the left, making sure not to break my legs over any stray boxes and pieces of paper. There were a lot of bicycles, chairs, and sporting equipment. I could not walk down anymore without the fear of being crushed by the contents. I walked back and tried the right side next. I quickly stumbled upon a lot of computers — really old ones. There were early 1980s and 1990s computers covered in layers of dust as old as the machines themselves.

I noticed something again. These computers formed a wall. I knew there was more space behind it because when the torch light hit the ceiling it kept on going for quite a bit. There was something behind this great wall of computers and I needed to find out. I scanned the computers and saw there was one pile that was on wheels. I pulled it out. I needed to make a note to go to the hospital to get checked out because my jaw dropped again.

It was a secret hideout. There were couches, a table, notebooks, a refrigerator, and boxes full of food and drinks. The floor wasn’t concrete. It was a lot of carpets all covering each other. What was this place?

I looked around and started one of the notebooks. I could not go past the login screen, but it did not matter. Werner was his name. And I knew who he was. I shut down the notebook again and walked around watching for other things. I saw a safety exit. It was badly damaged, likely from being forced. I pushed the handle and it opened. I was outside. The door slowly closed behind me. I tried to open it again. It opened. Safety doors are not supposed to do that. They had broken it and used it as an entrance to their hangout cave.

I looked around a little more. I was behind the school now, in the forested area. You could come here easily, but there was really no point to it, so nobody ever went here. I spent the rest of my days imaging the PCs and wondering what the cave was for.

* * *

When school started again I went up to Werner, asking him about the cave. He went silent. Whether it was the fact that an actual  girl was talking to him or that I was talking about the underground hideout, I don’t know. He struggled to say something to me, and finally blurted “you are not going to tell anyone right!? You cannot tell anyone!” I assured him I would not — so long as he would tell me what it was all about. He told me go to the forested area and wait there for him after school ended at four. I had to wait another 5 hours. Screw me.

I silently sneaked into the forested area and waited for Werner. I realized this was all stupid and turned to leave when Werner came up, sweaty and nervous. He led me to the door and opened it. The light fell on about a dozen nerds. They were scared that they had been found out. They took a closer look at me and recognized me. “You work at that dump they call a computer store, right?” “Is that the best you can say to a woman entering your nerd cave?” I asked rather viciously. I wasn’t angry at them for calling it a dump, because honestly it was. But the fact that I was associated with it just hit me wrong. Werner quickly jumped in, not taking minutes to say something for a change, and told them I had found our hideout over the summer and he was forced by me to show what it was all about.

They calmed down and reluctantly introduced themselves. They were of all ages and types of nerd. This “gaming cave,” as they called it, had been set up years ago and passed down from generation to generation of misfit gamers. After school they would come here to work on their homework, play with the electronics and most of all play video games.

I liked that and joined them for the afternoon. I was surrounded by geeks and loved it. We had so much to talk about. After an awkward first hour they relaxed and at the end of the day they regarded me as a member. I was in: the first female member of the game cave.",Chapter 6 - Summer school Pt. 2,1497

**The Story**

So one day a 2Lt comes down to my office and begins to tell me the issues hes having. This guy comes off as a tech savvy individual as hes explaining all the troubleshooting hes done and what the issue might be. He claims faulty power supply as the machine is dead and doesnt boot. Hes checked all the cables (sometimes students kick the power cable out of the machine) and has come to the conclusion that this is the only thing it could be. So I have him wait at the door so I can grab my book and follow him to his classroom. 

These classrooms were all put together on the military dime, and someone decided that all the desks should have built in power strips and kill switches. Immediately upon entering the room, I can tell which desk is his, because whoever designed these desks decided the kill switch should be on the front of the desk at waist level, and his is the only one without a power light on.

This is where tech savvy Lt turns into cocky power hungry Lt around his peers. He goes on to explain that the military isnt training people right and spouts off a few more belittling things about people of low ranks. This is the fun part. So instead of simply showing him that he somehow managed to press the kill switch, I went through all my troubleshooting steps... thoroughly. After Ive exhausted all my normal fixes, I stood up and told him I have one more thing. I leaned against the desk (on the switch) and clapped my hands twice. Like magic the monitor came on and I powered on the machine. 

Puzzled and somewhat stunned the Lt bombarded me with questions of how and why that worked. I let him know that HP has been integrating Clappers into their machines for years. Of course he didnt believe me, but everyone around us chuckled and I left the room.

Unfortunately it wasn't the first time my morning as network manager started that way. I made my way to my office to dump my stuff and see what was going on. Since my office was as far from the front door as you can get without jumping out a window I had to run the ""network's down"" gauntlet through the office.

She wasn't a terribly technical person but managed the jargon okay and did a decent job of running interference (yes, pretty much like the IT Crowd frighteningly enough).

She told me: ""I think I broke the network.""  I nodded and waited for the explanation.  ""I was moving some files around and I think I dragged and dropped the wrong thing.""

You see, the day or so prior she had requested that I give her administrative privileges on our file server since she was ""in charge of IS"" and all. I remember shaking my head as I made the change and thinking no good could come of that.

Sure enough, I looked at the root of drive on the file server to see that she had dragged and dropped the root application folder (the file share everyone in the company used to access shared applications run from the server - and there were a lot of them including all of accounting and payroll) someplace inaccessible to everyone except an administrator.  I quickly moved the folder back and gave the heads up to my helpdesk folk who were just arriving to work what had happened.

The_Clops,349,209,1gq5uq,778,"Gripe post. I work as an AV Tech (i.e. gain-riding button monkey) at my university's student union. This month the only thing going on is daily New Student Orientations for incoming freshmen. I run sound/lights/projection for these. We also have student orientation leaders who lead the parents around campus to and from tours and presentations and answer general questions. Let me preface this by saying that these people work much harder than I have to and god knows I couldn't stay as upbeat as they do (we start at 6:30 AM and these go on every day for a month).

Every day a few of the student leaders hold a student panel so the parents can ask questions and almost every day they are asked technical questions that they are ill-equipped to answer (though they really do try). Some of my favorites:

* *When asked what kind of computer is recommended for students:*

""Most students have laptops, and we recommend either Apple or Dell. Engineering students especially like Dells."" *Ugh*. I actually think this is probably a prepped response because I rarely see students using Dells on this campus, and virtually none in engineering, but ALL of university-owned desktops are Dells. Smells like a business arrangement.  

* *When asked about WiFi:*

Lankshire,174,167,1emc06,775,"Here is one story. 

A customer came in. He has his very apathetic kid with him. The keyboard stopped working on a few keys She needs to do school work. Well, that usually a sign of liquid damage. Sure enough, we opened up the computer and found a good amount of corrosion on the mother board *and* water rings on the inside of the enclosure. Sweet. 

We let him know. We only have one option to fix it. Good part is its a flat rate, and its guaranteed to get fixed. Keep in mind I work in the heart of Silicon Valley. 

Me: ""So those are the options, would you guys want to send it out, or would you like to think about it?""

Customer: ""I think this is a manufactures defect. I work in the business and people touch logics boards with their hands.""

Me: ""Uh....I am not sure if I follow.""

C: ""How do you know that this was not caused by something that happened to the computer when it was being manufactured?""

M: ""Well, Mostly computers are built in dry environments that are tightly controlled, I doubt very much that a liquid damaged computer would have finished the testing process and then lasted three years with no sign of defect.""

C: ""I don't know about that. I tour factories all the time and I see people touch mother boards with their bare hands.""

M: ""I don't think I am seeing how touching mother boards with bare hands would cause this kind of corrosion, or the water rings. We touch them all the time here...""

C: ""Well, oil on the hands. Over time...""

M: ""So it was a fair amount of corrosion, and that would not explain the water rings. Have you ever left dishes to try and noticed the little spots on them? Same thing.""

C: ""I am just not accepting that there was liquid spilt on the computer. It's can't have been me or my daughter.""

M: ""Ok, so we have found evidence of liquid on the inside of your computer and corrosion. Because of this we only have the option I went over with you before. If you are denying service I can point you in the direction of a few other certified repair centers. However, we won't be able to cover this accidental damage under your warranty because your warranty does not cover accidental damage."" GLARE.

C: GLARE

the kid: Cell Phone

C: ""I want to talk to your manager""

FACEPALM. 

I was trying really hard to be understanding and nice. The real conversation was a lot longer, and was just a loop of the same ""bare hands!"" thing. At the end of the day he just did not want to pay for his kid being careless. Does it suck? Yes. But, its not the fault of the people trying to help you. 

Also, turns out in later conversation he's an accountant. Why is he touring computer assembly lines then? Hmmmm.

""When it rains, it pours,"" I grumbled, sipping at a drip-brewed cup of Dark Magic and practically purring at the strength and taste.

Given the lack of concentrated caffeine in Keurig-brewed coffee, I'd prised open ten K-cups of Dark Magic to fill a double-filter of coffee, which I then brewed up. The weather in Austin had started to get cool again, after a weekend that was an all-too-unpleasant reminder of the ball-scorcher that was summer, and my helldesk was absolutely swamped with tickets. On top of everything, my second-newest PFY had injured himself and was on reduced duty, so it fell to me to get things done in his stead.

""Never send a PFY to do a network admin's job,"" I continued, sliding back into my chair and sitting on my feet, as is my wont, and my cell phone burst into Rick Astley's dulcet tones, signifying an incoming call. I arched an eyebrow - I hadn't expected the campus tech to call me, not when he had a PFY to unload troubleshooting on. A quick flick of the screen later, and my One's speakers blasted his voice out into the office.

""Hey, Jack, we've got a problem here,"" he said, frustration evident in his voice.

""Is it NEW_PFY?"" I took a sip. ""Because I just happen to have the financial aid office at TEXAS_COLLEGE in my contact list.""

I could tell his reply would be negative before he even said it. ""No, he didn't do anything. He _knows better_. I've got something new for you.""

He detailed the situation, leaving nothing out - apparently, a kid had driven his expensive SUV out to off-campus lunch at a very popular nearby restaurant, and in his brilliance, when he ran into the restaurant, he left his tablet and phone on the front seat, and the car unlocked.

The imbecile also left his keys in the cupholder.

...

You can guess where this is going.

...

Ten minutes later, when he came out with his order, his gadgets were gone, and so was his nice new car.

He got a lift back from a friend who had stopped there for lunch after he did, and the administration was in an uproar. I shrugged. A car stolen? Whoopdy-shit, that's why we have insurance, it'd be covered. The tablet? Not so much. A police report had already been filed, and we were asked to track the tablet and phone in order to recover them, and if it was at all possible, to try to save the car.

_It's the principle of the thing,_ I thought to myself, as I plugged the kid's credentials into iCloud and threw his phone into Lost Mode. A few clicks later, the police report number was registered with Computrace, and the tablet flagged as stolen. _Such useful tools... but only in the right hands._ I smirked. _Of course, it would be a TRAGEDY if this were to be misused._

About twenty minutes later, the device stopped moving (ReloadEvery is SUCH a nice tool), and after pouring another cup of Dark Magic, I took a look at the final location. Something seemed... off... about it. I grabbed the nearest cross-streets and plugged it into Google Maps, then switched to Satellite View. 

My eyebrows went up at what I saw, and I put down my coffee cup before laughing my ass off and grabbing my keys. I drained my coffee, then dialed a number on my cell on the way out the door. I had a drive to make.

- - - - -

**A SHORT WHILE LATER...**

- - - - - 

I walked into the school, phone (and bag of fast food - from a _rather popular nearby restaurant_) in hand, and strolled into the campus tech's office.

""What're you doing here?"" he asked. ""Didn't you track the phone and tablet?""

I nodded, and passed him my One with Google Maps pulled up to the approximate location of the phone, followed by the bag of food. His eyes widened.

""You've got to be joking.""

I shook my head and flipped the phone to Gallery, showing him a picture I took not twenty minutes before (not entirely coincidentally, taken outside a _rather popular nearby restaurant_), and he started chuckling.

""I pity him."" I could sense the laughter rising in him, and he stood up and locked his machine. ""The kid's in the office,"" he said, and walked out of his office, with me following. I threw a nod and a smirk to my newest PFY, who was sitting in the corner, stripping down machines for parts in his free period.

Sure enough, the kid was in the office, and his father was there too, as well as one Austin police officer with a notepad in hand.

""Did you find my phone?"" the kid said, jumping to his feet and looking at the campus tech frantically.

""Forget the phone,"" his father said. ""Where's the car?""

""I'm honestly surprised he doesn't know,"" I replied. ""Given what he did, he should know IMMEDIATELY where his phone and tablet - and yes, his car too - went.""

""What are you talking about?"" the dad said, his expression blanker than a new chalkboard.

""Does this look familiar?"" I said, turning my phone around to face the teenager and the father.

""I went to lunch there today; that's where my car got stolen,"" the kid retorted. ""So what?""

""Does THIS look familiar?"" I repeated, flipping to the next picture in the sequence, the one I'd shown the tech.

                            TOWING ENFORCED

    UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES WILL BE TOWED AT OWNER OR OPERATOR'S EXPENSE

His reply, much like his actions which kicked this off, was rather unwitty and lacking in common sense. ""I only parked there for, like, ten minutes!""

""And that's all they needed to take the car,"" I replied, flipping over to the phone's last location in Google Maps, which, when looked at via satellite view, was the towing company's storage lot. ""As of ten minutes ago, your phone was there, and I daresay you'll find the tablet and keys there too.""

His father glared at him.

The cop glared at him.

He glared at me.

I breathed on my fingernails, then buffed them on my button-down. ""So, phone found, tablet found, car found, universe saved, crisis averted. But just in case - next time, park in the appropriate areas.""

Mugros,236,200,19ytty,778,"We have a new researcher in our group for a few months now. She has a new MacBook Pro which she brought with her. (I asked her why she has a Mac and she said that it looks nice and is shiny. Well...) While I was setting up her network when she arrived it came up that she doesn't know the admin password to her own computer. I asked her to get in contact with the people who setup the computer in the first place, try some solutions from the internet or go to the local Apple dealer to get it fixed, since I don't want to waste my work time on broken private computers than necessary.  
Fast forward a few months to last week. She moved her office and at she needed to set up the printer and network in the room. The people in the room told me she needs to have more power sockets and a network application for a crappy old PC sitting on the desk while the MacBook is just next to it.  
I asked her why she wanted to use the old junk if she has a good MacBook to use. Well, because she still doesn't know the admin password and can't use it fully. I asked her why she didn't get it fixed since it's so much easier to have everything in one place and portable. The answer is quite possibly laziness and ignorance. There was a small argument that Dropbox is so great at syncing your files, so that working with two computers wouldn't be an issue at all. ""And what do you do if you have no network?"" Argument settled.  
So I asked her if she tried all the passwords and she said yes. While I was thinking to come up with potential passwords, since computer illiterates normally have very weak passwords, I asked her if she tried, well, nothing, just pressing enter. And while she was still thinking, I just did it and it went through....  
I actually did hint a facepalm to her face. I told her her password is.. nothing. And she started writing down ""noth.."" when I said ""No, nothing, empty, just enter.. "" when she finally got it.

TLDR: Try the obvious thing first next time.

Kicker: For her research project she has to program in C or C++. She never did program anything before. So, guess who is doing that...

Dear children.  When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING.  Every file she has ever saved.  Sitting on her desktop.  There were so many icons (no more room, in fact!) that the icons started repeating over top of other icons.  Three layers deep, in fact!

VolatileCurry,148,180,1l3028,769,"I work at a small computer repair shop and I get quite a few customers who are a bit... over the top. This one in particular was a different kind of special though. She had a terrible attitude and was incredibly obnoxious. Bear with me, because this one is a bit on the long side. It's mostly dialogue though.

A middle-aged woman walks up to the counter.

Customer: Do you fix computers?

Immediate red flag. She walked in through a door that says ""COMPUTER REPAIR"" on it.

* Me: We sure do!
* Customer: How much does it cost?
* Me: ... Well that depends on what you need done. What's wrong with it?
* Customer: I don't know it doesn't work.
* Me: Okay.. So when you say it doesn't work... What exactly is it doing?
* Customer: I don't know!
* Me: Does it turn on?
* Customer: Yes.
* Me: Okay... So is it really slow? Does it boot to Windows?
* Customer: I don't know that, you're supposed to tell me. That's why I'm here!
* Me: *sigh* Okay well do you have the computer with you?
* Customer: No, it's in the car.
* Me: Okay. Can you bring it in so I can look at it?
* Customer: Ugh! I guess so.

She said that with a grunt as if she was expecting me to go out to her car and get it for her or something. I already knew this was going to be a nightmare. She goes out to the car and comes back with an older Toshiba laptop and sets it down on the counter. I turn the computer on and boots to the Windows log in screen relatively quickly. There's a password on it, so I ask her to sign in. She gave me a nasty look and then typed it in and logged on.

It took forever to actually sign in. As soon as the desktop appeared, it was bombarded by fake anti-virus, registry cleaners, and the nefarious 24x7 Help virus. I told her the computer was heavily infected and explained our costs and process for virus removals. She agreed to have it checked in I started taking down her info. Remember this part, because it's important.

* Me: Okay, now I'm going to need the password for the computer
* Customer: Why do you need that?
* Me: So I can log into Windows... I'll need to do that throughout the repair...
* Customer: Well it's personal.
* Me: Okay... Well if you want the computer fixed, I'm going to need it.
* Customer: I don't care! I'm not giving it to you! I don't give my password to anyone!

I should have just told her I couldn't help her and sent her on her way. But alas... I did not...

* Me: Okay well if you won't give it to me I'll just remove it.
* Customer: How are you going to do that?

I wasn't about to explain to her the process of removing a Windows password. 

* Me: *big smile* We have our ways.
* Customer: Whatever. Go ahead.
* Me: Alrighty, well you're all set then. Given the amount of work that needs to be done, the process can take a day or two to finish. We'll give you a call when it's ready.
* Customer: What?! I thought you could just do it and I could wait here for it.
* Me: No... There's a lot of work to be done here. First there's diagnostic tests, which take a few hours to finish. Then there's the virus scanners I'm going to run, and then I have to do some manual work to clean up the rest of the stuff. There's no way I could get it done before closing time today.

She wasn't happy about this, but I finally got her to leave and went about my business. I set her computer to run hardware diags so I could verify that there wasn't a bad HDD or something silly like that going on before I start the virus removal work. Then the phone rang.

* Me: Thanks for calling &lt;store name&gt;, how can I help you?
* Customer: I want to know if my computer is ready.
* Me: Okay what's your name?
* Customer: &lt;gives me her name&gt;
* Me: Okay I only just started that one a little while ago. I quoted you a day or two, right?
* Customer: Yeah but I thought you might get it done quicker.
* Me: ... Well no, I didn't. But when I do finish it, I will call you to tell you.

She hangs up and the day goes on. Then the phone rings again... And it's her again.

* Customer: You're not gonna delete my stuff are you?
* Me: No I don't think that's going to be necessary. 
* Customer: So when I get it back, it's going to be exactly the way it was when I brought it in?
* Me: Yup! Well.. Minus the viruses of course.

She hangs up. All her hardware passed diagnostics a few minutes before the store closed, so I set it to run a series of anti-virus scanners over night and went home. I opened the following morning and the phone was already ringing when I walked in the door. I don't answer phone calls before the store opens, so I ignored them while I did my opening duties. The phone rang a few different times in the first hour that I was there and I finally answered it after unlocking the door.

* Me: Thanks for calling &lt;store name&gt;, how can I help you?

Guess who it is...

* Customer: I'VE CALLED SEVEN TIMES AND NOBODY ANSWERED THE PHONE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER!
* Me: I'm sorry ma'm but we literally just opened the store. That's why nobody answered the phone. The answering machine tells you our store hours.
* Customer: I don't care! I know you get there before 10:00AM and I KNOW you ignored the phone. Now give me your manager, I want to give him a piece of my mind!
* Me: My manager isn't here, ma'm it's just me right now. I apologize for the inconvenience but there is a lot to do before the store can open and we don't start taking calls before store hours. My manager would tell you the same thing.

She continued to argue with me about it and I tried to be as apologetic as possible, even though I didn't feel bad in the slightest bit. I got fed up with it after a couple of minutes and just asked her what she wanted.

* Customer: I need to know if my computer is finished.

I was starting to get really annoyed with her and I cut back my nice guy attitude and laid into her a bit.

* Me: No, of course it's not. I told you yesterday it would take at least a day. I left it to do some automated tasks over night, but the bulk of the manual repair work still needs to be done and it's going to take several hours to complete and I haven't even gotten a chance to look at it yet this morning because I've been talking to you on the phone since the store opened. Now there's no reason to keep calling us because I will call you as soon as the computer is ready. If you call me again before I call you, I'm going to tell you the exact same thing.

She was really quiet for a few seconds before she spoke up.

* Customer: Well how long is it going to take?
* Me: Several hours at least. It might even take until tomorrow. I'll call you when it's ready.
* Customer: What time do you think tomorrow?
* Me: I don't know. I'll call you when it's ready.

She finally hung up. Frustrated as hell, I sat down and started working on her computer before even looking at repairs that had been there longer than hers. I manually removed the 24x7 Help Virus and all of the fake anti-virus and registry cleaners, etc. Booted to Windows and immediately got a BSOD related to a program I removed that was still trying to start at boot. So I went back to my boot disc and fixed the issue. After messing with it for a while, I got it into Windows and it appeared to function normally. I rebooted it several times and ran some other scanners to verify that everything was gone. I did all this in between working on other computers, phones, and dealing with customers up front.

I managed to finish the computer in the mid-afternoon and I called her to come get it. She saw a different employee at the front counter when she came in and she asked to speak to me personally. I told the employee to tell her I was on break or something and I couldn't help her. She eventually left.

Later in the day, it was the end of my shift and I was about to clock-out and walk out the door. The phone started ringing and the other employee was dealing with a customer and asked me to answer it. You'll never guess who it was.

* Me: Thanks for calling &lt;store name&gt;, how can I help you?
* Customer: I picked up my computer from you a little while ago and now it's stuck.

I immediately recognized the voice and took a deep breath. I remembered the BSOD I got at boot earlier that day and I was dreading the thought that it was the same thing and I somehow didn't fix it, even though I was sure I did.

* Me: What do you mean by ""It's stuck""?
* Customer: I don't know I turn it on and it's just stuck and you need to fix it!
* Me: Do you see a blue screen with text on it?
* Customer: Yes.
* Me: Great... Have you tried rebooting the computer?
* Customer: Yeah and it just does the same thing. There's a flag on the screen.

I was about to tell her to bring it back in, but then I caught that she said there was a flag.

* Me: Wait.. A flag? What do you mean?
* Customer: It's like red and blue and yellow and green.
* Me: You mean like.. The Windows logo?
* Customer: Yeah I guess.
* Me: Okay. And is it in the center of the screen?
* Customer: Yes.
* Me: Do you see your mouse pointer?
* Customer: Yes.
* Me: Can you move it around?
* Customer: Uhh... Yeah.

Suddenly, there's a spark of hope. 


* Me: Can you see your desktop icons? 
* Customer: What's that?
* Me: They're like... The icons on the desktop? You know.. When you logged in yesterday, there were a bunch of desktop icons. One should say ""Internet Explorer""
* Customer: Yeah I see that one.
* Me: Okay can you double click it?
* Customer: Okay.
* Me: What happened?
* Customer: MSN came up.

I was shocked. Never before have I encountered a customer that didn't recognize her own desktop or know the meaning of the word ""stuck"".

* Me: ... Okay, then your computer isn't stuck. It sounds like it turned on normally.
* Customer: It did NOT turn on normally. I'm used to seeing my picture and I have to type my password to get in.
* Me: Well... It's not asking you for your password because I had to remove it.
* Customer: WHAT?! I thought you said I wouldn't lose any of my stuff! What else did you get rid of?!

This is where I lost it.

* Me: Nothing! You didn't lose any actual data. All your pictures, music, documents, whatever, it's all still there --
* Customer: I never had any music!
* Me: Okay, it doesn't matter. I got rid of the viruses and got the computer working again without losing any data. I had to remove your password because you refused to give it to me yesterday, and I warned you that I was going to do it and you told me to go ahead. There's nothing wrong with your computer. Have a nice day.

I then hung up the phone and left. The next morning, my boss told me I got a customer complaint after I left. I've never had a complaint before, but I wasn't really surprised because I knew what it was about. And luckily my manager is a really cool and understanding guy. 

* Me: Was it &lt;insert customer name&gt;
* Boss: How'd you know?
* Me: Because she was a bitch and she kept arguing with me over absolutely nothing. What did she say?
* Boss: She said you were rude and unhelpful.
* Me: UNHELPFUL?! Don't even get me started on this lady. I might have been rude to her, but I couldn't get her off the phone any other way. I'm sorry, man.
* Boss: Nah, it's fine. She sounded like she just likes to complain. But I saw your notes from yesterday about how she kept calling before the store opened. What an idiot.

I started laughing out loud at this. And luckily, I never heard from her again.

Now it was during my time slinging bits and bytes for the Feds, and in particular the tax collection parts thereof, that the result of the national leader of the day's weaseling on the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax came to a head. Most famously, he had declared some years back that it would ""never ever"" be a part of his party's policy after it had pretty much been the single cause of their defeat in a previous election. Of course, as it was one of his long-term pet policies, this was so much smoke and mirrors. Coming to power later on, he squeaked into a second term in office (technically actually losing the popular vote) and immediately declared that this was obviously a mandate to implement said pet tax (even though he couldn't get it supported without going to other parties). Thus, political shenanigans and power plays went on behind closed doors so he could force it into existence.  

So far, so national politics.  

Now, if you read the *official* histories, the tax was implemented halfway through the year 2000, presumably after all the glad-handing and subtle machinations. However, my tale comes somewhat earlier in the calendar... as in a good year or two beforehand.  
   
  
You see, I had shown up at work one day, suspecting nothing out of the ordinary, and been asked if I would mind assisting with the installation of a new server. Nothing fancy, just babysitting the hardware, running a couple of tests, and generally being eyes and hands on the ground for the central server team. Nothing strange about that, right?  

Only... the server was being installed in a building my employer had never operated out of before. And indeed, there was much in the way of outfitting and cubicle erecting and furniture schlepping going on, I noticed, as I wandered into the new site. Funny, as I hadn't heard of any new infrastructure expansion, at least through official channels...  

A quick glance through the specialist chapters of the installation procedures, plus a little knowledge of government acronyms, soon lifted the veil from my eyes. I was installing the central server for the ""never ever"", ""couldn't possibly have had all the details worked out yet, no siree"" Goods and Services Tax team. The election was barely over; the money and (most importantly) details I was looking at couldn't possibly have been arranged in the time between then and now. Someone had been planning this for quite some time.  

There were a number of other discrepancies, as well. The team wasn't referred to by any official name other than that on the front of the building. Much of the documentation was, shall we say, whitewashed of any identifying nomenclature. There was even public-information frontage built on the ground floor of the building at the same time, unconnected to the hidden team in the back offices, so that no-one would express any surprise upon hearing that the Tax department was operating out of that address, or raise an eyebrow at the furniture and office kibble being trucked in. In short, it was deliberately designed so that the general public wouldn't get wind of the fact that the GST team was up and running far, far before it was ever supposed to exist even on paper.  
   
  
Our intradepartmental procedures and processes were quietly expanded to include the new server on our list of supported items, but it was always just ""server 20"", its purpose never alluded to in any documentation which might even remotely find its way to the press. And then, one day, many months later... ""Oh gosh, looks like the party in power got support for this GST thing after all, what a surprise!""
   
  
A surprise for some, perhaps.

seraph77,114,141,1ip3e2,772,"I work as a T3 Linux/Windows sysadmin at a fairly large datacenter where we provide unmanaged colocation space. We have a leftover support model from when we were much smaller, which allows basically every customer to call in and get a T2 or T3 guy instantly. 

I've basically devolved into BOFH. Hopefully some admins out there share my pain. Here's a list of common stuff I get to deal with in no particular order:

(C = client, M = me)
 

* multiple failed drives in a RAID array that client wasn't monitoring

C: where do you keep the backups of my server?

M: the same place you do.

C: we don't have backups, we shouldn't need to because we run RAID!

M: I think your current situation disproves that statement.



* site coded 10 years ago gets compromised via SQL injection

C: my site got hacked! Can you fix it?

M: probably not. The site needs to be completely reworked as it is extremely outdated.

C: can you do that for me?

M: ~~sure, let me just press this magic fucking button next to me~~ No ma'am, we're system administrators, not webdev/coders, not to mention you're talking multiple hours of work.

* incredibly outdated OS gets rooted

C: my server is running really slow and acting strange

M: it looks like you are saturating your port with outbound traffic. You're probably part of a DDoS attack to some poor sap's website.

C: what?! How could you let this happen?

M: **WE** didn't let this happen. You are running an OS that was EoL 6 years ago. Even if we manage to clean it up, it will probably be compromised again within a week. You really need to install a current version and restore from backups.

C: Where are my backups?

M: *oh you*

C: are you guys going to call the Cyber Police and have whoever did this arrested and make them fix my server?

M: Sodium Hypobromite, it doesn't work like that. Sadly, the FBI's Cyber Crime division probably doesn't have time to investigate which 13yo script kiddie ""hacked"" your vulnerable, outdated server.

C: what?! I'm going to sue you guys for letting my server get hacked!

M: ~~bwahahaha please do, I would love to be present for the hearing~~ I understand your frustration.

* Web or other random service down

C: my server is down! Are you guys having network issues?

M: ~~yes, all five of our backbone connections just happen to be down at the same time~~ No. I'm able to connect to your server via SSH. Have you logged in and checked Apache/MySQL?

C: What's SSH?

M: You run a Linux server and don't know what SSH is??

C: I manage the server through WordPress.

Incident came in today, needed to be fixed asap, which was tonight.

My Story:
I was doing a Emergency change for work, from home. Limited support available for me.
I found the fix, and it was just simply change a config file and bounce the service
Tonight came, I remote in, all good. Change the config file. Attempt to bounce the service.
Herein started the problem. - The service wont fucking stop! Stuck on ""Stopping"" - Typical windoze.
So I was like, okay, that's fine, I'll just kill the process manually, like I would on *nix.
I go into task manager, kill the proccess manually. Then I try to start the service again,
All I get is ""Windows started the service, but it exited shortly afterward""
That was it - Change failed, job over.
So I go into the log, check what's going on. See THOUSANDS of ""dbload - error loading schema"" errors.
(The database is huge - 5GB, About 5 years of data and sensitive client information)
I was like, shit, the database is rooted, some keys have corrupted or something.

* At this point I am shitting myself, so I decide to go outside and have a smoke for sanity's sake.

Came back stressing a little bit less.
Checked the log again - Turns out the errors were from some stupid long-running database query someone was running. 
The log indicated that half of the app was still running (Kind of the back end part I don't usually touch) - So I went back into taskman, and killed it.
After that it started and was fine. *sigh of relief*

The_Juggler17,151,167,19pwia,767,"Had a pretty funny one last week

After installing a new laptop and monitor for some lady at our office, she called me back and said that the text was blurry and the monitor wasn't working very well at all.

I was truly concerned that there was something wrong with the monitor, as I've saw this sort of thing before. So I grabbed a replacement of the same model, some new cables, and headed over to her office.

When I got to her office, she said ""look how blurry this screen is!""
There was not a thing wrong with that monitor, it was just fine.

So I went ahead and installed the replacement, and then increased the text DPI size, increased the size of icons, windows, and such - made everything bigger.

The ""new monitor"" was much better and she was glad I got rid of that old broken one. I never said anything about her poor eyesight, these people don't want to be told when they're wrong - and I'm not her optometrist anyway.

TL;DR - lady has poor eyesight, says her monitor is too blurry

**Clarification:** In regard to not telling her that here eyes were bad and not the monitor - it's really best to just let people in that department think whatever they want to think. In the past, when I've corrected them or told them they were wrong, it didn't go well at all.

If I had told her that her eyes were bad - at best she would have told me off in front of some of the VPs of the company, at worst she would have filed a complaint with my manager. People want to think they're right about everything, and sometimes It's just best for me to let them keep thinking that - perhaps it's passive and lazy, but much easier.

-jackschitt-,225,191,1177ir,768,"We have a new manager who insists on everything being done *her* way.  And only *her* way.

Without going into too much detail.....we use a particular piece of software that is used by over 2000 companies in the country.  Of course, not every company has the same needs, so the software company develops the software that will meet the needs of all 2000 customers as much as possible.

One of our reports is a weekly checkoff sheet, and the report gives five blank boxes....one for each day of the work week.  The thing is....they're not labelled MTWTF.  Some companies use this sheet five times a day, and some companies have a work week other than MTWTF, along with a list of other uses this report could be used for.  

Well our new manager was not happy that this did not automatically label the boxes MTWTF for her, and asked if I was able to generate the report with the boxes pre-labelled.  I told her that that could not be done because the report is meant to be used in a variety of different ways.  

So she asks *me* to reprogram the software and add the MTWTF labels.  I tried to explain to her (a) I am not a programmer, (b) I do not have access to the source code even if I were, and (c) it would be illegal for me to do so anyway.  She did not like this answer.

""You're the computer guy.  Isn't this stuff what they're paying you for?"" she says.  

""No, they pay me to troubleshoot and support the software.  Not rewrite it.  There's a difference."".  I said.  She of course continues to have absolutely no clue what that difference is.  

I was then asked if I had contacted the vendor about this ""major"" issue, and I explained to her that the reports are specifically made that way because other companies use these checkoff sheets in a variety of different ways; pre-labelling the sheets MTWTF would screw up the companies that have a different work week or that use the sheet for a different purpose, and there's no way the vendor could possibly program all the possible ways that 2000 different companies use the sheet.  

""Well find a way to do it.  This is completely unacceptable."", and she stormed out of the room.  

She doesn't quite get the concept that (a) what she's asking for is not possible, and (b) she's not my boss.  

I hate my job sometimes.  /rant

EDIT:  And by the way....we've been using the software across numerous districts now for over a year.

Kerid25,164,156,1ea8cj,764,"Hey all! After two weeks of lurking around this awesome subreddit I figured I would share a story or two.



A little bit of background, I do tech support for medical devices in hospitals, managed by the pharmacy and used by nurses. When pharmacy is unavailable, the nurses do what they can with what they know. If a new nurse comes in, they can generate a temporary user for the nurse, and the system will generate a random string of 6 letters, these are usually gibberish.



I get a call the other day, the nurse is obviously pretty upset, she said one of us MUST be playing tricks on her and started insulting her. Because of course we have time for this! So I asked her if she knew the other agent's name, she didn't, so I went to look at the hospital's tickets and the last ticket was several weeks ago and her name wasn't even in the system so she obviously didn't call before. She starts explaining she's a new nurse and had her boss generate a user for her, and that the system was insulting her. I asked how could a computer possibly be insulting her, she said there was profanity in her user ID, and she wouldn't say it on the phone (calls are recorded, my boss would have loved to hear it).



I eventually managed to get her to take a picture of the screen and send it to me by email, I don't think I ever hit the mute button so quickly. Her user ID, and remember, this is all randomized, it could be ANYTHING... was FUCKEU.



I had her boss recreate the user ID and they were good to go, still I wish she would have kept that user ID, would have made for some interesting transaction reports.

setthuzzolo,118,124,1i5ghq,761,"This story takes place oh-so-many years ago. I was in the last year of high school and dynamic websites were fairly new. My computer science professor knew I was looking for a job and told me that a friend of his was looking for a student to work for him.

I meet up with the professor's friend who tells me the company promised a website to a *major* ambulance building company but he didn't have anybody with any experience in building a dynamic site from scratch; he only had a designer that created the mockup. He asked me if I could create something like that and I told him that although I knew HTML I never built anything like that, but I was willing to learn and do the job. He said the website was already late and the company only gave them six weeks to deliver the finished product or they'd take their deposit back plus a penalty. I said ""bring it!""

The deal we made was that I'd come to the office every day for a week and, if I'd show him I could get the job done, he'd hire me. Sound fair. So I came to work for the next ten days and studied everything I could about dynamic websites, how to prepare an NT server (he didn't have any linux machines) to run them, and how to use databases through Perl (that's how he wanted it). After the ten days were over I had the first draft of the website up and running. I showed the boss and asked if he'd hire me. He said that was impressive but the end product wasn't like the designer illustrated, I tried to explain ""first draft"" to him, but still said he'd want to see the finished project first. Ok.

Fast forward another week or so, the website's finally done, way ahead of schedule. Sure, the source code wasn't pretty, but the website looked and worked as requested: there was a database with all the products, the customer could choose the base vehicle, add every piece of instrumentation, get a quotation for the finished ambulance and place the order online. I also created a CMS (didn't even know it was called that at the time) so that the customer could update his database online. Doesn't seem like much now, but it was 2000 and I was a damn proud 19yo. So I show this to the boss. His answer was ""ah, good good, now just add the price conversion in euros and fix this border"" to which I reply ""ok, how about that contract we were talking about?""  
""Ah no, I can't... You see you don't even have a high school diploma and no experience in the field, so I can't hire you. But when the website's done I'll pay you and we can keep working like that: I'll pay you for every project you finish.""  
""Ok, so this one's finished, I can fix those two things in 10 minutes tops. So...""  
""Yeah, finish those and then I'll pay you.""

I didn't. Every day I kept coming back to the office and asked for my payment, every day he kept saying he'd ""pay me later"", everyday I capped his bandwidth (I had an ISDN line at home, this was a T1, it was AWESOME!), and every day I went back home. I'd have to take the train both ways and, of course, buy lunch. All this time I did nothing but nag the boss about my dues and talk to the other employees. Excluding the boss six people worked there: the designer, the incompetent hottie at the phone and four high school students that ""would be paid eventually"". These guys were working just as hard as me: one of them was preparing a linux box that would become the mail server, another one was working on some projects on Auto CAD, can't really remember what the other one did. Once, when talking to the girl, she let it slip that we weren't the only highschoolers that worked there, but many stopped showing up after not being paid long enough. She also let it slip that the website I was working on was being paid as much as a supercar.

And so I downloaded stuff from kazaa and bugged my boss until the customer came back asking a progress report. The boss brought them in the employee area, saw me smiling really wide and was smart enough to ask the designer to tell them how the website was coming along. He hadn't seen anything about the website ever since he drew the mockup and only heard hearsay so his progress report was something on the line of ""yeah we only need to add the euro conversion and fix a border and it's gonna look exactly like the pictures you already saw"". They weren't pleased.

Later that day the boss called me in his office to talk  
""So, how's the website?""  
""All nice and ready. I just have to copy it to the server.""  
""So, ehm... You've been coming here every day, right?""  
""Yup. It's been almost a month now. I have to take the train every day.""  
""And how much does it cost you?""  
""I pay X each way.""  
""So, 2X a day, five days a week, here you go: 40X. So can you copy the site on the server?""  

That was the day the bastard learned that ""you have nothing in writing"" goes both ways. I took the money, went back to my computer, erased the whole thing and walked out the door none the richer but all the wiser. The best part was hearing my professor scold me in class: ""he failed his deadline, had nothing at all to show for it, had to pay back the deposit and a penalty for half of the cost of the entire project! He had to file for bankrupcy!""  
I explained exactly how things went down and had another student that worked there confirm what I said.

My favorite story involves a particular idiot student that I busted. One of my agents comes up to me and explains he has a departmental deskside guy on the phone that needs to report a stolen laptop. I have him transfer the call to me....

The guy explains that the laptop was stolen a couple days ago from one of the classrooms. Luckily he has the MAC address which saves us a lot of time. I pull up the network logs and search for the mac address to find out if it has been on the network since it was stolen. Well what have we here..... it just got on the network 5 minutes ago! I take the IP and reference it with our application logs (which track the IP of who accesses web materials like blackboard, school email etc for security purposes). Hmmmm, this douche actually was dumb enough to use this STOLEN laptop on OUR network to access his school email. Now I have this idiot's username. I reference the IP address and subnet and now have the exact building and floor of the wireless network he is on, it's a dorm. Now I proceed to find the user's name using his login and check our student directory. His dorm room happens to be in the same building and same floor. At this point I put the deskside guy on hold and call the campus police.

A couple hours later the cop calls me back to get all of the details I collected for their investigation. He tells me that the kid nearly pissed himself when they showed up at his door and asked if he knew anything about a stolen laptop being used in his room. He immediately confessed and was dumbfounded at how quick we caught him.

mach_kernel,216,210,rrqa6,761,"I'm a 17 year old high school student working IT in the NYC metropolitan area - scoring the job from an interview last year in August. It's been my first corporate job ever and unfortunately the most shitty thing that I've managed to do my entire life. I work with incompetent idiots that hide behind their degrees and create the shittiest possible solutions for the most simple problems. 

This just happened the past week:

The servers at work are mostly Windows servers running either 2003 R2 or 2008 R2 - but we have about four or five *nix machines - two old outdated boxes running RHEL 4 and one IBM machine running AIX. Something happens (I don't know the specifics since I don't come in until the afternoon) and the root partition (which also happens to contain all the data) seems to be shafted. There are three middle-aged guys sitting in front of a shell sweating, so I just huddle in behind them and look at what's going on. Apparently the partition manages to mount when you pass the force flag to the command, and at this point, they seem content since everything is back up and running (for now). I tell them ""guys, I'd really suggest that you unmount and stop using the partition while it's damaged - run fsck for jfs just to be on the safe side!"". The server does some sort of database job (they don't tell me everything) so being back up it starts writing a ton of shit to and from the disk, using the same partition. 

My boss responds with a ""Kid, go back to installing Windows. We've got this and we don't need some boy butting in."" Alright - that was fine for me, seeing as how I only get paid 10 an hour if you want to voluntarily run off a cliff then you can go right ahead and do it. They applied some updates and made some changes to that machine over the course of a few hours and at one point had to restart. Upon reboot the partition didn't want to mount at all. My superiors were all crowded along side a computer trying their best to get it to mount but the mount command just threw error messages and random shit galore. It was time to call IBM corporate support since the genius minds that work with me apparently find that it was IBM's fault that all of this was happening. 

I try to approach my boss again since I kinda feel bad for those egotistic assholes: ""Hey, you guys need any help?"". I get responded to with ""NO GO SIT DOWN AND GO AWAY NOW I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER AFTER THIS IS DONE"". I'm offended at this point so I just sit down and watch them sweat it out like dogs. IBM support is on speaker for whatever premium rate they pay - and some guy comes on. They tell them the problem and what happened from the morning up to the point where I came and they forcemounted and continued using it. 

The guy said verbatim ""uuuhhhhhh, you should've ran fsck to repair errors in the filesystem before using it again - that's a big no no sir.""

I sit back in my chair with the biggest smug smile on my face while my boss turns incandescent red. He slams the phone in the receiver and has someone else call while he has a fit. Everybody in the IT office remained there that day except me - I just went home and felt fucking awesome.

I: My laptop won't turn on


Me: Is it charged?


I: It was on 1% then it just turned off, but it said I had another 10 minutes.


I proceed to take the laptop from her and plug in the charger we have ready to check if the laptops are charged. The light on the charger doesn't turn on. I try to turn the laptop on anyway. Nothing


Me: I'm going to have to take a look inside.


I: OK


I flip the laptop over and open it up to find, lo and behold, all the parts intact, except for one...


Me: There's no battery in here!


I: Yeah, I opened it up too to see what was wrong and there was this metal box that was really hot so I took it out


Me: What do you mean you opened it up?!? What did you do with the battery?


I: I threw it in the bin. I thought it was broken.


It is at this time that K walks back in to the office, coffee in hand, and notices the laptop's lack of a battery.


K (to me): Why'd you take the battery out?


Me: I didn't, I opened it and it was gone. This student here took it out and threw it in the bin because she thought it was broken.


K: Go and get yourself a coffee, I'll handle this.


When I return I see the laptop is still there but I isn't. K tells me we can't fix it or get her a new one because she violated school IT rules by opening it, and she seemed pretty annoyed about it.

-jackschitt-,272,223,xe11s,755,"My day starts with a phone call:  ""Hey Jack, can you open up site1 for some maintenance workers on your way into the office?  Thanks!""

This was almost immediately followed by a phone call from someone who needs a keyboard replacement after spilling a large iced coffee on it.  This was right near site1, so this wasn't a major issue.

Then I get a phone call from a regional office; she can't get online and wants me to stop in and see what's wrong.  This was right near site2, and I was beginning to like the fact that everything was happening so close to each other.  Also, the lady lodging the complaint about not being able to get online has virtually no need to get online in the first place outside of checking emails a couple of times a day.  She wasn't distressed or anything, so I decided to put her a lower priority and handle the first two issues first.  

45 minutes pass, and she calls me up screaming at the top of her lungs.  ""I CAN'T PRINT A DAMN THING AND I NEEDED THIS STUFF PRINTED 15 MINUTES AGO!  WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?!?!?!""

There are a number of things that need to be printed before she can start her week so that the right people can sign what needs to be signed.  Had I known that she was having a printer issue, I'd have put her at a much higher priority, even if it meant going out of my way to backtrack to sites 1 and 2.  

""Jill, you didn't tell me that.  You told me that you couldn't get online.  Those are two totally separate issues.  Had I known that your printer was down, I'd have gone to you first.""

""Well you should have known.""  *(apparently I woke up in bizarro land this morning where being unable to print and being unable to get online are the exact same thing.)*

So I get over there and -- as I'm sure you'd expect -- the problem was that she didn't hit the gigantic power button on the front of her printer.   Right in the middle of rolling my eyes, she says ""Now I can't get into my fucking email.  Fix this.""

""How many times have you tried?"" I asked.

""I've been trying for the past 10 minutes.""  *(TIL in bizarro world, 30 seconds = 10 minutes.)*

""If you tried and failed more than 3 times, you're locked out.  You're going to have to call corporate to have them unlock it and reset your password.""

She says ""I don't have time for this shit.  Can't you do it?""

""Jill, they won't even *talk* to me about your account at all.  You know that.""

""I need that email NOW!  Can't you just hack it or something?""

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 

Yeah, sure.  Let me get right on that.  Ignoring the fact that I neither have the skills, information, or resources to do that on the fly, I'm just going to spend god knows how much time hacking into the email server just so you don't have to make a 3 minute phone call.  I'm sure my wife would also love the explanation of why I just got fired, too.

I currently for for a defense contractor, but back when I started my exciting career in tech support, I worked for a fairly prominent ISP doing internet and VOIP support. Most of the calls were pretty normal things, rebooting routers and modems and such. But I had a few absolute mind-melters in my 2 years there. Here's one of them.

-----

Me: ""Thanks for calling tech support, my name is Gemini, how can I help you today?""

Confused Girl: ""Oh, hi. I got this message on my screen that says I need to call you guys because there's a problem with my account. Which is weird, because I don't have an account.""

Me: ""That... is indeed weird. Can you read me the message?""

She proceeds to rattle of the screen that shows up when your account gets shut off from not paying a bill.

Me: ""Oh, I see what happened. You didn't pay your bill in time, so we've suspended your service. I can get you over to the billing department to fix this up.""

CG: ""Yeah, but, like I said, I don't have an account with you guys.""

Me: ""Right... well... what's your name?""

She gives me her name, I look it up, she definitely doesn't have an account with us, at least not under that name.

Me: ""Okay... can you find your modem? I can try to pull it up using the serial number.""

CG: ""What's a modem?""

Me: ""It's a little black box with green lights, it's probably got an M on the front for Motorola.""

CG: ""I don't have one of those.""

Me: ""Okay... how exactly do you connect to the internet?""

CG: ""With my laptop.""

Me: ""Are you connecting wirelessly?""

CG: ""Yeah.""

Me: ""Do you have service with another company maybe?""

CG: ""No, can you just fix this please?""

I ponder this in silence a moment, and then break the news to her.

Me: ""Okay, so... here's the deal. You're connecting into your neighbor's unsecured wireless network. Your neighbor failed to pay their bill on time, so their service was cut off. You have two options. I can transfer you over to our sales department and you can get a legal internet connection from us and we'll come out and install it for you as soon as possible. Or you can wander around your apartment building knocking on doors and find out who didn't pay their cable bill, then admit to them that you're leeching off of their wireless and request that they pay their bill.""

CG: ""So... you can't just turn the internet back on for me?""

Me: ""Nope. Not a chance.""

CG: ""Okay, well, I don't want to pay for it, I guess I'll figure something out. Thanks though."" *click*

Now Read On...   

----

We all have them. The calls which make us wonder if we've gently drifted from the path of sanity during a momentary lapse of attention, and are now wandering the fractal-mirrored halls of a reality not quite our own. Calls which stay with us, bright and sharp-edged, heedless of the passage of years and alcohol, like glass shards in the mind.  

We all have them.  

This is mine.  
   
  
It started out innocently enough. I had been working a federal government helpdesk for some months, gotten past the initial weirdnesses, and settled in. The calls had become fairly routine, and I had just picked up the phone to be informed that the caller, from the floor above me, was having some difficulty printing.  

Not a problem! Friendly helpdesk tech is on the case and ready to help! We shall walk through the standard troubleshooting and have the user going happily printy-printy in short order, ho ho! The caller themselves is happy to follow my instructions, and off we go. We get to about ten minutes into the call, checking all the usual software settings to no avail, and I start asking more general questions.  

- Do they get an error when they print? No.  
- Is the printer switched off? No.  
- Does the printer make printing noises when a job is sent to it? Yes.  
- Does the paper, in fact, come out of the printer? Yes.  
- With the correct information on? Can't tell.  
- How about the - wait, what?  

Can't... tell?  
   
  
Is the user printing a document without viewing it? (Possible, but rare.) No...  
Does the user have a file with a print format significantly different from the screen presentation? No...  
Um... is the user blind? (Never assume the obvious.) No...  
The printer IS in the same room, yes? Oh yes, it's about ten feet away, against the wall.  
Then... why can the user not determine what's on the printout?  

Well, that would be because the printer **IS ON FUCKING FIRE**.  
   
  
Not ""the printer is a little warm"". Not even ""a sparking short is visible through the ventilation slots"". This was *""three-foot flames are leaping out of the power supply the whole time the user has been on the phone to me.""*  
   
  
I think, at that moment, I honestly felt my brain shut down. I just couldn't reconcile a rational world with the knowledge that a user had walked through ten whole minutes of calm, helpful troubleshooting, while never once considering it worth mentioning that the object of his disapproval was doing its best impression of Thích Quảng Đức.  

A second passed. Another.  

Reality, fully fledged and razor-tipped, fell on me with the weight of empires, all bloody maw and sadistic vengeance. Somehow, in my stunned state, I managed to get the caller to switch the printer off at the wall and go find a fire warden. I still cannot remember writing the ticket to have a tech go up and examine the charred ruin - I'd kicked over into autopilot, and wasn't exactly *compos mentis*. The world had broken, and it would never be quite the same again.

Celestium,250,226,1klb7n,749,"I work as a tech for an office supply company, their name rhymes with taples. Today was the first day I felt like I had a story to share with the subreddit. 

I come in as the closing tech, 11:00 am to close, around 8:00 PM. I enter the store to find that not only is the normal on site guy gone (hereafter named guy 1), but so is the guy who is supposed to cover the floor (guy 2). On top of that, I have now have to do the onsite that guy 1 is not here to do. I know exactly what needs to be done, as it was a return visit for an onsite I did earlier in the week. On top of that, we have roughly 40 PCs in, all of which need to be repaired, half of which are already late. Oh boy. 

I start running HDD diagnostics on four of the PCs that were BSODing on start up/programs opening/generally running slow. I take six that were in for virus removals and start running scans so they can just go while I'm gone and head to my onsite. First, to grasp the whole situation, I need to give a little backstory. I'm now in charge of a massive backlog of PCs, roughly half of the entire store in size, closer to 80% in terms of sales. This onsite that I need to make a return for is rather simple, need to re-install printer drivers as the tech didn't install them when we had the PC in the store and I had no internet at the house because of downed lines. However, the guy also brought in another laptop for a virus removal that I'll be bringing with me out to him. He also happened to purchase Kaspersky and wanted that installed. He had about 15 kbps at his house, and it would take far too long to install it there. No worries though, I happen to have installers for most consumer AVs on the market, so I take my flash drive full of tools and programs, as well as another that only has the Kasp installer/Printer drivers to make it easy. 

I head out there and the guy is pretty laid back, so I know I can just leave the installers running after I set the printer up and come back to check on them later. I run that by him and he's ok with it, so I go to work. Another preface, the laptop he brought in was incredibly infected, so before I ran a removal I happened to image the drive(which I'm not allowed to do) before I set to it, this is important for later. I get the printer up in about five minutes, and leave the installers to go while I head back to the store. Before I do so, I tell him that one of the flash drives is my personal work drive, and has a lot of programs that can damage the PC. In particular I told him not to open DoNotOpen.bat, located in the folder DONOTOPEN. What this file does it sort of like the half assed way to reformat a PC, without actually reformatting. It nukes all user files, reverts back to the default libraries, nukes just about everything in the registry, then opens another script called DoNotOpen2.bat that merges a fresh/clean registry with the old one (programming student, wanted the practice). 

I get everything running then head out. I get back to the store to deal with all the angry customers with late PCs/all the selling/deal with two PCs in particular that nobody else could fix. The first PC was a vista machine that had a fucked partition table. It was a single 560 gb drive partitioned into two 280 gb drives then RAIDed together. I assume that it was done to work around Vista pre SP1, but I don't know as it was before my time. However, the thing was upgraded to the newest SP, then someone stitched the two partitions together, but left the RAID controller on. On top of that, the HDD was starting to fail, and was giving me errors everywhere. In short, fucked. Windows wouldn't boot properly, so I booted to an ubuntu flash drive, imaged the disk, formatted the drive the reinstalled on top of that. PC works, drive going out, informed the customer and he said he'd just run with it. Step one done. 

Step two, SOPHOS, AKA the Devil's Anti-Virus, was blocking this poor mans bejeweled from running. After adding the exe to literally every ignore list possible and still having it shut down, I put his bejeweled install on a partition I created and told SOPHOS to completely ignore that partition. Finally got it fixed. Meanwhile, I've been sprinting everywhere helping customers and getting screamed at because people's ""highly important business server"" isn't done on time. 

I bang out another six PCs before I get ""the call."" It's the onsite guy, he tells me that the file called do not open in the folder called do not open, well he opened it. Now all his pictures are gone. I enter panic mode as I assumed nobody could ever be stupid enough to open a file called do not open in a folder called do not open that I told him to not open, but I was wrong. I tell him I'll call him back, and get ready for the worst. At about this time, I suddenly remember that I imaged his laptop last night. Seeing a way out, I load up and tell my manager that this is vitally important or we might get a complaint to the terrible and mighty corporate. Long story short, I run over there, load the image, perform another virus removal and then leave. He's happy, I'm happy, time to go back to work. 

Another two hours later my shift ends, nine PCs down, all customers not angry, sales in my section were great, day was good. All at 11 dollars an hour, capitalism.

TL;DR: Jesus hates SOPHOS and illegal backups save the day. 

EDIT: Yeah I've hidden the scripts and the registry assets, I've learned my lesson on that one.

quintinza,279,285,13zge0,753,"Before you cry ""Why not enforce a global recipient limit!!"" there is a good reason for that.

Back to this morning.

Saw that our co hosted smtp relay was taking strain, so I ran:

    exim -bpc

It spat out that there was 304 messages waiting in the queue.

While not a large number, it is unusually high for this particular server.

So:

    exim -bp | less

and scrolling down allowed me to find the culprit.

She sent a 2MB PDF marketing brochure to 1189 recipients, and delivery bounces and whatnot was clogging up our exim queue.

Fine.

Instead of doing the usual and walking over to educate her about our dedicated (paid for) bulk email and newsletter systems, I decided to have some fun. Besides, she has used the bulk mailer for just this purpose before.

    exim -bp | grep -A 1189 offender@abusersdomain &gt; abuserfile

I decided to pipe the output to a text file, because once exim has finished delivering the mails it will be a bit harder to snarf the destination addresses in order to do what I did next.

(Oh yeah, this is going to happen to her a few times this week.)

    cat abuserfile | awk '{print $2}' | while read line; do echo -e ""Bulk Spam Detected For \n \n $line \n \n Please refrain from sending bulk spam from your account. \n Account might be disabled if behaviour continues."" | mail -s ""Bulk Mail Abuse Detected"" offender@abuserdomain ; done

I checked her mailbox, and it is crammed with my abuse warning from root@myserver

I'll give it a few hours and decide if I want to send out another one, or wait till tomorrow. I might update with her response, if there is any before I send out the second wave.



**EDIT/UPDATE**

She downloaded all the emails from root, and slunk out of the office to a meeting. According to our IN/OUT system I can expect her back in the office at 16:00.

I guess about, see... 1189 gentle reminders of her misbehaviour can be sent out at about 15:30....

**EDIT/UPDATE 2**

So I decided to get creative and sent her a custom delivery delay notification for the sixteen or so messages that have not been delivered yet.

I'll send delivery confirmations for the others later :D

**EDIT3**

One of the commenters indicated that I am on a bit of a power trip, that I should not teach her a lesson and that I am a support staffer thinking that I am the law.

Fair enough, I guess you deserve a little clarification:

I am not only a support staffer, but IT management that takes care of our hosting environment as one of my tasks. My team gets a lot of flack and aggravation as it is with support staff.

Because I am senior management, I have an open door to her boss.

Why do I not speak to her boss? Because she has been publicly berated by him recently. If I go to him I could cause her to be fired, for she has pulled crap like this before, and his fuse is very short with her.

Why do I not sit her down and have a chat with her? Because a manager from another department having a sit-down with her would cause questions to be asked, leading to possible negative consequinces for her.

She needs to learn a lesson, and a little scare tactics goes a long way in getting people back in line with best practices.

**EDIT/UPDATE3**

I just went upstairs to enquire about her.

She decided not to come back after her meeting. I let one of her colleagues in on my prank and she told me that the section boss used the bulk mail system yesterday, and that she was supposed to do the same as per his direct instruction.

She remarked that ""... she does as she pleases. He told her to use the bulk mailer. Keep spamming her. She has to learn.""

Since the place is kind of small, our department also handles a bit of general tech support for internet and phone issues. Most of it is really simple problems and/or really dense people. Today I had a good one:

**Me:** NOC, this is Kendall.

**Customer Service Rep:** Hey, I've got &lt;account number&gt; and they don't have a dial tone. I reset the modem (Arris units with built in ATAs) and the provisioning looks good. Can I transfer?

**Me:** Go ahead.....&lt;click&gt;.....Network Operations, this is Kendall. How can I help you?

**Customer:** We don't have phone service.

*At this point I've verified that the provisioning is correct and have noted a Ringer Equivalency failure, usually caused by nothing being plugged into the ATA.*

**Me:** Yes ma'am, I do see an issue. It doesn't look like the modem is seeing anything plugged into the correct telephone port. Could you please tell me how many cords are connected to the back of it?

**Customer:** What's a modem?

**Me:** It's a small, black, rectangular box with some green lights on it. It'll probably be close to a computer and will say ""Arris"" on it.

**Customer:** Let me go see.

*A few minutes pass...*

**Customer:** There are three cords connected to the back.

**Me:** Are you able to get on the internet?

**Customer:** Let me see..........Yes.

*This means that only the power, coaxial, and Ethernet were connected and that the phone cord is probably laying on the floor behind whatever piece of furniture the modem is sitting on.*

**Me:** There needs to be four cords connected. Would you mind checking to see if there's a stray phone cord on the floor close to the modem?

**Customer:** I don't understand. There's only ever been three cords plugged in and it was working fine this morning. Nobody's been back there to mess with it.

**Me:** Ma'am, the phone service can't work without a phone cord connected to the modem. Would you please check?

*Insert quite a bit of back and forth about this and she eventually gets frustrated and hangs up. About an hour later her husband calls in and I get the transfer.*

**Me:** Network Operations, this is Kendall. How can I help you?

**Husband:** We ain't gotta dial tone. Can you guys zap it or whatever you do to fix it?

**Me:** From the notes it appears that the issue is with a disconnected phone cord. Would you mind telling me how many cords are connected to the back of the modem.

**Husband:** Three. Why?

**Me:** There needs to be a total of four cords. One for the power, one for the cable, one for the internet, and one for the phone.

**Husband (in a more aggressive tone):** My wife went through this earlier! There's only ever been three on the back!

**Me:** Sir, I believe you may be mistaken. Without that fourth cord the phone service will not be functional.

**Husband (now mad):** I TOLD YOU IT ONLY NEEDS THREE CORDS! NOW ZAP IT AND MAKE IT WORK!

**Me:** Sir, it is quite literally impossible for this to work without that cord also connected to the modem. Please, for the sake of being thorough, check to see if there's a stray phone cord on the floor behind the modem.

**Husband:** AIN'T NOBODY MESSED WITH IT! CORDS DON'T UNPLUG THEMSELVES!

**Me:** I agree with you on that point, however we still need to check for that phone cord.

*I hear him set the phone down and then utter some curses about the quality of our service and that this is a bunch of crap, but I can hear movement so it's obvious he's doing something.*

**Husband:** Alright, I got a dial tone. &lt;click&gt;

EDIT: Formatting and I misspelled something.","Sir, it is quite literally impossible for this to work without that cord...",942
wanttoseemycat,78,161,13gcqd,752,"Long ago, I found myself working at a place that did walk-in PC repair. I worked there for a few years and grew the business to working on mostly small company I.T. support, so we'd almost stopped working on home users stuff. 

There had been this computer there for over a year, some crappy HP desktop with a bad motherboard the women didn't want replaced. She called and asked us to burn some things from the hard drive for her, which we did at no charge. She asked if we could dispose of the computer for her, which we did. Upon taking any piece of hardware in we had customers sign a document that forfeit property if left with us for 90 days without any contact.

She calls back a year later and this is how the conversation went.

*Her - Yes, I left my computer there a few weeks ago, and I need to pick it up. I need a computer tomorrow very badly. Is it fixed?*

**I take the information and look it up**

Me - ""Uhm, an HP desktop, wouldn't boot up? Mrs. @#$%!?""

*Her - Yes, that's it.*

Me - Well that computer was dropped off over a year ago.

*Her - Oh has it been that long? Hah, I should have picked it up. It will be fixed when I come get it, right?*

Me - Ma'am it says right here that you asked us to dispose of it for you. Even if you hadn't, after 90 days we would have recycled it just the same!

**Here's about 15 minutes of her yelling at me, calling me names, and threatening me with every legal word she's ever heard on NCIS.**

Finally I interrupt her in the middle of her tirade. 

Me - Ma'am, did you notice a sign on our front door that said ""Dead computer storage?""

*Her - ... Noo.....*

Me - **That's cause I'm not in the BUSINESS of storing dead COMPUTERS**

and I just hung up. Never heard from her again.

curtcollin,132,146,1ds6il,750,"I've been reading this sub forever, love it. I work in the radio industry in Canada. I pull the IT strings at the station I'm with, and I've never posted anything because frankly, the people in my office are rather computer literate (today's radio industry relies heavily on computers, so everyone who is hired usually knows how to use one fairly well). I've always been a fairly crafty guy - I don't have any formal training in IT, but I've done a lot with Windows and Linux enterprise networking.

This story, however, doesn't come from my years in IT or at the radio station, rather from my days in high school.

Because I was naturally gifted, I was always the go to person to fix issues while I was in high school. Teacher can't get the projector to work? Curtis can fix it. No video from the DVD player? Give Curtis a call. I didn't mind, it made me feel important.

It wasn't just the teachers that knew this either, I had a reputation with the entire student body. Everyone, whether they knew me personally or not, knew that ""Curtis"" was the fix-it guy.

So, one day, we're at an assembly in the gym. The entire population of the school is in the room, and they're trying to show a video. They've got their portable projector and PA system set up, and they're projecting this video on the wall. Problem was, we couldn't hear anything. I can see the people at the front of the gym struggling to get it working, while the students all got antsy in their seats. 30 seconds pass, and still nothing. I hear someone near me suggest that ""Hey Curtis, go up and help them."" I guess some others heard that, and reinforced it, ""Yeh Curtis, you can fix it.""

And before I knew it, the entire school was chanting ""Curtis! Curtis! Curtis! Curtis!"" People were looking at me. All I could think was: Do I stand up to fix it, or do I let them work it out?

After a few more seconds, I decide to go help out. As I stand up from my seat and walk forward, the chanting of my name breaks into a round of applause. I walked towards the front of the room, and the video organizer, we'll call him Geoff, is still working on fixing the sound issue. I decided to make the most of the attention I was getting from the students to fix it, and tried to fix the issue by ""magic"". I took a solid stance on the ground, and stuck both my hands out towards the soundboard, as if I was a wizard casting a spell.

Well, the timing couldn't be more perfect. Geoff happened to fix the issue on his own at the exact moment I stuck my hands out. I was sort of shocked, so I shot my hands straight up into the air and took a bow. The students all gave me a standing ovation as I returned to my seat.

I've since graduated a few years back, but I'm told by my younger brother that my name still gets called when tech issues arise at the old high school.

**TL;DR - I got a standing ovation for fixing a tech issue without even touching it.**",Magical Audio Fix,896

ordinary82,168,178,1qfk0d,747,"I'm a fairly new talesfromtechsupport addict. To the pros among you, I'm sure my story will be nothing special, but it felt it was worth a post:

Background: I'm a graphic designer by trade, working mostly freelance and some part time. As many small businesses have no IT support, I'm often conscripted as a ""computer guy""… you know the drill.

I get a text message this morning from Miss S, my employer's sister in law. Although I'm busy, I decide to help. Can't hurt to maintain a good relationship with the boss.

&lt; Miss S: ""hows it going? Quick question: the Mac can't repair the disk backup and no storage left. Running totally slow. Won't work without fix. Can I fix with verbal guide? I'm sorry to bother you but afraid to delete anything! &gt;

I give her a call back: sounds like one of Miss S's kids has disconnected the USB backup drive to connect her iPhone, during a backup… this happened weeks ago. As the computer is now powered down, I ask her to disconnect the backup drive so we can tackle one problem at a time.

On boot the computer is alerting the startup disk is almost full. So I ask Miss S to empty the trash. I then patiently instruct her to get info on the 500 GB hard drive which we discover now has about 120 MB free.

After convincing her that removing application icons from the dock won't free up space, I ask her if her kids might have downloaded anything large recently. Miss S suddenly remembers a birthday gift for her son which captures video from his game console and saves it to the Mac.

I direct her to the home folder and explain again how to check the size of each folder to find the probable offender - a very large video file. I also remind her to take the backup to a Mac repair shop ASAP as having a backup is important, especially when about to start deleting files. At this point she seems happy to continue on her own, she thanks me and hangs up.

I'm feeling pretty good about my amateur tech support efforts. 5 minutes later I receive another text:

TenTonAir,388,179,1h6en8,751,"So I work at a local community college.  Recently because of the way part time workers above 30 hours now get health benefits in the United States suddenly everybody who was working as a part timer now gets their hours cut. This hurts especially for the entire department of people they had at 39.

So all the part timers in our department got together and I was chosen to speak with the dean of our local campus to discuss the issue of pay and hours. We discussed that this wasn't a healthy work environment because we were encouraged to do our jobs poorly because of how they do their pay. Our hours had been cut before for doing 'too much work' and so on and we were sick of getting paid less than home depot employes and no benefits we argued that they if they had budgeted a ton of money (roughly six million dollars) to their new admin offices they could budget a little bit of extra cash for fair wages. We said it's silly to pay us to little when we handle equipment that's easily worth several times our monthly wages and we handle all this sensitive data and network administration that goes into keeping a campus running.




 So after what I thought was a good meeting we find out that not only are our hours being cut but we're also being knocked down to below 20 hours a week. Even the people who have worked here five+ years and suddenly the dean who's always made time for talks is suddenly too busy in his office doing paperwork to have meetings.

On a unrelated note, there's been a rash of computer breakdowns and network problems and a lot of techs who are suddenly too tired to get up from their desks.

EDIT: My boss tried to console us saying maybe we'll get our hours back in September, and maybe they'll hire another full time worker. I find it hard to believe and personally I think it's a tactic to make five people in the same boat squabble over table scraps.

I use to work for a small POS company that installed and maintained Point-of-Sale (POS) equipment for small to medium fast food establishments.  We serviced equipment throughout the continental US despite only have the capabilities to physically support clients in the greater Philly, NYC and DC area.

On a Friday afternoon, a client in Texas called in to our support line...

&gt;client : I need you to send  someone out here RIGHT NOW!!!

&gt;me : Thank you for calling Derp Systems technical support.  Can i please have your client ID?

&gt;client : I need you to send  someone out here RIGHT NOW!!! Your shit equipment is broken again.

&gt;me : Ma'am, to further assist me in getting your issue resolved i will need to know your client ID.

&gt;client : **extrudes client ID number**  

&gt;me : thank you, i see that you are using a TD server running windows 98.  i can see that two of your three systems are online.  Your server is currently offline.  

&gt;client : NO SHIT the power button broke off the DAMN thing!

&gt;me : **wtf**  the power button came out of the computer?

&gt;client : YES, it wouldn't go in so i used a screw driver to pop the button in.  That's when the button went back into the box thing.  I NEED THIS SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING NOW.  WE OPEN IN 20 MINUTES AND IT's ""THE BUSIEST DAY OF THE YEAR!""  (*quotes because it was a generic march afternoon and they always use that phrase*)

&gt;me : okay! well we can send a replacement server to your location but i will not arrive until Tuesday next week.  In the mean time, we can restore your last back up from another machine and make that a temporary server.  

I noticed that the ""backup server"" was using software that was atleast 5 years old and was incompatible with the current databases mdb to accdb.  i would have to download and install the new software from our company ftp.  Download of 1GB started... on DSL that was clearly out of the range on the last mile.

&gt;client : **comes back and sees the Window's Time til Completion of 5 hours ** OH HELL NO WE NEED THIS SYSTEM UP NOW I CANT WAIT NO F*$#ING 5 hours.

the client proceeds to start vomiting curse words into the phone and making colorful comparisons of my company and its products to certain venereal diseases and animal excrement. at a certain boiling point she unplugs the computer that was performing the download.  my screen goes black and i could hear her screeching in the distant background.

suddenly, a calm young boy picks up the phone 

&gt;boy : how can we fix the computer?

at this point i was ready to try anything

&gt;me : good afternoon, do you have a butter knife laying around?  Good.  Do you see where the power button use to be?  Good.  See the four little prongs that stick up from the green board?  press the knife to all four of those prongs at once.

buzzbeebara,82,137,14one9,749,"So this happened when I was in my 2nd year at my job. We issued IBM Thinkpads with Windows 2000 and Office 2000 to remote employees. This one particular employee, whom we will call Rich, was a problem child who thought computers were ""just a fad"". Real old school type who resented having to use this new technology and ""electronic mail"". He was from the New Jersey area, an avid outdoors man, contempt for anyone born south of the Mason Dixon line, and an arrogant PhD to boot. Me, I'm from TX, overweight, and technology is my passion. As such, he had a less than admirable view of what value I brought to the company, and didn't mind letting my boss know that. To be fair, my boss just wanted me to fix the computers and keep the ship running.
So one day, Rich is in the HQ office for a week before he does another 6 month stretch out on the road. Just as he's about to start a conference call with a new potential client, he storms into my office and wants to know why his computer doesn't work. What he shows me set the bar so low it would not be broken until 2011. His browser had at least 14 toolbars installed. His desktop was littered with document fragments that started with ~'s. A popup kept fighting with another popup to be the one on top. And I could hear that poor Thinkpad's fan just screaming away in a desperate attempt to keep the hardware cool.

Now, in the past Rich had been borderline vulgar and condescending whenever he called me for tech support. As I was only at the job for less than 2 years, I just tried to work around it. My boss didn't care as long as the problem got fixed. So when Rich came with this problem I seriously considered playing dumb and shrug. It would have served him right. So just as I was about to do just that, I made eye contact. And for such a manly man that he purported to be, I saw fear.

The Angels of my better nature took over. Disregarding every condescending thing he ever said to me, I took a look at his computer. It would take too long to clean and could never be sure I got everything. 

I looked at him and said ""This is too far gone. You need a complete wipe and reinstall. With updates and patches to Windows, not to mention the custom and proprietary software we use, that's a two day process at best."" 

I could see his heart sink. The conference call he was supposed to be on in 5 minutes was, we later discovered, the biggest in his career with our company. He needed the files and programs on his computer to close the deal. I turned around and grabbed the only spare laptop I had just prepared the day before for an incoming new hire. After a quick boot to a safe mode, I copied the necessary files and handed him the spare. I looked him in the eye and said ""I will have your computer back to you with your data intact by 8:00 AM tomorrow morning."" With that, I could see the tension drain out of him and he left to conduct his phone conference.

I had to stay late, and even took his computer home so I could run updates overnight. I woke up an hour early and installed/configured the proprietary software. Sure enough at 7:59 AM the next morning, I had a clean and functioning computer. At 8:01 AM Rich walked into my office. I had it booted and showed him quickly all his data files were there. The PC was clean, and running like it was new. Satisfied his data was intact, I closed the lid and handed it to him. As he took possession of the pc, he offered his hand, gave me a ""Thanks"" and a bottle of Vodka.

Things were different after that.

EtanSivad,100,126,199nkt,743,"My dad worked for IBM tech support for a bit over a decade, mostly during the 90s. This was the support queue for their mid-range and large business systems. 

The names in this story are made up to protect the idiotic.  

One day my dad gets a call from a police precinct in a medium sized town where they have an AS/400 that serves 5 different police stations and a few fire stations connect in as well. 

Caller: ""This is Sergeant Murphy.  We've got an AS/400 system here that serves our precinct and we had to fire one of the system administrators by the name of Frank for being lazy and incompetent not to mention repeated issues with him not showing up to work.  You'd think this would be the end of it, but he showed up today at the main police station saying he was a master hacker that we couldn't replace him.  He says that he put a back-door in the system that only he can access.  He's demanded that we rehire him, along with a raise, or he'd destroy our computer systems and there's nothing we could do to stop him.""

Dad: ""Wow.  So what did you do?""

Caller: ""well, first thing we did was arrest him and throw him in a holding cell where he can't get near any computers.  Guy's not too bright.  I need you to look at our system and see if he's telling the truth and make sure there's nothing he can do to the system.  I'm sure I don't need to tell you that if he takes down our whole system that would be very bad for the town and our ability to do our job.""

Dad: ""Understood.  I'll get connected and take a look.""

My dad remotely connects to their system and starts looking around.  First thing he does is runs a query to see all users with remote access privileges.  He can see that Frank's account has been deactivated.  So he's not getting in that way.

All of the users have full names like ""BobSmith"" but two of them stand out.  BD1 and BD2 (Back-door1 and 2).  Looking at a query of those two users, they've never logged in.  Furthermore, they were created by the user ""JohnDoe"" (This name is not made up. The back-door user was created by an account called JohnDoe.) which no longer exists in the system.  Looking in the activity archive, the user JohnDoe was created by Frank's account.  It  was logged in once to create the two users Bd1 and Bd2, than promptly deleted by Frank's account.  

My dad disables those two accounts and starts digging deeper.  Surely this couldn't be his master plan.  A couple of users - that's it?    He once commented that this was the really fun part because he started thinking about if you wanted to put a time bomb in the system, how would you go about doing it?  He starts looking at the various jobs in the system.  Scheduled jobs that might elevate system privileges, jobs that adjust user privileges, scheduled restore jobs, scheduled deletion, so on and so forth.  

My dad got this call because he was considered at that time the foremost security expert on the As/400.  He was left severely disappointed because the guy didn't do anything even remotely sneaky or clever.  Only made a couple of remote access accounts and didn't cover his tracks very well in hiding who made them.  So he calls the Sergeant back and tells him what he's found.

Caller: ""Really that's it?  That's too bad.  I was hoping he'd done a bit more damage so we could charge him with more.  If he had remotely connected, what could he have done?""

Dad: ""Oh, lots of things.  Since the back-door users had full system level privileges he could have shutdown the system.  Deleted users, stuff like that.""

Caller: ""Really?  Could you write up a list of things he potentially could have done to disrupt us?  No matter how small.""

Dad writes up a list of everything you could do with elevated privileges.  From deleting users, to changing criminal records, to rendering the system totally unusable.  He had a lot of fun thinking outside the box and being devious.  Though later dad admitted that given the guys lack of imagination in creating a back-door, he probably never would have thought of half the things on the list.

He faxed the list over to the Sergeant (because faxing is how you rolled in the 90s!) and Sergeant called him back laughing hysterically.

Caller: ""This is great Dan!  I'm sending this to the D.A.'s office right away!  What kind of moron threatens the police and demands a job from them?  The D.A. is going to have a field day with this one.""

I felt very bad, because I had assured him that we could take care of the problem, but we narrowed down and figured out that the signal was failing between his MPOE and his modem, so there's nothing I can do but schedule a tech visit.  This old man had been a trooper, too, he never once got ahead of me, never once interrupted, he was a genuine good customer.

We get to deal with students, professors, faculty, and staff—so a wide range of people with a wide range of technological understanding. Today's a slow day, so I figured I'd share this particular tale with you:*

A few days ago, I had a customer who was absolutely certain he had gotten some sort of monstrous virus on his computer. Nothing at all seemed odd about the computer's performance, but he continued to insist that his anti-virus program was blocking ""hundreds of threats online"" every day (which turned out to be cookies) and he was sure that something was wrong. I ran a scan with two of the scanners we use at work, each giving his computer a clean bill of health.

&gt; What's your best anti-virus?

he asks. I explained to him that we have a contract with one company on campus, and said I could install that on his computer, but that he should be fine with the software he already has installed. After reassuring him about 20 times he had nothing wrong, he left, and told me

&gt; You're my new best friend (gets very close to look at my name tag) laughingwiseman

This customer came back into the store today, having decided that his perfectly-okay HP laptop would no longer cut it, and that he needed to buy a Mac (which we sell in store).

&gt; I'm going to buy a MacBook. So give me one of those, a copy of your best anti-virus, and anything else you recommend. And can I pay by check?

I don't work sales, so I was just in a corner on the other side of the store watching this happen. It was like watching a 65-year-old trapped in a 19-year-old's body buy a computer. The sales guys told him that he probably wouldn't need any anti-virus software (and that if he did want some, we don't sell it, anyway) and that we don't take checks, per store policy. As he's paying by credit card, he asks

&gt; Do I have to install the Internet on this?

The sales guy explains that he's already got all that stuff installed, and that if he has any further questions about his purchase, he's got a 3-year warranty with Apple and that he should call them if he's got any questions.

Not 30 minutes later, he's back, angry that he can't ""right click"" anymore, and insistent that we make sure he doesn't have a virus.

* * *

Don had taken his sweet time introducing me to Alex that morning. Though honestly he should not have taken the effort; I already knew Alex better than I cared for. He went on and on about the skills this new computer prodigy had demonstrated during his job interview, but never got into the specifics. 

After the introduction he told me something I was afraid of hearing all along: I had to to train Alex. Don made sure to put strong emphasis on wanting me to train him; I was the chosen one.

This was going to be a long shift.

I reluctantly walked to the back to stow away my coat and bag into my locker; it only took a minute. I wanted to stall going back into the store, so I started rearranging the items I had in my bag, reading the ingredients on the chewing gum, readjusting my clothing, checking my cellphone for new messages... Nothing that really helped my cause. Letting out a huge sigh I went back into the store.

Alex was still standing behind the counter when I came back. I decided to play the busy game and told him I had a lot of things that needed to be done before I could start training him. I pointed at 12 boxes of all kinds of electronics that needed to added to the shelves. He could do that and get himself familiarised with the store that way.

I checked the inventory system, which was an old DOS program that received its latest update in ’97. The system rarely worked as it should and often randomly updated items to be in stock again. We apparently now stocked hundreds of RAM-Modules and Video cards from the early 1990s. 

It did not matter much anyway as checking inventory was something that rarely needed to be done since Don and Ron just brought in random boxes at all times, but it kept me busy and Alex away from me. Except it didn’t.

Alex seemed desperate for some attention at this moment and kept asking me constantly where each of the electronics needed to be placed. I knew that he wasn’t stupid and could perfectly well find his way around the store. He had been here so many times over the months. 

About an hour in, I had stopped counting how many times he had asked me where items needed to be placed, but it must have been around thirty times. I decided to give him the training that he was supposed to get by decree of the soon to be millionaire Don.

As there were no customers in the store I showed him the back where we keep most of the stock, the cage with camera system and UPS and the tables with computers that needed to be fixed. We walked through the store and I showed him some more things, like how the sliding cabinets under the displays worked in the new part of the store.

I was on my knees at this moment taking out an mp3 player when he started coming a little close for comfort. I back off and stood up quickly, and told him he needs to keep his distance. He half-heartedly apologised and said he did not mean to do it. It all felt very eerie. Against my better judgement, I decided to ignore it and move on as I went on with the rest of the day. I let him loose in the store so he could harass the customers instead of me. 

I started going down the list of customers who needed to be notified that their repaired PCs and orders could be picked up. I was busy calling the customers on the list as another customer walked into the store. Alex took initiative for the first time. Rather awkwardly he walked up to a middle aged woman and started to introduce himself. 

“Hi, my name is Alex and I am an expert at all things technical.” The woman was already taken a bit aback by how he said it, lisping at every syllable. She started telling him that she was looking for a new keyboard as her current one stopped working. Alex immediately dragged her to the 6 or 7 keyboards we had, pulled out a Logitech G15 keyboard and told her she needed this one. No discussion possible. It was a keyboard that we sold for 140 dollars.

I had been listening and watching from the beginning and felt I needed to step in for the sanity of this woman. I quickly took over the conversation and pointed her to a 20 dollar keyboard that would do the job just fine. When she was gone I talked to Alex and made it clear that we don’t work on commission and our preferences don’t count.  I sent him to the back with a list of computers he could fix. He wasn’t any better at that.

The next two or three days were mostly the same story with him receiving negative attention from me because he kept messing up no matter what he did or how I dealt with him. Negative attention, however, is still attention and he seemed to dwell in it, maybe even actively asking for it. He was clingy, always asking the same questions — simple questions he could have easily solved himself.

It wasn’t until a month later that he started to become more than just annoying and moved into the territory of being creepy. It was one Saturday morning that I found a love note in my locker. It was barely intelligible because of the messy handwriting. 

Leila, 

I now have worked with you for a month and have seen you much longer than that. I asked you out once and you said no. Maybe now that you know me better I can ask again and get a yes. I really believe you are the one, I will win your heart someday. 

Alex

I wasn’t happy with this note and felt it had dragged on long enough. He was already in the store and I walked up to him and pushed the note into his chest. “I already have a boyfriend, I have said before that I was not interested and no I don’t want to be friends with you either.” It was harsh, sure, but I really did not want this situation go on any longer. He needed to know that I did not want him or his constant peering on me.

“Just leave me alone,” I said directly into his face.

When I told him, he became angry and started asking who my boyfriend was. I refused to tell him. He started stomping on the floor and muttered under his voice, “I will be your boyfriend one day,” and just left, leaving me to handle the entire store alone. He didn’t return and I called Frank to see if he could fill in for Alex. Afterwards I called Don telling him about what happened. He wasn’t happy with Alex but completely ignored the rest of what I told him.

I did not feel safe that day and when I was to leave around the end of the afternoon, I called a couple of my friends to pick me up and have a girls’ night at my home. I never saw Alex and will never find out if he actually did follow me, but it really felt as if he had.

After that, I told Jeremy and my family what was going on. I had to work with Alex again on Monday and Jeremy went with me to work, just to make sure that nothing would happen. In the end, he was with me for the entire shift as Alex never showed up. He didn’t for his next shifts either. I was happy he was gone but it did not feel right. Something would happen.

At home I started to receive postcards with love notes and even flowers. He somehow found out my private cellphone number and started calling at the most random times, saying nothing when I picked up the first two or three times. Texts with just one or two words in them followed soon after.

This was ongoing for about 2 weeks and I had been in contact with the police several times. They had told me there was very little they could do at the moment and I should keep all the postcards, texts and calls he send me. They had already gone to his house and warned him, but it didn’t help.

In those two weeks I had been surrounded by my friends, family and Jeremy, so nothing would happen. I hadn’t worked in the store during that time either and Jeremy, Frank and Richard were covering my shifts. Frank and Richard were very supportive of me and didn’t like Alex either. If they had their chance they would work their magic.

Around the three week mark we had a store meeting. The store meetings had become a mandatory thing every month since the new year. I went with Jeremy to see if I could start working at the store again. I was not going to back down for Alex.

At the store, the usual suspects were in. Ron and Don were talking about how well the store was doing with the Chinese knock off section and announcing some of their new plans when the suddenly were interrupted by a loud noise. Alex was now in the store.

He started shouting “JEREMY IS YOUR BOYFRIEND, I KNEW IT!” At this stage, the attention wasn’t turned to Alex, but to me and Jeremy. Frank and Richard seemed like they wanted to high five Jeremy, but Ron and Don for some reason gave a disapproving look to the both of us. I still don’t know what that was about. 

“Just leave, Alex. Leave and don’t come back,” I said. I did not want to take any of his bullshit anymore. Alex did not budge. “I am not leaving before you dump him and go with me.” It was at this moment that Jeremy stepped in and said something I never expected. “Listen, you deformed piece of shit, go back to the hole you came from and die.” I was taken aback by the aggression in Jeremy’s voice. I didn’t know who to be afraid of anymore.

Alex started throwing computers on the floor and broke a monitor while doing it. Don and Ron hadn’t really done anything during the fight but only now stepped in because they were going to be hit financially. “You don’t work here anymore and are not welcome here anymore. Now you better pull out your wallet and pay me or I will call the cops,” said Ron.

The cops pulled up fifteen agonising minutes later. They arrested Alex and had proof this time. The cameras installed by Ron had recorded everything. I was free. I never heard from Alex again.",Chapter 10 - The Stalker,1366
QDean,92,262,x0rju,739,"I was reminded whilst reading [this tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/wz3mz/biggest_baby_award/) of this story...

I was working on one of our developers laptops, and he was moaning about the screen resolution. It was a Thinkpad T60, a great laptop, but this particular one had a very low screen res, 1024x768 if I remember.

I was to take the laptop back to my desk to sort out something unrelated to the screen, so I had it in under my arm whilst we talked.

I was explaining that you can replace the screen relatively easily in these models, and he could get a higher resolution screen but we don't do it in-house so it would need to go to a specialist.

He then explained that he had asked for that already requested that, but it had been declined by his manager.

I half-jokingly said that if the screen had an ""accident"", it would have to be replaced anyway...

No problem with this, of course, except that when I said ""accident"" I actually made the bunny-ears thing with both hands. And dropped the laptop. Which broke the screen.

The user wasn't best pleased, as it turned out. And he was convinced I had done it deliberately as a favour. I hadn't. I'm just an idiot.

dinosaurtits,103,149,1d36wp,744,"I figured I'd join the bandwagon.

So, I've been working It for my college campus for the past 2 years. We have a lovely professor by the name of *Sandy. She is really a pleasure to work with. Mmmhm, definitely. 

So, Im working from home one evening when I get a call at 8pm. I answer, say my whole spiel, and she says ""How do I start a chat?! I need to chat with one of the employees working for you! I need to find the chat"" ""Well, ma'am its on the IT page at IT.school.edu directly under the phone number"" ""No, its not. Where is it? Do you think im stupid?"" ""No, maa'am. I'm sorry, you can also get to it by clicking the help button directly under the phone number"" ""Fine. You should make the chat button on the main page. How is anyone supposed to know to click help if they need help?!""

Well, that was lovely. I'm the only person working tonight, so I'm about to get her chat. Why didnt we just do this over the phone? Mostly because shes an asshat. 

Her chat comes through, I pick it up. I ask her whats going on, yada yada. Okay, her accounts locked. Well, she calls all the time, and proper protocol demands that I have both the last 4 of SSN and the last 4 of student ID number. So, I ask her for the last 4 of her Student number. she gave it to me, okay. She always does. Now, I ask for the last 4 of her SSN. She refuses. She refuses, she calls me names, then she says ""Excuse me, why would I give you the last 4 of my pin number!? Not to mention, this chat isnt a secure system! Anyone can see it!""   Okay, Im shocked. 

1) I can already see her SSN....she just has to verify it. 

2) LOL. She made that her pin number and shes concerned about me stealing her identity. 

3) LOL. This lady....


Well, after not unlocking her account, she asks why its locked. I explain it locks after 3 failed attempts. She DEMANDS that I change the settings for her, syaing its unacceptable for it to lock like this. That this is not a security setting, that I am messing with her, that i am ruining her life. Not to mention, I have no way of changing that, even if I wanted to. So, after this conversation....she goes on to tell me that I'll unlock her account if I ""know whats good for you"" Excuse me? ""Yeah, you'll unlock my account if you knew how to use common sense, but youre too fucking stupid to do that, of course you are"". Okay lady. 

I recite ""I'm sorry, I need both the SSN and the ID number in order to verify your account. I cannot help you any further if you refuse to verify your information"" maybe 15 times. 

So, She at this point, I've spent 2 hours (yes....you got that...2 hours) being harassed by this woman syaing shes going to get me fired.

Anyway, whenever she calls, I pick up the phone now and she hangs up trying to get one of the new employees, who always forward her to me because I think its funny to refuse to assist her without information according to proper IT protocol.

DirtDiglett,145,167,14bbms,737,"So I work for a company that sells a very popular phone, in Tier 2.

Normally when a Carrier's Tech Support T1 call, they go to our T1 because honestly, Carrier's T1s are essentially users in their product knowledge, despite being trained to only deal with our product.

Normally, that is. Unfortunately they also have our T2 contact line and will occasionally come to us thinking they are competent enough.

I get a call from a Carrier Rep. T1, we'll call her Susan.

Susan says, ""I have a customer on the other line getting an error when she enables personal hotspot for the first time.""

**Me:** ""What does the error say?""

**Susan:** ""I don't know, didn't ask.""

**Me:** ""What do you know about the issue?""

**Me:** ""But you don't know what the error says.""

I have never facepalmed so hard. I politely apologized for the inconvenience and referred back to the carrier.

**Me:** ""Do you know what the error is?""

**Susan:** ""No, but we've done everything.""

**Me:** ""I know what the error is, this is the same customer. You need to enable Personal Hotspot on your side of things for this to work.""

**Susan:** ""How do you know!?""

**Me:** ""I am telepathic. Prove me wrong, have them read the error to you right now.""

*Susan goes back to customer, returns in a minute or two*

**Susan:** ""You were right! You people are amazing! I always love consulting you wizards""

AutoEuphoria,181,225,147xjm,739,"I have to start out by admitting I am a ""user"". I am not in IT...I just read this subreddit because I love reading these stories (and I occasionally learn something).

I really wish I had the original email to which I am going to refer. It was lost in the transition from Lotus Notes to Outlook last year. I never really thought it would be important, but it would have been nice to copy the words verbatim rather than attempt to recreate the scene from memory. For that, I apologize

We are a mid-sized company owned by a larger parent organization. The structure of the business is somewhat complicated, and not entirely relevant, other than to say that company-wide emails could either be sent internally to our company (~200 users) OR, with the wrong entry in the ""to"" field, could get distributed to thousands of users across the globe. 

We had been having a string of phishing email attempts in the previous months...moreso than I had remembered in the past. Usually, like any smart employee, I would send these straight to the depths of e-hell, but of course you would always have the person or three who decided it would be good to inform everyone (including IT) by forwarding these malicious emails to the entire company.

Global IT got tired of this, and decided, after one nasty attempt that actually worked...someone was dumb enough to click it and it set off alarms or something in the IT department (or whatever happens) to send out a global email to all users in the entire company to NOT click on the link...NOT to forward the emails to everyone...make IT aware of the issue, and delete it straight away. 

That's when the most glorious example of ""throwing someone under the bus"" I have ever seen came to play. One user replied to this general IT email, thinking she was only replying to the IT department. Instead, she replied to all...ALL. Everyone in this global corporation...thousands of users. Her message?

""I sit next to [herpina] and we share a computer. I didn't click the link, but she did. I watched her do it.""

Imagine that feeling...sending out what amounts to a live hand grenade aimed straight at the person you have to work with every single day, and having the entire world watch you do it!

Googunk,136,169,13a6b8,732,"I worked at Kinko's for several years.  My particular branch was open 24/7 and near a college neighborhood where   I primarily worked behind the scenes in ""production"" positions, making the product and correcting new-hire mistakes.  When I became known to my colleagues as being a ""computer guy"" I was called in to assist with customers using the PC-rental stations and I was also expected to answer the phone if everyone at the counter was busy.  While my job was not tech-support, I had to provide assistance to people using the computer, sometimes for the first time in their life, so I think these should fit in here.  Here are my best stories.

**Wynne #1 What's the difference between cheetah and leopard?**  The customer, I discovered through protracted inquisition, was not referencing OSX versions.  The caller actually called a copy store at 9:30PM to ask for assistance with taxonomy.  The call came in from a middle aged woman named Wynne who would later prove to be either the most incompetent person alive or a lifetime-achievement-award level troll.  

**How do I open the fucking internet?!**One man, mid-40s, walked into the store with a handwritten letter and said to me “I need to email this.” He had a slightly oversized piece of paper, so it wouldn’t fit the standard little scanner we had at the time.  I directed him to the self-serve computers, which had a larger scanner.  To this day, I do not know why the full-service production area had only an 8.5X11 scanner, but the self serve had one large enough to do architectural drawings.  Nor do I understand why we could not own at least one scanner somewhere in the middle for size.  He sat at the rental computer, which was visually obscured from my workspace in the back of the store, and after about 20 minutes of evident frustration he surprised everyone in the store, especially the mother with a small child, when he shouted across the entire store “How do I open the fucking internet?!”  I went to him and calmly assisted 

“click on the internet explorer icon”

“The what?”

“The button that looks like a blue e with a yellow halo”

“How do I click it?”

“…with the mouse.”

He then picked up the mouse off of the counter, held it in his hand a moment - just long enough to raise my concern but not long enough for me to intervene, then touched the mouse to the monitor in the vicinity of the internet explorer icon.  He stared with his mouth gaped waiting for the wizard that lived inside of this tiny TV to respond.  I decided to cut my losses, I couldn’t spend my whole night helping one person email a piece of paper.   I convinced him to leave his task with us behind the counter as a full-service job.  I went and did it on the big scanner in self-service when the store was empty.

**Bernoulli disk**One gentleman brought in the file for his business cards on a Bernoulli disk.  This was in 2009.  If you don't know what a Bernoulli disk is, that alone should tell you how antiquated and esoteric the Bernoulli drive is today.  I get that his business card information may not have changed for some time, but surely someone, somewhere, at some point asked  “What is that?  Is that a hard drive? A CD case?  Baking chocolate?”  That’s where the story ends, when we couldn’t use his disk he left, confused, and never came back.  I assume he got into his DeLorean, cranked up his Buddy Holly 8-track, and went home to enjoy some surge and get caught up on Leave It To Beaver.

**Wynne #2 -  Eric opens a Factbook account** She later called for helping setting up a “Factbook” account but when the new person didn’t understand they asked her to come into the store for us to help her.  The new guy Eric was friendly and helpful.  He was not yet broken and also not yet experienced in making Wynne go away, which should have been a prerequisite skill at that job.   By the time I knew, it was too late.  I only learned what had become of him when I asked where Eric had been for over an hour, as I was supposed to be training him.  Wynne and Eric were still finding Wynne’s extended family, in-laws, and removed cousins when I called him on the P.A. saying he had a call holding for him.

“There’s no lines on hold, did they want me to call back?”

“There is no call Eric, I’m just giving you a break.  Go back to Wynne and tell her you are needed back here and to talk to someone else for help.”

“Oh.  Good idea.  Wait, how did you know her name was Wynne?”

**Fake ID’s**  Three kids from a fraternity came in around 10:00PM.  I didn’t know their exact ages, but it was evident later they were likely 18.  They also didn’t tell me outright they were from a frat, but it wasn’t hard to tell.  The store was only 4 blocks from greek row and these three were much like others of their kind we had seen before.  However, unlike the usual frat boys, these three were amazing quiet.  Suspiciously quiet, much like when seven year olds are playing and you hear a loud bang, followed by silence, followed by hurried whispering.  I tried to sneak up on them, but it was difficult in my work shoes.  I got close enough to see they had scanned in one of their drivers licenses and were attempting to Photoshop in pictures of the other two guys into it and change the birthdates.  One of them had a copy already printed… on regular weight paper…  cut out with scissors….  and the font was different on the birth date than the rest of the ID.  The real kicker though – In Washington state, to help identify age, under 21 years old gets a portrait layout on their driver’s license while over 21 get a landscape layout, and your portrait layout license always expires on your 21st birthday.  Not only were they using a portrait layout ID for their source, they didn’t correct the expiration date.  I did enough office and apartment keycards to know what it takes to fake an ID and while I won’t list the rules of how to fake an ID, they broke all of them.  They probably have no idea that I saved them a night in jail (or maybe juvie?) by telling them to leave and shred their copies.

If you want more of these let me know, I’ve got lots.  Wynne had plenty more including trying to laminate some pretty leaves she liked and breaking our laminater in the process.  A drunk who came in, sat at a computer chugged a four loko, pissed his pants while sitting in the chair and then just walked out laughing like he’d bested us somehow.  Lots of amateur porn, including a gay trio who had me help design an entire 12-month calendar of their own S&amp;M pictures.  I don't want to know why the three of them ordered 5 copies.  Also a woman who was banned from the store for threatening another patron by picking up her miniature poodle and lunging it at them like a weapon.

[Read part 2 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/13jiz6/3_years_of_kinkos_part_2_paid_in_fruit_a_poodle/)",3 years of Kinko's.  Here's half a dozen stories from my best-of.,901
RealHealthier,166,181,1a1pm9,737,"I'm sure I'll post more stories of this guy's incompetence, but I figured I'd go ahead and share a few with you, since it's Sunday, I have some time, and I was reminded of this crap, so here we go.

I work at a highschool ""district"" (idk if district is the right word, but we have several campuses) and recently they hired a new CIO.  He frustrates me so much, I can't even form a decent story here.  I'll just give you examples.

1.  While giving a presentation going through documents in his Google Drive (in IE, opening each in a new window, not a tab), he couldn't figure out how to get from one document back to the drive view.  We told him to just close the foreground window.  He moves his mouse in circles looking around.  ""Just click the red x"" *moves mouse in more circles* ""In the top right corner of the screen"" *keeps moving mouse in circles in complete confusion*.  Finally I stand up and walk up to the screen and point to the elusive red x in the top right corner of the screen and he clicks it.  The presentation continues.

2.  Someone was giving us a formal overview of our Citrix environment (as basic as you can get), and at one point, he said ""and these published apps you see here are determined by the permissions we give the user"" to which our CIO asks, ""What is an 'app?'  Could you give me an example of what an 'app' is?""  After we realized he was serious, we told him that Microsoft Word would be an example of an 'app'.

3.  Back to Google Drive, in another presentation, we're going over a spreadsheet.  He decides he wants to center a column's text.  He clicks in the top cell, clicks the alignment down-arrow and selects center.  Then he clicks in the 2nd cell and clicks the alignment down-arrow, and selects center again.  He does this on a touchpad for about 20 rows with an entire audience watching and waiting.  Because god knows, you can't apply formatting to more than one cell at once.

4.  We have a very high end network with segregated ports and wifi (with repeaters) so we can control who can have internet access and who can access network devices and such.  Like you do.  We had a misconfigured WAP in one room at a campus and we we couldn't access it remotely, so we sent the guy on staff who handles that out there later in the week (he was busy) and our CIO asked ""why didn't you just send someone out and fix it?  I can go to Best Buy and buy a $30 Linksys Access Point and have wireless up and working wherever I want.""

5.  His trademark phrase is ""explain it to me like I'm a 5th grader.""

6.  During a presentation with the whole school, he tries to ask the speaker a question by walking up to the projector and talking into it.  When he couldn't figure out how to talk into the microphone next to it, he just started typing his question into the computer the guy was presenting on, hooked up to the projector.

7.  In our monitoring software, we had all the devices named as their device name as seen in DNS.  All very descriptive so anyone with a brain knew what they were looking at.  This doesn't apply to him.  He had us change the name of every device in the system to an English type description.  Now we have to drill into every device to find its IP / name so we can do something if anything goes down.  He also had us change the way it displayed how much RAM / disk space / CPU is being used into gauges (like a speedometer) from 1% - 100% instead of giving us actual numbers like 3.1GB / 64GB RAM used because ""it's easier for him to understand when it's pictures.""

8.  Someone just got promoted to Help Desk Supervisor and he sent out an email to everyone in the address book informing them that this had happened.  Except he misspelled the guy's name.  Then replied to all and said ""his name is actually spelled &lt;correct spelling.  my bad.""  He's foreign.  ""my bad"" isn't in his vocabulary (at least we've never heard him say it).  We know this came from him though.  It's crazy.

We all just expect this behavior now and nobody corrects it. Okay, this is getting too long.  Turns out I could go on forever, but whenever I tell someone a story about him and they are like ""you're exaggerating, nobody could do that.  My grandparents are smarter than that,"" I revert to these examples.

She asks me ""Hey, I don't know if you're the correct person to ask, but I am freaking out. I need your help. Please come with me."" I follow her wondering what on earth is so important to freak out like this.

She showed me her Outlook inbox and points out an email. I forget what address it was from, but it had ""FBI"" in the address and the title was something like ""Please respond."" She looks at me concerned and says ""Why would the FBI be looking for me? What do they want? Is this really the FBI? I don't feel comfortable talking to them about the company, but I don't want to ignore them or I'll get in trouble."" I just started laughing. I told her it was spam and possibly a virus, and to delete it immediately. She didn't believe me and didn't want to ignore the email. I said ""Trust me, if the FBI wanted to talk to you, they wouldn't be trying to reach out to you through email."" It took a few minutes to make her understand that it was definitely not the FBI.

I work tech support at my university, and we get some great ""issues"" that are called in. During one of my first days on the job, I got assigned to a ticket where one of the faculty called in saying that she could only type in wingdings for some reason (it boggles my mind how technologically inept some brilliant professors are). I head down to her office and sure enough, everything she was typing was symbols and special characters (not wingdings though). After some clicking around on her machine, I glance down at the keyboard and notice that the Alt key was stuck in.

howaboutlove,149,170,181cjs,733,"I'm actually a librarian at a small college, but we have computers in the library, so I end up being ""tech support"" more often than not. This happened last week.

A woman came up to me and asked if I'd please come help her, then beckoned me back to her computer. I followed her to where she was logged in and had only Word open. She pointed at the screen and said, ""What I wanted to copy disappeared."" 

The Word document was completely blank. Obviously *something* had disappeared.

""Can you show me?"" I asked. After sitting back down at the computer, she right-clicked to bring up the little menu and pointed at where ""Paste Options"" was, grayed out.

""See? It disappeared,"" she said. This is a technical college (our largest program is auto repair), so many of our students aren't technologically savvy, so I wasn't really annoyed--this kind of thing happens all the time.

""Oh, when that happens, it means whatever you were trying to copy didn't get copied for some reason. You'll need to go back to where you were copying from and try again.""

She stared at me. I stared at her. She said, ""I was just trying to copy."" She stared some more.

""Yes, I understand, but when you hit copy before, it didn't register for some reason, so you'll need to do it again."" She stared at me.

""Oh,"" she said, continuing with the staring.

""So you'll need to go back to whatever you were trying to copy and try to copy it again."" I stood (and she sat) in silence while we both pondered the endless complexities of life. At least I was; she could have been pondering the price of tea in China for all I know.

""Oh, so I need to find that webpage again,"" she said finally. I nodded. She opened up Internet Explorer and went to town. I went back to my desk wondering if I was speaking Swahili.

My neighbor is outside with his dog. He gives me the standard, ""How's it going."" I answer with, ""It's going."" ""and ""Hey puppy!"" to the dog. As I'm petting the dog, and getting him all charged up before Keith takes him back inside, we exchange normal neighbor small talk. Then Keith suddenly drops his voice barely above a whisper. Turning his back to the street he asks me;

""You got a phone that gets wi-fi?""

Thinking he's about to hit me for free tech support I put on my call center representative voice: ""Yeah, what's up?""

""Check this out,"" Keith pulls his smart phone out of his pocket. Humming happily to himself as he calls up the available networks list. Knowing what is about to happen I shift uneasily from foot to foot, not wanting to ruin it. I take the last swig of my Big Red Soda, and drop my cigarette butt into the empty can. Finally Keith turns his phone so I can see the screen. ""FBI Mobile Command Center"" and ""FBI Surveillance Van #2"" as the top two available networks. I have to clear my throat to stifle a chuckle at this point. Dual band router.

""I knew they were here, watching these houses. I just *knew* it,"" Keith says. ""I caught them the other day. White van sitting across from your house.""

""Y-yeah?"" I cautiously said back to him.

""Yeah man, it looked like a plumber van but I know what's really going on. Watching us, using our tax dollars to sit in a van, listening into our houses. Law abiding Americans, makes me sick"" 

He may have muttered something else, I can't really be certain because I couldn't hold in laughs any longer. I tell him that I've been setting my wireless up with that name for years as a joke. He looked so disappointed when I told him that I had called a plumber. You could watch him visibly sink as the truth came out.

homepup,167,194,17axf3,733,"Worked as the lone IT ""Manager"" for a company a decade ago. One day the printer in the Sales department decided to lay over and die. 

Enter our main character: The Sales Lady (who I always thought resembled Mokey Fraggle) who was always the first to use bleeding-edge technology and would regularly admit not being tech savvy enough to use it properly but just had to have it. She was in desperate need to get a print out of something on her screen but was flummoxed that the printer was broken. Always full of ideas, not always good ones, she decides she knows what to do rather than attempt to print to a different printer.

I come walking through the Customer Service area to see the Sales Lady, with the assistance of her Cust. Service Rep, both of them attempting to balance her laptop, sprawled open and face down, on the top of the copier manically pressing the ""copy"" button. The only words I hear are ""It's still too dark!!"" as her CSR just looks over at me like a whipped puppy, her eyes screaming at me, ""Save ME!!""

Of course, I immediately had to gather as many as I could to witness this once in a lifetime event. Eventually the Sales Manager drifts through, sees the crowd that's gathered, realizes what she's doing and tells her to go away, she's embarrassing herself.

Did I mention she was our 2nd highest Sales Rep pulling in well over six figures, easily 3-4 times as much as me at the time? Great morale boost.

seraph77,75,173,1liuxp,727,"Basically, this client is a d-nozzle. He's fairly competent, but usually he knows just enough to royally screw things up. Yesterday, he decided to ""optimize"" his server for VOIP traffic. Without going into detail, he managed to thoroughly corrupt the TCP/IP stack on his box and was down for a couple hours while we fixed his fubar for him.

So, I get a text from one of our guys last night asking if he can escalate this guy to me. He's irate, belligerent, and demanding compensation for the ""thousands of dollars"" he's out because of the downtime. Now, I haven't met this guy in person, but just from my dealings with him, he has always come across as an alpha-douche that gets his jollies by berating and intimidating people under him. Everyone in the office knows and hates this guy, and he has ridden the line of what he pays/mo vs how much shit we have to deal with. Last night I decided he crossed the line.

Keep in mind this is my day off, and I'm at a bar with some friends having a great time when this comes in. I'm half-lit, not exactly pleased that something work-related is interrupting my fun Saturday night, and then find out it's *that guy*. BOFH engaged; send him over :)

In short, I proceed to call him out on his ineptitude. I keep it professional, but in the most sardonic way possible (honed over many jaded years of experience). This guy is absolutely seething on the other side. He keeps talking about cancelling his service, and I tell him we'll have his server unracked and waiting at the front desk in 20 minutes. *unintelligible rage ensues*

Hopefully you guys can (vicariously) enjoy this small victory as much as I did. We'll see what my job status is on Tuesday XD

update: Apparently he raged for a couple hours, berating my guys and threatening earth-shattering lawsuits. Minutes later, he was wondering why his server was offline again.

lwdoran,86,184,1nb8i5,734,"The place where I work is preparing to construct a new system development lab for the project that I'm working on.  In order to build the new lab, they are temporarily re-locating all of the project infrastructure servers.  As you would expect, this involves an advertized unavailability period while we walk the servers down the hall and have the telcom guy (a contractor) activate the network connection ports.

If you've ever done an unavailability like this, you are probably thinking that I'm going to complain about a user that missed the memo and doesn't want us to shut down the servers... not this time.

The advertized unavailability was set for 1400 (2pm) on Friday.  Expecting a rough afternoon, my self, the project lead and my boss decided to go out to lunch a little after 1200.  On the way out the door, a junior sysadmin stopped us:

Sysadmin: ""The telcom guy wants to do the move at 1245."" (it's 1215)

Project Lead: ""No.""

Sysadmin: ""He said that he was planning at leaving by 1100 originally.  We are 'lucky' he's willing to stick around until then.""

Project Lead: ""No.  Even if we would entertain the thought of moving early, now is too late.  Everyone is at lunch; they won't know until 1 at the earliest.  1245 is NOT gonna happen.""

Sysadmin: ""He said that he won't stick around until 2.  He has somewhere else that he needs to be.""

Me: ""So?  1400 was the advertized time.  Hand cuff yourself to the telcom closet if you need to; don't let him touch it before then.""

Sysadmin: ""But I think he's going to leave.""

Project lead: ""Then hand cuff yourself to him.""

Me: ""...or lie down behind his truck...""

Sysadmin: ""I could slash his tires!""

Boss: ""lol... &lt;manager voice&gt; No. &lt;/manager voice&gt; Do what you need to do, but this move will happen at 2 on the dot.  We're going to lunch.""

I never did find out what the junior sysadmin did and, frankly, I'm not going to ask.  All I do know is that when we got back from lunch, the telcom guy was still there, the servers were still hooked up and the development team was preparing for the unavailability as planned.

TSS: But I was sick all week!!!

Me: I hope you're feeling better. I'll see what I can do.

TSS: We talked about this last week!!  Why is this such a problem now?  You're ruining our training!!

*Side note 2: We didn't talk about this last week.  I asked about a file that would be necessary for when we eventually ran the file for the start of the year, but no training was mentioned.*

It didn't happen on Friday.  I struggled with the production issues our recent move caused, and nothing seemed to work.  The weird thing was, I didn't feel guilty about walking out at 3 not having it done.  There are other users who've asked for things last-minute, been awesome and apologetic about it, and are just genuinely nice people who acknowledge that dropping everything to get their stuff done affects everything else I have to do for the day. This chick is not one of those people.

I did log on, did get a file today, and did end up fighting with the system for two hours just to get what I got.  I sent it over, told her to not even THINK about complaining about it and flat out said that I missed Sunday brunch to get this done for her.  I also demanded that she quit it with the ""emergencies"" because her failure to plan should not constitute me giving up my weekend events.  I'm not usually that unprofessional with my users, but I'm done.  Her training on Monday is ""ruined,"" and exactly 0 fucks have been given.

He is having some major issues. He breaks it down really quickly and simply.
Now, I know this dude is far from illiterate, but he really blew me away with how in-depth he explained the issue.

He said something like this:

""Yeah, this thing doesn't start up. It gets to the login screen, and I get an error message saying 'C:\Windows\System32\suck\it\trebek\cantrememberfilename.dll Bad Image'. I googled the issue, and it comes up as a driver problem. I can boot into safe mode just fine, but regular startup doesn't work.""

One: He told me just about EVERYTHING I needed to know without hesitation. No tooth pulling, no facedesk, and no bullshit.
Two: He actually took the time to google the problem! My brain exploded at this point.

All geared up to help this saint of a user, I step into action. I figure that a simple sfc /scannow should work. I ask to boot into safe mode with command prompt.

Error on startup.

At this point, I realize this thing might be dead. I ask him to put in a recovery disc.
One problem: There is no disc drive.

No recovery disc option like that? Forget it. I will just install Ubuntu through USB for him. I am not going to break my back over a decade-old OS. I just want to check the BIOS first to see if there is USB boot capability in the boot priority menu.

I guide him through the steps, and he says that there is only a vague ""primary boot device"" listing in the boot priorities.

I explain my plans, show him the OS, give him plenty of info in order for him to OK my suggestion, and he accepts. I tell him that I will go over to his place to set it up the next day.

-The next day-
I call him:

**ME:** ""Hey. I am heading over to your place right now to help install the OS.""

**HIM:** ""Oh, I already did that. I figured that i could try to do the booting from USB thing like you said, and it worked.""

**ME:** ""Well done. Do you want me to give you a quick tour of the OS? I am positive that you're lost.""

**HIM:** ""I am totally lost on this thing. Please do.""

This man showed some serious initiative. As much as I don't condone diving headfirst into something like an OS install, there was nothing to lose, and he learned something from it. He really went above and beyond the threshold expected even from users of literacy levels that are almost twice his. I have never been so happy to work on a computer.

After I laughingly said no, he tells me: ""ok I can give $1000 AND THAT FINAL OFFER"". I was, at this point, wheezing and wiping away tears after this, as he proceeds to babble on that he's seen ""much better work"" and ""better sites"" for ""much cheaper than $1000"".

jaradrabbit,152,176,xvy6n,729,"Background: I work on the support desk for a niche, business-only ISP. Our broadband products are expensive because you get direct support to people like me.

The Customer: A high end sales floor that sells 200,000 dollar yachts and motorhomes.

The IT Manager for The Customer: Got the job because ""his brother used to do it"".

So last week, they upgraded their broadband from ADSL to a newer VDSL setup with us. All was good for 2 days (in which they downloaded 50GB of data) and then on Monday phoned in furious that they had no connection.

On inspection, I found the connection to be up and running. I could telnet to their router, and could even see traffic passing through it. After talking to their IT manager, he told me they seemed to be unable to browse to anything for 10 mins, then it'd work for 5 mins, then off again. He assured me he'd checked their LAN and servers and could find nothing wrong.

Should I mention that their LAN IP addressing is using public IP addresses that don't belong to them and are NAT'd? Yeah. Red flag there.

Our network engineers could find nothing wrong, and I received a lovely missive from a California University telling me that The Customer's real public IP was trying to hack into remote desktop servers. Lovely.

I tell The IT Manager. First he demands I tell him how to find the virus (wut?). I suggest he uses his antivirus, then things like netstat from a DOS prompt etc. He calls back an hour later, absolutely furious. He insists there's no virus on their network. He insists everything is perfect. He is absolutely adamant that it's the broadband line.

We send out a field engineer. What does he find? 

* Two Windows 2003 servers riddled with viruses (running DHCP, DNS and basic file sharing - no domain or permissions).
* Two Linux servers for which noone has passwords and noone even knows what they're doing.
* About 40 workstations, all running pirated copies of XP, also jammed with nastiness. Everyone is full admin on their local machines AND all the network shares.
* A hodge-podge of network gear by different vendors, none of which they have passwords for.
* No backups of any of their data (not that they didn't have an online backup account provided by us or anything... The IT Manager just never bothered to set it up).
* No antivirus installed on any machine. We found The IT Manager wandering around with a USB stick with a portable copy of AVG Free Personal edition on it, plugging it into each machine one at a time and making a fantastic effort of spreading around the viruses even more while fixing nothing.

Unplugging their shithole of a network from the router results in a perfect, constant 40Mbps.

It's now Wednesday. We've had an engineer on site for two days straight trying to fix their broken computers and network. Our poor field engineer had no idea where to start, and contemplated telling them to set fire to the place and take the insurance money, as literally every single thing he looks at to do with the computers or network is either somehow broken, misconfigured, or pirated.

Effex,199,113,10w5yb,729,"About 8 years ago, when I started my CIS major in college, I was in between jobs and tried to make some extra money by advertising computer repair, installation, etc.. I had printed roughly 100 pages, and posted them all around town and some neighboring towns.

About a week went by before I received my first call for a job. It was from a guy who wanted to have his sons computer repaired. And I knew that address very well as it was right by my old highschool, the rich side of town.

Gorgeous house, nice family, awfully spoiled 12 year old brat. The usual, right?

I get to his room, and see the Alienware. It booted windows xp, so there were no major issues, it ended up being malware, no biggie. I let his parents know that I charged $20 for the virus removal and $20 for the visit. They gave me $80, awesome. I go back in to take care of business.

I was done within 10 minutes, the kids internet was back up, all was fine. I really felt like giving his dad a little bonus for the awesome tip, so I offered to install some free virusprotection, clean the hdd/registery, etc..  He happily agreed, and decided to sit on the bed next to me as I did this.

At this point, his son was pretty much demanding that I leave, his dad kept asking why, and all he kept repeating was that I fixed it and it's done. His dad insisted that I stay to install the antivirus so it doesn't happen again. As awkward as a spot this put me in, It wasn't the kid who was paying me.

I grabbed a free firewall + antivirus, and it defaulted to the download directory: ""DL"" on his C: drive. 

As I am about to open this drive, the kid spontaneously stomps out of his room.

I open it up,and I knew exactly what to expect, but it was *oh so much more*.

In this coveted ""DL"" folder. This kid had more porn in there than my friends and I combined. Keep in mind, he is 12 years old. Pictures, Videos, gang bangs, softcore, you name it, he had it.

How did I know all of this? Because his thumbnails were set to large display, and penises, vaginas and facials were all over the screen. his dad had the palest look on his face. I'm pretty sure they were a conservative family, with conservative values. I'm also pretty sure he didn't know wth was going on in his childs private life.

Now im sitting here feeling awkward as all hell, and it isn't even the half of it. There was another folder inside ""DL"" that was named Stepmom. I guess this kid wasn't worried about protecting his private stash, at all.

His dad tried to gather his composure, and asks me to ""look at stepmom"". I ask him that maybe It would be best if I were to leave, but he pleaded with me to stay because he didn't know how to use a computer at all.

TBH, my curiosity level was at around +11, because his stepmom, the woman in yoga pants down stairs.. Holy jebus.

I open it up and it was riddled with pictures and videos of her in the garden, pool, was a video of her changing clothes, etc.

He steps away for a minute. I am getting ready to leave cause I know this ain't going to be pretty. But I guess it was the fatehrs intention to ridicule his son for punishment, because I heard a bunch of yelling followed by the father dragging the boy into the room and his step mom following behind.

They had me go through all of his porn (Like open it up and play some of it) and then go through some of her pics, which the look of awkward on her face surpassed mine by maybe.. 10fold?

At this point I realized that the father was probably a little crazy, extremely persistent, and very pissed off. I almost felt like a hostage at this point, it was actually pretty wild.

I offered to delete everything and finish the installation, he agreed, and I got the hell outof there within about 5 minutes.

One of the most awkward situations I'd ever been in, but pretty damn funny as I look back.

zupernam,151,192,1jjo27,729,"My first post on TFTS, after a couple weeks of reading. This is actually a story from my Dad, as I am too young to have a job, let alone one in tech support. I will refer to my dad as B. This happened years ago.

B was working normally as a sysadmin at $company, when his boss walks to his office and tells him that a potentially crippling backdoor has been found in the server software that their company uses. He gives B a CD from a stack that he's carrying, and says to start fixing the servers by running the CD in each one (This was happening all around the world at different $company locations). He decides to put the CD in his computer and see what was on it.

At the end of that day, everyone gathers around, his coworkers talking about the servers, ""Yeah I fixed 264 servers today"" ""Really? I only got about 200"". Stuff like that. They say, ""So B, how many did you fix?"" He replies that he didn't fix any, and they get kind of mad, saying that he wasn't helping.

The next day, B goes back into his office, and starts work on his computer, like yesterday. At the end of the day, he still hasn't fixed any servers. This continues for a few more days, people getting more and more mad at him. Finally, his boss enters his office, and says something along the lines of, ""Hey B, you need to help fix these servers, or we'll need to do something about you not helping."" He says ok, and keeps doing what he's doing. He finishes his project that day, and at the end of the day, people are still talking about how much they did. ""I got 368 servers done, how about you B?"" B replies, ""I did over 127,000, and they're all done, even the ones in India and around the world. Everyone looks at him crazily, and he explains that he used the backdoor to fix the backdoor. He gets a raise, his boss says sorry, etc.

**EDIT** He did get clearance from his manager, just not his higher-up boss, who was mad at him for not helping.",Backdoors = easy access,921
The_Beasts_Belly,386,143,1g5wny,728,"**Background:** I am a very high-level IT person at a major defense company, about a month ago I performed my first firing.

**The Story:** About a year ago we finished our shiny new datacenter and with it, we got some shiny new employees.  One of the new ones, who we will call 'Steve' was a recent college graduate, with a bachelors in Computer Science and specialized in security.  I put him on tier-1 help-desk for a few months while he proved himself, but 3 months ago I decided he was ready for the major league and promoted him to level-1 server administration (Deploying new servers, basic troubleshooting, etc).   I supervise his work for a month and only experiences a few missteps, but nothing major.

Now in our datacenter we run everything on Virtual Machines and we have a couple templates for the virtual hardware ranging from our small (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 4 GB for OS and a 40 GB iSCSI disk)for web servers all the way up to our SQL-XL template (16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, 128 GB disk for OS and 4 TB of iSCSI).  The servers are usually set up in groups of 8 and put behind the load balancer.

For the operating systems, we have a short list of ones that we will support: OpenBSD (Latest stable), Windows Server 2008 R2 or a very-customized linux kernel.

But I digress, back to the story.

Steve gets a couple tickets for Web servers, an application server or two, just basic stuff.  He ended up taking about twice as long on each than I expected it to take so I sit down with him and ask what's up with that, he replies that he is working as fast as Linux is allowing him (what with reboots, etc), turns out he was installing some weird -buntu distribution in the datacenter as opposed to any of our supported OSes.  I immediately tell him to stop and that now he has to go and migrate all the machines to one of our supported OSes.

He gets it all migrated back over the next week and I think all is good, he got an appropriate punishment and now he will follow the rules, or so I thought.

But I was wrong.

The following week I get a report that a server that Steve set up was running slow.  I log into to check on the cluster to see its usage; CPU, Mem and disk are at 100%.  Something isn't right.  I expand the server node and rather than see 8 small servers I see one large one.  I try to log on, but its rejecting my smart card and manually entering my credentials doesn't seem to work either, weird.  I get Steve into my office he sits down, pulls out his laptop and sets it down on my desk.

Once logged in he fires up PuTTY and what he types next made me go white and then dark red in the face:
 &lt;Servername&gt;.&lt;ourdomain&gt;.com and enter.  A login banner pops up, he then proceeds to log into using **root** and a password that looked to be about 5 characters long.

I am pissed at this point (It is very hard to get me to be angry, in fact I am normally accused of being high all the time because I am so calm).

**Me:** Why are you able to log into that machine, you should never be able to SSH into a machine from the internet.  Tell me that you at least used a white list for the IPs allowed to connect to this machine.

**Steve:** Don't worry, its Linux, no one can hack into it!

I pull his laptop over to me and look at the server he just logged into.  Yep, its that stupid distribution he was using earlier, not connected to LDAP, no firewall enabled...  Looking at the output of ps and see a single process using as many resources it can.  The process was a Java applet, odd since we don't use Java here...  No logs on the system (all were cleared and syslog turned off).  Dumping the list of active connections on the machine and I see a whole mess of connections to single machine over port 80 and a single connection to an odd IP over an odd port.  I called up the end user of the server and they have no idea what any of this was so I turned off the machine and submitted it to our Anti-Malware team to look at it.

I kept Steve in my office while the anti-malware team looked at the machine.  A few minutes later I get a call from them saying that apparently a foreign nation's cyber warfare group managed to SSH into the machine and install some sort of DDoS tool (root password was apparently set to 'access').   At this point I get on the phone with Security and have a guard come up to my office.  Then called HR to start some paperwork.

From what he did, Steve ended up becoming guilty of nearly a dozen violations of FIPS and other security standards and requirements.  And because of these violations he is facing jail time.  Even more if it determined that he colluded with the foreign aggressor.

**TLDR;**  self pro-claimed security believes that Linux is invincible even when you set a crappy password and disable every bit of security afforded to them and gets arrested for his disregard for policy.

Now read on...
   
  
   
So there I was in my job with much free time on my hands, and I'd used it to compile, amongst other things, a database of various user and system issues and errors, along with their associated fixes. Because I am a neat and industrious little bunny like that, and also a little picky when it comes to quality documentation.

Now, I had access to certain records by the nature of my position, and I thought it might be an interesting venture to make a list of all the tech people at all the offices in my state, along with their email addresses. You never know when you might need such a thing, after all. So this I do. These techs, being much like myself, were generally the only person in their respective offices who knew which end of a computer was up. None of us were in an office team; we were all singletons.
   
  
   
And as things go, and by and by, I find myself sending the occasional email to some of the techs at the nearby offices, usually on the occasion that a user transferred over and wanted a copy of their profile to go with them. Fairly straightforward. And as things would have it, we would sometimes chat about various problems we'd run into and swap or brainstorm solutions.

Given that I was overseeing one of the larger offices, and given that I had more than my fair share of free time to devote to tracking down fascinating little bugs and weirdnesses, it so turned out that out of those of us who bothered to keep records on such things, I had compiled the largest and most comprehensive database in only a few months. Not terribly surprising, perhaps.

Only once I innocently revealed the existence of said database during an email exchange, one of the other techs wanted a look at it. And being as how I didn't have any reason not to, I sent it to him. And in the course of things, he told one of the other techs, who also wanted a copy. And so on.

Eventually, a large proportion of the office techs in the state emailed me, and asked for this database, and also for any updates. And I was happy to share. Only I thought, as one tends to do, ""What if someone at one of the other sites has knowledge that isn't in the database? Wouldn't it be more useful being shared too?"" So I set up a little mailing list with all these techs in it, and mailed them updates, and asked for their input. And lo and behold, most of them hit Reply-All, and we had ourselves the beginnings of a forum.
   
  
   
Now, this wasn't a problem in and of itself. Although given that we'd mostly never actually physically met each other, and in general we'd had no other techs to talk to since we'd started the job, the floodgates kinda opened. There was a lot of back-and-forth, and, well, some techs were waxing loquacious and others were kinda getting lost in the background. Complaints were made. And then I got An Email.

This particular Email (with the capital letter) came from the state helpdesk, a bunch of techs in the state HQ we occasionally passed jobs to if they affected multiple offices. It said, in no uncertain terms, that they considered themselves the only source of information allowed to techs in less exalted offices, and that what I was doing was Propogating Potentially Dangerous Information to Largely Untrained Personnel.
   
  
   
I... may have made the mistake, being high on youth and bravado at the time, of welcoming them to OUR discussion which, by the way, had provided more training and solutions to the office techs than the initial single day of training at state HQ and subsequent deafening silence ever had. Oh, and I'd also based it off a similar setup which was being run very successfully in the next state over to great acclaim. Oh, and our FPOC issue resolution statewide was significantly up, meaning that we really didn't actually NEED the state helpdesk for anything any more.
   
  
   
Yeah.
   
  
   
Things... did not go well after that. Management became involved, and I was banned from emailing any of the other technicians (over their protests) for anything other than my actual duties. Some of us set up mailing lists using external email addresses to keep in touch, but it petered out after a while.

It wasn't until I was transferred out of that position entirely that I later found out the resolution and training improvements had not gone unnoticed, the State helpdesk had been severely reduced in both capacity and number of stuck-up snobs, and that office techs now got to have one day every six months where they could physically all get together, and shoot the breeze in the same place: the now-empty section at the State HQ.
   
  
   
Then there was the time I broke national security in thirty seconds flat...

The last two weeks have been IT hell. Why? Because a lot of stores do not use all their registers all the time, until holiday weekends. So they've been wanting everything repaired for their deadhead registers (the one they swap faulty equipment for when they cannot afford replacing it), wanted every nuisance on every register fixed, and that's on top of the weekly report, password, and derp issues.

Our phone and online queues have been maxed every day the last two weeks. We pretty much have been multitasking as we work on multiple stores, do maintenance on systems, monitor updates, and take calls. As such we've been a little short on patience.

reallyrose,140,224,tnzsn,722,"My father, like a lot of /r/talesfromtechsupport folk's parents (it seems) doesn't get computers. He had been writing a book on the topic of history using a word processing program on a computer (or a *magic-think-box* to use the technical term) but for YEARS was phoning me to ask how to put something in italics. He started writing it in about 1999. 
Anyway, he finished his book in around 2006 and was preparing it for submission to publishers.    
This lead to an epic journey of technophobic wrangling to cope with the submission procedures for the various publishing houses.    
1) He posted his final draft to several places on floppy disc. In 2007. When he received replies from a few requesting that he submit via email, he responded with ""But you asked for electronic format?""    
2) Posting the entire thing into (several) emails and sending it that way.    
3) This one is my favorite.    
*Slight aside for a back story. After a few years, I stopped giving tech support. In the best tradition of tech support, any assistance I gave was met with suspicion and a lack of any ability or will to follow instructions. After which comes ""But you did something / told me to do something 12 months ago and now it's broken and this is your fault!"" So I was no longer having anything to do with it. Any issues he has had since 2002, he's worked through on his own using books or the help function on the computer or trial and error.*    
       
And back to 3)    
He was asked to submit his book in pdf format via email. After a long time, he:    
- worked out what a pdf was...    
- found one online he could edit...    
- downloaded it...     
- deleted its content and then...    
- copy/pasted his book into the pdf file.        
    
After all this, he was happily browsing the pdf of his book when he noticed that another person's name, email address and other details were in the footer of the pdf.    
Instant freakout. He's been hacked. *Someone is trying to steal his book!*    
He called me, I referred him to the ""Calm down and Google it"" clause of our father/daughter relationship.    
Instead, he called the cybercrime division of the police. According to the law here, all cybercrime has to be investigated. Hacking, it's srs bisness, y'know.    
So out comes a cybercrime police person, takes down all the information and investigates my father's pc.    
Because he downloaded a pdf and edited it, the 'hackers' information was actually the copyright information of the person who owned the original pdf.    
So, technically, kinda, sorta, it was my Dad who was committing the 'cybercrime'.    
My mother says that the policeman came out of the office, went to his car, laughed for about 10 minutes and then came back in and explained things to my father. Then showed him how to save things as pdf in Word.    
My father says that he had a lucky escape and that the hackers are everywhere and won't hesitate to steal someone's book, right off their pc. He's still editing that pdf instead of saving as pdf from Word.

We just bought a new computer for our small business. The boss' wife
signed on over the summer and while she's been working hard, she is
quickly becoming a problem user. It doesn't help that she's constantly
reminding everybody that she and her husband pay the bills. Think
GOB's brief stint as president in Arrested Development. Except without

Anyway, the new PC for another new employee arrived today. It's a HP
machine. Decent enough. i5 processor, 8 gigs of RAM, no SSD but  a
hefty 1TB hard drive. The guys at HP were nice enough to include a
handle attached to the package, so I started carrying it up the
stairs. Boss' wife is walking down at the same time.

always mean more power. But she's off in her own little world, testing

I brushed off most things, people are stupid, that's what kept me going, but today, today sucked. The day started normally, browsed reddit for a while, read some manga, had breakfast at the office, but a call would end my patience. Anyways, got a call because the wifi wasn't working in their office, before I went there, my boss called me in his office to explain the situation, even though I had gone there multiple times.

He screamed at me for not being able to fix it, I took it like a man, and said nothing. When I got there, the customer screamed at me for not fixing it, even though it was working fine yesterday, and the people there were stupid as fuck, because they have 2 connections, 1 router that's not connected to anything and is used as a lan/network utility, and a router that has internet and wifi on it. Turns out, the fuckwits were connecting to the router without connection to the internet.

Just as I finished explaining that to them, my boss came, for god knows what, and yelled at me because I didn't explain to them which router they should use wifi from. Again, I said nothing, but the last drop was when, for some reason, the lan cable going to a computer was not working well and had to be cut and replaced; my boss proceded to check and said it wasn't the problem but the computer itself, I said fuck it, and cut the cable. It worked, he screamed at me, in front of the customers about how I should follow his orders since he's my boss and he knows more than me.

When we got to the office, I lost my shit and told him I quit, he said I was too good of an employee to let go and offered me a raise, told him to fuck off, and am starting a new job selling buttons, making almost triple the money.

These are The Adventures of Pete, and I assure you they are mostly true.*

##\#003 What Budget?

It was an average Monday morning at the office: production was behind schedule, I was being interrupted every five minutes with technical support calls, and the office manager was running around trying to figure out who spent $20,000 from the company account over the weekend. Nobody knew anything about it.

The FedEx truck arrived right on schedule with the deliveries that had accumulated over the weekend, and the ladies in production sat down to sort the packages. Most were supplies for their shelves, anyway. Of course, the ladies did what they always do when they were confused — they called me.    
""Know what these are?"" one asked as I entered the room. Both were staring intently at their computer monitors, eyes fixed on whatever block-shattering game they played all day.

All it took was a brief glance for me to see what they were asking about. Five enormous boxes marked ""DELL"" sat in the corner, nearly piled up to the ceiling. I shook my head.    
""Nope,"" I replied. ""I haven't ordered anything."" I returned to my desk; I had work to do.

Pete started to get anxious after lunch, pacing laps around the office and muttering ""Supposed to be here by now."" under his breath. Several people asked what he was going on about, but he paid no attention. It wasn't until his fourth or fifth lap that he stopped by production and found what he was looking for.

It was impossible for Pete to sneak the packages past the office manager's door, and it was equally impossible for the office manager to not put the pieces together. Thousands of dollars were missing and Pete was cheerfully wheeling giant boxes of computer equipment through the office.    
""What are those?"" he asked as Pete pushed his cart past for the third time.    
""My development servers,"" Pete replied.    
""Where did they come from?""    
""I ordered them Friday evening.""    
The office manager was clearly becoming agitated. ""How much did you spend on them?""    
""Just $20,000, but it's from my budget account."" Pete answered.    
""What budget?""    
Pete ignored him and continued to push his little cart.

It took the rest of the day to piece the story together. Faced with the reality that such powerful computers existed in the server room, behind a door to which Pete didn't have a key, he took it upon himself to spend more than two-thirds of my annual salary to ensure his office was the most well-equipped in the building. He assured the owner that it was absolutely necessary for him to have full control over his development environment, and for his development server to dwarf every piece of hardware in the server room combined.

So a coworker of mine goes to go reimage a machine - he reimages it, does all of the settings/updates/etc, and copies her files back over. He asks the customer if the machine was previously encrypted. She tells him, yes, it was. So he goes and encrypts the machine and gives it back to her. She goes to use the computer.

""This is how you log into an encrypted computer. You said that your computers were all encrypted""

Receptionist: Well, that is your job and I am asking you to do it.

Me: Well, I have to say not, his email passwords and any other passwords that he has are not to be used for anyone else, strictly a company policy.

Receptionist: Well, fine. Make me an administrator.

Me: Excuse me, but what?

Receptionist: Make me an administrator like you, then I can find the password myself.

Me: Again, that isn't allowed by company policy and I will not allow general workers to have administrator access on the network when they don't need it.

Receptionist: Well, fine. I'll be on the board of directors by the end of the week, and then I will make you give me administrator access.

That was this guy's issue, anyway. Well, sort of. He described it as ""the computer overheated and the memory chip leaked a bunch of stuff onto the motherboard. Could you clean it off for me?"" Now huge alarm bells are going off in my head when I get this machine, but it boots up fine and everything's hunky dory. I mean... the keyboard's crazy sticky, but the gentleman claims that he uses a usb keyboard anyway. Confusing. So I flip the machine over to take a look at this ""melted memory.""

I pop the cover off of the memory ports and take a look. I IMMEDIATELY spot a massive problem, reel away from the computer, and try very, very hard not to burst out laughing. I walk the gentleman's laptop over to him and ask a few questions about what exactly he wants done. I try to be vague and open ended, but it turns out that he just wants a few of the stains on the inside of the case case to be cleaned up (likely from whatever it was that made the keyboard sticky). Whatever, fine, mystery gunk doesn't gross me out like it does most people. I'll slap on a pair of gloves and put some elbow grease into it momentarily.

First though... I'm going to have to charge him for an internal component install. I had to crack the case, it's company policy, no way around it my manager was standing right there. Of course, now that he's agreed to pay the internal component install...

""Since I'm in here already, would you like me to go ahead and install this RAM correctly? It's in backwards. No, yes, really. Backwards. Even you can tell, if you look at it closely. That little gold part is supposed to be in that little black part.""

He thanks me very much for pointing that out, and yes he would like me to do that. I pull out the antistatic pad and wristband, flip the memory around, and seat it properly. Then, because I'm slightly prescient and know exactly what's going to happen, I boot the computer back up.

Nothing. Black screen.

Of course.

The tech that was monkeying around in the machine last time got a bad memory stick. Rather than calling it in, filling out the paperwork, and taking a new working stick out to my client, the lazy asshole FLIPPED THAT SHIT AROUND AND LEFT IT IN THERE.

So I ask him to read off his service tag (think Dell serial number), since we randomize the password of a local admin account based on the tag. He tells me, I input it into our generator and give him the password.

Doesn't work. 'Can you repeat the service tag for me again?' Sure he says. Seven Three Zero Bravo Mike Two One. (Not the actual tag for anonymizing reasons) I put that into our inventory and nothing comes up, strange. So I search the tag on Dell's website and it brings back a server, not a workstation.

At this point another technician wanders by and he too wants to have a crack at it. He starts writing down the service tag as the user reads it off, only to stop when he realizes it is the exact same as what I wrote down. ""Try changing the Zero to an 'O'"" he suggests. 'Dell doesn't include O's in their tags though' I say, meanwhile the user can hear all of this banter over the phone and stays quiet.

A new network engineer comes by and suggests the same 0-O shenanigans but of course it doesn't work. In desperation we have to give him the password to a service desk backdoor account.

He asked me if I had ever screwed up and I decided to tell him my worst f**k up story of my career.  He said that would make a great post on reddit so I have decided to share with you guys my tale.  



Before we start I'd like to state that everything here is 100% true and actually happened, the only changes were in an effort to anon it as best I can.  



For this story you will need to know a few variables:


$me1 = Middle Eastern Country 1 - We here in the US have an off and on relationship with them, not everyone likes them and we probably wouldn't have them over for a 4th of July picnic.


$me2 = Middle Eastern Country 2 - We here in the US are pretty cool with them.


This story also involves the UK but it's easier just to write UK, and I'm lazy.


You also need to know that my boss and owner was from $me1 and his family was/is very well connected in the $me1 govt.  He also was (by nature of his culture) very very secretive.


So here we go...



The company I was working for at the time had a lot of dealings with overseas companies, especially in the Middle East.  It ranged from everything from general support, email, websites, custom apps, and hosted desktops.  We also did work for various gov't entities in the middle east as well, enough things that I would always be ""randomly selected"" for enhanced screenings at the airport.



One thing you have to keep in mind while reading this is that alot of these companies and even some of the gov't bodies do not have alot of money or they are unable to run mainstream software.  So as such we used ALOT of Linux and open source solutions for them.



We were asked by $me1 to migrate their email from a software called scalix to Zimbra.  So go I go about to determine the scope of the project and everything seemed pretty normal except for the fact that ALL of the email existed on the scalix website.  No pst files and nothing to import, all they used was POP and IMAP.  I decided that I would use a tool on a small linux box to basically read and write using IMAP the mail from scalix to zimbra.



Here is where I made my first mistake....for some reason (and to this day I don't know why) I created a dummy account on the zimbra system with MY NAME not a generic user like ""import"".  



Here was my second mistake...I didn't know enough about the program or IMAP on scalix/zimbra to know that it would migrate the emails over as unread and then if they were indeed read would then mark them unread.  (so in essence it would ""read"" the emails)



So the first user I start with is the CEO since he has the largest mailbox and needs his emails first.  I start my program and watch as the emails fly by hundreds at a time.  I think all is well and goto lunch.



I come back from lunch and my boss runs in my office pale as a ghost (and he's from the Middle East) and says something I will never forget as long as I live....



**""The office of the finance minister for the country of $me2 is on the phone and wants to talk to you""**



I found out then that the company we were contracted with was basically the central bank of $me1, and the CEO of course had dealings with gov't offices all over the region.



Here is what happened....When the emails were imported into the import account (my FULL NAME) they were marked read, this caused the system to send read receipts out, hundreds if not thousands of them...to the entire Middle East.  Basically anyone that had ever sent him an email that needed a read receipt got one with my VERY western name on it.  It literally set off alarms all over the region because everyone assumed the CEO's email had been compromised and all that information was out there.  Including not only financials of the country, but what countries gave them money and travel plans for visiting dignitaries.  That's when Tony Blair's office called, because he was scheduled to visit the region and they were concerned that someone had seen the schedule (for security reasons)



It took at least 5 hours to get everyone that contacted us settled down, my boss had a good laugh after we learned no real dmg was done.  He told me that I was probably never going to be able to fly again and to watch out on my way home for black ford expeditions following me.



Just so happens on my way home that night as I turned into my neighborhood I hit a checkpoint where they were verifying insurance, the odd part is that I lived at that time on a cul-de-sac.  By this time I was so wrecked from the day that I went straight home and went directly to bed.



**TLDR; I think I just caused an international incident.**

Smallwater,251,172,1ohvjr,714,"TFTS, I guess you all like a change from the stories of idiot users and annoying bosses who don't know shit. Let me give you some hope in humanity.  
I [told](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1o5rgl/lights_on_router_out/) [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1obnqg/router_from_hell_or_user_from_hell_its_difficult/) that I don't work in IT. I'm still in college, and I do study IT. I also live in a dorm, but I go home on Fridays so I can see my parents, do a parttime job on Saturdays, and get my clothes washed.  
Now, most of the inhabitants of my dorm are pretty awesome. They're cool guys/gals, and all is well. There are some of them who are pretty good with computers, but for whatever reason, everyone comes to me with their digital problems. Not that I mind, most of the time it's just a simple reboot or a loose wire.  
Now, one of my friends there, let's call him Bro, is absolutely dreadful with computers. I'm talking 4 different toolbars, a system full with bloatware, a HDD to the brim with temp files and useless clutter, his system looks like a 90-year old's PC. He is, however, an awesome dude, who likes the same sort of games, movies, or anime like me, and I can spend hours in his room just discussing gaming in general, or watching some series.  
One day, he called me, and asked me to take a look at his PC. It had stopped working. I was thinking it may be some simple virus, or maybe its HDD was just finally too full. I loaded up some cleaning programs on a USB stick, and made my way to his room.  
I didn't need the USB stick.  
I was greeted by a black screen, with white text on it. I don't really remember what it said, but I knew it was fucked. I tried rebooting it (to no avail), and looked it up on Google (also to no avail).  
I couldn't possibly fix this. It had transcended from the mortal plane of IT into the realm of complete bustedness. I told Bro ""sorry, I can't fix this. I will have to reinstall it""  
That was a problem, as Bro didn't have the money for a new (see PS) Windows CD (A backup? What's a backup?), and didn't want an illegal copy, so I suggested installing Ubuntu.  
Being as computer illiterate as he is, he didn't know about Ubuntu. So I explained to him what it was, showed him some sites on my phone, but he didn't really like it.  
""I'm not too good with computers, I don't want something technical like that, and then fuck it up""  
""Bro, what do you use your PC for?""  
""uhh, internet, video, and downloading""  
""Then Linux isn't too much for you. I can install VLC, a torrent program, and Firefox for you, and you can do what you want""  
Alright, Bro was onboard. I quickly burned a brand new shiny Ubuntu 12.4 install CD for him, and I installed it on his PC. By now it was deep in the night, 2 - 3 AM, and he finally got a working PC with all the programs he needed. All was good, and I went to bed.  
The next day was a Friday, and I went home for the weekend. I packed my bags, and went to the train station. As I was on the train, I get a textmessage from Bro, claiming he can't watch videos using VLC. It gives a errormessage, but since I'm on the train without internet access, I can't help him. I apologize, tell him I'll look into it when I get back (since he could still use the computers, just VLC broke), which wasn't a problem.  I advised him to use google to find a solution, just search for the error.  
Weekend goes by, and I return to my dorm. I unpack, and hop over to Bro's room, to see if I can fix his computer. To my surprise, he had already fixed it.  
""I just used Google like you said, and found a solution. It's all working again now!""  
I was glad to see the problem resolved itself, and put it out of my mind.  
Some time went by, and I never got another computer related problem from him. I went to see him again, and to my surprise, found him cursing at his laptop. He tried to install a new driver for his graphic card, and somehow it messed up his entire installation. Before I could even say anything about what might work, he grabbed the installation CD I gave him a while back, and reinstalled Ubuntu. When done, he himself managed to install VLC, a torrent program, and everything else. He basically installed his laptop. Some errors popped up, and he immediately went to Google to search for a solution. He fixed the errors himself, with me not having to do anything.  
I was so goddamn proud. This was a guy who just a month ago, didn't even know what a terminal was. And now he was reinstalling his PC, and fixing dependency issues in Ubuntu like a pro.

PS: He used a Dutch version of Windows 7, as we both speak Dutch. Try as you might, you **cannot** find a free Dutch version of a Windows 7 recovery CD.

thndrchld,96,172,wnb49,713,"More than a few years ago, when I was just starting out and had just taken my first tech support job with a company that refurbished old, crappy computers, and sold them on a rent-to-own basis to people who couldn't afford to pay for one outright, and who's credit was too terrible to take out a loan.  Most of the time, these were the customer's first computers.  Nearly all of them ran Windows ME (ugh).

I received a call from a woman who had just rented one such computer.  She was calling because her CD drive refused to eject the disk she had put in.

Me: *redacted* support, Thndrchld speaking, how can I help?

C:  My computer won't spit out the disk I put in.

Me:  What steps have you taken?

C:  I haven't done anything.

Me:  Ok, to the bottom right of where you put in the cd, there should be a button.  Push it.

C: ...  Nothing happened.

Me:  You pushed the button?

C: yes.

Me: Ok, on your screen, double-click on 'My Computer'

C:  what's that mean?

Me:  Use your mouse.  Point at the little picture that says 'My computer', then press the left button twice in quick succession.

C:  A box popped up.

Me:  Ok, now find the picture of a CD, and click on it with the right button.

C:  Another box popped up.

Me:  Click 'Eject'

C:  HOLY CRAP, IT OPENS! (Me (thinking):  Red flag)   There's no CD in it.

Me: Ok, now, I need you to turn off your computer.  Now, unplug all of the wires and cables in the back of it.

C: All of them?

Me: Yes. All of them.

C:  (Some clattering and grunting)  Ok.  Done.

Me:  Now, pick up your computer, point the front of the computer towards the ground, and shake it.

C:  Ok!  CD came out.

One day my ""aunt"" calls me up asking if I could help her because her internet just stopped working out of no where and was wondering if she had a virus. So I tell her I would be over some time in that week.

I make the 45 minute drive to East Bumfuck and was greeted at the door. She shows me to her computer area and I take a seat.

Her: ""We get internet from our neighbors I think.""

Her: ""Oh can you fix that?""

Me: ""Well if you want you can call them and tell them that they need to move their router closer to your house so that you can steal their service... Im not going to do that for you though""

wonderweirdo,123,180,ut4q9,715,"This didn't happen to me, thankfully, but I got a little involved in it.  Started a week ago, we got a new lady working in our department, I'll call her Maria.  Maria had this look on her face when she came in, the kind you see on a dog when it's taken from an abusive home.  

After a day she was smiling like she'd won the lottery, which I thought wasn't possible in my company.  So a day or two after she starts, I get a call from another lady asking to speak to Maria.  Maria was no where in sight, so I just asked if I could help her out.  She very bluntly told me to have her call Jane ASAP, then hung up.  Being use to rude user, I didn't think much of it, so I just emailed Maria and didn't think of it after that.  A short time later, Maria came back and asked me questions about Jane, she had that abused dog look again.  I told her about the call I took, and didn't have any information beyond that.  She thanked me, and went back to her desk.  I found out yesterday that all of this came to a head.  

Turns out Jane was calling into our office demanding to speak to Maria, and on one occasion got through, where Maria told her she was going to call the police.  Maria explained that Jane was her former supervisor in her previous job, who had made their environment so hostile that people were quitting left and right.  Seems the last company Maria worked at was family owned, and Jane was part of the Family.  Jane apparently needed a job and they put her in charge of the help desk, where she was going to ""Motivate"" the techs into shape.  

She imposed crazy rules, like no talking in the break room, and a demerit system for accumulated infractions.  People decided they would be better off and just started quitting.  Those professional enough to turn in a two week notice were worked like dogs with all kinds of projects.  Maria was one of their more senior people, and found that her work load multiplied every time someone quit.  When Jane started to demand she put in long days to resolve issues, but denied all raises in their department, Maria had enough and just quit.  Then Maria came to work for us, and the less hostile environment was like a breath of fresh air.  

Apparently the loss was affecting Janes department, and she kept calling into our office trying to get Maria to take on some projects even though she'd quit.  One of my co-workers took a call from Jane, and he told me that Jane was pretty nasty, to the point of threatening to come down and find Maria herself.  She said that Marias resignation wasn't acceptable, and that our company wasn't going to be allowed to steel her employees without catching hell.  

I was told that the matter was taken up by the police, and some lawyers who apparently know about Janes ""Family"" and were happy to take care of the problem.  I've had some bad employers before, but I can't even imagine what Jane put Maria through.  I find that Maria knows her stuff, and is capable of running her own team if she wanted to, she can handle most any issue without any expense in energy.  I've seen her handle network issues like they were nothing and juggle tickets like a circus clown juggles balls.  She's confident and skilled better than most people I know.  So I wonder what Jane put her through to make her so scared every time she called.

I'd do more, but, well, ammonium triiodide is SUCH a volatile compound.

About two weeks after the doctor went live with his remote desktop scheme for EMR access and remote clinic visits - which actually went off pretty smoothly, much easier than I expected, but that was because I dropped RDP shortcuts on every user's desktop, and at which time, against my better judgment, I'd migrated their ECGs from the failing 1TB MyBook to the 1TB RAID1'd LaCie device, but they'd still had another 1TB MyBook containing archived studies from the previous year - I got another call from the practice manager, this time at 11 PM.

Before I picked up the cell, I rolled over in bed, away from my lady-friend, and double-clicked on a script on my machine, which kicked off remote diagnostics on her servers (ping, RAID check, uptime, et cetera). I picked up her call, and before I finished my greeting, I got a report that everything on the servers were good.

""Hello, MXX. I haven't gotten any pages from the autonomous monitoring systems from your office, so the UPS and switches and servers are okay, and my diagnostics just confirmed that. What's up?""

""Well, there are two things. The doctor can't get into his computer from home -""

""Is he using the shortcut I put on his laptop, or is he using his big desktop in the office?""

As an aside, I should mention that in a rare moment of altruism, I'd set up their home network on the condition that I would never be asked to support it (and yes, my documentation for it was SUPERB).

""It's his desktop, but I can't get into my computer at the office either!""

""Well, the office connection is up, if it wasn't, I'd have a page from my monitoring systems at my office. Out of curiosity, what does it say when you try to go to a web page on your computer?""

""It has an AT&amp;T logo and it says that the broadband link is not available! Did the connection at the office die? It's Time warner! Why would Time Warner have an AT&amp;T page on it?""

My eyebrow started twitching at that point.

""Remind me, MXX, what ISP do you have at home? And remember, I set you up, I KNOW what ISP you have.""

""Uh... we have AT&amp;T DSL?""

""And when multiple machines in your home are offline, doesn't that generally mean your connection at home is down?""

""Not necessarily, it could be the rest of the - ""

*If you finish that sentence with 'it's the rest of the Internet that's down' I swear to god I will hook a 240-volt Etherkiller into your shitty unmanaged 24-port 10/100 switch and blow out every damn device on your network, you vapid pennypinching bleached-blonde harpy,* I thought to myself, but apparently, the god of tits and wine looks out for children and stupid people, and she corrected herself.

""Oh, you're right! The DSL modem has a flashing red light on it. I guess I'll wait for it to come back up. The other reason I called you was that before this started, the doctor was working on a study and Windows said the drive was... inaccessible, and that the file or folder was corrupt and unreadable.""

FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU - 

What I'd been warning her for ages had finally happened! The LaCie was apparently as far gone as my patience, and it, like a drunk who'd had too much spicy food, shat the bed.

""I will be down there in the morning, MXX. Do NOT let the doctor do ANYTHING with studies until I'm there. Period. If he does, I'm not responsible for what happens. Hell, I'm not responsible for what happens anyways, since I put it in writing to you that that needs to be fixed.""

Once I arrived at the clinic, I walked over to the doctor's machine, and took a look at the LaCie. Sure enough, it resembled HAL 9000 - the light on the front was flashing red, and everything pointed to a faulty drive or RAID failure. Cursing my bad luck, I called LaCie, since it was still under warranty, and got another sent out next-business-morning as a replacement.

Since there was nothing else I could do, I went back to Austin, then came back the next day, and sure enough, the device had arrived.

""MXX, look. Seriously. You've had the MyBook fail, one of these has died. I am NOT going to deal with these things constantly. Either we get a storage server, or I will not warranty any of my work and I will put that in writing to both my boss and our insurance company.""

""Fine! I'll run it by our accountant and see if we can afford it.""

*If you can afford it? Your house is worth four million dollars! Your kids go to private schools and play bloody lacrosse with the best gear available! YOU HAVE A BLOODY ESCALADE WITH SPINNING RIMS AND YOU SOMEHOW GOT AN iPAD MOUNTED TO THE DAMN DASHBOARD! You can afford to drop four thousand on a storage server, don't tell me you can't!*

I told her that recovery from this would take all night if we're lucky, and that I wouldn't be out before midnight.

As soon as everyone left, I hooked up the good drive from the RAID array to a spare computer via an internal SATA port, and booted the box to Ubuntu. LaCie uses some arcane, obscure file system for its arrays, but Ubuntu reads it fine. 

Copying the terabyte of data to the new LaCie box took about nine hours (even SATA2 to eSATA will take a while to copy 1TB of data), and I didn't walk out of their office before 4 AM. Again, I left a note on the practice manager's desk saying that she needed to order a storage server ASAP and that the next failure would invariably be worse than that.

""Hi, Jack, it's MXX. Do you have a minute?""

""Sure, MXX, what's up? Actually, call me back on the office phone, PXXX will send you back to my desk.""

She calls back on that, and the other techs in the room crowd around me as I put her on speaker.

""So, MXX, what've you got?"" I took a bite of my Hunter's Club (sans tomato and with dijon mustard).

""Well... you remember the drive holding the studies from last year?""

I mumbled assent through a mouthful of sandwich. ""You mean the one I said we should migrate to a storage server? Yeah, why?""

""It's clicking. Is that bad?""

I barely had time to hit mute on the phone before my monitor was covered in partially masticated sandwich bits and saliva.

ProjectAzar,75,152,1e5n9m,704,"First time posting a story of mine. I've been doing customer support IT for about 3 years now. Over that time I've seen some things. 

Background: I work for a medium-large sized university help desk. I've been there a while so I get to deal with the faculty and staff. Anyone who has done university IT realizes that it is probably a miracle any of us who deal with faculty are able to function without a constant drip of alcohol feeding into our systems.

On campus, you are provided an email account while you are actively affiliated with the university, and 210 days after you are done with the university, *Poof*, no more email for you (which is an incredibly difficult concept for so very many recent graduates to understand.

Help desk on a Saturday is usually slow. A ""my password just decided not to work today"" here, and a ""My God, what did you do to my email client, I can't use it at all today and you need to fix it now"" there. But every so often you get the most dreaded of calls: a nemesis. Now, I know what you are thinking. You're thinking, ""But Azar, isn't that a bit dramatic? Can your help desk really have a nemesis?"" To which I respond, ""Of course not. A help desk does not have just one nemesis!""

Today I have done battle with the ""Uneducated Elaborator"". 

Story Time: I walk into work today and a soon-to-be-tormented colleague begins to tell me what he is dumping onto my day, as he is walking about the door.

STBTC: Azar, this guy is going to be calling in soon. Hes just trying to migrate his email off our server, we need to connect to his computer and help him with it. I tried, but he had to hang up and put more time on his calling card.

Me: ...Alright...what was the trouble?

STBTC: We couldn't figure out how to setup his other email account to move the email.

Me: Should be easy enough.

Lo and behold, but right as he is walking out the door I receive the call. Within seconds, a cold, piercing chagrin set into my bones. The Uneducated Elaborator has found my line.

Me: Thank you for calling the help desk, how may I help you.

UE: Ah yes, hello. I was speaking with your colleague, but and we were trying to setup some email to move it from one account to another but I guess my phone has blocked your number as he was supposed to call me back to work on this issue. I suppose hes just gotten so fed up with it that he can't handle it any more. You see I was...

*Five minutes later*

UE:...so can you help me get this email migrated?

Me: Sure. I actually wrote the instructions you were sent so lets see if we can get these worked out.

We have a remote connection tool that gives us control over their computer and I walk him through getting connected. I see he already has Windows Live Mail installed and running and his school email address is already added. All we need to do is add his gmail account, and move the email from one to the other.

Me: Alright sir, if you can just fill in your gmail account information we should be able to get this taken care of quickly. *Showing him where to type with his cursor*

UE: Alright where do I type now?

Me: Right here. First we need your username.

He types his username.

Me: And here we will need your password.

UE: My What?

Me: The password for your Gmail account.

UE: I never was prompted for a password. You see I've never had a gmail account before and your colleague helped set one up. He said...

*Another 5 minutes later*

UE: ...And so I've never set up a password on this account.

I assure him he must have set one up before in order to use the account, but we pull up a web browser just to see if it was automatically saved and if so we could just get his password. Easy.

The web browser was open and there was his Gmail account already logged in.

Me: Alright sir, the password we are looking for is the one you used to login here.

UE: I never logged in here. 

...I logged him out of Gmail, hoping the login screen would jar his memory.

Me: Alright sir, if you can just login to your Gmail account here, we should be able to determine what password you should use.

UE: Alright, what is my username?

Me: ...Its the name of the account we were just in. The one you said you setup just a few minutes ago.

UE: I never setup a username. I never have used Gmail before. Your colleague helped me out over the phone and I have this old email address I used before Y2K...

*An epoch passes. I see the full life cycle of entire species crawl before my deadened gaze*

UE: ...So I really just have no idea what this password could be.

I take him to the area where he can retrieve his password. To save time I start filling in some of the information for him. Then he drops the big one.

UE: ...and so I just have no idea how to get this all working. Oh, wait a minute. That says Google there. Is this a Google website?""

The entirety of Gmail is covered in Google logo's but I hold back my desire to flip the nearest table I can find.

UE: OHHH! I've got me one of those. You see I have a YouTube account...

tuxedo_jack,138,179,1bmk7i,714,"About a year and a half ago, at my immediately previous position (not the infamous orange-and-black VW-driving company of yore), it was a relatively quiet morning on an average Austin spring day (not too hot, not too cool, bright and sunny, and absolutely wonderful to be outside on).

I'd done my server checkups and monthly assessments on all of my clients (remotely, too - gotta love RDP. It's saved me from driving from Austin to Dallas and Houston a few times). I'd fired up the office's Keurig and brewed a cup of Jet Fuel, and with a grunt, I settled into my comfortable chair in the back room that the six field techs for my employer shared (small company, but REALLY elite - and in a lot of cases, pretty damn awesome - clientele, and the techs sometimes made me look like an idiot by comparison).

I kicked off my usual morning things - Firefox, AIM via Pidgin (we used it for interoffice communication), Outlook - and settled in for a long day of fielding tickets from my clients, planning for server upgrades for others, and cursing and swearing at the absolute ass who decided to get infected with a rather nasty rootkit at a client in Houston (I could fix it remotely with the Windows PE flash drive I left there, but STILL!).

About an hour into my arduous labors (browsing Facebook, playing turret defense), I got an IM from the chief network administrator / chief engineer of the company, who sat a few chairs down from me normally, but was in San Antonio that day.

Chief Admin 
&gt;Hey, are you free this afternoon?

Me
&gt;Sure, what's up?

Chief Admin
&gt;I need you to go to HERPDERP Surgery Center and block Java updates from running by any means necessary. Their EMR depends on the specific version that's installed and if the updater runs, they're screwed.

Me
&gt;Got it. Anything else you want?

Chief Admin
&gt;A six pack of Shiner needs to be in the fridge on Friday afternoon. Get on that.

I called the practice manager (who, funny enough, I work with in my current job, since she heads up about 100 non-hospital clinics for my employer), and she told me to come over after lunch that day and she'd make sure everyone was available. The CNA had given me a list of asset tags for the laptops there, but I couldn't do it remotely because I didn't know if the laptops were on and in use at the time, and who trusts users to get it right?

After a filling lunch at Whataburger, I arrived at the surgery center, parked, and found the PM. She gave me her master key to let me into everywhere, and off I went. It took about two hours or so to do the laptops and desktops in the non-sterile areas (recovery, pre-surgery prep, intake, et cetera). I'd ended up both setting the update frequency to never and deleting jucheck.exe to make COMPLETELY certain that it could never update. Better safe than sorry.

Eventually, the only machines that were left were in the sterile areas (operating rooms). They had a spare bunny suit for me, along with a cap and booties, so I scrubbed up (and sinks that are operated with foot pedals are AWESOME, by the way) and stepped over the red tape into the sterile area.

I started working my way down the line of operating rooms, updating their machines, as well as the ones in the doctors' dictation area and at the nurse's station, and eventually there was only one room left. This one was a live operating room, and they were performing surgery in it while I was working. I knew I had to wait until I was done, but curiosity compelled me to look through the window on the door just to see if I could get an idea of where they were in the procedure.

In retrospect, I REALLY wish I'd looked at the daily schedule on the door BEFORE looking through the door's window. Alternatively, I wish the room's designers had put the blood-gas and anesthetic equipment on the side of the room near the door, because that would have meant the table would have been facing the other way, and I would have been spared.

There's NOTHING quite like - on a full stomach, mind you - seeing a morbidly obese man's legs spread on the operating table as a doctor has his scrotum (which resembled something like a blood-covered pair of walnuts) CUT OPEN FOR A VASECTOMY.

NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE^NOPE

Fortunately, I gulped down the nausea and waited until they were done, then got my work done and got the hell out of there. When I got back to the office, I got back on AIM and loaded up eye bleach.

Chief Admin
&gt;So, how'd it go?

At the time of this **tale** I was just a scrub, a lowly IT trainee working under my boss.
I work for a local council, first proper job, absolutely great environment, but of course that means that people lacking in skill seem to be able to stick around much longer than they ever should.
She was a great and powerful ICT Professional of 8 years in the industry! Or so I thought...

**The first of many head-desk moments**
It was just another day working in a local council office, network falling to pieces around our heads, me trying to make sure the users don't notice it too much.
My boss of course, caught up in whatever land she lives in (*really must be a magical place*) decided that I should learn how to make installation documentation.
Giving up hope of ever being able to fight back the every expanding queue of servicedesk tickets, I push off from my desk and wheelie my way over to her side.

 

Her: ""Ok, so we need some documentation on how to setup xxxxx software"" she says slowly as if waking up from her dream state

Me: ""Sure, do you want screenshots throughout the process or just a list of all the settings that you need to apply?"" I reply, thinking up things to be helpful

Her: ""Well we can't do screenshots for all of the installation, which I would really like, because it takes us into a 'full screen' mode that you can't click out of. So we'll just have to do dotpoints on my pad until we can type in on the computer after""


*This statement completely confuses me, I can't imagine any sort of install that you can't switch out of mid-way through. But of course, I am a lowly IT pleb, so I just assume she has greater knowledge of this.*

Her: ""Let's start then"" She says, double clicking on the exe

*The wizard fires up and we're taken into quite a standard full screen installation window*

Me: ""Ok, so if we take a screenshot of this and then paste it into word, can't we just then just resume and repeat?"" I respond, still dazed and confused about where the issue lies.

Her: ""But how are you going to get out of this program? There is no minimize button and you can't see the taskbar!"" Boss retorts with a smug look

*reaches over to the keyboard and presses 'Alt+Tab'*

Her:""How did you do that? What did you press??"" Utter amazement in her voice as she stares once again at the desktop

Me: ""Umm, alt-tab"" I mumble shyly, as she quickly pastes the image into a fresh word document, of course making special care to click 'File &gt; Save' before clicking back to the install

Her: ""Hmm, ok, let me try that"" She says focusing hard after taking the next screenshot to make sure that she presses exactly the right key combo

Her: ""Wow! Thankyou so much! That will make things so much easier for me! I think I'd heard about people doing this before, but I'd never been bothered to learn what they were pressing!""

axis_0,178,127,1g106t,705,"I've been a long time reader of r/talesfromtechsupport, but never really got around to posting anything. I work in my school's Technology center, as part of the on-campus job program. Each student on campus is issued an HP Elitebook 2740p, complete with rotating screen that supports 'pen' input. If anyone has ever seen one of these things, the screen is mounted to the laptop with a *single* hinge, which rotates 180 degrees. A student came in a few days ago, holding the mutilated remains of what looked like the base of one of these HPs. 


Axis_0: ""Hello, welcome to the Tech Center. What exactly are you holding?""


Student: ""Oh, yeah, hi, this is my HP.""
*silence*

Axis_0: ""So... what exactly.. happened?

(There is no evidence that a screen ever *existed* on this laptop)

Student: ""Oh, well, it uh, fell off my bunk bed""

Axis_0: ""It *fell*?

Student: ""Yeah, it did""

Axis_0: ""So, where is the **other** half of the computer?""

Student: ""Oh, I, Uh, threw it out.""

Axis_0: ""Well, it would be helpful to have the screen. Is there a chance you can get it?""

Student: ""Uh, yeah I'll go look""



After the student leaves to go look for his discarded screen, another technician comes over to the counter and explains that they saw Student pick up his computer by the base and smash the screen over a stone wall the previous night. After several minutes of trying to comprehend his reasoning, I sent the technician to go gather the parts that remained at the wall. He returned before Student, bringing with him a plastic bag of shattered plastic and wires. At that moment, Student walked back in.


Student: ""So, I, uh, couldn't find it.""

Axis_0: ""Someone took the trash out?""

Student: ""Yeah, that must have been it""

(He notices the remnants of his laptop screen spread across the counter)

Axis_0: ""So, I have a technician who claims to have seen you smashing your laptop over a stone wall""

Student: (*nervously*) ""That, uh, wasn't me.""
...
""Well, maybe it was.""

Axis_0 ""Well, that aside, because the damage to your machine was *not* accidental, you will need to pay for the screen replacement yourself""

Student: ""What? Why?""

Axis_0: ""Because you smashed your screen, and the laptop isn't *technically* yours, you have to pay for the repair.""

Student: ""**WHAT?** I'm not payin' for this!""

(Picks up half laptop, walks away)



A few days later, Student's half-laptop showed up again, this time because he needed some Word docs from its HD. We took it, replaced the screen, and happily billed him. We later heard that he badmouthed us for not fixing his machine for free. 

**TL**;**DR**, Student decides to be an idiot, ends up with word docs and a bill, complains about the consequences of his acts.

**Day 1:**  
About 16:55 one evening, I was about ready to go home and I got a knock on my door:

&gt;*Student*: ""That row of computers suddenly turned off.""  
*SP*: ""Alright, let's take a look. Not really my department, but... okay, I assume the circuit breaker must have come on. I'll have to get someone to take a look in the morning, just use some of the other PCs.""  
*Student*: ""Oh okay. It just happened when I plugged my laptop in.""

I fired off an email to the IT tech, who said that that row was quite bad for tripping the circuit breaker, so not to worry, he'd sort it out in the morning.

**Day 2:**  
All I had left to do was some admin work during the last hour of my day, until I hear a familiar voice at my door:

&gt;*Student*: ""Hi, I was wondering whether you could take a look at my laptop? It's not charging.""  
*SP*: ""Again, I don't really deal with computers any more, let alone personal ones, but... I guess I can look and see if it's anything obvious?""  

The student then takes out his power supply, and just slides the outer casing straight off (**alarm bells immediately ringing**) and points at several smouldered components.  

&gt;*Student*: ""Could you maybe fix this? It's been weird for a while.""  
*SP*: ""Uhh... no. Tell you what, here's the address of a repair place nearby. Just get a new power supply, it's a fairly standard one you've got.""

Friday has finally arrived. I have my coffee nice and warm, but the mug doesn't even make it halfway to my lips when my door opens:

&gt;*Student*: ""Uhh.. do you have a 3-pin plug adaptor I could borrow?""  
*SP*: ""I doubt it, sorry. How did you manage to get a European plug instead of a UK one?""  
*Student*: ""It's not a European one, it's the cable from my old adaptor. I mean... you know how there are three pins?""  
*SP*: ""Yes...?""

**CHAPTER 2**  
*""Declare the pennies on your eyes...""*  
   
It was with some trepidation that I touched down in the new city. Particularly as it was about the size of what Australians tend to call a large country town, and stuck out in a sheep paddock at the arse-end of nowhere. It was also fucking *arctic.* The place I'd spent nearly my whole life in before this was famous for things like an entire month of temperatures over 100F. If any part of it actually got below freezing, ever, it made the news. This place had a summer like I remembered winter, and a winter like nothing on earth.  

Welcome to the frozen heart of the federal public service.  

So I got a taxi, and told it to take me to the rental agent for the address I'd been given - a temporary apartment used for visiting businesspeople. (Paid for, fortunately, by my new employer, as rents in that town would have made even Sir Edmund Hilary think twice about tackling them.) Signing paperwork and retrieving keys, I made it back to my new home base at around 10am - unslept, unshaven, unwashed, wearing that wonderfully formal Australian leisurewear referred to as tracky-dacks, and with about five remaining IQ points.  

I decided, after some contemplation, that before I sacked out for the remainder of the day I would make absolutely sure that I knew where the hell my new workplace actually was, given that I only had a street address. Fortunately, some perusal of a map, and ignoring the hammering in my head, I figured it was not all that far away at all - just on the other side of the park across the street. In fact, it was so close that I could probably go and have a quick peek at it to find out where the front door was, given that I was supposed to be starting work there, y'know, *the very next morning.*  

 

This in mind, I wanted to be prepared. So wild of eye, and in sweaty tracksuit, flip-flops, and stubble, I stumbled through the park doing an impromptu impression of either a one-man zombie uprising or the local inebriate three sheets to the wind. The paths twisted and turned (probably a little more than normal, given my lack of sleep), but I eventually found my way to the far end and was faced with a giant set of buildings, all apparently blithely unencumbered with any such thing as street numbering.  

Much lurching up and down the street later, I became moderately sure that the lot I wanted was the one nestled into a city block corner (the park making up the other three sides). However, it had several actual buildings rising from it, connected in various ways at their upper levels. Which one would I need to enter upon the morrow?  

It was thus that a weaving, red-eyed shambling wreck of a technician, clad in the finest Walmartwear, could be seen staggering suspiciously around the base of several federal buildings, peering blearily into each doorway, when all of a sudden I rounded a corner and came face to face with someone in standard office clothing, obviously taking a smoke break outside one of the emergency fire doors, away from the keen wind. The bloke in question was grimacing, puffing, and balding, in approximately that order, and he'd seen me - it was too late to avoid conversation, and I just hoped I could muster something more intellectual than ""BLARG!""  

I introduced myself, if only to avoid being seized and charged with impersonating a hobo, and for want of two brain cells to bang together and a topic of conversation, admitted that I was starting work in that very building tomorrow morning, and would be most obliged to have the front doors pointed out to me. This earned me a slow, evaluating look up and down, and the smoker pointed towards the base of the next building over.  

 

And that was how I met my new boss.

I work helpdesk in a hospital and I have 2 stories from tonight:

Number 1:
A nurse called asking me to unlock her account in the Active Directory. Easy problem/Easy solution right? Well I go to look her up and there's no one with her name listed. So I ask if she's a new employee, and she says no and that she's never had a problem logging in before. So we go back and forth for about 20 minutes while I try to figure out where her account went. 

After I have exhausted every possible idea she says ""oh wait, maybe its under my other last name""

I said ""you have 2 last names?""

She responded with, ""Well technically no, but I use my boyfriend's last name and I've never had a problem before""

I didn't know what to say to that, but once I had her actual last name unlocking the account was easy.


Number 2:
A different nurse called asking why her account for our core system was locked, because it wasn't locked on Tuesday(She's an agency nurse, which means she doesn't work here a lot). I ask for her user name, and she responds with a generic name for agency workers that I can do nothing with so I tell her it will just be a minute while I look her up. She says ok. Now, I always have my calls on speaker phone because I'm the only one in the office and that way I have both hands free to do things, but I swear to God I never expected to hear what she said next while on a call.

She said to someone else, ""I'll be right back, I have to use the bathroom.""

At first I thought I misheard her, but then I heard the bathroom door swing open and shut, the stall door shut and lock and then a loud grunting sound as she sat down. All while I'm on the other end of the phone, trying to fix a problem for her.

She proceeded to take one of the loudest, most ungodly shits I have ever heard.

I tried to stay professional during this, but once she started grunting her replies at me trying to force the devilchild that was her dinner out of her, I just didn't know what to say.

She finished, I got her the right username, and ended the call. And then I cried for my innocence that was destroyed by a woman who needs to lay off the spicy food for dinner.","Nurse doesn't know her name, and another doesn't know proper work place etiquette. ",897
DoScienceToIt,113,134,1bvrcw,697,"Part of my job is to assess computers and get a ""first look"" idea of what sort of issues they may be having, in order to streamline troubleshooting on the bench.  This usually means plugging them in, watching them boot to the OS, the usual song and dance.   
For anyone who supports laptops, you know that a very common issue is a power on problem related to some sort of power safe mode. This usually happens if the computer experiences a minor power variation, or is unplugged or plugged in improperly.  You pop the battery out, hold the power button down for a few seconds to evacuate any residual charge, then the machine boots up just fine.   
So a customer comes in with his laptop, says that it gets no power at all.  It's a Lenovo, something like a T400 or similar model. So I *know* it's not a power jack issue, and his power cord looks new.  So I am pretty much sure that his computer's just in power safe mode.  I pop the battery, cycle the power, muck with it a little bit, all the while looking concerned.  
Then I set his laptop on the counter, (remember that as far as he is concerned, his computer is as dead as Jimmy Hoffa) raise one hand in the air, place the other one on the keyboard, and yell in (I would like to think) an excellent impersonation of a southern baptist televangelist faith healer: ""AH CA*MAND* YEW TO BE *HEEALED*""

My blood turns cold as I realise my mum is attempting to purchase a laptop, and the poor women has very little if any technical knowledge.
Immediately I pick up the phone and ring her, asking what she's trying to buy. She quotes me some ridiculous machine with 8GB of RAM, 4.4ghz of CPU, 1TB HDD, etc etc (I teased this out by asking what numbers were next to each section on the specs)  I explain slowly that she needs far less than this, and to just find something with 2GB of RAM and about 250gb of harddrive space.

About 15 minutes later I get a text with a laptop model spec, a quick look online shows a gaming laptop - 6GB of RAM, modernish Radeon gfx card, etc etc.

I ring again asking where she got this from, she tells me the man at the shop says students need something like this if it's just for typing word documents and using skype. I curse under my breath realising that instead of looking online she's in PC World getting royally shafted by some greedy sales assistant.

I've since told her to quit the store and I'll come over tonight to help her buy one online. I can only hope she takes my advice on this.l

M4ltodextrin,119,147,11b3hp,693,"The actual incident occurred several months ago, but a little background, I support a VoIP system. Voicemails are sent to user's e-mails, so just about any issue with e-mail crops up as ""My voicemail isn't working."" Which is fun because our team has no direct control over the exchange servers.

A few months prior to this incident, we had a couple of incidents where a person had acciendtally included the ""send this to everybody"" address in their e-mail. And of course, there would be the bevvy of people who'd hit reply all back, which, considering that these e-mails were going to 40,000 people, is something to be expected.

Of course, after two incidents occurred within about two weeks of another, the ""send this to everybody"" address was removed from common usage. End of problem, right? Oh how wrong we were.

Shortly after arriving in work one morning, I notice an E-mail show up in both my personal inbox, and my support inbox. Opening it up, I see the sender has sent it on behalf of another employee, who had a legitimate opportunity at a million dollar prize, and an appearance on a TV show. Then, I noticed the ""To"" line. The sender had sent it to everyone. Everyone. [Everyone.](http://youtu.be/MrTsuvykUZk?t=7s)

All 40,000+ e-mails, all group inboxes, all public mailing lists, ALL of them were in the ""To"" line, bringing the size of the e-mail up to a whopping 10 megs. She had gone and inserted ever. single. one.

And then people started hitting ""reply all...""

From ""I don't think I was supposed to get this,"" to ""Please remove me from this list,"" To long winded rants about appropriate use of the e-mail system, to ""For the love of god, everyone stop hitting 'reply all'!""

I'm not sure about the long term consequences. Short term, the exchange servers shat themselves. The struggled valiantly from about 9:30, when the first ""reply alls"" started going out, until mid-afternoon, when finally, they gave up. As a result, e-mails voicemails were showing up hours after they had been left, if at all, causing a deluge of calls to our helpdesk, which we could do squat about. The exchange team got drunk and cried, and the perpetrator lost their network access, which they didn't need to do their job anyway.

A person walked in to the shop today, and announced to everyone inside ""MY C'MPUTER IS SLOW!"" I walked out from the back room and asked him if I could take a look inside. He replied ""Sure, as long as you d'n't (yes, he just abbreviated an abbreviation) f*ck anythin' up."" He then proceeded to drop his XP machine on the front counter. I flinched.

I open the case, and what do I find? The biggest dust farm I've ever seen. We do a trade in service where you sell us your old PC and we do a free data transfer, and I've seen some dirty cases, but none as awful as this. I am not kidding when I say it looked like that dust bunnies became a commodity, and they wanted to cash in. That really says a lot about how slow it is. I personally doubt it was touched in the past 10 years.

I grab a can of compressed air (since the air compressor we have was being used for quarterly maintenance at a local medical office) and sprayed down the memory sticks. If I had allergies to dust, I would be dead by now. The air became clogged with dust that had not been disturbed for god knows how long.

After the dust settled (and I could breath without being 15 ft away from it), I looked at the memory, and guess what I found? Inside the case, there was a grand total of 64 MB of RAM, the absolute minimum for Windows XP to run. I'm surprised the machine was even usable with that kind of power.

He must have left while I was spraying down the case with compressed air, as I do not remember seeing him leave. When he returned, I informed him that the reason his machine was so slow was because it had only 64 MB of RAM. He then proceeded to ask me how much it was. He said that he could indeed pay for it.

He then asked how long it would take to arrive. When I told him it could be up to a week, he yelled ""I NEED MORE MEM'RY AND I NEED IT NOW!"" I told him it could get it to him faster if he wanted to pay more money for shipping, but he said again ""I NEED MORE MEM'RY AND I NEED IT NOW!"" I asked him why he was in such a rush, and he said ""THIS IS THE COMPUTER I USE FOR WORK! IT NEEDS TO BE READY TODAY!"" Meanwhile, the other techs were trying their hardest not to laugh their asses off at the stupidity of it all and anger him further.

I asked him what this computer was running that was so important. He replied ""Photoshop."" I wanted to facepalm so bad. I asked him how he even got it to run on the machine, to which he replied ""I didn't-it w'n't load!"" (More abbreviating of abbreviations.) I informed him that his Pentium II wouldn't cut the mustard for Photoshop, regardless of how much RAM he threw in there (I later found out it could only support 128 MB anyway).

He then said ""IF U AIN'T GONNA FIX IT, I'LL FIND S'MEONE WHO WILL!"", took his computer, and stormed out of the shop. He should have at least paid for the compressed air I used.

Now read on...

   
  
   
Well, we're getting towards the end of my time at this job - but this isn't the last post about it. That comes later.

**This** post is about a stunt I pulled to achieve multiple things simultaneously for minimum effort.  

---

See, I'd gotten pretty much my fill of metaphorically kicking the office manager in the neck, and had figured it was time I should be moving on. But first, there were a couple of things yet to do on my list. These included:

* Scoring some credentials for my CV and to wave around, to make the inevitable transition to another job easier and more fun; and  
* Having a chat to the CEO in person, because I like doing that when I'm on the bottom of the ladder; and  
* Monumentally pissing off the office manager one last time, in such a way that he couldn't do a damn thing about it.  

   
  
   
So I used my free hours to sit back and consider how to achieve all of this together. And after a while, the answer came to me. I went to my section manager (the nice one), noted that I had a lot of vacation time coming to me, and asked for a week off. Given that this would decrease the amount of drama occurring when the office manager (her boss) was in my vicinity, she readily agreed. And I went back to my desk and made a couple of long-distance calls, then booked a flight.

On the day before my vacation, I called up the list of all the innovations and ideas that staff had submitted to HQ over the preceding months. Then I spent some time with an office printer and some thin cardboard, and walked the results out to my car during the lunch break. I was ready.

   
  
   
The weekend saw me on a red-eye flight out of the city, and headed for the nation's capital. There was a friend there who was willing to cover accommodation, and I didn't need more than a sleeping bag in a spare room - apart from a standard business suit, all my props fit into a single clipboard, and everything else was in my head.  

Monday, I started. You see, the names of the controlling Board - the CxO people - were available on the office intranet. As were those of their secretaries. And there was a corporate phone book where you could look up extensions all across the country. And it seemed that an awful lot of the CxOs's secretaries had received phone calls a week or two ago, asking politely for ten minutes on the relevant Board member's schedule, if they would be so kind.  

This included the CEO.  

So I spent Monday through Wednesday happily chatting with the Ultra-Bosses about this and that, having prepared some conversational topics relevant to their area and using it as an excuse to bring them up to speed on my home state, which was the furthest away from HQ and pretty much never ever got visited. I was the courier from the far frontier, and happy to play up the angle that people at home would love to hear all about anything coming down the pipeline. Thusly, I gave myself a crash course in talking to CxOs and picking up relevant HQ-specific jargon, phrases, and mindsets.  

Then came Thursday.

   
  
   
Thursday, I met the head of the Innovation and Ideas program. As I suspected, she'd never actually talked to any of the staff who had submitted anything. After all, they were out in the public-contact offices and state offices, not in the National office.  

Well, I told her, I have an Innovative Idea. Why not make a little award, like a certificate, for the person who submitted the most ideas in a year? It'd give the program a little publicity, a little boost, a little legitimacy. It might even encourage more submissions, which had been tailing off.  

Why yes, she thought, this would be an excellent idea!  

Great, I said. Because according to the data of the first year of the program, the person who submitted the most ideas in the entire country is... me. And as fate (and an office printer which took thin cardboard) would have it, I coincidentally have here with me a fully designed and printed certificate stating so, needing only your signature. Of course, I'd be more than happy to provide details and assist the I&amp;I program with any writeups it wanted!  

She signed it. Stage One: Complete.

   
  
   
Friday was the big one. Friday, I met with the CEO. I'd managed to get onto her calendar purely because she was new, she had been appointed from outside the Service, she was interested in shaking things up, and she'd never before had a bottom-rung employee ask to talk to her directly about something other than a complaint. This made me oddly intriguing, and I got my ten minutes.  

I spent the time rabbiting about a half-assed idea for rewarding employees who generated cost savings with either a percentage in cash or access to things like spare executive furniture and better coffee makers for the office. I didn't expect it to go anywhere (although if it had, I would have milked that sucker like a dairy cow), and was fine with having her shoot it so full of holes it could have auditioned for the Miss Swiss Cheese swimsuit competition. It was all smokescreen, anyway. My real reason for being there was to be seen as a really nice guy. A solid, reliable, dependable employee who really liked the organisation, and was enthusiastic about the direction the CEO was taking it in. Because as we finished up, she walked me out past her secretary, and at that moment I asked if I could get a photo of us together. With this camera I just happened to have brought along with me.  

There was a loooooong pause. I grinned brainlessly at the secretary, who gave her boss a look which said *Aw, give the kid a break and something to show his friends.* And ten seconds later, I had a photo of me and the CEO, standing in the CEO's chambers in the heart of central HQ. Stage Two: Complete.

I flew home, with my certificate (which I'd laminated, after photocopying it and its signature a couple dozen times onto other thin pieces of cardboard) and my photo. I spent the weekend having the photo blown up to A4 size and framed. Monday, I took it to work.

   
  
   
Now, what I hadn't mentioned to this point was that the desk I had been given was about fifteen feet away from the office manager's little glassed-in mini-office. He could see me and everything on my desk every time he walked out his door.  

I put that photo of me and the CEO up exactly where his eye would fall whenever he looked my way. And I made sure that everyone in my section (and thus via gossip, everyone in the office) saw both that photo and the ""official certificate of excellence signed by the I.I. board member"" where it was pinned up in pride of place. EVERYONE knew where I'd been, and who I'd talked to, and it looked a lot like the Very Top Brass had taken something of a personal shine to me. Stage Three: COMPLETE.

Soon after, the office manager took his first vacation in over a decade. And I launched my final and most Machiavellian plan of my time working in that place.  

...and *that* is going to be my very last story - at this office, anyway. It would be eight years before I returned to the city.

   
  
   
But that, and everything that came after, is a story for another time.

##\#004 Now With 50% More Fiber

It was the middle of a busy week, and things had been quiet for a while. I was working with the companies sole iMac, which was so crucial to the final step before production that it bypassed most of the physical network for the most direct route to the Internet. It came as a great surprise when coworkers started coming to me and asking if the network was down.

I turned back to my Windows workstation and ran a few quick tests. Sure enough, the network was down and, since the iMac still had connectivity, I knew it was on our end. I took a closer look at the network to find a source of the problem, but I already had my suspicions. Pete fucked something up. As far as I could tell, his $20,000 rack-mounted workstation was trying to rout traffic.    
I made my way to Pete's office hoping to figure out why he was, once again, bringing the business to a screeching halt.

As soon as I stepped through the doorway, Pete greeted me with a smile and said ""I was just about to come looking for you, I can't get on the network.""    
I quickly explained my troubleshooting, how I knew the issue was internal, that his computer was producing unusual traffic, and that the iMac could still access the Internet.

""It must be that damned iMac,"" Pete concluded. ""They always cause problems. Have you called ABC Communications?"" (ABC is a small service provider a few towns over.)    
""Why would I call ABC?"" I asked.    
""That's where we get our fiber from.""    
""ABC doesn't have fiber lines here; Verizon is our only option.""    
Pete gave me a half-witted grin. ""They ran it just for us. I asked them to do it.""

The nearest ABC Communications infrastructure was more than fifty miles away, Verizon had exclusive rights to fiber in our town, and Pete wanted me to believe ABC strung out more than fifty miles of fiber-optic cable — just for us. To this day I can't decide if he was truly that stupid or if he is the world's most amazing troll.    
I went to the server room and unplugged the network drops to his office from the switch. With the rest of the office back in action, it took me the rest of the day to get Pete to admit he had been monkeying about with settings he didn't understand and to figure out how to fix the problem on an operating system I wasn't familiar with.",The Adventures of Pete #004 Now With 50% More Fiber,859

mikeash,102,128,14ulhl,687,"I was a programmer for my previous job, working for a small software company. We were small enough that when users had problems that the first line of support (one dedicated support guy with help from the CEO) couldn't solve, they'd pass the customer on to whatever programmer best knew the problem area and we'd try to work it out from there.

We sold an app that streamed music over a LAN from your computer to a set of remote speakers. I had done a lot of work on the networking for this app, so when a user came in with a bizarre problem the support guys couldn't handle, he got passed to me.

The problem was that the user's stream would disconnect after a few minutes. But, and here was the kicker, only when playing rock and roll. Classical music would stream consistently with no trouble. Yes, seriously.

I'll omit the roughly one month of highly confused e-mail conversation that ensued between the user and me. The user was extremely nice and helpful, everything you'd want from somebody while doing tech support, he just had a *really weird* problem.

After getting lots of diagnostics and even adding some more to the app just for this guy, I *finally* figured it out. First, some background on how the app worked. This gets technical and I'm not sure just what level of audience we have here, so I'll try to explain things, and my apologies if I'm being too obvious:

The app streamed music by breaking it up into small (fractions of a second) chunks, compressing those chunks with a lossless audio codec, then sending them to the remote speakers over UDP. For those who don't know, UDP is a kind of ""fire and forget"" protocol where you send one packet of data at a time and then it may eventually be received by the other end. There's no attempt to verify delivery or throttle the rate at which data is sent or anything like that. You, the programmer, are responsible for checking for packet loss, retransmitting as necessary, etc.

The app worked with both IPv4 and IPv6. In our experience, LAN communications were generally more reliable with IPv6, so the app preferred that whenever possible. Yes, this is relevant.

All network interfaces have an MTU, a maximum transmissible unit. This is the size of the largest packet that can be sent over that network segment. To send data larger than this, it has to be broken up into sufficiently small pieces. TCP connections (the common kind, the ones that web sites use) send a stream of data, so when they hit the MTU limit they can just break their data into smaller chunks and retry. UDP has no such facilities, but the lowest-level IP layer will automatically fragment UDP packets that are too large, and reassemble them on the other end.

Finally, Mac OS X (this was a Mac app) refused to perform fragmentation on network interfaces with an MTU set to less than 1280 bytes. The IPv6 spec sets a cutoff there, although I'm not sure if OS X interpreted it correctly. In any case, that's how it worked.

I finally discovered that this user had somehow set an MTU of 1200 bytes on his network interface. Neither of us knew how or why, but that's how it was set. (1500 bytes is typical.) This is under the 1280-byte cutoff, and thus the problem. Most of our audio packets were under 1200 bytes and passed fine. But since lossless compression results in variable sized packets depending on how a particular chunk of audio compresses, there were occasionally packets that exceeded 1200 bytes. Instead of fragmenting them, the OS returned an error to the app. Upon seeing the error, the app terminated the stream.

So why did classical work while rock and roll triggered the error? Well, it turns out that classical music compresses better. I guess rock is noisier or something like that, and is harder to compress. So while classical (at least this user's classical) always produced packets under the 1200-byte limit, rock music had occasional bits that didn't compress well enough to fit, and it disconnected.

The user didn't need his 1200-byte MTU, so I had him put it back to the standard 1500 and the problem was solved. Craziest problem I ever had to debug, though.

lawtechie,45,135,1qts9b,679,"My first tech support gig was at an advertising agency. Mad Men it was not. 

For some reason, the office park had unreliable power- we'd have 1-5 minute shutdowns at least weekly. Ironically, we were less than a mile from the headquarters for the regional power company. 

So, to fix our intermittent power problems, we put an UPS in every cubicle. The artists got these serious 50 lb systems since they had 20"" CRTs. 

Regular users had some APC brick about the size of a shoe-box. 

One of my end-users, a female account executive sends in a ticket:

AE: Every time I have a presentation due, my PC shuts down randomly. Can someone please fix my broken PC?

So I look at her machine. Nothing's _obviously_ wrong with the PC or the UPS. I open her presentation on my PC. It's not corrupt or infected. No infections on her PC. 

All the cables under her desk are tight and velcro-tied, so there's no way she's inadvertently yanking power. 

Since we were slow with replacing batteries in the UPS, I suspect a weak battery. I swap out her UPS and close the ticket.

A week later, another ticket from AE.

AE: Please, please fix my PC! I had another presentation due today and it just powered off!



So I run up. Her manager and my manager are trying to figure out how incompetent, lazy and stupid I am. 
I absolutely can't replicate the problem. She's convinced her PC senses that she's got last minute work to do and it hates her. Her PC only shuts down when she's got a presentation on that day. I'm stumped but swap out _everything_- her PC, monitor, keyboard and UPS and make a note of it on the ticket. I'll check back with her daily.

Two days later, she calls me. It's done it again. I tell her not to do anything and I'll be right up.

She's furious. I can't let this one go, so I ask her to go back to what she was doing. 

I finally figure it out and start laughing. 

I ask her if she only wears high heels on presentation days. She does. 

I point out that she uses the UPS as a foot rest. When she's barefoot or wearing flats, the plastic ridges on the side of the on/off rocker switch on the UPS prevent the switch from being hit. 

When she's wearing heels, the heel is narrower than the switch and protectors, allowing her to hit the off switch long enough to power down the system. The spring tension in the switch moves it back into ON position by the time anyone comes back to investigate.

She starts laughing herself. I make a cardboard cover for the switch and she goes back to work.

oxmancometh,145,163,wmgnp,681,"I work at a community college.  The current student email system uses first initial, last initial and mmdd of the user's birthday.  It never fails, the beginning of every semester there are students lined up at the door because 1) they forgot their password between semester or 2) the new students don't read the first time login instructions that are written in huge red letters at the email login screen.  *that's another story for another time*

One day a student walks into the IT office stating she can't log into her email account.  I told her that I'd be glad to help her and asked if she forgot her password or is it another issue.  

""I don't know"" she said.  I paused and waited for some other words to be said but there were none.

""Ok.  Well, why don't you walk with me to the kiosk and let's see if we can narrow down the problem"" I said and she was in agreement.

At the kiosk, she typed in her username and attempted a password.  Of course, ""Incorrect Password"" appeared after the failed login.  

""I can fix that for ya.  Just follow me back to the office and I'll give you a temp password and you should be good to go""  I told her.

I looked up her username and reset her password to 123456.  I informed her of the password and told her if she had any more problems to feel free to come back.  

About 3 minutes later she comes back to the door and says ""Sir, it's still not letting me in.  The password you gave me is wrong.""  I apologized and and just assumed I mistyped the password.  So this time I was careful in my typing and again assigned 123456 and sent her on her way.  It wasn't 2 minutes and she came back saying the password was incorrect.  I though that maybe my keyboard was acting up so I opened notepad and typed 123456 and it worked fine.  So I asked her what was she typing in for her password and she said 123456.  Out of curiosity I asked what she was using for the username.  She said ""nothing"".  

""So you're leaving the username blank?"" I asked She nodded yes.  So I informed her that she needed to type in a username every time she logs in or else the system wouldn't know who she is.  

""You mean your system is so dumb that I have to tell it every time that I'm me?!  If that's the case, every time I call my family, I should tell them who I am because the sound of my voice isn't enough""

Between the curse words that floated around in my head was the long lecture about identification and authentication methods used in technology but yet somehow I was able to say ""Yes ma'am.  This system was all we could get on state funding""

rootedchrome,313,202,1otleu,676,"Hello everyone. Long time reader, first time poster like everyone. I host Minecraft servers. That brings a lot of &lt;12 year old clients. I have 2 stories from the same client. These are actual ticket responses. Let me know what you think and I may post more:

Story 1:
(Backstory, we gave him a 1GB upgrade to test out because he was complaing of lag. I sent him a reply saying the trial was over. This ensued after)

&gt;rootedchrome: I have hope you enjoyed your trial of 6GB. Did you notice an improvement? Would you like me to send an invoice over to you for the upgrade? The cost for the rest of this billing period would be $5.16

&gt;Client: Hello i wanted to know if i can upgrade my server today for 6GB but can i cancel it like in the last day? like downgrade back to 5GB then the next day can i upgrade back for 5$ agian idk i just feel i dont waste that much money like this but is it the same thing?

&gt;rootedchrome: The $5.16 is the prorated cost. It is found by taken the price of the 6GB and subtracting the price you already paid for the 5GB. You then take that number and divide it by how many days are left in your cycle. It will be a lot more than $5.16 the first day of your cycle since you are 10 days in now. 

&gt;Client: so how much will it be? if i keep doing that can u give me a exmiple

&gt;rootedchrome: On the first day of your cycle, it will be $8. Subtract 25 cents as the days go on. 

&gt;Client: i did 8 Subtract 25 im going into negative number like -17 the frist try i did it

&gt;rootedchrome (facepalming at this point): I said 25 cents, which would be .25 in a calculator.... 


He hasn't responded to that yet. 

Story 2:
(This is a little Minecraft related. If you don't understand how Minecraft works you won't find this funny. I didn't answer this, one of my chat reps did. We'll call him CR.)

&gt;Client: hello when i do /lag it shows World World 23,233 chunks
&gt;Client: why does it show that much
&gt;Client: this enver happens

&gt;CR: Thats the chunks the world has loaded

Me: our technicians are extremely careful and we document everything with pictures which I can send to you. Do you keep it in a case?

CX: No, but I keep it in my bra at all times. How could it get wet?

Me: Well... uhhh... Body moisture is a common thing, especially in the summer.

Vortilex,125,138,1ixwup,676,"My friend worked for an electronics store in Central Florida for a few years before he moved to town. During that time, he had some rather...interesting customers. Since the place he lived was home to a large retirement community, he often had a lot of older customers.

One of these customers was a lady that seemed to be relatively fresh into retirement, but not young enough to be the most tech-savvy of individuals. She calls in one day saying, ""My computer's shutting off and I don't know why."" After a drawn-out conversation, my friend says, ""Ma'am, your computer is overheating. Bring it in tomorrow, and I'll take a look.""

""Alright, Ma'am, bring it in and I'll see what I can do,"" my friend was already rather pissed that she hadn't brought it in already if it was such a problem. When she arrives, he opens up her computer, only to find everything inside is rusted.


""So, uh, what exactly did you *do* to this thing? There's no reason for it to be rusted like this.""

""Well, you said it was overheating, so I poured water on it to cool it down!""

One day I was walking together with this IT head down a hallway and we went past a small, closed closet next to the door leading to the server room (actually just another closet with a single rack and the biggest collection of ADSL modems you have ever seen). The IT boss suddenly shouts:

*""Oh no! Why is that plugged in there!""*

And I see him reach down to the floor level, where out of the wall comes out a single network cable, going into a single socket embedded right in the wall next to the closed closet. And he pulls the cable right out.

**He:** ""Now that was close!""  
**Me:** ""Why, where does that socket lead to?""  
**He:** ""There... * knocks the door * ... is our only linux server""  
**Me:** ""Uh-huh""  
**He:** ""It is important that that server *never* touches our network!""  
**Me:** ""Why? What server is it anyway?""  
**He:** ""Nobody knows.. "" (continuing somewhat proudly) ""...but a while back it was causing serious trouble in the network, so I made the janitor change out the locks to this door and not to give the key out to anyone. Not even to me! I couldn't go there even if I wanted to!""  
**Me:** ""...so the server is still running?""  
**He:** ""Yes. So it is very important that this cable (pointing at the cable) never gets plugged in! Good thing that I got in time this time, before the server could screw up our network again.""  

He rolls up the bit of cable coming out of the server room wall and leaves it hanging there, against the wall, proclaiming ""There!"" and we leave.

I couldn't give up on this mysterious, malicious (if not pure evil) Linux box sealed behind closed doors, so I went looking for clues to what its real purpose might have been, before it turned against its creators. I had almost given up, when a few weeks later I stumbled upon a short documentation (on paper) lying in a storage room, titled *""How to Operate The Linux Server""*, written by the previous IT head about 8 years ago. I thought this must be it; the described location on the handbook matched the sealed closet. So I turned to the page two (of two) which consisted of the following four lines of text:

&gt; If the HTTP proxy service jams up, log on as root and run  
&gt; ~# /etc/init.d/squid restart
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes this does not help, so reboot by running:  
&gt; ~# reboot

So the secret was revealed! The evil network-destroying Linux Server was an HTTP proxy.

Now I'm afraid to ask why the new IT head ever thought sealing up the server behind closed doors, disconnecting the network and throwing away the key was an easier solution than just shutting it down.",Shutting down a server is hard,840
vinnievon,170,177,10ebrg,674,"Just a funny instance.

I was in Salesforce this past week for a convention and flew JetBlue. Flying back on Saturday and this guy plops down next to me. I knew I hated him immediately when he completely ignored repeated attempts to power down his phone because he was in the middle of a text conversation.

I hated him even more because he was using an iPhone and made a huge commotion to also get out his iPad AND Macbook Air and shove them into the seat pocket in front of him.

Well, he finally turns off the phone and his screen is black. For those who don't fly JetBlue - you can press the ""decrease brightness"" button and it will eventually turn off your television. Everything is controlled via buttons on the armrest.

Well this guy starts slamming his fingers into the TV trying to get it to turn on. Pushing and poking and swiping - and obviously nothing is happening. This goes on for a good two or three minutes. He starts looking all around for a flight attendant so I subtly cross my arms and press the brightness controls for him. His TV slowly turns on.

So now he thinks it was just a slow reaction and he spent the next two or three minutes swiping the screen to try and change the channel.

Finally the guy looks around and noticed the controls - on the wrong armrest. Starts punching buttons for another good 30 seconds until the woman next to him informs him he's changing HER channels and changing HER volume.

if0rg0t2remember,189,177,yiv0h,673,"I used to work in a place with lots of government employees. When we moved to a brand new facility the decision was made to replace all the old desktops and laptops with brand new laptops with i5 processors, plenty of RAM, a desktop dock and a new 21"" monitor. There were maybe 7 or 8 computers in the whole facility where this wasn't going to be a clear upgrade, this story is not about any of those computers.

I got to this gentleman's desk and began the short interview to ensure we captured all the programs that needed to be installed, the user date was backed up and any custom configurations were noted. Everything looked pretty standard for this guy so I finished the interview and proceeded to break down his old PC and get the new one set up. I got everything set up nicely and had him log on to the new machine and make sure everything was working and that his programs and files were there.

An hour or so later he calls down to our desk and asks that my supervisor and myself come up to discuss issues with the new PC. He starts to tell us about how his work is very intensive on the computer and his last PC had to have a new graphics card installed to handle it. So I check out the old PC and wouldn't you know it, it has a fairly nice ATI card installed, a little better than the discrete graphics on the new laptop. I was confused, because nothing I installed on the new PC would need that. So I begin to ask questions, like are all your programs and files on the new PC, and do they run properly? He answers yes.

My supervisor takes over and starts asking completely unrelated questions. At this point I start to realize he is in over his head and buying into this guy's story. It turns out someone couldn't figure out this guy's issue in the past so they just threw parts at his computer and told him he was some sort of power user that needed high end computer parts.

I asked him to walk me through what he was doing on his old PC. Turns out he was opening an Access database that was over 8Gb in size. His crappy old p4 PC had integrated Intel graphics and 2Gb of RAM stock. That is when I figured out that all he needed was discrete graphics so the RAM wasn't fighting with the display for memory. The new laptop already had this, but he wanted to feel special again.

Plonkerby,118,167,v1dqp,676,"I knew most of this yesterday, but wanted to wait until I could talk to the IT guy in depth to get the full story... and hear what E had said to everyone. 

For anyone who missed the first installment of this amazing blunder - [Infinite Backups Part 1](http://redd.it/uvu0r)

Now, the news you are probably all wanting to hear. 

**E has been fired.** He will be leaving the company at the end of this month and is now coming in only to pass things on to his replacement. 
He has been working here for quite some time, and is the ""face"" of our company to a number of our customers, so it was a tough decision for management to make. Luckily, sense prevailed and he is going to be gone!! Woohoo!

The boss who gave E the login info to begin with has been reprimanded (not sure on the details) and he will no longer have access to this information. He put the company at a huge risk (beyond E's stupidity), so I guess they are handling it pretty seriously.

Now, on to the juicy details. 

According to E: Apparently, E never realized what he was backing up. He never even checked. He was under the assumption that he was just backing up his normal daily backup set. When only a few in a row filled the backup folder, he was ""shocked"" at how little space was available. He saw it as a ticking time bomb of sorts - if only a few backups of his stuff filled the folder, what was going to happen in a couple months when larger pieces of data ran out of space? This was clearly a design flaw on the part of the IT guy. The IT guy clearly couldn't handle such a simple task, and was surely just going to blow E off if he tried to tell him about it (as he had been blown off in the past when giving suggestions - surely this is a sign of his incompetence), so it was just easier to take things into his own hands. 

Staying logged in as root was a mistake. He had planned to log out and use his own log in, but forgot. Oops!  He hadn't intended to delete anything other than his oldest personal backups, but again, oops! He thought it was just dealing with the size limit on his personal folder, not the entire server. That wouldn't have happened if the IT guy used UNIX instead of dumbed-down Linux. Linux makes these kinds of mistakes easy, which is why he keeps telling the IT guy to use UNIX... but the IT guy just keeps blowing him off. What kind of IT guy blows off suggestions from his seniors? Not a good one, for certain. 

So, it boiled down to ""If the IT guy had done it right in the first place, I would never have needed to do anything at all."" and ""I use UNIX, this dumbed-down Linux tripped me up on a few things."" All with the charm turned on full blast.

Now, the boss vaguely remembered that he was only supposed to give that login out when 1) The IT guy could not be reached by any means and 2) a new IT leader has been hired.
His mind converted these to ""When the IT guy isn't around"" and ""When someone new needs to do something IT related."" - both applied to the E situation. E had been part of the original starting team, so he was trusted. It wasn't like the boss handed out the information to just some random faceless employee.

I have to actually put a good word in for our management. They apparently listened to the IT guy explain what had actually happened, how E managed to screw things up, the poor security chain that allowed E to do this, etc. They apparently weren't deliberating over who was at fault, but more about the best way to discipline the boss and E. The IT guy was kind of scared that they would flop the blame over on him as he has been working here for about half the time as E and the boss... but they were actually sensible about the whole thing. After reading through some of the insane stories on here, I have to give them some credit. They even praised the IT guy for getting it completely sorted out and back to normal over the weekend with no visible down time other than the hiccup on the first day.

Edit - I forgot to add. Apparently this isn't the first time that E had tried to mess with the network and servers. He has been told several times to leave the IT work to the IT professionals. So this wasn't the first time there had been a problem of sorts.",Infinite backups update!,843

Anyway, the professor took those of us that knew computers well and teamed us up with those that didn't. Not that any of that is relevant...

Anyway, in the class was a blond woman in her late 30s. Nice enough girl, though completely clueless about computers. We were discussing the horrible things people do to computer and she starts to get red in the face and buries it in her arms. Then she begins to slightly sob. The discussion stops and, being a pretty small class, ask her whats wrong. She got upset because she was one of those people we were talking about - here is her story.

She bought a graphics card - an AGP graphics card. However, her computer was new enough that it only had PCI and a PCI-E slot. Seeing that the PCI slot was the closest looking to what the card had, she tried to make it fit. Now at this point those of us that are more techy are asking her questions. For one, AGP slot is further back on the motherboard so the back of the card wouldn't even fit in the case even if she got the slot lined up.

First, she cut away the back metal panel around the slot so the card would just stick out, allowing her to line the card up with the PCI slot.

Second, she took a hammer and forced the card into the slot.

She paid $2,000 for the computer.... and it was only a few months old when she did this. It was this event that led her to take college classes a year later.

Guess what? It was NOT easy for her - the class confused her a great deal but we all took turns helping her out and taking more time with the hardware swaps and repairs (on the lab computers).

techsupportlibrarian,254,111,19wvon,673,"Greetings! I have been reading this reddit for a while and decided to make an account to share with you a frustrating event I had yesterday.

I work as a librarian in a public library. At our library, we have public computers for anyone to use and I've come to realize 50% of my job is helping people learn how2internet, how2word, and other fun stuff I never thought I'd be doing. I'm not super savvy, but I am smarter than your average user.

Yesterday, I had a fun time when a lady looked at me from her PC and waved at me. To be honest, I saw it from my peripheral vision, so I thought she was waving at someone else. Nope, she was too lazy to get up and ask me, which became clear when she practically yelled ""Hey you!"" I got up from my seat and went over to help her. 

I could see she was trying to access her e-mail, but her e-mail locked her out after too many unsuccessful tries. I asked her, ""What seems to be the issue?"" 

Irate patron, ""I tried to log into my e-mail, and it told me I was logging in from an unknown device and asked for my security answer.""

Me, ""I see. Have you logged in at our computers before?"" I was thinking perhaps if she was suddenly logging in a place 'far from home' it could trigger a message like that.

I.P., ""No, I've been in here everyday since I got a card last week! I haven't had any issues logging on from all these other computers!""

Me, ""Okay, what happened when you entered your security answer?""

I.P., ""It told me I entered it wrong. I tried it about 7 times before asking you to come over just to be sure. I think there is something wrong with your computer. Fix it.""

I'm just a humble librarian. We aren't allowed to mess with the computers, but I also know its not our computers. This is pretty much completely the user's fault. I think she probably forgot her security answer or something like that happened. Nonetheless, people always seem to think that I can control the websites they visit.

Me, ""I'm sorry, the library is not in control of that website. You might have to get in contact with that website and see if you can reset your password another way.""

I.P. rolls her eyes and says, ""Oh sure, how am I supposed to do that!?""

Me, ""Well, I am sure if we looked we can find a number-""

I.P., ""Look, I don't have time for that. I thought I could come into this stupid library to check my e-mail, but if this is going to be a problem every time, then this will be a waste of my time!""

Me, ""I understand, but I really can't help you other than see if I can help you find a reset option somewhere-""

I.P., ""Can I log onto another computer? Would that help?"" Because logging onto another computer to possibly just run into the same issue takes less time than trying to reset a password... sure.

Me, ""You can try that, but I can't guarantee it will work. I will put in a ticket to our tech team and see if they can come up with an answer, but we might not get an answer today."" I feel bad having to ask tech support about things like this, but I am pretty much at a loss for what I can tell this lady.

I.P., ""Make sure that you do! I wouldn't want to waste anymore of my time trying to get into an e-mail, because your computers suck!""

She pretty much left in a huff and it took a lot of effort on my part not to tell her that if she could remember her security answers, maybe she wouldn't run into this issue!

I can honestly say that today was the first time I had a jaw-dropping response when I asked a customer to describe what they saw on a screen.

The customer was having trouble getting computer to access the internet. The customer was elderly and admitted she was not very good with computers. I'm normally fine with this; I don't care how little you know about computers so long as you remain calm and don't act like a dick.

During the call process I had the customer check the network status in Network and Sharing Center in Windows 7 for connectivity and describe the three icons in the network map section that you would normally see at the top of the window. This is where my jaw-dropped.

Me: ""Can you describe what you see?""

Me: ""And what do the three pictures look like?""

Nana: ""There is a computer on the left, a globe on the right and a picture in the middle. It looks like a bitch""

Me: O___O ""I'm sorry?""

Nana: ""It looks like a bitch.""

At this point I am just completely stumped and being a big Tarantino fan I assumed shit was about to hit the fan. I had no idea what she was describing and what in Windows could possibly be interpreted as ""looking like a bitch"". I decide to ask one more time for more of a description for what she is describing.

Me: ""Sorry, could you just describe that again?""

Nana: ""It looks like a bitch, like something you would sit on.""

It then clicks in my mind that she is actually saying *BENCH* and it is being mangled by her southern accent. The bench she is describing is the icon for a network classified as public in Windows 7. I finally manage to compose myself and get back to fixing the problem.

narelie,171,111,wrxfr,673,"****EDIT: I have added the full story in links in a comment****

Ok, so bear with me, I had to cut out some of the details, to keep within limit. I'm also reposting this from TalesFromRetail, at the request of a poster.

So our story begins years ago, when I was contracted to design a custom template for a guy's website. $750 total, to cover the design I made, and the guy the client hired on to code. (Yes, I was a moron about pricing back then.) 

The Client, we'll call him TJ, threw a fit about the price, but eventually agreed to it. The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish, but ended up turning out really nice. The site's monthly profit actually **went up by 650%** after the new design was launched. No, I'm not kidding, that's how much of an improvement I did. 

TJ, however, throws a massive fit, demanding extra free work done, and that we WILL do it because he's paying us so much. As I'm in the middle of trying to calm him down, and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project, he suddenly does a 180 personality change. He's suddenly extremely polite and nice, and says he completely understands. I'm a bit weirded out, but didn't think much of it. 

Well, that evening, the guy who I paid to code, calls me up, freaking out. His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night. Considering we'd just gotten paid by TJ, to our Paypal accounts....this was odd. Both of us checked Paypal, and found out TJ had reversed the payments. 

Coder, in a fit of rage, promptly logs in to TJ's website, and strips down all the files, and leaves up a note on the website of “TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder, and this is what he got”. Not a  classy move, but within two minutes, TJ was calling me up, screaming with rage. He made all sorts of insane rants, that we overcharged him, that we scammed him, now we have to give him the entire design for free, and that if we didn't, we'd suffer. 

I explain, politely, that the terms of the project that TJ agreed to clearly explain that in the case of a payment reversal/non-payment, the files will be removed, until receipt of the payment. He rants a bit more about how this is “illegal extortion”, but finally gives back the money. Coder puts back the files, problem solved.

Right. 

I guess coder felt like this wasn't good enough. I had no idea, but apparently TJ had done this sort of thing multiple times to some of Coder's buddies, and Coder had enough of TJ's shenanigans. He went onto a extremely popular forum for TJ's industry, and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over. Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited, word got out. Fast. I heard about the post within half an hour, and by the time I went to go check, TJ and coder were having it out on the forums, screaming at each other. 

I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJ's lawyer (later found out it was his friend), telling me they're going to be suing me for slander, extortion, etc. I tell Coder to cut it out, and I get the forum thread locked down.

TJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my way....he's gonna track me down and beat me up, he's gonna cut me, he'll find my family....I end up blocking him because I'm not gonna listen to that. After blocking him....radio silence. I thought perhaps, magically, this would all blow over.  

A few weeks later, I get a message from TJ on an alt IM account. He's apologizing, and asks how I'm doing. I said fine, and he asked if my kids were nearby, as they typically are. Hm, weird, but I said yeah, of course, one's even sitting in my lap. TJ is all “kids are wonderful like that. So, I need to know if you'll make a design for my new site...” and gives me a link. At this point my kid was squirming, so I got up, put her down so she could leave, and went back to see what he was talking about. I click on the link, and immediately, hardcore porn floods the screen. I'm horrified, and look at TJ's im, where he's laughing and saying how he bets that’s gonna be one traumatic thing for my kids to try and forget. I'm furious, and block him. At this point, I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problems.

This occurred a few more times over the next few months. I'd get messages from fake people, wanting to know quotes, asking me to look at their site and see what I can do...and it'd be some sort of hardcore or illegal porn. 

The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on. TJ went  and made a post about me, with all sorts of insane claims. Apparently I was a foreign Communist spy sent to infiltrate their industry, and that with every project, I stole my client's bank account numbers, SSNs, and their CC numbers. 

I'd had it, and I unblocked TJ long enough to tell him that if he made ONE more move to harass me, I would contact the police. I was done with it, and I'd drag him through courts if I had to. TJ flipped out, claimed this is all MY fault. I cut him off, say I'm serious, and I'm done. I'm blocking TJ again, and if I hear ONE WORD, I'm going to the police.

That was the last I heard of him for a while, a year in fact. 

I later ran into his ex-partner, from the website we did for them. He was furious, asking if I'd heard from TJ. Turns out, he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular, and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny. He contacted the buyer, and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale. He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed. He's siphoned off something like $10,000 of his partner's money, and kept it for himself.

That wasn't all though, as he was discussing this with the buyer, he noticed in the site's activity feed, someone withdrawing small amounts. (this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks)  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well, and the new owner was like “yeah, come to think of it....they're been withdrawing every day...”. New owner checks the account, and HOLY MACKEREL, they have a $5,000 pending balance! That's literally impossible to pull off....especially considering that the account was created **the day before the site sold**. Upon further digging, new owner discovers a few accounts, all created the day before the sale, with thousands in their balance. 

And all with payment details that belong to TJ.

Yep, he'd made fake accounts so that he could steal money from the buyer, slowly over time. He would've ended up making off with something like $27,000, if he'd not been caught. So yeah, ex-partner and new owner were furious, and trying to find TJ. I just said I'm sorry, can't help you there, and went back about my business. 

Tthe next week, I woke up to a huge amount of emails and messages. Upon checking, every single one of them was from a client/friend of mine in the industry, ranting about the same thing.

TJ.

He'd had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for. But, he'd closed everything down, and told everyone  they're not being paid. This is something now to the tune of $60k. Several of my clients had already contacted lawyers, and were in the process of setting up lawsuits.

Another year passes, and I meet a new client, and we end up becoming friends. We chatted a few times about some of the crazier people we've dealt with, and he suddenly blurts “Well, nothing tops this one guy, TJ.”

TJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick. One of which was my new client. Neither would have any of it, got their money back, and told him to scram.  So TJ tracked down their addresses, and called the police in BOTH towns at about 2-3 am. 

He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun, and holding their family hostage, threatening to shoot them if they moved.

You can imagine the response that happened to that.

First guy was woken up at 3 am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement. He was surrounded by about five cars, all full of screaming policemen with guns trained on him.

Second guy wasn't actually home, he was on a trip, but his family WAS, so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them out.

Everything got straightened out of course, and then both guys pressed charges against TJ for what he had done.

The icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him, and mentioned how this was his favorite way to teach people a lesson....but that “the only one who couldn't have that done to her was that &amp;*@$ narelie”. Because I'd been smart and it was difficult to track down my address.

New client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest record.

In the year since I last told TJ that if he didn't cut it out, I'd call the police on him, his life had hit the downhill slope and gone to heck. 

The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming he'd been robbed of his TV and Xbox...only to have been found out that he was lying, he traded them for drugs. 

Afterwards, he quickly got in trouble multiple times for drugs, assault, and then domestic violence. 

His businesses all folded, and with the lawsuits looming, he moved to try and escape having to pay back the money he owed. Didn't work, from what I hear, they still managed to track him down.

However, he isn't done yet. He's shown back up recently, attempting to schmooze some of the industry vets into backing him with a new startup....saying he's changed.

Probably gonna be really difficult for him to do that, considering I just discovered that the arrest database now has a new entry for him as of last month: Child Abduction. (Kid's safe, as far as I can gather)

And it somehow may, or may not, have gotten out as a nice email, with a list of all the arrests and his mugshots. To all of the major industry players. Maybe.",xpost -- The Tale of the Craziest Client,784
MrZZ,168,212,zpd5w,675,"Hi, everyone. Some background:

I am a junior analyst and because we are a smaller company I take care of day-to-day tech support as well. We dabble in marketing and data sales, so naturally there are A LOT of reports that have to be done each month. They are mostly done in either excel and/or powerpoint. I know my way around MS Office and especially Excel and it didn't take long for some of my coworkers to figure this out. Most of them had no idea how to link data from different excel files and they relied mostly on copy-paste for every report they made. I offered one day to help out and make the whole thing automated and waaaaay easier than what they were used to. So I took their reports, pimped them up a bit and basically cut their work from a few hours to just a few minutes.


Now for the story:
One day another junior analyst Derpina asked me if I could show her how to link her Excel charts and graphs into Powerpoint, because she has a report with 200+ slides and it takes forever to do with copy-pasting (Let's call this Report X). I said sure, no problem. So I basically do her whole report with every chart and every text linked to the data in excel, so all she had to do was refresh all the links and voila, the whole PPT was done. I show her EXACTLY how to do it, step by step and she was extremely grateful.


Fast forward 2 months: Due to vacations we were a bit short-staffed and I had to do almost twice the work for 1 week during which time the I was pulling 10-11 hours each day to get it all done. We have a shared schedule in the office which basically prioritizes my work and Friday morning I only had 3 things left on it, that would take roughly 2 hours each. I was very excited, because it had been a tough week and I wanted some rest.


At 11am a new task pops up: ""Derpina needs Report X by the end of today."" At this point, I was still calm and collected and I got up and walked over to her desk.


Me: *Hey Derpina, I noticed the task, is there a problem with Report X?*

Derpina: *Well no, but I forgot how to do it*

Me: *Heh, that's fine, just open the Powerpoint and refresh all the links and it's done.*

Derpina: *I tried that, but it says it can't find the source for the data.*

Me: *That's wierd. Did you rename the excel file perhaps? But even if you did, it's not a problem, we'll just correct the source file path.*

Derpina: *Which excel file?*

Me: *The one that has the graphs for the report.*

Derpina: *Oh, I deleted that one. Since you fixed the powerpoint I didn't think I'd need it.*

Me: *The powerpoint has links to the graphs in excel Derpina... You need the excel with the graphs for the Powerpoint to work.*

Derpina: *Well that's stupid! Why did you bother in the first place then?*

Me: *So you wouldn't have to copy-paste it everytime! I'm sorry but now you have to re-do all the graphs.*

Derpina: *No way, I don't have the time. You do it! You broke it in the first place, so you should fix it!*


Thankfully our boss knows how linking works and Derpina had to redo every graph and link them to Powerpoint herself.

Craptain,99,136,177a9c,673,"Not sure if this story fits here, as I've always been a coder so it isn't really tech support. We'll see how it goes.

Whenever I needed our office address, I would pull up the corporate homepage to find the address and zipcode of our office. I make heavy use of tabs in my browser, and since I use a vertical tab plugin, I rarely close any.

I had noticed that my browser would sometimes slow down to a crawl, and I knew it was probably some shitty plugin in one of my many open tabs, it was usually less work to just close the browser and re-open it, discarding all open tabs and starting anew.

One day, I had pulled up the homepage again to copy the address, and after that went to lunch. An hour later, I was doing some work that didn't involve my browser. The door to our room opened.

""That's him, over there,"" a coworker told some guy I hadn't seen before, giving me somewhat of a stink eye.

It turns out that the corporate homepage was experiencing a DOS attack that originated from within the company, more specifically my laptop. Meanwhile, some bottlenecks in our corporate network also got swamped with my laptop's calls, setting off all kinds of alarms and crashing stuff. This is not a small company by the way, it employs 1000s of people.

I pulled up my browser and it was slower and less responsive than I'd ever seen it. So, putting the puzzle pieces together, I said: ""ah, so that's what's been slowing my browser down."" Guy said: ""yeah that's really interesting, would you mind closing it like right now??"" ""sure."" So I closed the browser, instantly alleviating a corporate-wide IT crisis.

I wanted to know what exactly had happened though, so a couple of days later I had some free time and pulled up the corporate homepage again, and used the firebug net monitor. It seemed fine at first, but I started noticing a pattern pretty quickly.

One minute after I opened it, it made an ajax call to the server. I looked into it, and it was to update the stock price in real-time that was displayed in a tiny area on the homepage.

One minute later, it made two calls to the same service. Another minute later, it made four calls, next, eight calls, sixteen calls, and so forth. e: after writing this, I've calculated that after an hour, it would attempt to send 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 simultaneous calls. I believe that's called a Quintillion.

In Javascript, a common way to repeatedly trigger a delayed execution is to use setTimeout at the end of the function you want to repeatedly trigger. The problem was, for some reason, there were two setTimeouts at the end of the function, so, after a minute delay, it would execute the function twice, and both executions would hit two setTimeouts, resulting in four executions a minute later.

What makes this interesting to me is that anyone on the internet could pull up the homepage, and cause huge problems by just doing nothing. I wrote an e-mail to the people responsible. Didn't get an answer, but it did get fixed.

Revolving-Ocelot,193,161,1qjb3b,668,"Background: I work in a computer retail &amp; repair shop in a small town, nothing very advanced beyond virus cleaning and harddrive replacements in shop as it's mostly elderly clients. My lack of a decent camera has unfortunately prevented me from posting the gruesome results to /r/techsupportgore.


A fairly common problem we see are broken DC jacks. Usually someone drops the laptop while it's plugged in, or rrrrrrips the power cord out at the wrong angle. Occasionally someone sits on it. Usually it's possible to replace it and have it working and charging again, assuming the laptop isn't an ancient primordial relic (and they often are).

I was lurking in the work area at the back of shop, furrowing my brow at just why Mr X's laptop initially tries to log into a non-existent duplicate user on startup, demanding an equally non-existent password (a half-complete user profile error fix, it turned out). Meanwhile, my colleague is talking to Ms Y in the front of the shop, but being a small shop it's only behind one wall and I can hear the conversation.

Now, Ms Y had apparently brought in her laptop just recently, for a broken DC jack. I don't know why it broke the first time, but they had handed it in for the standard repair service, taken it back and it had somehow been broken again by Ms Y's husband, Mr Z. The idea of bringing in the laptop to be charged again for another replacement DC jack had not sat well with Mr Z. Since we had done it before, surely Mr  Z could do it himself and save another labour charge! So he had apparently ordered a DC jack from eBay, and attempted some amateur splicing of Parts to PC.

Ms Y then sheepishly admitted to my colleague that Mr Z had superglued the DC jack to the motherboard. Dollops of superglue. And the laptop was dead. And she was facing the significantly higher charge for a new motherboard, or whole new laptop. 

Superglue.

It was very hard to suppress the giggles at this point, and I probably failed. My other colleague (also in the back) developed the ol' thousand-yard stare, which I hadn't seen for a good few months.",Super new motherboard!,829
Xyrqurqualym,134,170,1lkoyc,667,"Hello, people of /r/talesfromtechsupport

It has been quite some time. But today, it is time. Time for another story of the Meekrosoft Mother. You know how I kept claiming that she got better with computers over the course of the fifteen years of me doing tech support for her? Well, she's at a point where she fixes things herself. This includes, but is not limited to, random shortcuts that appear in random folders, fifteen-folders-deep filing systems (like F:\My Documents\Movies\films\Action\new\unwatched...), and e-mail.

But every now and then, there comes an issue that stumps even her. So, as per usual, my phone rings.

**Her:** Nothing works.

**Me:** Define ""nothing""?

**Her:** Do you have internet access?

**Me:** Yeah, I'm watching videos on Youtube.

**Her:** That doesn't work either. Youtube's also broken.

Right, I've learned to ignore her distinction between ""internet"" and things like ""Youtube"", ""Inter"", ""The Net"", ""The soap site"" and a variety of other things that are online but apparently not the internet.

**Me:** Right, what happened.

**Her:** I was using the laptop, then it was all black and then it had a blue.

Oh holy shit, it's happening again! Please, someone, kill me now. [Not another blue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1aavyw/grandmother_vs_computers_i_turned_it_on_and_i_got/) This has given me enough trouble back when my grandma tickticked on a blue and the orange told her Jack was in Brooklyn, so I am not too keen to go through this again.

**Me:** A... a what?

**Her:** The pink stuff is all blue.

Phew... I dodged a bullet. Because the pink stuff most likely refers to her taskbar that I turned red and not pink so that it's optically pleasing. And if the pink stuff turns blue, then it's very likely that the graphics driver decided it needed a break and deactivated Aero, which would result in the taskbar turning into the windows default blue.

**Me:** Alright. Anything else?

**Her:** Well, everything is slow. Nothing works anymore. Firefox doesn't do anything, Outlook doesn't work, everything's broken. And the mouse doesn't move anymore when I move the mouse.

**Me:** Alright, let's force a restart. Push the power button for five seconds.

**Her:** The What?

Here's where it begins... Why me?

**Me:** The blue glowy button that you press to turn on the laptop. Press it for five seconds.

**Her:** Okay. It turned off now.

**Me:** Good. Turn it on again?

**Her:** There's white writing on black. Now there's the windows swooshy swirly. Now I can enter my password. But it's very slow.

**Me:** Well, it is recovering from a forced restart..

**Her:** No, it's not! I did no such thing. All I did was Outlook, then there was a black, then a blue. Then I called.

Wait... what. Mom, you just forced a restart. How can you forget that?

**Me:** And then, what did you do?

**Her:** I restarted it by pushing the butt... oh! I see.

**Me:** Good. Does everything work now.

**Her:** The blue is pink again. And network diagnostics are telling me that I have no internet access.

Network diagnostics? How the fuck do you even know that this exists. But before I worry about that, I decide to push my luck. Occasionally, her Windows, due to the somewhat cobbled together nature of her LAN, doesn't immediately find the internet, for lack of a better expression. Connection and everything is there, but Windows doesn't believe it. To this day, I have not found out why that is, but it works, so I'm sure as hell not going to attempt to fix it.

**Me:** Uhm... leave Network Diagnostics out of it. Can you start Firefox real quick?

**Her:** I don't see what good starting Foxfire would do, but I'll try.

...

**Her:** It works. Thank you! You know, you're really good at this. You should do this for a living, because I'm sure that many people would be grateful for it. And you didn't even look at the computer. How did you know?

**tl;dr**: Mom's computer decides to disable Aero for unknown reason and crashes computer. Apparently, knowing how to force a reboot makes me a professional IT-superpro at least. She doesn't mention Meekrosoft once.

So in our office, we have 2 MFP/Copiers, a standalone fax machine, a large format printer/scanner, and a high volume scanner. All of these are in the hallway that all of the cubes are off of. I've made how-to guides for most of them, but still have people come to me with issues.


Today while I was troubleshooting a configuration issue in our timekeeping system, one of the admin-assistants (been here for years) comes in to complain that the fax machine isn't working. I'm in the middle of reading logs, so I tell her I will look at it in a few minutes. I check the MFPs and the stand-alone fax, none have errors. I tell her it looks fine, and to come get me if she has an issue.


An hour later, she comes back and complains that the contractor says he didn't receive the (large and time sensitive) change order she faxed. I ask which fax she used and she said the one that is just a fax.  I go check it and there is no log of any faxes sent today. I go ask her about this, and lead her to the fax machine. She tells me she didn't use this one, she used the one closer to her desk so she didn't walk as far.

........ This is the closest fax to her. She leads me into the kitchen, and points to 'the other fax' - our high volume shredder, in between the trash bins and the paper recycling bins. I ask just how many 'faxes' she sent today - 'Oh only 5 or 6. Plus that thing the president wanted from the VP.' I proceed to tell her that it's a shredder, not a fax and she proceeds to demand I get the documents back for her since there was no way for her to know it wasn't a fax machine (except for the lack of a dial pad and the word 'Shredder' in big letters).

When I told her it wasn't happening, she started complaining that we must waste our tech budget since we could just buy an un-shredder and should have for situations like this.

tl;dr: A high volume shredder makes for quick faxing, IT hides un-shredding technology from users, and there now are labels on all shredders stating 'THIS IS NOT A FAX MACHINE'

maumacd,96,162,z11nx,665,"Some Background:

We are a small company and we all share offices with at least one other person. In addition, the office is a converted residential home, and office supplies are stored in random closets throughout the house. (My closet has all the printer paper and envelopes and stuff in case you were wondering).

When we first moved into the building (from being entirely remote offices) we started noticing problems with things disappearing, or getting moved constantly. Innocuous things like a power strip, all your highlighters, etc. 

Often they would turn up later, after you had already had the office manager purchase replacements.

Many a memo went out about the proper location of all the office supplies and to please stop taking things from people's desks.

Since my manager and I handle all the IT requests, this became increasingly problematic for us. The monitor for the email server disappeared! Who is messing with the fucking email server!? It takes a key to get into that room!

So, we did what anyone would do. We set up a few cameras in the office.

The first few days, nothing happened, and we were beginning to question which of us might be protecting the ""borrower"".

Then, it happened. The president of the company (who also has keys to everything because she owns the building) came in after hours and was working at one of the conference tables.

After an hour of working, she gets up and goes into the nearest office (not one we were recording) and comes out with a power strip. She plugs her laptop in to charge and continues working. Then after a few hours she packs up and leaves... TAKING THE POWER STRIP WITH HER.

Turns out she likes working late because it's quiet and there are no distractions, and she likes working at a conference table because her desk is cluttered and if she is working on just one project it's nice to work on a ""clean slate"".

Every month or so, she cleans out her home office, realizes she has a bunch of stuff, so she brings it all back to return it - not realizing that she is the borrower that has been driving all of us mad.

Now, every time something is missing off someone's desk, the first person we go to? The president of the company.

The best way to keep your things safe? Put them in a drawer. She doesn't like to rifle through people's drawers, but she has no problem borrowing from the top of people's desks.

When we hired someone in another department form mine, I warned her to always clear anything she needed into her drawers and leave her desk clean at the end of the night or things might walk away.

Poor shy girl waited three months before asking us if we knew where her THREE phone chargers had gone. She had been using her car charger exclusively for weeks to avoid confrontation. Apparently she has the same charger as the company president - and since no one was asking for it back the president thought it must be hers and she had forgotten to take it home last time.

TL;DR: We aren't joking, if you want to keep it, put it in your desk drawers.

I take an educated guess on the array based on how I would set all that up for a single job. This is not just a SWAG, but I drew the array out as if I had just gotten this equipment and needed to set it up for this. RAID level, number of hot spares, stripe depth, nested redundancy...

I walked her through applying the config without initializing the arrays (Yikes!! oh god, please make sure that box is unchecked!!).

We reboot... POST...NO ALARM... and the OS loads, all data intact. All those variables and I guessed right on the first try.

MrTwinkeh,66,179,1nps7m,667,"**Background:**

I was having a bad day. Like, called in early, made to work overtime, constantly bad users and mind-wrenching tickets. This was near the end of the day, so about 6 or 7pm.

**People:**

M : Me
U : User


**Story:**

I was at work, feeling slightly frustrated with all the people who come in, when one person walks in with a completely *destroyed* acer. This machine had seen the nether regions of hell. He plonks it on the table, and looks up at me.

U: It won't turn on.

As I am feeling frustrated, and as it seems quite obvious why it does not turn on, I play along.

M: Hmm... I can't quite see the problem, let's try to boot it up.

I then proceed to wrench open the warped screen, and I press the on button. Nothing.

M: Well.

I sigh.

M: It won't turn on.

He looks at me oddly.

U: Yeah, I just told you that! Fix it!

M: I am just not sure what the problem is. Let me open the back up and see.

I open up the back and lift off the bent plastic. Inside, one of the RAM modules is snapped clean in half, and there are other bits and bobs are strewn everywhere.

M: Ah!

I pick up a small shrapnel of plastic, and I look closely at it.

M: That's your problem. This is called a starter-upperer. It starts the computer.

I am trying to keep a straight face. He is nodding in understanding.

M: These aren't cheap. It would cost BIG money.

He looks shocked and anxious.

M: But... I am lenient, I will give you a spare.

He looks relieved and lets out a breath. I give him a spare and he waddles out. I didn't even ask how he did it.

EtanSivad,120,99,191b2q,669,"My dad worked for IBM's AS/400 (A mainframe system)  tech support division for over 10 years (1992 to 2003) and in that time he had many strange and bizarre stories.

Thought I'd share some of them.  First, my favorite.  A customer called in because he needed to run a report and send it out to the networked printer.  For whatever reason, the report was failing to generate and the guy on the phone was freaking out because some corporate big-wig demand that this report be printed and on his desk by 3pm.  
Just another day at work.  

About 10 minutes into the call he starts to hear this strange high pitched noise in the background.

Dad, ""Uhh, if you don't mind my asking, what's that noise it the background?""

Caller, ""Oh, that's the fire alarm.""

""Fire alarm?""

""Yeah, the building is on fire.""

""Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but shouldn't you get out of there?""

""Dan... you don't understand.  I HAVE to get this report printed, now are you going to help me or not?""

So they continue to troubleshoot the issue. A few minutes after that my dad hears shouting in the background.

Dad, ""Umm, there seems to be a lot of yelling in the background, is everything OK?""

Caller, ""Yeah, it's fine.  It's just the firefighters evacuating the building.""

""Shouldn't you get out of there too?""

""Dan I absolutely HAVE to get this report printed are you going to help me?""

""I'm not sure that I should.""

""We pay our support contract.  I have to get this printed and you have to help me!  It's almost 3pm!""

""It's just a report I don't think it's worth risking your life.""

The caller starts to get furious when the shouting in the background gets much louder.  A firefighter has come over to the guy on the phone and starts barking orders at him to get out of the building.  The caller tells the firefighter ""Look, I have to print this report before 3p and I can't leave until it's printed.""
Over the phone dad hears the firefighter scream, ""I don't give a damn about your goddamned report the building is on fire! Now MOVE!"" 

There's a scuffling noise and the phone handset on the other end drops to the ground as the firefighter physically drags the caller away. After that, all dad could hear was the sound of the fire alarm and various crackling noises.  

Needless to say, the report did not get printed by 3pm.

Ironically, I got a call from the same user a few weeks later because he couldn't figure out how to eject a disc.","Um, sir, that's not quite...",841
scootersbricks,48,116,1cngcf,670,"I do hate not getting the tools I needed to do the job.

As stated in a previous thread, I worked in the Blackberry phone department for a company we'll call ""Spring together with Lextel"" right after they merged six or seven years ago.  During my tenure for the company , I worked the ""jabber chatroom"" for the department. Basically I would sit in a chatroom where all the other people in the call center were also sitting in.  If they had a question, instead of finding a supervisor or SME they could ask in Jabber. As one of the moderators (and someone who could type 100+wpm even back then) of the chatroom, I would respond with the answer.

Because of this we couldn't take calls, since we were too busy.  But my supervisor gave me a headset and told me ""log in to the phone so we can call you if we need. Don't worry, you shouldn't get any calls.""

Out of nowhere in my second month, the phone rang. It wasn't a supervisor, but some random outside line. I had been gated (put in the call center queue) for a department I didn't know anything about!

Not going to let myself get thrown for a loop, I put on my headset (brushing away the cobwebs) and gave as generic an intro as I could:

Me: ""Tech support, this is ScootersBricks, how may I assist you?""

Customer: ""Yeah. My card isn't working.""

Me: ""I am very sorry that you are having trouble.  Could you give me the model number for your device so I can pull up the tools I need to fix the problem for you?""

Customer: ""Yeah...it's the IM241 card."" 

At this point I am googling the number and find out that this is apparently some extremely archaic, super slow PCMCIA card that connects the user to the Internet using their Lextel SIM card at something near the speed of dial-up.  The problem is that 1: I had no idea that this card existed, and 2: I had no idea that our building even supported this card.

Me: ""Okay, can you give me a little bit more information about what the card is doing?""

Customer: ""Well I keep connecting but the red light won't come on.""

Me: ""And the red light is supposed to come on?""

Customer: ""OF COURSE!  You act like you've never heard of my device before or something!""

Me: (laughing) ""No worries there, sir.  We are extremely well-trained here and I think we can get some help for your issue today.  Now before I can get things working again would you mind if I put you on a brief two minute hold so I can bring up a few tools I'll need?""

I put the customer on hold, and frantically ran across the building to my supervisor.  I'll still never know why they sequestered all of us Jabber folks in the far corner.

I told my supervisor I'd just gotten a call for some project I'd never heard of.

Supervisor: ""Oh yeah, that's the PC card.  We get about five calls a year for them.""  

Turns out apparently my building volunteered to take over calls for this extremely outdated card that almost nobody still owned, but that they still somewhat supported.  Nobody in my building had, as far as I know, ever successfully helped a customer with their PC card--we would basically just take the calls and send them to wherever we thought was best.  Eventually the customer would either give up and cancel their card, or figure it out on their own.  I kinda think this was the goal--it isn't cost effective to have people take calls for a device that only a few dozen people in the US probably still used.

Me: ""Okay, so tell me what the hell to do?  I have a customer on hold right now. I need to know where to send him.""

Supervisor: ""Oh yeah, I forgot...I was supposed to give you this a few weeks ago.""  He opens up a drawer in his desk and pulls out a HUGE, spiral-bound training book. It is at least 2-3 inches thick.  He hands it to me. ""Here you go.""

Stunned, I walked back to my desk.  In my hand I had a 1000+ page training manual that apparently I was supposed to have read and been competent with.  

The next half hour was hell, mainly because I was determined to make this customer think that I actually knew what I was doing.  Finally I was able to get all of his information, we tried some basic troubleshooting (restarting the PC, re-inserting the card and SIM card...basically anything I could think of that may go wrong to a PCMCIA card in a laptop).

In the end, I decided that there was no way I could help him any further.  I called our Tier 3 department and explained the situation.  The response from the guy on the other line was essentially, ""Well, I have no idea how to help him either...but honestly nobody does.  Send him over and I'll see what we can do.""

I'll still never know what happened to the poor guy with the dinosaur PC card.  But the next time someone tells me ""Here, put on this headset. Don't worry, nobody should actually call it,"" I'm calling BS.

Edit: Looks like this one is taking off too!  I really love you guys and read all of your comments. You really know how to make the memories of my past tech support work pleasant, instead of dreadful.","""Wear this headset. Don't worry, nobody should actually call it.""",786
billryethedrunkenguy,145,129,10m43d,666,"I sat behind the IT help desk in my university's library one semester during my undergrad in order to generate beer money while studying.  It only lasted one year before we were replaced by the Information Kiosk, which is telling of the type of problems I dealt with.

There were literally only two things I did:

1) Re-enact the step by step instructional posters located beside the coin operated photo copier. 

2) Read out the bright red message located beside the email login form (and emailed to the old accounts) telling students their password had been reset to their student number for the new mail server over the summer.

This story though has to do with a graduate student who showed up a month or two before the end of the fall semester to occasionally work in a quasi office space located behind me.  Sheila, as she was called, was a budding sociologist grad student employed by the school to quantify and interpret the opinions of the student masses regarding this new mail server.  And before you ask yes one of the questions was indeed ""Were you, as a returning student, notified of the change to your password.""

Now our school, with its fancy brand new mail server, was not one to use pen and paper when taking surveys.  No sir.  This survey was sent out in a mass email to the entire student body, and responses were typed directly into the body of a reply email to be sent on their merry way......  Now I'm not sure who came up with that clever plan, but whichever poor soul's inbox that load of garbage got dumped into somehow managed to parse and extract the relevant data and pass it onto Sheila.  Enter Sheila.

Now Sheila was one of those girls who thought she knew everything.  Strike that - she knew she knew everything.  Not only about current events and politics which no red blooded American would be caught dead not having the correct opinion on, but pretty much the driving force behind all individuals, societal groups, and the history of humankind as a whole...also computers.  Needless to say I was happiest when she was hunched over her keyboard one handed typing away than anything else.

A few weeks passed, Chanukah break was almost upon us, and apparently Sheila's report was soon to be presented to the powers that be.  It was around this time that I saw more and more of Sheila, and she began talking less and less.  One day while sitting at the desk with my phone on vibrate, I answered a call from my friend with an innocent ""How's it going?""  Cue Sheila sitting behind me.

Sheila: ""Humph! This is so stupid is how it's going!""

Me: Silently mouth ""sorry"" to her while gesturing to my phone.

Sheila: *Grumble Grumble*

-phone call eventually must end-

Sheila: ""*How*...Am *I*...Supposed to get *this*... *done*!""

Me (with much reservation): ""Is there anything I can help you with?""

Sheila: ""NO!""

Me: slowly turning away as not to attract any atten...

Sheila: ""Just look at this! They didn't give me enough time to enter all this info!""

I pause for a moment and take time to digest what has been said.  enter the info..enter the info..enter the info.  Just what is going on here.  She was always talking about 'implementation achievements', 'notification method efficiency', 'perception of professionalism' etc. I always thought she was working on fancy 3d graphs and colorful charts.

Me: ""Are you having trouble generating fancy 3d graphs and colorful charts?""

Sheila (whining): ""I haven't even gotten to that yet.  I'm still placing all the info in.""

Me (suspicious): ""I thought you said someone sent you all the info and you were analyzing it?""

Sheila (haughtily): ""Yes but to do that I have to put it all in don't I!""

Me: ""Well what format is it in?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What type of file did it come in?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What did the file extension say?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""What are the letters after the period in the file name you received?""

Sheila: *blankface*

Me: ""Ummm...what program are you putting it into?""

Sheila: ""Excel obviously!""

*The color drains from my face as I slowly rise from my seat and walk over to her computer.*

Open on her monitor are two windows.  One, a csv file opened in notepad.  Two, a spreadsheet in Excel - the cursor blinking ominously in a cell where she had paused in her work. Y-E-_.

Me: turning to look at her ""Are you typing in every singl...""

Sheila: ""I know!  I'm not stupid.  I tried to copy paste it in but it kept on going in wrong.""

Reaching over I silently commandeer the mouse from her right hand (the same hand she one hand types with), close both the windows, right-click on the csv document, ""open with...Excel""

I ask her to open it up and show me.  She points out that the charge light isn't on anymore, which I tell her is probably because it isn't plugged in at the moment, so it isn't charging.  She just stares at me for a second, until I ask about the shift key.

I ask her if any other keys are not working.  She says she doesn't think so.  I hit the windows key to open the start menu so I can test out the shift key.  Nothing happens.

""Looks like your Windows key is broken too.""

""The what key?"" she asks.

""And your ctrl key...and your alt key...""

Turns out the entire bottom left corner of the keyboard doesn't work.  I didn't really think  much about it, so I told her I was going to take the machine in the back and check the ribbon connection to make sure it wasn't just loose before I order her a new keyboard.

After removing the 16 or so screws that HP deemed necessary to keep the keyboard from escaping, I pull the ribbon out and check the contacts.  All clean.

Then I notice a brown stain on the underside of the keyboard.  Yep, right under the faulty keys.  I grab the keyboard and take it out to show her.

""Did you spill something on the laptop?""

""Oh, oh yeah, coffee.  You think that has something to do with it?""  she replies.  ""Maybe that is why the light was flashing too.""

Ceres_is_a_Planet,166,163,vsefa,657,"The year is 1999. I'm 18 years old and working my first ""real"" job as general computer tech at an office full of mostly ancient machines: 386 Compaq Presarios running Windows 3.1. Yes, I said 1999.

Two of those computers were used by people doing actual work, while the rest of the office was mostly useless. So it became necessary to put them on a network so they could share data, and to have a copy of all the important files in both machines in case one of them died. So, I put a request for two network cards, and a crossover network cable (a router would never have been allowed as an expense). In order to make sure they understood I needed a crossover cable, I wrote in the paper, ""for direct connection between two computers"".

A couple of weeks later, I get the two network cards. Awesome! And I get.... this cable: http://i.imgur.com/Mocga.jpg

That, my friends, is ""Direct Cable Connection"" cable. It was a feature of Windows 95 where you could connect two computers by their parallel ports, and Windows would transfer data between both. Most certainly not a network cable.

Now, by my description so far, you can probably guess that asking for a proper cable would have just led to delays and frustration. And because it was my first job, I had a lot of pressure on me to make things work with whatever I had, or they'd find someone else to do it.

So... soldering iron in hand, I proceeded to add a parallel port to an Ethernet card, making it pin-compatible with the DCC cable. Once I was done, I took a picture to forever remind me of that moment. I still have it, and I will share it with you: http://i.imgur.com/LPb0u.jpg

I still feel extremely conflicted about this. In one hand, it worked. I am extremely proud that the two computers were networked on the same day, and productivity increased, while risk of data loss lowered a lot.

On the other hand... **I wired a parallel port to an Ethernet card**. My brain will never be okay with this.","My first tale was well received, so here's another franken-fix story.",820

Shit, I recognize this tone.

Me: ""What's up?""

MLM: ""I went to install iTunes on my laptop this weekend and it wouldn't let me.""

Me: ""You're right it wouldn't, I stripped your admin privileges when you showed me you couldn't handle them. On top of that, iTunes is not company software and is a big no no. If I find it on company machines, I remove it without any questions.""

You might be wondering about the admin privileges part. Because we don't have anything like Team Viewer or GoToAssist, my solution was to give the laptop users local admin rights on their machines. The caveat is that if they abuse it, they get it stripped. This particular manager had it stripped about a month back when he handed the laptop to me covered in spyware and junkware that his kids had installed.

She was on an old desktop, and messaged me that she was having trouble setting up video chat on Facebook.  The best I could get is ""It's just not working.  We can't connect.""

I figured that she was either having some trouble with an external webcam, or just didn't have some random setting right.  She insists she's got it right.

SPOILER TL;DR AT THE END.

(Occupation: Unemployed, which on resumes means ""Freelance computer repair"", which means once a month or so someone will ask me to fix their computer)

And so begins my tale. The customer, who we'll call ""Rose"", was a friend of a friend of a friend that I had done work for before, and was impressed with my reputation and very low rates (My policy is, ""I charge a flat rate of $20-$50 depending on the situation; if I can't fix it you pay nothing; if the same thing goes wrong because I overlooked something, I'll come back and fix it for free.)

Her main issue was that the internet didn't really work well on her computer, and that she was having issues with it going slow etc.

Pull up Chrome (+10 customer points for this being her default browser) running on Vista SP1 (-5 points for Vista), and sure enough, it doesn't load the default home page, https://www.google.com.

Try IE: It works fine, loads http://www.google.com just fine. Try https://www.google.com? Nope. Other computers she has aren't having this problem, so I know it's not ISP and/or router related. Plug in an ethernet cable, same thing. At some point I find that with complete consistency, any https website will fail after trying for about 2 minutes, refresh the page, it loads just fine.

I figure this might maybe be the result of spyware/malware, so I run a HijackThis scan to look things over. No suspicious LSPs. Some unsavory BHOs, and a Chrome extension I had disabled, but nothing that would suggest some major interference.

Turn off the computer, plug the harddrive externally into another computer, scan it with Avast: Not a single thing. Plug harddrive back into original computer, scan it with Spybot, removed some pieces of malware, issue is still there. Check computer's proxy settings - no proxy in use. TCP/IP settings all set to DHCP. Kindof at a loss at this point, I decide to try upgrading IE7 to IE9. Who knows, maybe there's something that ties into how the computer handles SSL connections? It won't work, saying it requires Vista SP2. ""But wait!"" I say. I had installed every update in Windows Update. Check that there are no hidden updates. Nothing that I hadn't hidden (Bing Desktop, Live Essentials, et al). Have it refresh the list of updates. Still no SP2.

Proceed to Microsoft's website, manually download the Vista x64 SP2 installer. Run it, everything installs just fine. Of course, there are now a shitload more updates to install. Before proceeding I pull up Chrome. Secure web pages now load without any problem. Same with IE. Test it out on other HTTPS websites (bank etc.). No problem. ALL ISSUES RESOLVED. Go ahead and have customer verify that I've fixed everything to her satisfaction (I went ahead and had all 80 or so updates working in the background.) Everything is fixed.

She asks me how much she owes. I ask for $40. She writes me a check for $75. Happy days.

**tl;dr** Customer's computer refused to load any https:// connection on the first try, it would always work on the 2nd try.

Me:  Generally, I would begin with not waiting until the last second to get something prepared that is important.  In fact, poor planning on your part does NOT constitute an emergency on mine.  Threats are also generally frowned upon.

d1dOnly,139,174,wzvdv,660,"About 6 years ago, I was hired by a construction company to be their level 1 support. Within a month, the level 2 tech was fired for showing up drunk to work. My boss decided that, instead of filling the role, we'd go without a level 2 tech. This worked for a while and the levels were removed from the tech titles.

After about 6 months, the contract for our guy that worked in the mailroom was expiring. The board of directors liked the guy, and asked us to take him on in our still vacant role. We did, but his main job was destruction of old data as we were preparing to move buildings. Things went fine for another 4 or 5 months, until we got a phone call one day. A woman was having trouble with her laptop and called us to get help. However, she did not work for us and never had. Confused, we asked how she got our number. Her response: ""From the sticker on the bottom of the laptop.""

It turns out the guy from the mailroom had been putting laptops in the bottom of bins, taking the bins out filled with trash, and then selling the laptops on downtown street corners, without removing the asset stickers that included our phone number. We estimated he did this with about 20 laptops, and we didn't notice because my boss had him perform the previous inventory. Needless to say, he was fired and I had to perform a full company inventory of all equipment to see if anything else was missing.

The part that pissed me off though, was after the CIO found out, he came to me and said ""Have you ever stolen anything from this company?"" I was the only one he asked. BTW, the answer was no unless you include forgetting I had a pen in my pocket.",How Not To Steal Company Laptops,834
raix-corvus,50,183,1q9ziv,656,"First post here so for info I'm in 1st line and this was a wonderous phonecall I had earlier this week.  For extra info point, we have three wifi networks, let's call them NameOfCompany, NationalShared &amp; Visitors.

**Me:** Good afternoon, IT Service Desk...

**Lady:**  Hello, yes, the wifi doesn't work on my laptop and this is very inconvenient.

**Me:** OK, which one are you connecting to?

**Lady:** What do you mean?

**Me:** What's the name of the network you're connecting to?

**Lady:** NameOfCompany.  But it doesn't work.  Sometimes it works after five but never during the day.

**Me:** Right. So it only works in the evenings?

**Lady:** Yes, after five, before that it doesn't work.

**Me:** Could you bring the laptop over to us in person?

**Lady:** It is not my laptop. It works at home.  Your wifi doesn't work properly

**Me:** At home it will be a different connection so we would still need to check the settings for NameOfCompany to see why it doesn't work.

**Lady:** But it works at home - it is nothing technical!!

**Me:** Yes, but you have a different network at home.  It has different settings.

**Lady:** It is NOT my laptop!  It is nothing technical!  I do not want to waste my time coming to the desk, just fix it now, it will waste 2 hours of my time to come and see you.

*(this is doubtful as she's on site and we're no more than 10 minutes walk for anyone)*

**Me:** I can't fix it without knowing what we're looking for.  There's no reason for the wifi to work only after 5pm.  Are you sure you can't bring it over to us?

**Lady:** Well I didn't bring it with me today because it's useless!

**Me:** Next time you bring it into work, you can come over and see us and we'll get it working.

**Lady:** BUT IT WORKS AT HOME SO DO I HAVE TO QUEUE?

**Me:** Er... As I said the network you'll have at home is different so-

**Lady:** NO!  That's not what I meant.  It works at home so do I still have to queue when I come?

**Me:** ......

**Lady:** There is always a queue at the desk! Do I have to still queue with the people?

**Me:** If there's a queue, *yes*, you have to queue in it.

**Lady:** *&gt;huff&lt;* FINE.


Bland pleasantries exchanged and we end it at that.

After much discussion around the office, we concluded that the reason it works after five is probably because she's taken it back home again and is using her flawless sparkly totally functional home wifi... and has in fact probably never connected to the one at work.

If she came to the desk in person, I certainly didn't get her, so we may never know whether the wifi started working before five.

unknownrebelx,101,165,1d9hct,658,"I recently had a temporary job replacing hundreds of computers for a major US company. We were expected to wait until the office closed on a friday night and replace the 10 year old computers with new ones. We were instructed not to begin the work until everyone had left for the weekend and the employees had been informed of this fact as well. Sadly, as is usual, one lower ranking employee decided to be a ""female dog"" and disregard this information. 

When we were silently making our rounds dropping off new equipment outside offices in the hallway, she rushed out and started yelling at the techs. ""I'M TELLING YOU NOW THAT I WILL NOT BE LEAVING UNTIL I AM DONE WITH WHAT I'M DOING! YOU BETTER NOT MESS WITH MY COMPUTER UNTIL I'M DONE"". While I would have loved to tell her where to shove her attitude, we just smiled and nodded and continued our rounds. 

The lack of groveling must have really irked her because she began talking loudly on the phone about the ""DISRESPECTFUL IT GUYS"" and how they ""WERE SO DAMN DISTRACTING AND INCOMPETENT"". Again, I just ignored it instead of telling her off. 

The procedure was to swap out the monitors, keyboards, mice, and towers with new hardware. The existing DVI, ethernet, and power cables would be reused. When I got to her office several hours after the incident, I noticed her system was using VGA cables, not DVI like the rest of the office. We had spare cables so I easily could have swapped them out and gave her better quality, but I decided not to bother. 

I guess she pissed off the last IT guy as well. Why else would she be the only one in the office with lower quality cables? Petty revenge at its finest. ",Less respect for me? Less quality for you!,823

**Previous Chapters:**

[Chapter 1 - My first job in IT](http://redd.it/xtlhx) 

[Chapter 2 - Store uniforms](http://redd.it/xyazr)

* * *

I was happy to finally have a decent uniform to wear. I had been walking around in questionable clothing for far too long. My new shirt was light pink and had the store logo across it. The only downside was the new name badge that came with it: I don’t like the idea of strangers calling me by my name and pretending they are on a first name basis with me. 

The name badge was part of the second wave of the plans from Ron and Don to revamp the store. In a second store meeting, they had told us that they wanted to change the store even more. It needed to be spacious and full of light with demos of our products on the tables for customers to try out. They clearly had been to an Apple Store and thought, “we can do this”; they could not.

After about six weeks of planning, arguing, and having an even messier store, they were done with the  makeover.The result was what looked like an counterfeit back-alley Apple Store. The store windows now were completely free of the promotional posters that had been up there for too long. The glass was  tainted with adhesives for weeks afterwards. The tables were put in the center of the store and had refurbished notebooks on them. The desktops were banished to the right side of the store with the software and accessories on the left. New was the table full of iPod knock-offs that would be the new, “can I interest you in…” item. 

The store still kept many of its old features. The walls were still brownish (they used to be white a long time ago) and the floor was old grey carpeting that had had its time. The bins containing all kinds of USB-gadgets and promotional displays still were scattered around the store. 

On the outside they did nothing; the paint was still chipping off and the street was still dirty. The store sign had changed by now, but it was poorly secured and looked like it was leaning towards the left. I am honestly still surprised it never fell off. In the street we now had a poster board that detailed our special offers - special in the sense we didn’t actually have any offers. Just full prices disguised as discounts.

With the store now having a full fledged identity crisis, the attention fell on the back of the store. Ron wanted it to be cleaned and to throw away anything that we did not need -- the hoarding was over. With my Saturday shift coming up, he decided I could clean up the back. I don’t know why he picked me, but I was happy, since it beat working in the store.

The back was messy and looked old. The walls were hidden behind rows and rows of metal bookcases storing inventory, old computers, and boxes full of parts. On the right was Ron’s office a small kitchen and the toilet. I never really went into Ron’s office unless there was a good reason; I was afraid of what I would find there. 

The part of the walls that were free of the bookcases were used for storing boxes. The only thing that looked remotely new in this place was the light above the safety exit hanging next to the door. They had it replaced before I came to work here under pressure from the fire department. Otherwise it would have have been an archaeologically perfectly preserved 80’s IT-workspace.

In the middle of the room we had the work benches. 2 big grey tables with another on top. On top bench we had all the PCs and notebooks we had to work on with their information sheet taped on the front. Aside from the ungrounded extension cords it was actually a decent workplace. 

Not knowing where to start with cleaning the mess up, I looked around and decided to start with one of the blue plastic containers in the metal bookcases. It contained all kinds different cables that appeared to be in the middle of an orgy. I was not going to untangle that mess, so I put it back and slapped a sticker saying “Cables” on it.

I then took out the next box and started looking through it: mostly old video and sound cards. I was ready to put it back and slap an “Audio/Video” label on it when something caught my eye. I took it out and I could not for the life of me identify it at first. It was an tennis ball covered with screws, all of which were pointing outward. You could have really hurt somebody with it. I asked myself what it was for, and moreover, why we even had it. Asking Richard a couple days later, he told me they had played a match of “pain ball.” Pain ball was a game they had played to see who could handle more pain. He showed me all the damage they had done to the store with it; broken LCD screens - carefully hidden behind boxes - and damaged walls.

It is about now that I should tell you more about Frank and Richard. They were - to put it kindly - practical jokers. They had a spirit of having fun around them and whenever an opportunity arose, they took it, no matter the consequences, costs, or ethics involved. They treated everybody equally. Them buying me an outfit was an opportunity to play a joke on me, made possible by Don and Ron.

Their other hobby was doing imitations of _Jackass_ and building things. Strange things. When I had put the pain ball away and went on with cleaning up the store, I found many more of their treasures. They later showed me how all their devices worked.

Hidden between the CD and DVD drives, I found the Stabber: a repurposed slimline DVD-drive that, instead of ejecting a DVD, would eject a knife. The Shooter was a collection of high RPM fans that been taped together.With part of their casing removed, it worked like a waterwheel, shooting away pieces of cereal. What took the cake for me was the walking video card. They had taken an old card and put 4 fans on it, their casings removed. Being hooked up to a small battery it would sort of walk. It was surreal to see, if totally pointless.

Having cleaned out most of the back, I turned my eye to a pile of magazines wedged between two of the shelves. They were old PC magazines - editions from 1995 to the early 2000s. I decided to throw them all away and grabbed a container to bring them to the paper bin just around the corner. While I was picking them up to put in the container, my curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to skim the magazines, just to look at what was the “must buy” hardware at the time. Computers were expensive back then. I had gone through about three quarters of the pile when something came up that was not a PC-magazine. It was a porn magazine, vintage 1997. 

It was unexpected, but I wasn’t fazed by it. I had never actually browsed a porn magazine before, and opened it up to quickly find out that the theme was barely legal. It was really questionable. What made me throw it in the trash right away was that - how cliche it may sound - the pages were sticky. I did not want to touch it anymore. I went to the kitchen to scrub my hands with soap and a brush over and over again till they were red from irritation. It wasn’t super effective, and I still felt dirty. I decided it was better to just leave it. It was either from Ron or Don, and I did not want to know which.

Later that week, I started working on about 5 orphaned PCs I found during the cleanup. I had connected the first PC, hit the power button and a well known beep was heard followed by a rattling hard disk busy with loading whatever ancient version of Windows would be on the PC.

What was missing, however, was the screen. No input whatsoever - just a vague reflection of me in the glass CRT monitor. I checked the VGA cable: it correctly attached to the monitor, and, reaching under the desk, I determined that it was attached as it should be. There was a lot of dust, though. Already on the verge of sneezing my eyeballs out from all the dust, I managed to open the side of the computer up. It seemed to be working on dust: everything was grey aside from the video card, which was, rather... Cheetos orange. Upon closer inspection, I found that it was indeed Cheetos dust and smudges covering the entire card. The heat sink had been removed and replaced by Cheetos. Unsurprisingly, Cheetos don’t transfer heat well. After cleaning the computer of dust and Cheetos, I replaced the video card and tried to boot again. The computer started.

Two or three computers without advanced Cheetos cooling down the road, I encountered another computer that did not work. I opened the computer up and quickly my jaw dropped. There was mold growing around the CPU. It was disgusting to look at. Baffled at how it was possible I took off the cooling. They had replaced the thermal paste with cheese, probably in an attempt to make CPU grilled cheese. Idiots.

Lydious,228,187,19p4ex,652,"I got a call today that just blew my mind. This guy called me at Derp pro support saying that he had 2 systems with ""issues""- the first one was ""holding him hostage"" on his favorite games site with some popup that wouldn't let him close the browser. From the start he was snippy, demanding, &amp; standoffish- not the best way to start a call &amp; certainly not the best way to get any more than the bare minimum of service from me. If you're nice to me, I'll bend the rules like nobody's business to make you happy. If you treat me like crap &amp; act like a petulant child, you will get the absolute bare minimum of effort that it takes for me to keep my job. He starts off bitching about having to talk to an Indian person last time he called in, which pissed me off because I hate racists with a passion. Then, my attempt to confirm his service tag &amp; system type was met with ""I don't know, you should already know that!"", and every instruction I gave him was met with ""I'm not a techy person, what are you talking about?!"". 


By some miracle, I managed to talk him through opening the task manager &amp; closing out IE, and then he started talking about his other system which was ""locking him out"". I was already prepping my ""sorry, we don't crack passwords"" speech, assuming he had just forgotten his password, when he began describing the FBI virus. To begin with, viruses are best-effort only for us, and I rarely bother with them because they're annoying &amp; a waste of my time because the cust usually ends up reinstalling windows in the end anyway. But whatever, I'll pretend to take a shot at it just to shut him up. I had him boot into safe mode(which took 3 tries due to him ignoring my instructions), but FBI was still locking him out in safe mode. He was hosed. I began to explain that if he can't even get into the system in safe mode, there was no hope of me fixing the system &amp; that he'd have to OSRI. This was met with ""NO NO NO! I am NOT reinstalling windows! The last time I had this problem that Indian guy remoted in and fixed everything for me!"" The last time...? You mean you've had this problem before &amp; didn't take precautions to keep it from happening again? Oh what, you DO have virus protection? You mean that stagnant copy of Norton- the least effective virus scanner available- that's not even running in the background &amp; hasn't been updated in 2 years? No no, I'm sure you're fine. Totes not your fault that you keep getting viruses!


I told him I'd love to remote in &amp; have a go at it if I *could*, but since he could not even log on to the system, we would be unable to get connected at all due to our remote access SW being web-based &amp; requiring hand-input token codes for each connection. He just kept repeating that the last guy had just fixed it for him &amp; that I should too. I was beginning to get really pissed off at this point. I have little patience for idiots, and even less patience for belligerent, rude idiots who won't listen to what I'm telling them. 


I hadn't yet pulled up the tag for this second system, he had just launched right into the spiel without even giving it to me. I got the tag from him(after again explaining what a service tag was &amp; where to find it, and listening to him bitch about how much trouble it was to read off seven digits to me), pulled up the account, &amp; saw that he didn't even have a support contract on this system. **Score**. I was not obligated to help this douchabeefy at all anymore :D I informed him of his lack of coverage &amp; explained that I could not actually provide *any* sort of support for this system at all. It had been out of warranty for an entire year, and the last 2 times he called in he had been charged for support. The notes even said ""fee based support"". I pointed this out to him &amp; he yelled ""NONONONONO! I paid to extend my warranty on October 1st of last year! You guys charged me $109.95, and that was for a warranty extension! I'm looking at the sheet in my hand right now"" 


""Ok sir, since you have the order sheet right there, can you read me off the order number so I can check to see if maybe there's been a mistake on our end?""


""There IS no order number! It's just a charge! You guys charged me so you have to help me cause I'm the customer!""


Ohhh, he's pulling the ""customer is always right"" card. I'm gonna have fun shooting this one down &gt;:D


""I'm sorry sir but there are no active support contracts showing up on this system, and unless you can give me an order number for this warranty extension there's really nothing else I can do for you today."" I replied, my voice sweeter than Jewish wine.


""WHY WOULD I MAKE THIS UP?! I PAID YOU GUYS!!!"" (Uhh, you would make it up in order to get free service on a machine that's out of warranty! Durr.)


""I'm not accusing you of making anything up sir, I'm just letting you know our policy and that I am not able to help you unless you have a valid support contract with us.""


He began literally WHINING like a 3 year old having a tantrum over forbidden candy. ""Come OOOOooonnnn-uh! You HAVE to help me! The last guy helped me, so I MUST have a warranty! I'm the customer and I'm always right!""


""I'm sorry sir, but it says in the notes that the last 2 times we helped you, it was fee-based support and you were charged for our services. If we help you again today, there will be another charge.""


""THERE WAS NO CHARGE! THEY NEVER CHARGED ME LAST TIME! YOU'RE LYING!""


I'm having to mute him to laugh at this point, and I'm giving my greatly amused supervisor a play by play via IM. ""That's what the $109.95 charge was for, sir. That was not a warranty extension, that was a service charge because your system was out of warranty the last 2 times you called in. If it had been a warranty extension, there would be an order number on the paper."" 


""This is ridiculous, you should just help me!!!"" (And I probably would have at least tried to if you hadn't been a total assmunch from the moment I answered the phone!)


""I am not allowed to help you unless you have a Derp support warranty sir. I'm sorry, I'd help you if I could, but those are the rules.""


""Yeah, well... rules can have exceptions...""


At this point I could tell he knew he was defeated. His once booming voice had become small &amp; weak. He then asked how much it would cost to extend his warranty. I told him I'd have to transfer him to another department for that, and that even if he did extend his contract it wouldn't cover existing issues. I think he may have actually been weeping at this point, because he just quietly asked, without arguing, how much it would cost to have us clean up the virus. I transferred him to our fee-based support department, but I'm not sure what they could do about it since he couldn't even get into his system to initiate a remote session. But meh, not my problem.


What a mook. I don't know if he was trying to pull one over on me or was just genuinely too stupid to recognize over $200 worth of support charges on his credit card, but he can have fun paying another $110 dollars to remove a virus that could easily be taken care of for FREE with a simple OS reinstall. 


I will never understand what makes a grown adult think that throwing tantrums like a 2 year old is ever even remotely OK ಠ_ಠ

**EDIT:** OK, forget I said ANYTHING AT ALL about the racism thing, jesus. I guess you had to actually be there and hear the way the guy was talking about the Indian rep he last worked with to understand why I feel he was being racist. Trust me, it was NOT along the lines of ""Gee, I sure don't enjoy talking to people whom I have trouble understanding &amp; who have no power to actually help me!"", it was more like ""God I hate talking to those stupid freakin' Indians!"". The rep had fixed his issue without any problems &amp; the customer did not mention any communication issues at all. His only issue with the rep was that he was Indian &amp; had a foreign-sounding name, hence why I made the accusation of racism.

Doc_Osten,59,163,xrmqw,652,"A couple of years ago I used to work at a helpdesk that supported a family of hospitals scattered across the country.  We were 1 of 4 helpdesks setup to support this group of hospitals, with each helpdesk assigned specific hospitals to support.  

In addition to our level 1 support, our particular helpdesk also did basic operations support, such as monitoring application interfaces.  We did this for all of the hospitals, regardless of if they were assigned to us for level 1 support or not.

One day, an interface went down for a HospitalX.  The error it was receiving was ""Fatal: Client Died"", which was a fairly common error - it usually means there's not enough room for the log to continue growing.  If left unattended it could cause larger issues, so these are treated as priority issues.

At this point in the story it's important to note that HospitalX was not assigned to our helpdesk.  In fact, the helpdesk (we'll call them HelpdeskX) that did support HospitalX was located *at* HospitalX and it was the only Hospital they were assigned to support.  This actually was cause for a lot of resentment for the other helpdesks as the call volume was not evenly distributed... but I digress.

So, back to the story.... we issued a high priority ticket to the appropriate team at HospitalX, they address and resolve the issue, and that's that.   Or so I thought.  

Each helpdesk had their own team lead, and I was the lead for mine.  One of the duties of the lead was to review priority tickets for your assigned hospitals to ensure everything was going smoothly and address any issues.  I get an email from HelpdeskX's lead with the subject ""*URGENT* HIPAA Reminder!"" and the only thing in the body being ""Please remind your staff that it is a hipaa violation to put any patient information, including status of the patient, in a ticket"".  That was it, there wasn't anything else for me to go off of as to what prompted this email.

So, I call up HelpdeskX's team lead and ask what this was about.  She said she had been reviewing priority tickets and came across one where we had put that a patient had died!  Of course, this was a serious accusation, so I asked for the ticket number.  Pulling up the ticket, I had to supress the urge to laugh and spent the next 15 minutes trying to explain to her that the ""Client"" in ""Fatal: Client Died"" was an application, not a patient.","If your patient has died, please submit a priority ticket to the helpdesk via phone or email....",815
nameless912,121,319,1465hp,652,"Story #2 from my $Uni helpdesk job. This one technically isn't a tech support story, or a helpdesk story, but that's okay!

So, some backstory: in my department, all the student workers (me included) have to work at least 4 hours a week of lab sitting shifts. So today I'm monitoring the computer science building's main Linux lab this morning, and I get up from my (insanely comfortable, holy mother of God) chair to do my rounds.

I walk past a lab station that seems to have eraser shavings all over it. Upon closer inspection, it's not eraser shavings. It's hair.

Yes, *hair*. Little bits of it. Covering this desk.

After puking in my mouth a little, I run back to my supply closet, pick up some 409 and paper towels, and very carefully clean up the desk.

Glad that's over, right?

NOPE.

Doing rounds an hour later, I see the same desk, covered in little bits of hair again, this time with a user sitting at it. This guy, I kid you not, pulls out a Braun electric trimmer and starts shaving his rather extensive Movember 'stache, right there at his desk.

I ask him what he's doing. He says that I have no right to tell him to stop, and begins rambling before I can get another word in. And I quote, $TheStatementInTheTitle. (Yes I'm lazy, deal with it.)

So, I go back to my desk, log into our userdir server using my fancy L2 Helpdesk sudo powers, and remove his write privileges from his home folder.

He storms into my office about 10 minutes later, yelling about how he can't save anything on his computer. 

I tell him, ""Oh sorry, I meant to take away your *shave* privileges, not your save privileges! Let me fix that for you!""

Now, two things could have happened in this situation. Either:

1. he could have punched me in the face, or
2. he could have backed away slowly, realizing that I had complete and unchecked power over all of his files.

Thank Jeebus he chose option number 2.

I assume most call centers do this, but just in case, I'll explain: We had a central database of step-by-step solutions for every tech support problem customers had ever presented.

When you accepted a call, you listened to the problem, and then searched the database for the solution. If the database didn't contain the solution, you figure it out on your own using Google, or your brain, or whatever.

Starrion,64,190,1dsstk,646,"My company creates software and hardware for commercial and government security systems. I am a senior tech. All names have been changed to protect my job. 

I am on the phone to $nice_guy_older_field_tech. I have a long history with $NGOFT, as we resolved several issues at the regulated facility that he is working at. The site had hired a company with a fast talking sales droid who originally sold them our product, whose company did a drive by installation that was unacceptable. $NGOFT and his company was hired to re-do the install to correct the numerous problems. 
One of the issues that I had identified with the install was that the servers had been installed into an unlocked disused basement room with little airflow and no power backups. The server towers were plopped under a desk with loose cabling leading to a switch sitting exposed on the desk. Their first major outage was due to a power loss that caused drive corruption.
$NGOFT responded by building the room into a real computer space with actual server server racks, a UPS and a backup tape array. The security system servers and the surveillence camera server and storage array had been installed only a couple weeks before. 
The UPS was installed at the bottom of the rack, and the only problem with the whole deal was that the UPS had shipped without a couple of parts including the comm cable, switchguard and software.  
The customer was duly impressed with his display of competence. 

Which brings me to my real story. 
We were doing a significant patch install. This required stopping the redundancy services to apply the patch to the common application drive. We were doing this at 10pm, well after the facility had closed. 
We had just restarted the mirror process, when $NGOFT slipped on some condensate from the additional AC (the facility had not run the drain line properly) and kicked the faceplate of the UPS. The switchguard was still missing, and he made full contact with the UPS power switch. A moment later the phone line got real quiet except for $NGOFT's profuse swearing. 

The swearing got worse when $NGOFT got the rack started up again and found that both drive arrays were corrupted. Thankfully he had done backups, I walked him through some hack n' slash surgery to bring my company's product back online. Three nights later we were complete again. 

TL;DR: missing three dollar part causes outage at major site, good tech manages to recover system because he had backups.

50sheckles,84,147,1mvxjr,647,"I worked for a relatively small remote tech support company. It was kind of a half-scam, boiler room telemarketing operation done with the use of encrypted VoIP and online merchant accounts, but we provided inbound support for everyone that paid us money and recorded all conversations so we could provide proof of customer satisfaction to the payment gateways in case anyone tried to do a charge-back after receiving support. Overall, we made sure all existing customers were getting what they paid for and happy with our work and most were. 

Only problem was that since we were avoiding charge-backs like the plague, a lot of times we had to do extra stuff for our customers. We had to make sure the customer was as happy as possible and that his/her satisfaction was crystal clear over the phone.

Most of our customers were some very strange characters.

One in particular was this one woman named Lisa. She's around 50-55 .
Every time she called us, she was wasted. Most likely we think she's blackout drunk. It's possible it could be something else. Meth is a close runner-up. Anyways, we have no idea what she's like sober.

This is a small snippet of what usually happens during a call with her:

Me: ""Ok Lisa, now I need you to type something in that box. are you ready?""

Lisa: ""yea I pressed ok""

Me: ""(!) No Lisa! Let's try this again! Look at your keyboard again. Do you see your keyboard?""

Lisa: ""yeah""

Me: ""Ok remember on the keyboard, on the lower left hand side, next to the C.T.R.L (saying it slowly) key.... do you see the C.T.R.L key Lisa?""

Lisa: ""yeah I see the start menu on the screen...""

Me: ""NO! Your keyboard! Look at your keyboard! The thing where you press buttons and the buttons you press shows up on the screen.""

Lisa: ""...................OH the keyboard! Right the keyboard! ok sorry go ahead""

Me: (Slow instructions to get her to open the 'run' box). ""ok lisa what do you see now""

Lisa: ""it says 'type the name of the program, folder....' (run box)""

Me: ""great! now DO NOT DO ANYTHING! ok Do... Not... Do.... Anything.... don't click 'ok'... I need you to type something in that box right next to 'Open.' Ok?""

Lisa: ""ok go ahead.""
Me: ""ok now type this in... www....... ok? W.W.W...... DOT....... [domain name]...... DOT.... net""

Lisa: ""ok should I press okay now?""

Me: ""NO!!!!!! Read back to me what it says!""

Lisa: ""www.domainname.net""

Me: [I don't trust her] ""Could you spell it out for me lisa? After WWW, did you put a 'DOT' after that?""
Lisa: ""Yeah it says dot""

[mfw she literally typed in wwwdotdomainnamedotnet] 

[spend the next 5 minutes trying to get her to locate the ""."" key on her keyboard.]

[fast forward 10 minutes...somehow get this drunken mongoloid connected because I'm Houdini]

Me: ""Well lisa I have no clue how I did it, but you are successfully connected to our technician's console"" 

Lisa: [babbling incoherently] 

Me: ""uh... we'll give you a call back once the work is done""

Lisa: ""Wait! Listen I want you to sign me up on the facebook. I want to start a facebook account! Where do I go to get one and is it free?""

Me: ""............""

[Conversation is being recorded. I can't just hang up or refuse service. If she decides to do a chargeback, the company's gateway is blocked and all money for the month is stuck for 6 months.]

Me: ""................ sure lisa. let's get you signed up on ""ze facebook""

[going through process of making facebook profile for her as she starts talking nonsense again]

Me: ""ok Lisa you're all set with your facebook""

[she mentions something about her daughter having a facebook and how she hasn't seen her in years]

Me: (since I start to feel bad for her and also to show her how to navigate around facebook as if she'll remember any of this tomorrow) ""What's your daughter's name? We'll find her on ze facebook!""

We go to her daughter's page, and she goes into shock. Apparently, she has a 2 year old grandson and she's never seen him before. There are tons of photos of this kid on her page. She starts crying as I'm navigating through all the photos.

[shaquille o'feel]

Because I know she'll never be able to get pack to this page without my help, I save all the pictures into a folder on her desktop.

She tells me she'll pay me whatever I want to have these pictures made for her and sent to her house. She cannot understand that she can do this herself. I tell her about FedEx/Kinkos.... nothing.

I decided I've had enough because not only do I feel conflicted about her proposal (on one hand, I do accept donations and I DID just help this insane person get her first look at her second grandson. On the other hand, 'holy shit! that's just fucked up that I would take her money for something like this!' 

Anyways, she was crying and thanking me and asking me to send her these pics. She was also flirting with me and asking me if I could send her a picture of me. It was getting way too weird at this point, so I just hung up the phone. I figured there was no way she would do a charge-back after this, and if she did, that's just something I'll gladly live with.

So there you have it, kids. This is just a tiny fraction of a typical call with her. Every moment is exactly like this. 

Did I also forget to mention that the whole time I'm trying to to help her, she is nonsensically babbling about nothing?

I've got tons of stories regarding Lisa. I'll stop here for now. Just thinking about handling her calls makes me want to physically hurt myself to distract from the memory.

Now read on!
   
  
   
**The Guy in the Tie**  
So you all know from [the last story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/r58tc/how_i_turned_a_demotion_into_giving_me_power_over/) that the office manager had bumped me out of the office tech position without actually thinking about the resulting side effects. When he realized that, technically, in an office without a tech guy all the computer problems are the responsibility of *the office manager*, and that almost 90 people had suddenly discovered that their [magic fix-everything icon](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qrqsa/ten_minutes_a_day/) suddenly wasn't working any more, he immediately leapt into uninformed action.

His first attempt at replacing me was to determine who else in the office had computer knowledge sufficient to address all the common issues. The answer, as I knew he would eventually find out, was that there was ONE other young, technically-minded and hyper-competent staff member on the roster.

What he didn't know was that she was my girlfriend.
   
  
   
His overtures, in an attempt to get her to replace me, were comical enough. And no doubt, she could have done the job - but she was pissed off at his treatment of me, and told him in no uncertain terms where he could stick his excuse for a management style.

Some weeks later, with computers and printers lying stricken all around the office and no-one fixing them, the office manager managed to scrounge up someone from outside. This dude couldn't have been more than eighteen or nineteen, if that, and he had no more computer knowledge than the manager. However, as the position was technically 'filled', the manager didn't have to listen to staff complaining about the busted computers any more, or why he wasn't allowing me to fix them.

The replacement's sole talent, as far as I could tell, consisted of the ability to turn up every morning wearing a tie, which was more than the rest of the non-management staff bothered with. This earned him the moniker of the Guy in the Tie, which I can remember even now despite his actual name being lost to the mists of time.

The Guy in the Tie was helpful, willing, spineless, and absolutely useless at technical diagnoses. Given that amount of free time I had, I even made it worse on occasion by trailing him around the office, sticking my feet up on a desk while he labored fruitlessly over some piece of equipment for half an hour, and when he left stepping over and repairing it in thirty seconds. It got to the point where whenever he turned up, any staff in the vicinity would give him a look which said ""Go away so the grinning guy behind you can provide the help you obviously can't.""

It probably didn't do much for either his concentration *or* his reputation. Heh. And of course, every time a staff member cracked and came to me directly to have something fixed, I'd shrug and say that I wasn't allowed to because of the office manager's decision to put Youngster McWearsATie in that job.
   
  
   
Fortunately, while all this was incredibly amusing and gave me a spring in my step each day, it didn't stop me finding new ways to improve office efficiency and save money. Which is how I came up with the Cancellation Detector.
   
  
   
But that's a story for another time.

Me: Why? We don't know what is wrong yet. You only needed to stop everything and attach it to one side. OK. We can rebuild that later. Can you start the services on server 1 please? 

Govtech: I deleted them. I also deleted the Resource group. 

Me: (on mute) @#$^&amp;&amp;&amp;!!! (off mute) Um, that is a lot of reconfiguring to do. Let's see if we can find out why it's failing. Try to manually start the service in the OS please.

stationed at a Catholic high school. Recently we have had the pleasure
of acquiring a new teacher with the ethereal voice of a buzz saw,
irreparably damaged hair from 60 years of chemically treated self

help desk requesting that I set her up in the active directory and exchange server and
give her a quick run down of how things work around here. I assign her
a password, deliver it to her, introduce myself, etc. Seems like a
nice enough lady.


About a week goes by when I receive an email from her:

""HEY SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME MY EMAIL DOES NOT WORK.""

Oh no? Begrudgingly I go to her room to pay her a visit. Turns out she
just assumed it wasn't working because she wasn't getting responses
from other faculty members about an email that didn't warrant a

start becoming a very frustrating part of my work day.


A few days later there's a knock on my office door. It's you know who:

""Hey can you help me my password does not work.""

""Doesn't work? That's unusual.""

""It doesn't work!""

""You didn't start using a new password did you?""

""NO! PLEASE HELP!""


Class is in session and teachers are all looking out their doors to
see what the noise is all about. They see their new coworker, arms
flailing, raving about a trivial issue and they roll their eyes as she has
already established herself as a less than desirable individual to
interact with. I catch a couple of them chuckle and point at me that already know how much I love talking to this woman.

I go back to her room with her to have her show me the problem. She
sits down to type her password and reveals the issue to me:


""So everything was fine but I don't know how to capitalize the dollar
sign in my password and it always worked before but now it doesn't.""

""Wait, *what*? You can't capitalize the dollar sign in your password?""

""No, I can't.""

""That's because no one can. You do not need to capitalize the dollar sign. Just enter it.""

""Well how do I enter a lower case dollar sign without making all the letters lower case?""


That's where I began to explain to her how to use a keyboard. The
first time I have ever actually had to explain, to a teacher, how to
use a keyboard. I typed up simple, step by step instructions, printed
them out and left them on her desk. Haven't heard from her since and
I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Someone may have forgotten to explain to her how to breathe.



**TL;DR**: Crazy lady randomly uses different password. Can't log in because she's making all sorts of attempts to capitalize the dollar sign in her password.

**EDIT**: Corrected a typo I missed (breath -&gt; breathe) before I turned the lynch mob upon myself.

**EDIT 2**: As of today (10/25/2012) the teacher in question is no longer employed at the school. 3 cheers!",Passwords. Tricky business.,808

*Names and events have been changed to protect the innocent. And to appear more awesome.*

**Act I: In Which the Battle Lines are Drawn**

Let us not underestimate the love a man feels for his customers. Especially the ones who give him money and don't complain. To have a customer wrestled from his hands by the likes of those Scoundrels! Wastrels! Ragamuffins! Rogues!

It is unfortunate that the man at Worst Purchase who had wronged me so was likely only attempting to do that which was necessary as per the requirements of his no doubt monstrous suit-clad overlords. Yet such is war. Two men may meet on a battlefield, with no personal qualm over one another. They are but two machines, manipulated with the controls of paychecks and commissions from some cruel dictator in the background.

I had endeavored to let it go. I was to allow this infraction from a man I did not know, who likely had no understanding of what he had done, to pass by me unabated. But soon, a series of unfortunate events instilled in me the need to take immediate action.

Over the course of the next few months, I received three computers that came from that citadel of darkness. The computers, seemingly unrelated, all tied together by the simple utterance of two small words. *Nerd Patrol*.

Those two words made my skin crawl. Was I upset for having to handle their incompetence? Was I disappointed that people in my industry could fail so completely in their responsibilities? Or was I merely jealous that they were, on average, paid twice as much as I was?

**Act II: In Which Straw is Piled on a Camel**

The first of these affronts to the technically competent was a customer who came into my store with her brand new laptop. She was unable to access windows. I began my much beloved bench diagnostics. The system booted to it's login. The login name was ""Worst Purchase"". Passworded. Summoning all my available resources and knowledge, I was able to heroically crack the password (the password was ""password"") and was greeted with the software reserved for a floor demo. Despite my prowess, I could not circumvent this insidious trap. Yes, not only had these hooligans provided a passworded, unusable laptop to my customer, but had also charged her for an ""initial PC setup"". I informed her that she was to return to the Nerd Patrol as my agent of vengeance, and demand a refund for obviously not doing the job that was paid for. I did a system wipe and reinstalled windows.

The second of these infractions was a customer with a custom made computer. This computer had exactly nothing in it. A mid-range processor, HDD, ODD, low end video card, and two DIMM's, at 2gig each. That was not the surprising thing. What was surprising was that it also had a basic water-cooling system that only covered the processor, ran to a radiator, and back to the processor. Aside from the insignificant airflow coming off the pump, *there were no fans anywhere in this case*. So was it any surprise that his computer was overheating? ""Who did this to you!"" I demanded, dreading the answer. But I knew the response before he even said it. ""Nerd Patrol"".

Apparently his machine sat in his bedroom, and he wanted it to be quieter so he could sleep at night. The solution, in the eyes of some quack with more knowledge than common sense, was to remove all the fans and install this water ""cooling"" system. To make matters worse, the radiator was caked in dust, and the fluid was over 6 months old. No information had been given to him on the maintenance of this particular cooling system. I demanded a name, but he could not remember it, no doubt due to the shock of finding out his $300's of work was in vain. I installed two low-decibel fans, one on the side blowing onto the motherboard, and another exhausting through the radiator.

As bad as both of those were, nothing could compare to the third one. The final straw. I will begin explaining this with a single quote from the customer. ""The man at Nerd Patrol told me that McAfee and Web Root both pick up slightly different things, so I asked him to install them both!""

She had arrived with a computer that would not connect to the internet. Leery that it had worked fine before she took it to THE STORE OF LIES and not when she got it back, she took it to us for a second opinion. During the bench diagnostics, I saw what had happened, and after inquiring about it, I received the above quote. This will not stand! I confirmed that not only had she paid for both pieces of software, but she had also paid to have the Nerd Patrol *actually install it for her* at the insistence of the sales rep. I had her sit around as I uninstalled both programs, ran the removal tool for both, and installed a free anti-virus for her. I felt sorry that she had purchased expensive software and the subscription for both of them. I didn't charge her, gave her my card, and told her to come back to us next time she needed anything.

It was on.

**Act III: Excuse me, sir. Can you help me?**

I developed a plan. A cunning, beautiful plan. A plan so ingenious that I can't even remember what it was. Because in all actuality the plan was something along the lines of ""go punch their tech in the dick"". But then fortune smiled upon me.

I was tasked with picking up a new HDD from Worst Purchase for a rush job with a corporate client. Armed with a friendly smile, an unwrinkled polo, and a pair of jeans that screamed ""I'm not a damn bit scared to crawl around under a desk"" I marched towards Worst Purchase. On my way in, I saw a woman carrying out a laptop, displaying the infernal brand of the Nerd Patrol. I stopped her, merely handed her my card, and wished her well. I would see this woman later, but that is a story for another time. I took a deep breath, and crossed the threshold into the very heart of villainy. I made for the service counter, and began to make my inquiries.

""Sir, I am looking for a new HDD to replace an old pATA drive on my computer. Do you have any I could buy so I don't need to go to Mecca? (Nerd Mecca is a nearby computer superstore in a warehouse format. I personally believe that every nerd is required to make a monthly pilgrimage to this store.) I was thanked for this with a blank stare. I repeated my request, and asked if he would please help me.

""Um... hold on sir. Let me speak to one of my technicians""

I heard them planning their nefarious scheme behind closed doors. The technician was close to clock-out, and did not want to assist, fearing I would be here for some time and hold him past his scheduled hours. He also seemed to have a problem understanding what pATA was, and I kept hearing him say ""Are you sure he didn't say sATA? This idiot doesn't know what he's talking about."" I allowed my smile to fade. The technician finally came to the front. His name tag reads ""Techdouche"", and he is likely ten years my senior.

""Hi, I'm the *head tech*. You said you need a... pATA... drive?"" Yes, he put emphasis on the ""head tech"".

""Yes, a pATA drive.""

""I'm not familiar with that.""

""... ... ... a ribbon cable.""

""Oh. Um, I think we have one, let's take a look."" And with that we are away on a whirlwind tour of the most insidious place on earth. Like Disney Land if the only attraction were the ""It's a small world after all"" ride. After trying to sell me on a new PC, and me informing him that I'm not interested, I just need a replacement HDD, he finally pulls one off the shelf. ""I think this is... a ribbon cable,"" he says, turning the product over in his hands. I clearly see the box marked as sATA. I also take note that it's the largest, most expensive HDD they have on the shelf. This repeats twice more, and finally he finds one clearly marked as pATA. I smile at the guy, and ask the killer question, ""Does this support ATAPI?""

**Act IV: A Villain Defeated!**

Techdouche's eyes glaze over, as he realizes he has no answer to that question. At this moment, I believe him defeated! But alas, I was a fool for this was only his first form. A change overtakes him. A fire burns in his previously glassy, soulless eyes. He fixates me in his gaze. ""Are you trying to make me look stupid?"" I must admit, I was slightly taken aback. I had not expected our game of cat and mouse to so quickly dissolve into a direct, armed confrontation.

But, in a game of wits, I always pack overwhelming firepower. ""No sir, not at all. You seem to be doing that just fine on your own."" Thus began his full on onslaught. Though he kept his voice low to avoid spooking the herd, he was able to instill the heated rage of ten thousand white hot suns into every word. In these situations I tend to tune people out, allowing them to fall upon their own sword of vitriol and ignorance. This man had gone to college! He had been working with computers for over *five* years! He had worked in the IT department of *three* major corporations! I was just some punk kid who didn't know the ass end of a USB port!

People had taken note. The citizens were becoming restless. Eyes watched cautiously from around lines of overpriced electronics. Then, I saw my opening. He made the fatal mistake of asking ""Who the hell do you think you are!?""

""Sir, I am also a PC technician. I have been working with computers for over ten years. Today, I was looking for a HDD with these specifications to replace a HDD on a server that hosts a corporate firewall.""

The man stepped back in stunned silence. A number of people had gathered around, intrigued by the hushed yet angry tones coming from our direction. I took the HDD, my trophy, from my vanquished foe. My path to the register took me by the service desk, where a customer was sitting, awestruck. I handed her a generic business card, and suggested she might want to give that place a try. She nodded quietly. I purchased my HDD, and returned to my store.

The war was far from over. I made no attempt to get the man fired, and he didn't seem interested in pursuing the issue. He retained his job.

But this battle had been won, and the seed of discontent had been planted. That seed would grow into a majestic tree over the following year.

SarahC,84,180,1bu8a5,646,"I know in help-desk jobs you have to be super polite, and not ask awkward questions.

One time, many years ago, I worked in internal-support, and did for 4 years.

I did hardware support, OS, application, ad-hoc application, and programming too.

There was just me, our manager who was always off-site and one other guy, and eventually the guy left.

It meant I was the ONLY PERSON on site (400 people in a production place, shop-floor printing system, directors computers, networking hardware... the lot), I also had remote calls for a place 150 miles away!

When the IT phone rang, I answered, when someone needed some local help, I was the one who went down there. When  someone needed access to someone elses account, or there own (face-palm) - it was me.

I was the Alpha and fucking Omega.

It meant I was in a position too few support guys are... I got the calls, and the follow up calls... I got all the requests, and knew ALL the situations people got themselves in with IT. The third coffee on the keyboard, the mobile dropped into the BBQ. The 10th password reset that week...

You know ALL the bullshit excuses people give? I got them, and I fucking QUIZZED THEM on it.

""You did? Oh dear, let me look at what's happening.""

""You guys in IT suck, you know that? We're waiting here for her to log in!""

Now normally your IT Support app may not have ALL the notes in it, because someone forgot to add them, so in situations like this you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.

""I'm sorry, there's no record, let me rush and do it for you now!""

""Can't you just rush it through now?""

""No, she needs setting up on several systems first. I'll get back to you when it's done. BUT REMEMBER - if some urgent hardware failure happens, I have to do that first, it could be ALL DAY before her accounts ready.

Remember, you're supposed to do that EVERY DAY! Now I'm going to have to spend the morning working through the data from backup.""

(she's still annoyed!) ""Well, do that then, and I'll take it from there."" (she said that before)

""I can't, there's a fault on line 5 that I have to sort out. You're just going to have to go out there into the warehouse (-24 degrees!) and stock-take on paper, and type them in by hand.""

GenericName951,101,112,11ravq,646,"So I do over the phone technical support for audio and POS systems at drive thru stores. Different systems than most tech support you guys are probably used to but the basic idea is the same.

One day I get a call from a McDonalds because none of their headsets work. Definitely an unusual thing, since we tend to see individual headsets stop working, but not the whole system. Sometimes it does happen, though, since there is a main control unit that all the individual headsets communicate with. People don't really mess with it very often, and most don't even know it's there, but sometimes it goes down.

I spent a good hour to two hours on this thing, checking everything I know to check, even going so far as to having a nearby store try their headsets on the frequency this one is running on to see if there is interference issues.

Then he said it. I never knew before that moment that any combination of works could ever cause me as much physical pain as the store's food has so often caused me. 

Him: ""Is it a problem if it's fried?""

Me: ""I'm sorry what? Has there been a power surge or something?""

jellatin,103,181,txwf9,646,"I used to work as a web developer for a custom motorcycle company, weird combo I know. Anyways, because I was really the only person in the building who knew how to operate a computer, I was also impromptu IT. To be fair, I'm really nowhere near professional IT, but I've worked with computers for a long time, and can help out with a lot of simple problems.

So one day I come in and the wireless network is down. Everyone who is hardwired on the first floor is fine, but all of us on the second floor who used wireless aren't getting any internet. So I go down to our server/networking room and start poking around to see what I can figure out. 

Common sense told me that our wireless router (an apple airport) wasn't working, and sure enough the light is blinking orange. So I try a bunch of different things, swapping out ethernet cables, rebooting the router, logging into the router admin and checking all the wireless settings, etc. Can't get anything to work. I dig around and find a Linksys router, set it up, create a new wireless network, etc, works fine. I go around and get everyone set up on the new network, then we're good to go.

Everyone is happy except one guy who swears that I'm wrong, the router works fine, and is determined to prove me wrong. Keep in mind that this guy is a certified douche bag and this isn't the first time he's tried to one-up me in front of most of our company. All his efforts always end hilariously bad for him. So after about an hour of everyone getting back to work, he bursts into my office and declares that he has gotten the Airport to work. 

Now like I said, I'm no networking or IT expert, but I know my shit fairly well, however I wasn't 100% positive the airport was broken, it was just my best guess. I walk over to his office and he proudly loads up a webpage. So I have him open his wireless network list and point out that he is connected to the new network that I set up. What's more, I don't even SEE the old network on the list. He begins ranting that he swears he had it working and he will fix it shortly. So I walk out to check the airport itself. It's plugged in to the wall, but there are 0 ethernet cables running into or out of it.

mod_critical,218,160,r0axt,644,"There seems to be a recurring theme in corporate I.T. that for any given server, the more money it will cost the company if it goes down, the more neglected it will be. May I present to you the most important, most neglected server I have ever had the pleasure of putting out of its misery.

Once upon a time there was a large national corporation in the financial business. As this company grew, there came to be one whole organization in charge of telephony, and one in charge of computers. As time went by, telephony slowly became part of I.T. Phones were just IP connected devices, phone lines became SIP trunks, and PBXs became just another server in the rack. Well, everywhere except for at _this_ corporation. There, the telephony team made a special point to control their telephony hardware, even though they were just servers very much the same as any other in the data center.

Shortly after I was hired there I got an alert that a server had a failed hard drive in a mirrored set. ""No Problem!"" I think, I'll just order a new drive and this will be like any other day!

WRONG.

First I find the server, and realize that it is some frankenstein freak of nature abomination with a consumer class case, a half dozen T1 cards in it, and no hot swap hard drive bays. Wow, okay, I guess I'll have to schedule an outage to replace that IDE drive.

WRONG.

This particular server was one of the telephony team's server. I had never seen one of these telephony people, but boy did I ever hear from them when I scheduled the outage! This particular atrocity was in fact the most important server in the whole building! It provided a text-to-speech engine which meant that if it went down, every single customer calling this corporation would be met with silence! Call into the automated bill payment system? Silence. Call the main line? Silence. You see, this server could not be down, not for 1 second, ever.

""But that other hard disk will go eventually,"" I said! Didn't matter, the server can't go down. Let's fast forward about six months. Lo and behold, the other hard drive failed. However, the system did not crash! You see, the application never performed disk I/O, so it never hung waiting for the drives that were long gone. You couldn't log in to the server, as an audit record couldn't be written to the log. You couldn't do anything to the server really. BUT, the application kept dutifully providing synthesized voice to thousands of callers a day despite all this.

""It's fate is sealed now,"" I told the telephony team. If that server is ever powered off or crashes it will never boot again. This, of course, did not seem to concern them, as everything was ""working"".

Eventually I forgot about the server. Months went by, then turned into years. New applications were built, new servers were installed, old hardware was removed, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent.

Then I heard about the fact that the whole data center was going to have to power down for a weekend! Something to do with the electric coming into the building, a big change, had to be done.

""Well I wonder what ever happened to that server with no hard drives,"" I thought. It was STILL THERE! It WAS STILL RUNNING WITH NO DRIVES! How could this be!?

I talked at length with the telephony team. They were furious, and emitted rage in every possible direction regardless of who was talking to them or whether they had anything to do with the mandatory power outage. They said it couldn't happen! There was no backup of the text-to-speech server, nor was there any copy of the program that was even running on there. Also over the past two years while the server sat there with no hard drives, nobody had bothered to prepare for it going down in any way.

It was like watching a hurricane; everything was going to get fucked up but there wasn't anything anybody could do about it. Eventually the day came for the power outage. It was over thanksgiving weekend, and I had volunteered all my time to participate, just because I wanted to be the one to power off that server. It was so bad that even up into that weekend the telephony team was calling and saying that the server could ABSOLUTELY NOT be powered off.

I made sure to pull the plug on that one myself.

The next three weeks were wonderful. All the fallout of a full power off of the data center, apps down, failed hard drives, missed reports, etc., was all drowned out by the impact of the telephony team needing to rebuild the text-to-speech system from scratch.

It was a headache and a half, but I will always remember fondly powering off the server that had no hard drives for two years.",Mission Critical server in service for 2 years with no working hard drives,804

As might be expected from someone of this caliber, he was surprised and angry that we wouldn't cover his notebook's repairs.     
""But,"" I hear you ask, ""Wasn't his notebook well outside of its warranty anyway?"" Yes, by about five years, yet somehow he didn't see that as an issue either. (Even if he had bought the longest extended warranty we offered, it would have been outside warranty by a year at this point.)

I stayed with Sarah for most of the Sunday before I left her in the care of her family again. I didn’t go home straight away but went by Jeremy. I had not spoken with him since the night before. He was rather surprised when I showed up at his door, he still expected me to be with Sarah or sleeping at home. He invited me in and I didn’t leave until the early morning; we had talked all night. I had not slept in 2 days. I was tired, but It was eight in the morning on Monday and school was starting soon. 

I went to school while Jeremy went to the store. Both of us were dreading it, but we had to go. I went through the day thinking about everything except what the teachers were trying their hardest to explain. One of the tests I made that day must have had dreadful answers. It was around four that I could leave and opened up locker to grab my wallet and cell phone. I had 6 texts from Jeremy.

He told me Ron and Don had been informed by him about everything that happened. Ron’s heart went out more to the notebook than to Sarah. “Was it really necessary? Was the only question he asked that sounded genuine. Don quickly intervened though “Don’t be like that. I’ll call the girl the see if she’s ok”. He did actually follow up on it and called Sarah.

My next shift was a Friday again and well, I didn’t quit. I had talked with Jeremy that Sunday night and he was planning on getting back to school again. It was quite expensive and he would need another three months of work to have enough saved up to pay for the tuition and other school expenses. He had asked me to stay with the shop for at least those three months to keep hit bearable for him some shifts. 

I had been pushing Jeremy for months to go back to school and supported him in every step he had taken towards that goal. It didn’t feel right to not support him now when he actually had made the decision and the paperwork was filled in already. We had compromised that my shifts would be with him. It was only three months. I could handle it. It wasn’t Ron &amp; Don’s fault that this happened? Was it?

When stepping in the store again after a week of absence it felt strange and uncomfortable.  I put my jacket and bag in the back and changed quickly in the store clothing. The shift would only take about four hours. Jeremy quickly noticed my unease and offered to take care of the store while I would fix the computers in the back. I gladly took his offer as it was something he seldom did. He felt guilty about making me stay.

The next Saturday was a full day and things started taking their usual rhythm again. I was surprised about how quickly I picked it all up again. I had been in the store for most of the day until we switched places. I went to the back and started working on the computers for about 20 to 40 minutes before I walked to the cage holding the computer that stored the security footage and UPS. It was a quality cage, which was strange for a computer store that sold stuff that never should have had passed Quality Control. I put my head against it. I missed Sarah. I wanted to see the footage of that night. But I couldn’t open the cage.

I asked Jeremy if he knew the code on the cage but he didn’t. Ron didn’t share it with anyone; not even Don knew. I asked Ron if I could see the footage but he told me it was already deleted by now. I knew it wasn’t true. He had boasted to the police agents who had come to collect the video evidence of Alex that he kept 6 months worth of footage. He never lied about stuff like that.

Ron and Don had the meantime had become silent again and started withdrawing from the store again. They would hire new personnel in the coming weeks. “You better do because the both of us are leaving as soon as we can, have fun running the store with just the two of you” was what I mumbled under my breath while walking away from them. [I wanted out.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjV8SHjHvHk).

It wasn’t until three weeks later that I realised there were still other people that could know the codes; Frank &amp; Richard. I still had their phone numbers and called them. I tried Richard first. He didn’t pick up; I got a computer voice telling me it was a disconnected phone line. I tried Frank. The phone rang, once, twice, three times; it went to Voicemail. I ended the call and threw my phone on the desk and smashed my head on my desk. I stayed like that for a couple of minutes.

The desk started vibrating. The phone was ringing. It was Frank calling back. He was doing well and was very talkative. I told him my story. He was silent. Despite the fact that Frank &amp; Richard could do questionable things, they were still human and humane. Frank told me he didn’t knew the code either. I was ready to give up asking nicely and blow the damn thing up when he continued “but I know where it is likely to be kept”. He told me all about the second safe in Don’s office. It was hidden from sight in one of the cabinets along the walls. It wasn’t much of a safe really, one of those cheap hotel safes. He gave me the code and wished me luck. 

With the code in my hand I went to the office of Don and opened the cabinet. I had left the lights off on purpose, though it made me feel even more on edge. I tried the code on the safe and was surprised when it actually unlocked. I tried took out the content. It was a big stack of randomly sorted papers.
The papers were mostly manuals, warranties and invoices. It took me a few minutes to sort through it before I found the manual for the digital lock on the cage. The code was written on the back; 9851. I walked to the cage and tried the code. The cage opened. I was in. I hit the power button from the monitor and moved the mouse around. A windows XP login screen popped up. I was prepared for that and started looking through the papers; the password and login were on another sheet, poorly written. It took a few attempts before getting the password right.

It took me a while before I understood how the software worked and where the footage was located. When I found it I watched it again and again. It didn’t make things easier for me as I had hoped. The footage was hard to watch. It was only one minute and twenty-six seconds worth of footage. Was that all it took to destroy someone’s sense of security?

I closed the window and started looking around on the computer some more. It only had the security video software installed on the system. What caught my eye was the fact that there was a shortcut for remote desktop on the desktop. I clicked it and it opened with the last used address. It connected. It was a Windows Server 2003 and it was asking me for credentials.

I was having a moral problem now. I had seen what I had come for. Would it be ok for me to also log in on this remote server? I decided to try on log in. It was hard for me to find the credentials and after trying the 12th set I decided to give up. I went through the stack of papers again when I noticed random letters written on the edges of a page. I tried that as password. I was in.

I started looking around the server but it looked clean to me. No out of the ordinary software installed or strange files on the desktop. I wasn’t familiar with the server editions of windows and went through the list of server specific applications. DHCP, Active Directory, Routing and RAS. Nothing of particular interest. I didn’t know what this server was for. I decided I didn’t want to know. I closed the connection and logged myself out of the physical computer.

I was ready to close the cage when my eye fell on the UPS again. Why does he keep that around? It doesn’t even work. And locked in the cage? I took a closer look and leaned over. I lost my balance and landed on the UPS with my body. The unit shifted. I saw it had a network cable attached to it. I pulled the UPS out of the cage, making sure I didn’t disconnect any of the cables.

Once out I tried to look in to the openings in the casing but didn’t see much. I put my ear to it. I heard the rattling of hard disks. This wasn’t a UPS anymore. It was a computer. I put the UPS back in again and reconnected to the server. Something wasn’t right here. I wanted to find out. If they were doing something illegal I wanted to know.

I started looking through the computer again. While going through every program down the list. It was then and there that I saw it! This could be the key to understanding this strange setup.",Chapter 15 - When things fall apart Pt. 1,1090
FissureKing,34,109,1j9f34,635,"I was troubleshooting DSL service in Tennessee. This was early 2002. 

I had a customer call me and ask for his password to be reset. I asked him what the problem was since this is kind of an odd request. He said that he could not get his email and he needed his password reset. I asked him if he had changed his password and forgot it. He said ""No"" but that this happened quite a bit. I looked at the previous calls and he had indeed called to have his password changed quite a few times and the previous tech had made the change and just ended the call. I told him that passwords do not just change on their own and asked him to try to pull a web page. He couldn't and I told him that his password was not his problem, he wasn't connected to the internet. All good so far.

The next bit of the call went as follows:

&gt;Cust: ""I have told you enough to do your job, NOW JUST DO IT!""

&gt;
&gt;Me: ""Why yes sir. Just one second"" I change password ""Ok, sir. I have changed your password. Your new password is '**jerk**'. That's  '**j'**, '**e**', '**r**', '**k**' all lower case. Please type that in for me and lets see if you can get your email. I'll stay on the line. Do you need me to spell it again?""

There was a very long pause here 

&gt;Customer: ""NO""

Then the sound of typing. Another long pause.

&gt;Customer: ""I still can't get my email... Will you help me... please?""

So, I did. I believe I just reset the modem and he was connected and getting his email. I left his password the way it was. He asked to speak to my supervisor (next level tech) after the call so I thought I would at very least get a verbal warning. Instead the other tech came over and told me the customer said I was the best tech he had ever talked too.",Rude customer asks for help,744

Now read on...

   
  
   
So I had time, and quite a lack of supervision, and access to both the government mainframe and its completely unregulated, unsecured macro language. I was also bored, and looking for things which could be improved. So I build...  

...a macro which ran through all the government benefit-issuing and -reviewing interviews which were scheduled to be performed at the office in the upcoming week, and would make notes where the interview had been canceled or rescheduled or otherwise moved out of its original timeslot. Originally, these slots weren't checked by anyone until an hour or so beforehand, and even then only by the interviewer, so they could find themselves with a very patchy workday instead of the neat set of interviews they'd been expecting to use as an excuse to pass off their back-office paperwork to someone else.

Only around 70% of interviewees actually turned up to their original times, as it transpired. Which meant it was taking around three days to do two days' work, and more to the point, members of the public who actually *wanted* interviews in order to get their government entitlements before they starved to death were being booked in timeslots weeks away.

I solved this by having the macro identify all the spare timeslots in advance, phoning up the people who'd been booked more than a week away, and asking if they'd like to be fast-tracked to a closer timeslot - like tomorrow, or even today. All of a sudden, the time blowout on interviews is cut by a third, interview days are more predictable, and interviewees are happier because they've been 'fast-tracked'. Stress drops, stats soar. I write up the process, pass it off to the section booking the interviews, and build...

   
  
   
...a macro which speeds up the data entry of manually issued benefit checks. Previously, each one was punched into a set of slow-to-update mainframe screens, and then *literally* 92% got rejected three days later and had to be redone because the figures didn't match up. My check reconciliation macro took all the check data for ALL of the checks at once, compared it to the relevant records on the system, and then entered it automatically. Check rejection by the audit systems dropped to 2% overnight, and I no longer had to spend hours every day slowly moving through the same workflow over and over. Which meant I had time to build...

   
  
   
...a set of simple forms I could print out and attach to physical files which had been sent to us accidentally. Such things were a problem, as many of the files which turned up in the interoffice bag each morning had been sent by people at other offices who were unfamiliar with the actual rules and policies governing when to send a file and when not to. The forms I created looked official, and quoted the appropriate policies and their references, and got attached to the front of the files which were sent right back to where they came from (or where they were supposed to be).  

I combined this with a program which scoured the 60,000 customer records for our region and identified discrepancies between where a file *should* be, according to policy, and where it actually *was*. This led to me purging the file stacks of an awful lot of files which we shouldn't have had at our site, thus making it easier for the rest of the staff to find something in the archives when they had to go hunting. I also used the opportunity to re-alphabetize the archives properly - no-one had done that in twenty years, and it gave me something to do when I didn't want to be sitting at a desk staring off into space. And when I got bored with *that*, I sat down and proceeded to build...

   
  
   
...a game of Arkanoid on the mainframe, so I'd have something to play with that would at least look like I was doing something with the keyboard if anyone glanced my way. I mean, hell, I'd automated everything *else.*  

Now, while all this was happening, someone in Head Office had decided to set up an Innovation and Improvements team. You'd email them an idea for making things run better, or faster, or cheaper, and they'd enter it in a publicly accessible database, pass the idea on to whichever manager or executive was the lowest level with the authority to approve it, and theoretically update the database eventually with a Yea/Nay/Maybe as to whether it had been implemented.

I had a lot of free time, and a lot of imagination, and it wasn't hard to work my way to the top of the national list of contributors to said list. I was also looking for a way to *enormously* piss off my office manager in a way he couldn't possibly retalitate to, and I soon hatched a devious plan which would take me all the way to the CEO's office...

   
  
   
...but that's a story for another time.

NightMgr,95,170,15mkg5,636,"Back in the mid-90s I had moved from a company that supported medical devices that communicated to PCs via serial devices to a new Unix job with serial terminals and printers.  I get the job basically because I'm a whiz with RS-232.  I'm learning unix and more about PCs, but I've been doing customer support and technical electronics for about five years.

I'm working for a company that does software for county government.  Taxes, courts, and law enforcement.  I'm at a big installation where we have about ten techs.  I'm struck by the hours- up at 6 AM to make an hour drive from the hotel to the customer site, then work non-stop till 10 or 11 PM.  I'm given all this ""real men/hard core"" blah about the hours.

But, I witness our lead tech pulling out old serial cable.  We're working about 10 PM after several 18 hour days.  We're all working on salary, so no overtime.  He doesn't notice that one cable is orange while all the others are grey and- snip.  Yeah, down goes the fiber connection between the courthouse and the jail bringing all of our work at the jail to a halt.

He knows wires but not fiber and soon discovers we can't just splice the fiber back together with our wire crimpers.  The cable belongs to the phone company, and they give us a 48 hour ETA on repair.  Customer is obviously not a happy camper.

But next week, I'm in another county seat.  Not as bad as we don't have the hour long commute from hotel to customer site, but similar hours.  Just me and my boss.  She knows the technical stuff and I'm still learning that, but I have quite a bit more life experience than she does.

After some insane number of hours in a few days, we're taking our customer contact, the county judge, out for lunch.  My boss is driving, and at a stop light, she falls asleep behind the wheel, her foot slips off the brake, and we hit the car in front of us.  The people we hit want an ambulance rubbing their necks and such.  

The Friday after that trip, I'm called into the official manger's office.  I'm told ""You're one of the most mature people in the department, and so we're wanting to make you a manager as soon as you're up to speed on the technical stuff.  What do you see as a problem?""

So, I tell them about the hours.  I point out that human performance falls off after a certain number of hours and you get bad labor that calls for people to fix the errors later.  I point out the accident cutting the fiber and how it resulted in two days downtime for 10 techs.  I point out you'd get more usable labor by having people work fewer hours each day.  I point out we're putting the company in danger from liability by having someone work 80 hours in 5 days and then having them drive home 14 hours.  They're going to fall asleep and hit someone on the highway and kill people.

That Monday, I'm fired.

I find out later their entire hardware department had quit together before I was hired, and everyone only had a couple of weeks more experience than I did.  They all formed a new company to do hardware support.  

But, knowing how the phone numbers there, when I got a new job, I poached their techs for a few years by calling the desks where the hardware people worked, introducing myself, and asking if they'd like a 40 hour a week job with real overtime where you're home every night.  They were our recruiting department.

TLDR: Force techs to work 18 hour days for days on end, fire people who point out performance degrades when people work without rest.  Car wreck.  Human Poaching. 


",How I Lost My First Computer Tech Support Job,806
abugguy,81,102,1ajl7n,635,"About 12 years ago I was working a summer job in high school at a Kinko's type place. It had a few computers to rent internet use, made copies, etc and it was in a gated community that catered to the uber rich, politicians, dignitaries, etc. Many of the people there had no clue how to use technology, so after hours my buddies and I would do tech support and we charged $30 for first hour, $20 each after. Everyone we helped always said what a bargain it was.

A woman came in one day obviously upset. She said her computer wouldn't work and she HAD to get to a file and asked if I could help. I explain I could come in a few hours after work, but she wanted it now as she was trying to submit an entry into the summer poetry contest and the deadline was an hour away.

She left and came back 10 minutes later with a laptop. Sets it down on the table and shows me that Microsoft Word was froze and she couldn't use it.  I hit CTRL+ALT+DEL, closed it from task manager, and restarted Word with no issues. 

She dropped $30 on the table, scooped up the laptop and was gone less than a minute after she walked through the door. 

If only all of those summer customers were that easy.

So this old lady calls, by the sound of her voice she's probably in her 60's or 70's so I gear up for a very tough and long troubleshoot because her internet's not working. But thankfully she's a clever old biddy and takes my instructions seriously.

We figure out all the cables are plugged in, the computer's working properly etc. etc. it all boils down to this: 

Me: Ma'am, I'm afraid your modem has died.
Customer: Oh that's too bad. 
She sounded pretty concerned as if she thought this was a very big deal or somthing. And today I still don't know what came over me but...
Me: It's allright Ma'am, it's an old modem and he had no friend or family.

My coworkers where all staring at me when they heard me say that. The old lady though burst out laughing. We got her a new modem and as far as I know the other one was buried in the trash can.

liquidmini,92,145,1pt2xd,631,"Short and sweet. An acquaintance of mine is currently mid-internship at a major department store covering IT project work.

After gaining trust with the engineers and devs, he looked into how the [very large] company ran their online purchasing system. They used 2 main servers - 1 as production/live and the other as the fail-over/redundancy should anything bad happen. Prudent planning when you service hundreds of stores nationwide and thousands of online transactions everyday. 

One day, and without prior permission, he decides on his own volition to load balance the 2 servers, so no matter what happened to 1 of them, the other would take over anyway. Good shout you say? Well...

...it would help if the software running the online purchasing system understood what load balancing was. The result? All online transactions were duplicated for 11 whole hours and customers charged double.

A very painful lesson to be had here. Go to the boss when in doubt / go to them anyway. Have a great day techs. :)",Doubled up department store. How interns can get it (right in their heads) oh so wrong.,776
muklan,79,132,1ft9u5,630,"so, 2006...ish, i have just began my first in house technician position with a company i apprenticed with just after highschool, standard m-f schedule. i get a call from the owner on a saturday, saying theres a high profile client with a serious issue, no one else was picking up, so i jaunt on over to the shop.

the ""high profile client"" is a random local DJ, who is doing a show at 6:30, no response from his computer. an off the rack acer, nothing special about it, even in 2006. 

so i begin my diagnostics, tearing his laptop down to the motherboard, infront of him, hes panicking, running short on time, im in that 'zen' moment of taking something apart.
 
come to find a micro fracture on the cmos battery mount, giving intermittent drops in voltage, causing the machine to A) not power on B) hang at random times. 

the shop did not allow soldering, there wasnt even an iron in the lab area, and bringing one from home was a fire able offense, as they were in the business of modular replacement, so...what to do, this guy needs to get out of here, he NEEDS his machine..apparently.

so..the solution was a post-it note. folded, jammed between the battery and the case to put pressure on the contact, and give uniform current flow, all the time im doing this, explaining, this is a stop-gap. this is an emergency procedure, youll need to bring it back in monday to order a new motherboard. blah blah blah in one ear out the other, got it working and he left. 

fast forward to a couple months ago, i left that company, started my own, and he shows up in my shop one day, we make jokes about that terrible post it- i ask how long it worked, he said it still is, like a champ, but now it needs a dc in jack repaired. needless to say, i did that and the cmos battery....and framed the post its.

I work in the web hosting support industry. I specifically work for a web hosting provider generally supporting shared customers. Basically you call us if your server is down, you need a password reset etc. It should be noted that what we don't do is website development. If you write shitty code and want us to fix it we wont. We're not your web designer we're just your host.

Me: Thank you for calling Host how can I help?

Cust: Hi, my site isn't working

Me: Okay what's the exact nature of the problem.

Cust: My site was working fine and then stopped.. you must of changed something.

Me: Alright I can take a look at that for you

(This part removed to protect the customer's identity and my job)

*I Proceed to get their domain the specifics of the site etc then visit the site and not-surprisingly don't see any issues jump out at me*

Me: Alright you site seems to load fine for me is it loading for you?

Cust: Well yeah but that's not the problem the some parts aren't loading.

Me: Okay the only images I see are the banner and the backgrounds of the menu and those are loading for me.

Cust: Well then you're on the wrong page. Go to /filelocation.html

*I visit the file and don't see any issues granted I'm not completely sure how the page is supposed to look. At this point I'm read to scream I'm not a mind reader please just explain your damn problem*

Me: Okay so what is your site supposed to be doing that it's not? 

Cust: Okay you see where the drop down menu is? One you select and option an image should load.

*I look at the site a bit more and figure out this is an ID creator where you select the type of Id you want to make, library card, student ID etc and it loads the template for that ID.*

Me: Alright I see that and the image is not loading for me.

Cust: Great can you fix this for me?

Me: Well I can definitely look at this for you but fixing custom scripts is generally not something we can do.

*I proceed to place the customer on hold and start looking at the script I do a few small checks but I'm no coder. I check to make sure source images are there, permissions are correct I even ask an admin if anything looks directly out of place or if we had made any changes to the server I might have missed.*

Me: Sir I've checked the script and a few other things to make sure nothing has changed on our end and nothing has jumped out at me.

Cust: Okay so what are you saying the problem is?

*I really want to say to him the problem is your shitty coding*

Me: I believe that the problem may lie within the code.

Cust: NO IT'S NOT. I have not changed ANYTHING on my site.

Me: Well sir sometimes things like this happen codes break.

Cust: No that's not true you're lying to me.

Me: Well I would recommend contact your developer and inquiring about your code.

Cust: I am the developer.

Me: Sir I do apologize but there's not much I can do as I'm not trained in coding or development.

Cust: Oh yeah? Then why did you just fix it?

Me: I'm sorry I didn't catch that?

*In utter shock I check his site and it's fixed it self*

Cust: You fixed it!

Me: Sir I can guarantee that I did not make any modifications to your site.

Cust: Well something you did must of worked.

Me: I promise not settings have been changed, and it's possible and even likely that your code may encounter this issue again.

Cust: Oh you modest bastard, I'll just call back and ask for you Bye!

And she knew -- *knew!* -- that there must be a secret folder containing all her dirty pictures on that computer, somewhere!  And she wanted me to find it.  

Blindfolded.

Yes, you read that right.  She had no idea how to look for these supposed pictures that may or may not even exist, and she wanted me to search for her.  But she wanted me to do it blindfolded this way here if there were any pictures, I wouldn't see them.

Yes, that makes about as much sense as it sounds.

I told her that it just didn't work that way -- there's no way I'd be able to work if I can't see what the hell I'm doing.  I also tried to assure her that she could look directly over my shoulder the entire time and make sure that I didn't leer at or download any of the pictures on the off chance that I did find something.  Nope.  I had to work blindfolded because she didn't want some strange man looking at her daughter's boobies (and yes, those were her words).

I told her that I would not be able to do that.  Her response was ""Well OK.  I'll just take it to Best Buy, then.  At least they'll be professionals about it"".

After several minutes of trying to disambiguate that statement, it turns out that it’s not connected to our campus wireless network. So, I look at the wireless settings, tap on [network name] and it prompts for a username and password. I asked her if she’s ever put in that info or tried to connect it to the network.

""Nope, never did that.""

""no, what's a setting, I don't have time for this, fix it!""

We've been getting ""prepare for domain migration"" emails for several months now, but due to our office's move back in June it was deferred til around this time.

Last month we had a rash of people (the ones still using XP) getting emails that they needed to go to a company website, fill out information about their workstation, including some applications they use, and submit it. I knew things would be coming to a head for the W7 people to start getting notifications that the domain scripts would start doing their work, so I sent an email out 2-3 weeks ago saying ""Very soon we will start getting notifications that certain programs will be needed on your computer. Please ensure the installation windows state (company/domain) and follow all instructions.""

Yesterday they apparently started to roll these scripts out to my office based on employee ID.

I get an IM from a woman in my department (Departmental Coworker) and tell her yes, this is legit, and that she must close all apps then just let the script restart her computer.

Not 5 minutes later I get a personal desk visit from one of my problem children asking the same thing.
Seeing as how it's barely 9am and most of the office hasn't arrived yet, I proactively send an email.

&gt;Good morning,

&gt;Possibly today, but very likely this week everyone in the office using Windows 7 will start receiving popups with (Company/Domain) text and graphics stating that a download is occurring.

&gt;After you click OK on that message, you will eventually get a popup (with Company/Domain) text and graphics stating that you must close all open programs on your computer, then to click OK on the script/install notification window. DO NOT use your computer during this time.

&gt;The installation process may take 10+ minutes, but it will eventually restart your computer.

Around 11am I get an email from a woman in the other Support department (who primarily works from home.)

**Her**: How long am I supposed to wait for the computer to restart?

**Me**: It'll probably take a few minutes, but make sure you don't do anything with your computer, just let it do its thing

**Her**: How will I know when it's done?

**Me**: Your computer will automatically restart.

**Her**: How long is it supposed to take?

**Me**: I don't know, but only a few minutes.

**Her**: And I can't work during this?

**Me**: No

At 3:55pm I get an IM from Departmental Coworker (**DC**).

**DC**: You have GOT to call me when you get off that support call

**Me**: (I call her)

**DC**: Yo, have you talked to (Other Support Department Lady) recently?

**Me**: She emailed me around 11am asking about my domain migration email

**DC**: Oh, she got it alright (she can barely keep herself from laughing)

**DC**: She called the customer-facing Support 800 number.

**DC**: Apparently (laughing) when she received your email, she closed all her programs

**Me**: Okay

**DC**: No, no. (laughing) She never got the warning about the domain migration. (Laughing) She closed all her programs. (laughing) and shut down her computer.

**Me**: (by now I'm laughing too)

**DC**: (laughing) AND! AND! she said she was waiting for you to call her back to tell her she could turn her computer back on

**Me**: (Laughing) Wait, what?

**DC**: YES! Holy crap! She's been waiting FOUR AND A HALF HOURS for you to call her to tell her that her domain prep was finished and to turn her computer back on

**Me**: (semi-sobering) So she never got the warning, but instead used my email as if they were instructions to shut her computer down and, instead of calling back within 30 minutes, waited ALL DAY to find out if something that needed to be done on her computer, which cannot be done because its shut down, was in fact actually taking place?

I have a pretty good amount of tools that allow me to do a lot of things from remotely changing settings on the device to monitoring data delivery and reported device issues.  One day as I'm working the queue I get this call.


**RobotJeff -** Helpdesk, Robot speaking, what kind of problem are you having?


**Liar -** I am not getting emails on my blackberry anymore


**RobotJeff -** One sec, gonna check your event logs and see if anything important is listed


I go into the logs and sure enough there was about a 4 minute window when the users device dropped off the network and failed to shake hands with the BES when it came back.  This is caused by situations where the user goes into an elevator, drives through a tunnel or a remote area with no coverage and similar circumstances.  The Fix?  Take the battery out of the phone for about 15 seconds to reset it, put battery back in, power on and it starts talking to BES again.


**RobotJeff -** OK I just need you to take the battery out of your phone to reboot it.


**Liar -** Pfft!  I already did that 3 times before calling you and it didn't work.  I'm not stupid.


Not only are they stupid, but they are now also a liar as the tools I have show me if a device is down for a period of time.   If they had taken the battery out 3 times already I would see 3 instances of the device dropping off the network for about 2-3 minutes.  But I'm not gonna argue, I'm gonna get my way.


**RobotJeff -** Of course you have, but this time the reason I need you to take out your battery is so that I can run a ""spontaneous proximal repair,"" on the server and your device and if it's powered it will interfere with the packet port exchanges.


**Liar -** Uhhh yeah ok that sounds like it would work...I'm taking the battery out now.


I sit on my hands for about 30 seconds.


**RobotJeff -** OK go ahead and put your battery in and power the device on.

**Flying Tech 4: A New Hope**

*It is a period of civil war.*
*A rebel technician, striking from his tiny store, has won his first victory against the evil Worst Purchase.*

*During the battle, our intrepid hero managed to obtain an outdated HDD for his secret weapon - an old firewall, with enough power to protect an entire network.*

*Yelled at by an unskilled technician, he raced back to his store in his car, custodian of the hardware that would eventually bring freedom to his entire career...*

[Check It!](http://starwars.com/play/online-activities/crawl-creator/?cs=rxzdmdcarw)

**Act I: Our Hero Returns...**

I returned to my store with the device cradled in my arms like a newborn child and hand it off to KungFu Manager. ""Many Bothans died to bring you this HDD.""

My manager turned to face me. ""PolloMagnifico... come sit down.""

My heart leapt into my throat. As I have mentioned before, KungFu Manager and I were on pretty friendly terms. Even then, he was still my boss, and I was still his employee. We had an unspoken agreement that, when it was necessary, we would shift back into that relationship, deal with the official business that needed to be dealt with, and shift right back into our friendship with no hurt feelings. I had been ""spoken to"" on several different occasions at the behest of the company owner. It always started out with him asking me to come sit down. This would not be good.

""So, I talked to the boss about your raise...""

So far so good.

""And he said that if you're going to get a raise, then you need to start doing a little more. I talked him into adding you to my contract.""

Wait... what?

""So tomorrow, I want you to show up to at the DreamKiller Offices and help me install this firewall, and meet some of the people.""

This... this is finally happening!

**Act II: FBI's most wanted**

Business slowly began to improve. The store (which was being funded by the parent company) was on the verge of turning a profit for the first time. Many of the new customers were former NerdPatrol customers, who through word of mouth or sheer dumb luck had found their way to our door. I had been given an admin account, some training for exchange and active directory, and a crash course on the network topography for the three DreamKiller offices. I was officially doing helpdesk! And it... was boring.

While yes, technically, I was doing helpdesk now, I was not given enough access to the important things. Things like the PBX server. Or the inventory. Or the firewall. Or really anything except active directory and exchange. So my abilities were basically limited to password resets, account creation, and escalation. Doesn't matter, had tech!

Enter the rich kid. His parent's were doctors. He was probably 18 or 19, and was the poster child for every nerd who still lives with his parents. Quiet, stuttering, lanky, pizza faced. He puts his ""very expensive"" custom made computer up on the desk and tells me he's got a problem. This is the story according to him.

He was spending his day doing the normal manchild computer thing, when he decided he wanted to hack into some low-security systems. He said he does this ""all the time"" but THIS time, he got caught. The FBI hacked him back and installed a virus on his computer, demanding he pay a fine within 48 hours or they would come knocking on his door. Remember this particular story, it's relevant for the entirety of the rest of this recollection.

I inform the kid that no, that's not what happened. I don't even need to boot up the system to know that the FBI would not demand you pay a fine for hacking. They would come to your door and kindly escort you to the nearest holding facility, where you would be given three hots and a cot until someone paid your bail. So I boot up the system, and confirm that the kid does in fact have a virus claiming to be an FBI virus and demanding he pay a fine of *$100*. The virus comes complete with an official FBI watermark, and even has a place ready to input the credit card number.

I tell the kid that I can get the virus off for our usual fee, which is more than the cost of the ""fine"". Kid doesn't want it, he would rather pay the fine! I inform him that it's just a regular virus, and if he puts his credit card in there he's going to wind up with 98 additional problems (and a bitch still won't be one!).

Finally he relents and I remove the virus. When he comes back in the next day, I give him my normal talk about being careful where you go on the internet, this is your new antivirus, and other general safety tips. But when I mention downloads, he dismissively says ""I never download anything"".

Dude. You have complete manga scans downloaded and saved in a file on your desktop. Don't BS me. But whatever. I send him on his way.

**Act III: Again dude? Really?**

Time clicks forward another month. I've settled into my role as helpdesk, and have even learned a few tricks to keep from escalating *everything*. Kid returns with another virus. I clear it off for him, and when I'm done, we have a short discussion about some of the games I saw on his desktop that I had recently been working my way through as well. That leads to this gem.

""Hey, since you've got it, do you know why I can't play **graphics intensive** game at full graphics?""

I hook up the computer, and get into the hardware manager.

I inform him, nicely, that he has a pretty shitty computer and the graphics card isn't very good either. His response is that the computer was ""very expensive and new"" and actually had a pretty good graphics card in it!

Nicely, again, I tell him that my computer at home (which cost me ~700 to build) was at least twice as powerful as his and it still had problems hitting max graphics for this particular game. But but but I have six gigs of memory! Yeah, but you have a dual core processor and a discount graphics card. Seriously, I don't even think they make this anymore. Once again, kid leaves.

**Act IV: The third times the charm**

Now we're getting to the good part. Flash forward another half a month. Things are going quite well now, until this kid walks into my door. I nod to KungFu Manager. ""There's the guy that keeps calling, asking questions that don't make any sense. Why don't you go deal with him?""

KungFu Manager Obliges. I sit outside the door and listen. The first thing the kid says is ""I think someone is hacking me.""

KungFu Manager stammers for a second, and finally responds ""what?""

""I keep getting viruses even though I never download things. I think I'm being targeted by a hacker who keeps putting viruses on my computer!""

KungFu Manager calmly explains to him that it's not extremely likely that he's being targeted by a hacker, as it doesn't fit with a typical hacker MO. But regardless, he would be happy to take a look at it. Oh, and viruses (again). KungFu Manager takes it in, we remove the viruses, and he goes over the firewall looking for open ports and a few other things (he's far better at security than I am) and can't find anything to indicate a problem. While we're doing this, I'm telling him about the previous two times the kid had been in, and how you would think someone who supposedly hacks well enough for the FBI to take notice would know how to keep his system secure. We decide to have a little fun with him.

We hold his computer for a little over a week. When he comes to pick up his system, we look him dead in the eye and say the following:

*""We found some very interesting things on your computer. You had several open ports, and your local DHCP was configured to reroute all of your internet queries to a server in china through a network of proxies. It was very hard to trace, so we called in an FBI computer forensics specialist to help us. He did some digging, and found an extremely sophisticated virus that had infected your BIOS, which is why the format didn't get rid of it. He traced it back to a known server exclusively utilized by the Chinese military for spying on American systems. He believes that you were originally a primary node in a chain of proxies used in a recent attack on the pentagon. Your computer was confiscated as evidence in an ongoing investigation into that particular attack, and he wanted us to thank you for being a good American Citizen.""*

Kid was absolutely devastated. He looked at us like he was about to cry and said ""Really?""

We place his computer on top of the counter.

""No, we didn't find anything wrong with your computer aside from the virus. Here's a list of places that we know are clean to get your manga from instead of using rapidshare. If you're really worried about being hacked, call your ISP and ask them to change your external IP address. Have a nice day.""

""... what's an IP address?""

**Me** - No dramas at all can you just set it down on the counter and I'll hook it up and take a look.

Customer puts the printer down and I plug it in and fire it up. While it's going through it's short start up procedure I run through in my head what it could be.

**Me** - So did the printer display any error messages when it wouldn't print?

**Barry** - I'm not sure. It just doesn't print.

**Me** - Okie dokie then. Normally if something isn't right on a printer it'll give you some information on how best to fix it.

By now the printer has finished powering up and has displayed a message stating that it has a paper jam.

**Me** - Righteo so it's saying it's got a paper jam. If it's got a paper jam it won't print until you remove the jam. I'll sort that for you right now.

I turn the printer around and open up the rear hatch and find half an A4 page stuck in there. I quickly remove it and close the hatch.

The printer then moves the print head around and runs the rollers preparing to go back to it's ready state.

I tell the printer to print out a status report which is does so without an issue.

**Me** - There you go sir. Just a simple paper jam. Nothing too serious.

I then go about unplugging the printer again so that the customer can be on his way.

I go and find the Boss and get him to come back to the Service Counter to see the customer.

**Barry** - I just wanted to speak to you quickly about Limitr's service. It was fantastic. He had my issue sorted out very quickly and was very helpful.

peacefulpete,251,131,1e52g2,623,"So I'll start off by saying I am in no way a professional when it comes to tech help, nor do I work for an IT company so please forgive any lackluster tech definitions. 

My parents recently had dinner with a senior couple in the neighborhood who own a small business in town. They explained over the course of dinner and conversation that a few of their computers at work and home were 'infected' somehow and they were trying desperately to get them fixed because of the sensitive information on the machines. My parents say something to the extent of, ""Hey, our son is a nerd- maybe he can help you?"". 

The next day I find myself going to their place of business and looking at a computer there. The wife meets me at the office and shows me the infected computer. It looks sketchy and seems to have some bad juju on it but after a quick run of Malwarebytes and Combofix is back up and running fine.  

Then, she decided if I can magically fix that one machine I should be able to fix the ones at her house. I follow her back to their house and take a look at two more 'infected' computers. They both exhibit the same problem as the other; connected to the internet but can't browse. I go and look at the internet connection status and see that the machines are both sending and receiving packets so at least I know they're getting something. After almost 30 minutes of messing with internet connection settings I come to the conclusion that nothing is wrong there since both computers are getting the signal (and both wireless) so I start to look at programs that may be blocking internet access. Ah, looks like Norton 360 is installed on both machines... Double click on Norton 360, nothing happens. Try to uninstall Norton 360, nothing happens. I restart both machines and go into Safe Mode with Networking and voila, now I can browse the internet. Go to uninstall Norton 360 but still- nothing. After another frustrating 30 minutes or so I give up and Google for the answer. Turns out you have to download and install Norton Removal Tool to uninstall Norton 360 from your computer. After all that, both of her machines booted up normally and could browse the internet. 

I couldn't help thinking though that if someone didn't know how to boot into safe mode, how would they be able to download the removal tool if Norton 360 was blocking internet browsing???

tl;dr- Norton 360 is a pain in the ass to uninstall. ",One does not just uninstall Norton...,754

GranZero,108,150,1g82ug,629,"Just a little background: I work as a Systems Administrator for a software company that codes a website in a software-as-a-service business model. One would assume that as a software company, users would be tech-savvy and give sysadmins fewer headaches than what other industries in this subreddit show, but you'd be surprised.

We give laptops to our users as their workstations so they can bring their work home or in meetings. Part of our job description is to upgrade workstation laptops after a year or so using their workstations.

This story took place 3-4 years ago, when I was tasked to upgrade this one developer. He was known in our department as a notorious whiner who thinks he is entitled to *everything.* For example, he bypasses our ticketing system claiming that he needs to get things done ASAP and we are *severely* hampering his work. When we do ask for reasonably similar things from him, he takes his time before actually doing it. (Please bring your laptop to the IT office and we can assist you, etc.)

When he did finally arrive for a scheduled backup for his laptop (an hour past his scheduled time too, past working hours already) he was in a rush because he wanted to get home. This was clearly evident while I was explaining the upgrade process to him. For this story, I will refer to him as AssholeDeveloper.

**-AssholeDeveloper hands his laptop to me for backup-**

**AssholeDeveloper:** ""Make sure that none of my files are deleted, [folder X] has to be in the same place, blablabla...""

**GranZero:** ""No problem, those will all be taken care of. (I've been doing this for years, and I've experienced worse experiences) Just something to note though, you will need to sign-in on the services---""

**AssholeDeveloper cuts me off**

**AD:** ""Can we talk about this tomorrow? I need to get home quickly.""

**AD leaves for the day**

It's as if he thinks I live in the office, I grumble.

Part of the upgrade process is cleaning the old workstation, (this one had the most amount of hair from some animal. Maybe a cat.) check for damages, (he spilled coffee a year prior) and check for user belongings in the optical drive, if applicable.

Lo and behold, there was a disc inside his optical drive. Not just any disc, a *porn* disc. Remember what I said earlier about having laptops so users can bring their work home? Well, they also use their workstations for -ehem- questionable reasons.

Fast forward to the next day, I give AD his new upgraded laptop.

**AD:** ""Did you transfer the files I told you? What about my programs? What about [folder X]? Blablabla...""

**GZ:** ""All done, sir. Nothing went wrong in the upgrade process.""

**AD:** ""Good, good. I'll make sure to come back again for problems you caused.""

**GZ:** ""By the way,""

**-hands over the disc covered in a self-made CD sleeve to hide the label-**

**-AD recognizes the disc-**

**AD:** ^Fuck.

**GZ:** ""Please ensure that you don't have your discs in your laptop when you turn them in for an upgrade. Have a good day.""

Needless to say, it was very awkward for both of us --- for him leaving red-faced with embarrassment from our office, and for me trying hard to keep a straight face throughout the whole ordeal. He never pestered us again after the incident.

But one of my projects recently involved releasing a website for employees to access certain things from home.  Of course things like that require a lot of support, since the variety of users and devices is pretty large.  Most users problems were pretty straightforward, but one employee, lets call her Brenda, really broke my brain.

Day One after the release - Brenda sends me an email.  She tried to login, but her ""PC wouldn't accept the website.""  Um, what? I ask her about her browser and OS. She tells me that she doesn't use an Internet Browser, she has her ISP. Double what? I send her the link to her personal email (which she says she can check) and tell her to click it, and if it doesn't work to send me a screen print of what she's seeing.

Day Two: I go see Brenda at her desk, to see how things went.  She hands me two printed pages, one with a list of search results for the site, and another one with a diagnose connection error message, with handwritten notes about what happened when she pushed the repair connections button. I confirm that she was able to get to websites as a general matter,  and retire back to my desk with a promise to figure something out.

Day 3 - I take screenshots of a couple browsers, their icons, and circle where she should be entering the site address, send via email.  She emails be back that she clicks an E, but doesn't have that bar for the address.

Lightbulb. Bingo. Duh.

She's in full screen mode.

Go downstairs to her desk, have her open IE and go to the site that's her home page at home (which she enters into the correct location). Press F11. Ask her, is that what it looks like at home? 

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.

Hello,

I access my &lt;derpco&gt; email through Apple Mail. For about a year now, I've noticed that even though my Mailbox Preferences indicate that deleted messages be stored on the server and that deleted messages ""never"" be permanently erased, I've found that messages are still being deleted. For instance, when I look in my trash, I have about 10 deleted messages from 5/15/13, but only 3 deleted messages from 5/14/13, and no deleted messages on 5/13/13, etc. I have no deleted messages between 4/25/13 and 4/29/13, and none between 4/13/13 and 4/28/13. The oldest message in my trash is from February 2013.

This hasn't been a problem until today, when I discovered that I tried to find an email from a year ago, which I had deleted. (I found the message I sent thanking the person for the attachment, but the message the person sent me with the attachment is gone.)
Do you know how I can fix this problem so it doesn't happen in the future? I contacted Apple, but they said there was nothing they could do, and that I should contact the administrators of the server.
Thanks so much.

thecravenone,129,95,1dtite,622,"After I moved out of the house at 21, my parents would call me for computer fixes every so often. They were (and still are four years later) very good about keeping the number of issues to a minimum.

Because of my troubleshooting mindset, they'd occasionally ask me to come take a look at other less computer-related problems. These tended to be little things like

* The garage door won't open (It had somehow worked its way off its track)

* The fairly expensive sprinkler wasn't working properly (Clogged with hard water)

* Universal remote not working as intended (TV + Stereo + VHS + DVD + DVR = too much going on)

One such occasion arose and he gave me a call. The ice maker in the fridge wasn't working right. More specifically, it was working intermittently. Sometimes it would be broken then work for weeks before going back to its broken state. We arranged a dinner/repair.

That afternoon, I called to confirm I was on my way. Dad was grilling beef tenderloin and had just filled the garage fridge with the local brewery's latest seasonal. It would be a good night.

I finally got to the house, and as soon as my dad hears my truck pull into the drive way, he walks out of the house.

Each one would take less than 10 minutes to sew if my sewing machine was working, but after the first, I spent over an hour trying to figure out why the thread was bunching up on the bottom instead of sewing cleanly. I checked every setting, took it apart as much as I was comfortable, and read the manual cover to cover without finding an answer.

Finally, I gave up and called my grandma to see if I could come over and use her sewing machine to finish the batch of bags I was working on. She ended up helping me troubleshoot the machine over the phone. Even though I was getting tired and cranky, I tried everything she told me to, even rechecking the things I had spent the previous hour on. After all, she's been sewing for at least twice as long as I've been alive, I'd be stupid to not listen to her advice. 

And what do you know, it turns out I had completely missed checking the thread tension on the bottom, and I was only fiddling with the top thread. It was way too loose, and that was causing most of my problems. 

Unfortunately, it was still bunching up in a few places even after I corrected the tension, and since sewing machines only have so many parts, it wasn't long before we exhausted the list of possibilities. My grannie's final suggestion? ""Have you tried turning it off, completely removing the spool and bobbin and rethreading it, then trying it again?""

Reboot my sewing machine? There's no way that could work. Still, I said, ""why not?"", rethreaded it, and... Now it works perfectly.

It made me realize what people like her feel like when we help them with their computers! They're up against a machine they don't fully understand or feel comfortable using, and they don't want to go outside of their comfort zone and poke around in case they break something, but they know something's not working.

Human nature takes over.  I grab my screwdriver.  *poke*.  Ball turns from a ball into a writhing mass of insects.  Ball disintegrates into what seemed like hundreds of little bugs, scattering to cover the circuitry of the motherboard.  Some are zapped when they become the path of least resistance.

I'm waiting for mom to intervene.  No such intervention.  ""I need my game from the CD drive.""  Sure enough, it's GTA3.  Attempt to give the game to mom.  ""It's mine.""  Child snatches it from my hand.  Mom gingerly hands over paperwork and child performs the most insane thing I've ever seen from a pre-pubescent.  I'm literally pausing for emphasis.  Ready?  Seriously... ready?  Child reaches up, grabs mother by the CHIN.  Pulls her down to his level and says, with all of the seriousness of a serial killer:  ""We will not be sending this off.  We will be buying a new one.""  Looks mother dead in the eye.  I mean, just some straight up gangsta sh*t.  Mother calmly waits for child to release her, looks at us, and says:  ""We'll just buy another one.""  Child and mother walk off.  Read that series of sentences again,  I'll wait.  We were all disturbed.  I know my mother would have inserted that GTA CD into my anus had I even attempted something like that, then she would have slapped the teeth out of my mouth and then forced me to eat the PS2.  That was in 2005... I can imagine where that kid is now.  Hopefully in a super-max penitentiary.

**The Chemistry Lesson**

It is a well known fact that waiting for a depot repair sucks.  It takes weeks and half of the time, your item isn't fixed because, well, depot repair guys care more about leaving at 5pm than fixing the things they fix.  So, for some nice customers, we would ensure that the item being sent to the depot was unrepairable.  Cue the DC Generator.  Originally slated for supplying 12v DC to components for testing, it led a double life as an assassin.  Two seconds when connected across capacitors and such led to the release of that acrid magic smoke and the impending disposal of the host product by the depot team, ensuring a replacement unit was in order.  The electrical assassin was also used for fun.  Frying circuit boards was a favored past-time of bored employees.  My co-worker and I were partaking in said activity when we decided to see how badly we could burn out a PCI modem.  After many minutes of frying components and spraying capacitor liquid onto the wall, we employed our second favorite item into the mix... compressed air.  Not 150psi of air... canned air.  When held upside down, a freezing stream of chemical is ejected and can even cause frostbite on bare skin.  It's perfect for cooling down burning components, right?  1/2 a spray can later, and its subsequent sublimation into a gas, we cause a chip to arc and burn in an ember of awesomeness.  The chemical in the canned air reached an ignitable fuel-air mixture.  And did it ever ignite.  WHOMP!  The entire table becomes engulfed in flames, igniting the arms of my co-worker and creating copious amounts of ozone.  Customer on the other end of the department leans across the counter to enjoy the festivities.  Co-worker runs around the bench with flaming arm hair.  I could only imagine ""Danger, Will Ronbinson!"" as he robotically attempted to wave off the fire.  Entire department smells like burnt hair and spent chemicals.  In the ultimate act of cowardice, I conveniently notice that it's time for me to clock out and I disappear from the premises, knowing that I was probably going to get fired.  I didn't, and the accident became legend.  8 years later, I still catch crap for my ""exit stage right"" maneuver from my buddy/victim.  ",My Classics: Part Deux,752

Male caller: Hello?

**Me: Hello!**

Male caller: Yes hello. My name is xyz and I'm calling from Microsoft. We have noticed your computer is infected with a lot of viruses.

**Me:  Really? Which one?**

Male caller: Your Windows computer.

**Me: Yes, I have 6 computers in the house that run Windows. Which one?**

Male caller: No, no, your Windows PC.

**Me: Well as I just said, I have 6 computers in the house that run Windows. What is the computer name? Or IP address?**

Male caller: It does not matter. If you can please go to your Windows computer I can show you the infections from the viruses.

**Me: Ok. I don't believe you by the way. My antivirus is up to date and I also have anti-malware software.**

(Silence)

Male caller: Hello?

**Me: Yes I am here.**

(More silence.)

Male caller: Hello?

**Me: I'm still here. I am waiting for you to speak.**

Male caller: Oh ok. Well can you please go to your computer?

**Me: I'm already there.**

Male caller: Ok now turn it on.

**Me: It is on already.**

Male caller: What can you see on the screen?

**Me: The desktop.**

Male caller: Ok I just need to get my supervisor to take the call from here as the next part is technical. Can I place you on hold?

**Me: Ok.**

(Sound of the phone being put down. No hold music. Muted conversation in the background.)
Female Supervisor: Hello?

**Me: Hello.**

Supervisor: So you are sitting in front of the infected computer?

**Me: I'm sitting in front of a computer which I believe to be in perfect harmony.**

Supervisor: Ok do you see the keyboard?

**Me: Yes.**

Supervisor: Ok, down on the bottom row of the keyboard and to the left there is a key that's got a circle on it with the windows logo on it? Do you see it?

**Me: Yes. The Windows key.**

Supervisor: Ok press that key, but keep holding it down and also press the ""r"" key at the same time, then let go.

**Me: You want me to initiate the run command.**

Supervisor: Yes that is correct.

**Me: Ok, I've done that.**

Supervisor: Ok so now please type the following. E for everyone, v for victoria, e for everyone, n for november, t for tomorrow...

**Me: You want me to open the Event Viewer?**

Supervisor: Yes that is right. Please open the Event Viewer.

**Me: It's open.**

Supervisor: Ok what do you see.

**Me: I see the Event Viewer.**

Supervisor: Can you read what's on the screen for me?

**Me: There is a lot on the screen. A few different panes and a lot of words.**

Supervisor: Ok but what is there.

**Me: Well where do you want me to start. As I said there is a lot on the screen.**

Supervisor: On the left hand side.

**Me: Ok, but at this point, shouldn't you know what you want me to click on?**

Supervisor: I don't understand.

**Me: I mean, you are the ones calling me, purporting to be computer experts, and you mean to say that you can't tell me what to click on next?**

Supervisor: I think you are lying to me and that you are not really at your computer.

**Me: I am at the computer.**

Supervisor: No you're not. If you were you could tell me what is on the screen. You are lying.

**Me: No I'm not. I swear on my mother's soul that I'm in front of my computer.**

Supervisor: No I think you are lying. Why else could you not tell me what is on the screen?

**Me: No I really am. Listen, here's the keyboard.**

(Put phone near keyboard, hit space several times)

**Me: Hear that?**

Supervisor: Well then why can't you just tell me what is on the screen?

**Me: As I said before, you have called me purporting to be computer experts to diagnose and fix a problem with my computer. You should be able to direct me where to click. You must be able to tell by now I know a thing or 2 about computers. What if I was a total novice?**

(5 seconds silence)

Supervisor: Ok double click on Windows logs on the left side.

**Me: There we go. I can see that so I will click it. That wasn't hard and now you have restored my faith in you.**

Supervisor: Ok so now what do you see?

**Me: I have 5 options in the sub-tree.**

Supervisor: What are they?

**Me: Application, Security, Setup, System and Forwarded Events**

Supervisor: Double click on Application

**Me: Ok the logs have populated in the main frame.**

Supervisor: Ok so you should be able to see lots of entries there. Most of them will say ""Information""

**Me: That is right. all on the screen in fact say information.**

Supervisor: You may need to scroll down. Tell me if you see anything else.

**Me: Ok, I can see some saying ""Error"" and some saying ""Warning""**

Supervisor: Ok so those are the infections.

**Me: No they're not.**

Supervisor: Yes they are.

**Me: Nnnnnnnno, They're not.**

Supervisor: Ok well what are they then?

**Me: Well for example, one of the ""Errors"" is from last night when a game I was playing (Skyrim) crashed.**

Supervisor: That is because of a virus.

**Me: No it isn't. The program crashed. It is a known issue that is affecting thousands of people with this game and the company that make it are making a patch for this and other known issues as we speak.**

Supervisor: Well what about one of the ""Warnings""

**Me: Ok, well the first warning here is an advice that my Samsung software's update service could not be restarted. Also not a virus.**

Supervisor: But you don't know. All of these could be viruses.

**Me: Thay're not. As I said to your colleague, I have up to date antivirus software and anti-malware software. But even ignoring that knowing that new viruses are always being made, I know what the Event Viewer is and how it works and you won't scare me saying all these ""Errors"" and ""Warnings"" are viruses and infections. Because they're not. They're normal things like program crashes and notifications that things didn't quite go as expected, and they get logged so that if you need to investigate further, you can.**

Supervisor: That's not true, you don't know anything.

**Me: I do. In fact I work in IT. I have built and maintained my own and friends and family members' PCs for over 15 years. I've installed and troubleshooted operating systems as far back as DOS, most Windows versions over the years and Linux as well. Where I work, people call me for technical support for their PCs.**

Supervisor: But you're not a Microsoft Certified Engineer.

**Me: I am** 

(I lied. The only lie of the phone call but I was having too much fun at this stage.)

Supervisor: Well then why are you talking to us.

**Me: You called me! I know all about the Event Viewer scam. It even happened to my best friend's wife recently and as soon as your colleague said he was from Microsoft I knew what was going on and I wanted to see how you operated. I must admit I'm pretty unimpressed.**

Supervisor: Well why didn't you end the call?

**Me: I was having too much fun. It's my birthday today and you guys have just made my day.**

Supervisor: Well then why don't you just hang up then?

**Me: I think I just might. It's been a blast. BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!**

TL;DR - Scammers called me trying to subscribe me to their service or whatever. I had some fun instead.",A fun conversation I had today with scammers,709
munky9001,136,165,yh2r4,615,"I goto a customer's site because their tape drive is basically pooched. I took this server down and basically I'm checking bios and post bios ctrl+c type windows. Stupid ibm servers take a billion years to boot up and then only give you 1.3 seconds to press any of these buttons. Naturally I need to hit these immediately. 

Now this building has 2 businesses and they are both customers. The customer which I wasn't there for comes to me in the server room and is like, 'I have a problem come fix it.' I'm ask what's the problem. She says 'Wifi is down' and I pull out my phone and I have even connected to their wifi... I surf to google. Wifi is definitely up. So I ask who is having problems? She says, 'no one its the laptop that nobody uses that cant get on wifi.' I'm sure she saw me roll my eyes but i say, 'Well this server is down so at least 3 people aren't working at the moment and I need to get it back up running.' Then she's like, 'This is very important and I think it's your fault it's down.' I say, 'Well I can't drop what I'm doing right now but soon as I can' She's says, 'So you're not going to fix it now?' and I just say no. Which she storms off and clearly is extremely mad. 

Other customer walks over to me and says, 'You know she's going to just call your boss immediately' and I nodded. That person then immediately sends an email to my boss explaining what happened which was extremely thorough. Like 10 mins later I got to a point where I could walk away for a moment. I hook this laptop up to the wifi and that was that and I go back to checking out the server. Like half an hour later I'm done the server and I'm just standing in the lobby talking. This woman comes back downstairs and sees im just standing around. She gets even more mad and starts chewing me out and I just raise my hand like stop and she stops and I say I already joined the laptop to the wifi and the problem is fixed. She then gestures to have me walk away with her and I follow to where nobody is around to hear us. She says, ""I understand that a server is down but those people don't matter; I'm more important and should get highest priority. However you see what happened there right? I called your boss and you immediately fixed my problem, that's way it should be.'

In reality she called my boss and he didn't answer his phone because he saw caller id... and she kept calling over and over and eventually went to my desktop support guy who basically was told that wifi was down and he said we wouldn't be able to fix it until we got over there anyway so she just has to wait until he can get someone on site. He didn't know where I was. She's like, ""Tell munky9001 to go fix it immediately"" and he just said, 'I don't know where he is' and she hung up on him.

My boss didn't even need our sides of the story; he just read the email from another customer and gave her a call to 'set expectations' and apparently she broke out crying again.",Those people don't matter. I'm more important.,780
Hypnotoad2966,115,114,1m1gqq,618,"A couple weeks ago I set up a new scanner for one of our Customer Service reps.  She had paperwork from the client that asked for 300dpi, so I set it to scan to that.  She was also scanning small cards, so I set it to just scan the card, and ignore the whitespace around the card.

Flash forward to last Friday.  She had asked me several times as I was walking to another support case how she could send the 56% version to the client instead of the 212% version, or how she could send the actual size to the client.  

When I stopped down there she showed me the scan she wanted to send.  It scanned into adobe acrobat, and then zoomed in on the file to fit it to the screen.  She went up to the zoom settings, typed in 56% and then saved the file, but when she reopened it it still zoomed in to 212%.  

I spent at least 15 minutes trying to explain to her that this setting was zoom, and it only affected how the file was displayed on her monitor, not the actual file.  I even pulled out a magnifying glass and held it up to a card on her desk and told her this is how we're looking at the file now, but it's not changing the actual file.  It didn't stick, she kept asking me how she could send the 56% version to the client.  I even pulled up some of her old scans, showed her how the computer had zoomed way out on those (because they had a bunch of whitespace around the image) but shown at ""actual size"" the cards were the same size as her new scans.

She seemed to finally accept that this was the way she was going to have to send the images, but I could tell that she didn't understand it at all.  This is the same lady who keeps bringing me in stuff that she found at home, and even on the street thinking it might be useful to me.",How do I send the 56% version?,732

They simply shipped them as is to us to see what we can salvage. When opened, they were just a wall of mud and test equipment poured out, with chunky computer systems sprinkled through the flow.

I call a halt and go to work. I build a cleaning station of grounded pads, grounded grate work surfaces, and a grounded water nozzle, all using a common ground point to equalize potential. Next to it is a similarly grounded brand new automotive parts washer filled with technician grade alcohol to prevent water residue.

Every machine is set on the grid, opened, and gently hosed out. Once clean, it is transferred to the alcohol rinse, then set to dry.

All of the test equipment (Oscopes, multimeters, etc) came through fine, and passed recalibration afterward.
Most of the computers, minus hard drives, survived as well. We lost maybe 10% of them. I forget total cost of equipment, but definitely 8 digits.

Later in life he is the sort to customise away the file system while messing with it and even after he has bricked his computer still gush about how good it is to be able to do that.

itssilvernotgray,128,149,1fsb45,608,"Several years back, around 2007, when I had my shop in another state, I had a client that brought me her computer (One of the old dell clam style desktops that opened like the hood of a car) saying that it ""won't turn on"".  When she stepped through the door there were several odors that hit me.  One of these was the unmistakable scent of roaches.  That was coming from the computer.  The other odor(s) were similar to garlic and parmesan cheese but nothing you'd want to put in your mouth.

She was wearing a yellow T-shirt, Nascar flannel pants (I'm not making this up), and bedroom slippers.

I put her computer on the workbench and before I even opened it I saw literally DOZENS of pairs of antenna protruding from the honeycomb metal on the back of the computer.  The area around the VGA ports &amp; USB's were caked with dark brown roach shit.

I opened the case anyway and it looked like I had taken the top cover off of a honeybee hive, only roaches.  Scores of them.

I know IMMEDIATELY that this PC is going in a BAG.  But I didn't have any bags.

I say ""Hey Carol (name changed),  I've got to run on a service call real quick, how about I do that and just call you when I've checked it out?"".  She replies something which I don't remember and leaves.

I move the computer as carefully as I can without disturbing the residents within because I do NOT want them in my shop.  In retrospect I should have immediately taken it outside.  I make no claim to being extraordinarily bright.  Instead, I set it (still opened) on a cardboard box about 6"" high.  In my haste I forgot my phone, and when I turned back around to get it I cracked the lower part of my shin against the case sending it careening onto the hardwood floor.

Imagine taking a cup half full of water, tilting it at an angle, and smacking it on the floor.  What would have happened with the water, instead happened with a handful of now startled roaches that scattered in all directions seeking a hiding spot.

I headed for the nearest WM to procure spray and bombs.  When I returned, they were everywhere.  I lock everything down, bomb the hell out of it and go home.

Most of the next morning was spent in cleaning up the aftermath.  Then, she arrives, still wearing the same clothes.  I didn't really want to show her the carnage because I was embarrassed FOR her.  But I did, with surprise results.  She says ""WOACHES?!?!?!  I DON'T HAVE WOACHES IN MY TWAILEW!!!  YOU MUST HAVE WOACHES IN HEWE AND THEY GOT IN MY COMPUTA FROM BEING IN HEWE"".  WTF?!?!?!?!  In defiance of that, I take the side panels off of two other desktops showing (surprisingly) an absence of infestation.  I tell her I can't/won't fix it because it's done.

She wants to know if I have another one I can sell her, I do, just give me a day or two to get it ready.  Ok.  Two days later she comes back IN THE SAME CLOTHES to pick it up.  I boot it up and show her everything is working and she leaves with it.

The next day the phone rings.  It's her. ""THAT COMPUTA YOU SOLE ME STOPPED WUKING"", well, bring it in then.

She brings it in and guess what?  The power supply is FULL of ~~WOACHES~~ ROACHES.

She denies it, can't believe it.  ""I BOUGHT SOME SPWAY AND SPWAYED, IT CAN'T BE WOACHES"".  I don my gloves and take the power supply apart, take it outside on the sidewalk and SLAM it on the concrete.  When I remove it there are no less than a dozen of all sizes, some alive, some dead, some twitching.  She yells at me ""GIMME BACK MY COMPUTA IM GOING TO TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TOO MANY WOACHES IN YOU PLACE"".  I comply, graciously.

Me: Good morning how can I help you today?


Lady on phone: Umm, yes I've been contracted by CustomerX to do a new website for them and I need you guys to transfer their DNS to xxx.templatewebsitehost.com


Me: oh wow, ok...well we currently host their website and we have a full panel with hosting access.  You can pretty much do anything you want inside their account.  It would be far easier if you just used their existing account.  If you'd like I can set you up a user/pass for their panel.


Contractor:  (annoyed)  No thank you.  I use lots of complex things on my sites that require specific settings.  I need them moved.


Me: Ok, well we also host their email and several CNAME headers in their DNS for ease of use (such as mail, office, VPN..etc) so it would be easier for them if I just changed my A record to point to your host.  Is your host a shared host or a dedicated IP host.


Contractor: (30 secs of silence)  I'm not sure what that means.


Me: **Realizing that this whole process was about to go horribly wrong** Ma'am let me get your number and I'll give you a call right back.  I need to check some settings here on my end.


Me:  (I call the customer explain the situation, they are adamant that I do whatever she needs done to get their new site up and running)


I make the change to the nameservers to point them at ns1.templatehostingservice.com and almost instantly all email and vpn goes down.


Contractor calls back, I determine that she's a stay at home mom using some wordpress template site with pre-installed modules.  The sites look like crap and cost 15 bucks a month.  She's charging customer several thousands of dollars to do the new ""site"" for them.  Making a nice little paycheck as a home business.  (My panel does wordpress)


Almost in tears Contractor:  CustomerX just called me and said their email is down, said they would sue me for lost revenue.  I don't know what to do please help me.


Me: -sigh- Ok fine...(i get the admin acct login and fix the dns, all services return to normal)

Management talked to me extensively before doing this; they really were good folks there, and wanted to be sure I was 'ready' to have to deal with this guy on a regular basis, and be able to fully document everything well.  I assured them that first, I didn't care if I supported 1 user or thousands so long as you kept paying me, and second that he wouldn't bother me much.

The day they gave him my extension saw me get a few 'Phil' calls, ""just to make sure it works"" type of thing.  Yep, we do know what we're doing; the company had it's fingers into multiple telecom products ranging from phones to cellphones to internet at the time, and all were managed and setup very, very well.

When I got to work the next day, though, was rather humerous.  I logged into the phone system, and the little red light for voicemail started blinking.  Normally, it blinks once for each message left, then goes solid for 10 seconds, etc.  It just kept blinking.  I smirked, and dove in.

35 messages; 32 of which were from Phil.  I start going through them, and each and every one is him just ranting about various unrelated, silly things; web design questions, problems with his keyboard, phone problems, problems with his *desk chair*, everything and anything.

I carefully, and meticulously made a brand new ticket on his support account for each and every one of these calls.  Then, I'd make an addendum to any repeats.

Apparently, ""Phil, if you have problems with your Internet service, call this number"" had mutated to ""Phil, if you have problems with your bunions, call this number"" inside his little mind.  I've been off-phones for the first hour of work now because of this; I laughed, they're paying me to babysit, why would it bother me?

So, I go through the usual 'check our side' work that I noted in the last call.  Everything's still golden (of course).  I make an outbound ticket, fill in refs to all the other tickets I'd made and closed, copy and paste all the terminal output of the tests I'd done, and make the call.

Me: Greetings, this is SilentDis from XYZ, is Phil available?  
Phil: It took you long enough to call, I have all these problems are any of them fixed yet?  
Me: Hello Phil.  Do you have time to discuss the voicemails you left this morning?  
Phil: It better be quick, I have work to do!  
Me: Oh, it will be quick, I assure you.

I proceed to list each and every issue he called us about off to him, and asked if each is correct.  Verbal contract established across 32 calls and 10 issues.

Me: Now, as we have discussed before, we are here to help you with your Internet service.  We help get you online, we help make sure you can browse webpages, we help make sure you can get your e-mail from our servers, and we make sure your hosting is working.  
Phil:  Yes...  
Me: I've already verified that everything concerning that works on our side, and will e-mail those results to you, as well as the details from this call.  Are you able to browse webpages?  Are you able to get e-mail?  
Phil: Yes, but this is...  
Me: No, Phil, this is not a 'general life support' line.  Nothing has changed regarding that; we still only help with the same things, just now I'm the only one you'll be dealing with concerning them.  Do you understand?  
Phil: (sounding a bit deflated) Yes.  
Me: Good.  As soon as I close this ticket, I'll e-mail you this ticket log as a reminder of what we can help you with, and it can act as a 'receipt', if you want, for all the calls you made.  Again, Internet connectivity, your website, and e-mail are what we help with.  Do you have any questions regarding those things now?  
Phil: (yeah, that's defeat in his voice) No.  
Me: Good, thank you for using XYZ.

I finished up the (mostly done) ticket.  It formats fairly well right out of the box, I found, from the ticketing system; a few minor changes here and there, but nothing major.  It lists each ticket number that was 'referenced', the title, and the close reason (Unsupported for each, of course), the start and end times.  Then it lists all my notes.  This gets sent to Phil, as well as BCC'd to my supervisor.

Phil didn't call me again that day...  [But it gets better](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/w62i0/phil_33_13_the_final_insult/).

a7h13f,111,162,vz7ep,611,"So this story is a bit dated now, but I was a 16-year old with my first job in tech support back in 2002 with a small local ISP.

My job mainly consisted of doing whatever the hell I was told, for a very small check, which was fine with me!  All my friends were working at grocery stores.

Anyways, I'm on the phones one day when an elderly lady calls in with a computer problem and I give her my standard speech, ""Thanks for calling Yada Yada, my name's [name], how can I help you.""

She informs me that her computer is 'being slow'.

I tell her that she'll need to bring it in, that there's not much troubleshooting I can do over the phone.  (This was pretty much my mandated go-to line for non-Internet related support.  We didn't make money unless they brought the PC in.)

I proceed to start asking her a few questions so she has less paperwork to fill out when she brings it in.

""Alright, ma'am, what operating system do you have on your computer?""

*silence*

""Windows XP?  Windows 98?"" 

""Oh!  Windows 97, I think...""

""...alrighty, well when you bring it in, I've got all your paperwork filled out, so you'll just have to sign and...""

""What does that mean, anyway, Windows?""

""Well, that's the brand of your operating system.  It's the software that..""

""Ok, I'll try that first!""

""Try what exactly, ma'aam?""

""You know, moving it near a window.  Maybe the fresh air will speed it up. Bye!""

Chizzoink,141,132,1865z5,612,"If this is too long and boring, please tell me how I can fix it. It's my first post here, so be gentle (which I know you all are :)

I just recently (past few weeks) got a job at a small tech support place near where I go to school. It's not much, but it's a permanent thing (I've just had summer work at my old school district) with a little room to move up. I've seen more weird crap that people do to their computers than I've ever encountered in the rest of my life, and I've been into computers for a long time. I'm excited to share my first clueless moment of this job!

Okay. So this guy bought the computer from somebody. It's a custom-built machine with an Athlon tri-core and a GTX 280. It's pretty much a gaming machine. He says that he saw it boot at the guy's house, and when he brought it home, it wouldn't boot. (When I got into it, I noticed that it also had power plugged into both the SATA and Molex connections on the HDD, so somebody didn't quite know what they were doing along the line)

I say that I can take a look at it and get back to him after I run some diagnostics and such. He's perfectly okay with that, so I take the machine, write up a receipt, and take the computer. He seems kind of antsy and asks if he'll get an update that night. I say maybe, but it'll most likely be tomorrow, since we have a certain procedure for progressing through work.

I set it up and have one helluva time getting it to boot into a disc. First, both of the optical drives inside are completely disconnected. So, I proceed to plug in an external one. It doesn't boot to anything. Just a blinking cursor. No nothing.

After some clever work, I finally get in, run diagnostics, and everything checks out just fine and dandy. I continue investigating.

So I finally get into the BIOS after googling the key to do so (seriously, MSI? What the fuck kind of BIOS key sequence is Tab+Del? And you don't even tell me this on the splash screen? And you need a PS/2 keyboard because the USB ones aren't recognized? Really?), I switch the boot order so that the main HDD is above 2.2TB Infinity and it boots right up. Nice clean install of Windows 7 with no malware or anything in sight.

I'm all like ""sweet!"" and send it right over to the call center, where they quote him out the minimum charge to fix it. Now, I'm not privvy to what goes on in those conversations, but he declines the work. My guess is that it would be too expensive. Per policy, I've gotta get it back to the state that it was in when the customer brought it in, since they didn't pay anything. So I just swap the boot order back to how it was before and *poof*, we're back to the cursor and no Windows. I put it out front to wait for a return appointment.

You'd think declining to pay anything would mean that nothing would be fixed.

You'd think that declining to have work done would mean that no work would be done.

Apparently not this guy.

He comes back in acting thankful and such as if we had actually fixed it. I make it crystal clear that I'm sorry he declined work and we didn't fix it. I never got close to saying anything like we had fixed it.

He just kinda says okay and stuff, still giving off the impression that we fixed it and starts walking out the door. I stop him to give him a receipt and such. I print off two copies the receipt, one for him and one for us. He signs the one for us, and takes his. It says on the receipt that he declined work and no work was done.

And even though it's not what we're supposed to do, I tell him off the record that he just has to swap those two settings in the BIOS. He tells me that he's not a tech-savvy guy, so I just explain a few quick steps, and he nods and says okay like he understands. He leaves.

But then he calls back. He's all in a tizzy because his computer has the same problem as before. He complains that we didn't fix it. 

[Wat?](http://i.imgur.com/9R0Ae.gif)

No shit sherlock. You didn't pay anything to fix it. You declined to have us fix it.

Now another appointment is scheduled tomorrow so I can tell him that we didn't fix it because he didn't want to pay to have us fix it. We'll see how that goes.

TL;DR: Customer doesn't understand that declining work = no work.

ingodan,113,224,z7srp,609,"In my country a lot of people are obnoxious to tech support over the phone. I'm not sure if it's the same level as elsewhere but I can give you a quick example. After a week in training, my first ever support call was coincidentally my first ever death threat. I was of course in shock but I kept on working there for 3 years and when you receive them on average about once a month, you really get used to ignoring them.


This particular story happened around 2005. I had been working as a tech support for about 18 months.

Plonkerby,196,180,uvu0r,608,"Update! 

There is now an update - head over here to read it. [Infinite Backups Update!](http://redd.it/v1dqp)

This just happened in my company...

The big guys at the top finally decided to start doing backups. We have to keep records of transactions for two years - but for some reason, actually dedicating some money to a real backup system was too much of a pain. Someone hadn't ""backed up"" to a CD (and promptly deleted from anywhere else) when their HDD died, losing about three months of their data. A customer complained about never receiving a delivery, but we had no record if it now so had to just take the customer's word for it. This managed to scare the top enough that they let the IT guy finally put in a system solely for back up.

I don't know the details of it (not my department), but he set it up so that we all have our own folders, and now we run a program at the end of each day to copy our vital data over into our network folders where it is backed up. (Edited for clarification - the server runs a RAID, but the server is not the only backup. It is the first level of backup. The data there is backed up offsite after a week. It is just a dedicated online,  onsite server storing the most recent daily backups.)
It was all working great for the past two months. We already run something to close the day, so it has been totally painless. We have backups of our active data that we can access, and daily backups of everyone's data are compressed and saved. Our IT guy is great and I commend him for setting this thing up over just a couple days.

Anyway, there is someone who I will just call E. He knows just enough to be a huge pain. He thinks he knows a LOT more. He goes on and on about how he thinks Unix is the greatest, Linux is for lazy losers, and that he has (gasp) actually installed it a couple times. He knows he would do a much better job than the IT guy, but he is too ""important"" to waste his time on that. Luckily, the guys at the top don't let him mess with the IT stuff. (To give him credit, he is good at his actual job, so is not just an irritating waste of space.)

On Thursday, E decides that he has come up with a better plan for the backups. Or at least for his backup. He sets up something that checks his computer for modified files and backs them up to his network folder every ten minutes. His entire machine, not just his vital data. In no time he fills his space quota with swap files and cache backups.

This should have ended there. His space was full. But no...
He goes to one of the bosses. Says he has some trouble with his network folder, but knows exactly how to fix it so doesn't want to bother the IT guy who is out. He just needs to ""borrow"" the root login for a bit. The boss (stupidly) gives him the login info - after all, E seems to know what he is talking about. What could happen?

E sets it up to make just backup wherever (to get around the space limit for individuals) and then sets it up so that the root of the backup server is one of his network drives. It is now included in his every-ten-minute backup list. He changes a bunch of other settings so that it ""works better"" and then goes on with his day.

At the end of the day, we close the day... and get an error. The backup server has no free space. All 12TB have been filled. (Our daily backups for the entire company are about 1GB before compression, to give you an idea of how impossible this would be under normal circumstances.) 

E had been backing up the backups, which were ""new"" files, and those backups were also backed up, until the entire server was filled. E saw that there was no more space before everyone else - so what did he do? He set it up to just delete files based on date, starting with the oldest. Not just the backups - from anywhere on the server. He didn't have any trouble - closed his day, and then headed home (about half an hour early, for some reason.)

Nothing was actually lost in the end, but we had to stay late until we could figure out what was wrong. 

We are still waiting to see what will happen to E. He has only come in to meet with the bosses and the IT guy. 

TL:DR - Server starts to make copies of itself, which overrun our building demanding blood sacrifices to quell their thirst.

DerManiac,189,151,11iqsw,610,"I'm a java dev and systems administrator at a small research lab that's part of a Medical University. We just recently published a software tool and one of the first users was an Assistent Professor from another Institute in the same City.

He is semi computer literate. I mean, he's no techy, but he's doing fine. Still, he had some issues with our Software. We usually only provide support via our User Forums and by E-Mail, but in this case my Boss asked me to help him personally.  

One day he asked me to come to his office for some simple task. When I arrived he was just in the middle of a phone call with a representative of a Software company. He told me she was doing a live demo of a software similar to ours. I was interested, because it's always good to see what others are doing and so I sticked around.

This is what happened:

Her: ""Ok, now you can click here to load the inputfiles."" *opens a 6GB text file* ""You can see the progress here.""    
Him: ""That takes quite a long time to load..""    
Her: ""Yes, that is strange.. May I ask what kind of Computer you have?""    
Him: ""It has 16GB of RAM and an 8 core processor.""

Now, I have to say I saw the specs before, and this was one monster of a desktop machine. 16GB of RAM, Intel Xeon 8 core (with hyperthreading) with I think around 2.4 GHz each).

Her: *pulling up the system information* ""Oh I see you have an 8 core processor.""    
Him: ""Is that not good?""    
Her: ""Yeah, you know the problem is that with the 8 cores the GHz are actually **split between the cores.**""     
*sound of my jaw springing open*

Her: ""You see, you have 2.4GHz split in 8. That means it's actually just 300MHz. Modern PCs nowadays all have more than 2GHz! You should get a new PC.""

He looked at me and saw me facepalming really hard. I shook my head to symbolize that he shouldn't believe her. 

She then tried to start multiple worker processes for the software. The GUI would then connect to the worker process over the network - or the loopback interface in our case. Perfect for compute clusters. Anyways, after about 10 minutes of her reading instructions on how to set this up (instructions that he also had on the screen and I could read), she came to the part where she had to enter his PC's IP address. Up to this point I was quiet, but now I was about to lose my patience.

Me (to the Professor): ""Just enter 127.0.0.1""    
Him (to her): ""My colleague here told me I can just enter 127.0.0.1""    
Her: ""No, no we have to find the IP address!""    
Me: ""127.0.0.1 works too!""     
Him: ""Are you sure?""    
Me: ""Trust me.""       
Her (to him): ""Is your computer in a network""    
Me (thinking): ""You are remoted in on it.. what do you think?!""    
Him: ""Yes, it is in a network.""    
Her: ""Then it must have a different IP address. **127.0.0.1 is a default IP Address that only computers that are not in a network use.**""

I gave up there. Just facepalmed again and let her do her thing. Worst of all was that when she found and entered the correct IP address she was all proud ""You see? This is the correct address! The other one is not correct if you are in a network!"". She later ended the call again emphasizing how important it was for him to buy a stronger PC.

He never bought their software, btw. It was crap anyways. It was pretty cool for the user interface, but it only worked with obsolete algorithms and reference data.","""Your Intel Xeon quad core processor is too weak for our software""",761

A little background info, I work for a company that mainly hosts minecraft servers. Guess who wants to own their own minecraft server? 9 year old kids. Every time something goes down, or their server crashes due to user error, they seem to blame it on a DDOS attack. Why? No clue.


At about 3 am one morning, I received a ticket from a particular client who we've had a numerous amount of problems with. The conversation went a little something like this..



**Him**: My server crashed no plugins work someone is ddosing my server change my ip plzzzz.



**Me**: Hello ServerOwner! I'll be glad to take a look at that for you. None of our nodes are currently under a DDOS attack. It appears your server is crashing upon startup, due to you trying to run 32 plugins on our smallest memory plan. (For those who are not familiar with bukkit, bukkit is a mod for minecraft that allows plugins to run. Bukkit uses about 1GB of ram without any plugins, and uses anywhere from 100-200 more MB for each plugin installed. Not to mention the 100MB of memory that each player takes up when joining the server. He had a package that **only** had 512 MB of ram.) I highly suggest you upgrade to a higher memory plan if you wish to keep running these many plugins.



**Him**: fuck shit damn ass bitches (he used just about every cuss word he knew of) this worked yesterday I swear fix it plz or i will cancel i know someone trying to hack me



I pulled up the server log, turns out that the server has been crashing from a java out of memory error since about 3 hours after he bought the server with us. Meaning that it worked until he installed 30 plugins and tried to start it up. ***Facedesk***



**Me**: (getting annoyed) It is not a ddos attack, the error I am getting is a java out of memory error. What that means is your server does not have enough memory (ram) to start up. Your server is trying to use well over 1.5GB of ram, and your plan only allows 512mb.



**Him**: why are you lying? This is not my fault fix it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



**Me**: Mr.ServerOwner, I will be forced to suspend your account if you do not remove excessive plugins as you are causing unnecessary strain on the node, causing other clients services to lag. 



**Him**: fuck you you dont know what your talking about i know more than you i should have your job.

The first was a woman who wanted to know why her computer wouldn't boot up.  My company did free diagnostics, so I had her leave it and checked it all out.  The HDD was spinning up, clicking, and then stopping altogether.  Told her it would need a new one.  Cost of the part, backing up her data, and formatting the new one would be $219.99, or we could forgo the data backup and be $199.99

Her response?

""My cousin will do it for $50 and a case of bud light!""

I told her to take it to her cousin.  A month later she comes back claiming he said it wasn't her HDD gone back, that her motherboard was dead because he replaced the HDD and it still didn't work.  I opened it up.  She had a SATA HDD sitting in there.  Nowhere for it to go though since this was an old 2004 PC with IDE only.  The cables were literally just sitting there plugged into the HDD and nothing else.  After laughing I explained to her that her cousin ripped her off and it would be $200 to fix it still.

I work at a computer repair shop owned by an awesome family. Well... one day this umm.. fellow... came in asking if we could fix the 'mouse thing' on a laptop. Well whats wrong with it, we inquire. Now picture the man please. He's wearing nice clothes, but he's got that Dallas Dance going on... He just cant stand still, swaying back and forth like he's intoxicated although you can tell he is not... He's just all over the place. Fast talker, too. He says 'Well see, yo. It had some syrupy substance spilled on it, see. A syrupy substance.'

Alright man. At this point I've decided the man blasted his butter or something on the computer and screwed up the touch pad. So he brings it in and sure enough there's weird resistance in the button presses, something sticky under it. Buttons do not work, but the top of the touchpad is spotless. Everything that was spilled was wiped off, but it made it inside.

So we check the computer in, it's a Toshiba if I remember correctly... and check it out. This model happens to be one where there isnt a touchpad daughter-board per se, the switches themselves are on the motherboard. Cool. So I take the computer apart, find some donor buttons the same size, and prep my soldering station.

I use alcohol and a toothbrush to clean off any residue from around the buttons, and take the iron to it for removal. At this point, smoke billows up from the button right into my face and it smells like... Marsh mellows or something. Kind of sweet I guess. I step back and take a breath and .... aw shit. I know this feeling from somewhere (don't ask, that's a different story.)

My head feels like its 5 ft above my body. My heart is pounding in the back of my neck. My vision is kind of in and out of focus. My skin feels like it's crawling... I'm high.

I step outside where my bosses are sitting smoking cigarettes and I tell one of them that we probably should've asked the guy what substance was spilled on the computer. The bosslady asks why (we've already discussed the different nasty things it could be that he was too ashamed to admit), and I kind of hint at the possibility of narcotics or poison or something, and we should know what we're dealing with. At this point, I'm not telling my boss 'I think I'm high on crack right now, can I go home or somethin?' I was addicted to cocaine (and it escalated) when I was younger, and I really wasn't happy with my feels at this point. I actually work near some police officers, one of them being a narcotics officer. I went down to their store and spoke with him about what's going on, and he went out to his truck. He returned a few moments later with a testing kit. Came into the store, took a sample of the substance you see here on the touchpad, and sure enough. 'Yeah John. That's cocaine. It's heavily diluted, but it's definitely got cocaine in it.' When I questioned him about the smell it had (You dont forget what crack smells like, and this was different) he said that he's seen cases where instead of baking soda, baby formula was used to cut/cook the stuff.

And so there you have it... I smoked crack cocaine at work, unintentionally of course. Now we have a charcoal filter for the soldering station.

So when the customer came back in, I had to ask... 'So uhh... What was the syrupy substance you spilled on the laptop?' Of course we all already knew what it was, and his information had been passed along to the PD, but regardless... his reply? 'Oh That? That was my sista, she done went off and spilt some sweet potato pie in my lappytop.'",Dont cook crack over your laptop,708
jerdman76,93,152,1d89ku,600,"As mentioned before, I own an IT company…. And I have parents.  Of course that means they qualify for the unspoken rule of free tech support.  I have smart parents, but when they call me for support, it seems like their brains turn off.

After this incident, they are required to only get support for my employees.  It seems like since they are not talking to their son, they actually listen.

On to the story.

I sold my parents a new laptop (their FIRST new computer purchase) and had it drop shipped to their house. I wanted them to have the new PC experience – unboxing a new PC, experiencing the peeling of the protective plastic from the LCD screen, and the new out-of-the-box PC smell.

My mom calls:

**MOM**: Hi son, we got the new laptop in and have it plugged in and setup on the desk, but the mouse buttons do not work.

Now, I am as proud of my parents as can be.  I was pleasantly surprised that they got as far as getting it out of the box.  Even more surprised that they plugged in the power supply and found the power plug on the back.  But the mouse?

**ME**: What do you mean the mouse buttons do not work? Do you mean the touchpad?

**MOM**: Yes, the touchpad, I just turned on the computer and am at the welcome screen.  I can move the mouse across the screen and am trying to click the ACCEPT button, but it does not work.

**ME**: So you can move the mouse cursor, the little white arrow, around the screen but you cannot CLICK the Accept button?

**MOM**: Yes

This is frustrating, the last thing I want is to have my parents receive a laptop with defective mouse buttons, and of course if my mom can move the cursor it is obvious that she found the touchpad.

**ME**: Mom, this is a new PC, I really cannot believe it is defective… right of the box.  When you click the mouse button you can feel it click right?  It actually moves?

**MOM**: Yes, I used the touchpad and put the mouse over the accept button and then I am pressing the ENTER button to accept.  And when I click the accept button, nothing happens.

**ME**: Mom, did you just say ENTER button?

**MOM**: Yes, and when I click the accept button nothing happens.

**ME** (frustrated): Mom, the ENTER button is NOT the mouse button.  The mouse button is right on the touch pad.  You didn’t use the ENTER button to click with your old computer right?  Why would this be any different?

**MOM**: You mean the little black squares here are the mouse buttons.   Oh yes that works.  Thanks son!

Anything else is this conversation was a blur.

**tl;dr** mom thought the enter button on the laptop was the mouse left click button.  Her son no longer provides direct them support, rather his employees do.

ValekCOS,59,120,10g7sc,608,"Just got this one this morning (preface: I do technical support for a warehouse).

We had a ticket come in that read as follows:

&gt;The Computers in the Old Returns Area do not have windows access.

Since we run a combination of Windows and Linux machines in production, I figured maybe there were Linux machines out there instead of Windows machines, but due to the vagueness of the ticket, I went out to investigate.

When I encountered the man who put in the ticket, he looked thoroughly confused as I began asking him questions about it.  Conversation went something like this:

**Me**: Hey, so there are computer in the old Returns area that don't have Windows access, huh?

**Him**: Yeah.

**Me**: Any idea how many are affected?

**Him**: No.

**Me**: Any error messages or anything else you know of?

**Him**: No.

**Me**: Any idea what's going on over there at all?

**Him**: No, not really.

**Me**: Alright, let's go over there and see what's happening then, because right now I have no idea what's going on here.

So we started walking toward the old Returns area, and he figured that was a good time to tell me the issue wasn't his, but one that belonged to a woman in another department.  So basically, the chain of custody went from her telling him about an issue in a vague manner without any real details, to him telling someone on our Helpdesk without really knowing what was happening, to the Helpdesk person putting in a ticket with us.  Awesome.

And to top it all off, when we finally arrived, we saw that the area in question didn't even have computers in it.  It was just a series of empty tables.

I was attending a course about some new process (I forget exactly) when, at about 4:30pm, my phone starts receiving missed calls from the same person, Mr W.  I know Mr W and he is a great laugh.  Lots of banter and swearing and jokes, but also very serious about his job and the projects he runs.  Anyway, after the 15th missed call I excuse myself from the course and answer; Mr W is unusually agitated, wanting to know how to recall a sent email in Outlook.  I tell him and he seems a little less panicky after recalling the message but I know that it won't recall all the read messages or even delete people's memory of the message.  


Five minutes later, I receive a call from our Helpdesk asking me whether I know Mr W.  A bit coincidental, so I ask why.  Apparently, Mr W had felt the need to email the entire company, from PA to director, from electricians to legal eagles, to tell them ""I've just farted - and by jove it stinks!""


Mr W's defense was that he had left his PC unattended and someone had sent the message as a prank, but I had a suspicion that he was trying to email the project team in his cabin the above message - he was a celebrated farter - and assumed the ""Everyone"" distribution group in the Exchange Address Book was ""everyone in view"", rather than ""everyone pulling a salary from the company coffer"".

IdiotBastard,154,130,vbfuw,605,"Got a call today from someone I did work for in 2003. He was the friend of a friend of a co-worker and was one of those self-proclaimed ""web designers"" who bought a copy of Frontpage and proclaimed they ""knew the web"". He wanted to stop creating every new page on his site by hand and start using a database to store his *articles*. He lived in a house his grandmother had left to him, computer in the basement. I see his face every time the *Make Love, Not Warcraft* South Park episode airs. He was that guy.

The site was about the government and cover-ups and the moon landing was fake and what if aliens and put on these sunglasses to see the truth. I thought it was hysterical. He thought it was as serious as an HD not found error. So I agreed to help him for $500 over a week (I high-balled him, he accepted) to *teach* him how to code this up in a secure and intelligent manner.

Him: *Oh, by the way, it has to be ASP and use an Access database.*

Jesus. Ok, I guess, no problem. It actually took two weeks, because the guy was as slow as molasses in December, but he seemed to finally get it. And it was pretty damned good code if I do say so. It took him weeks to pay me, $20 here and $50 there. I never heard from him again once paid.

Until today, that is - he called me up out of the blue, on my home number no less, and proceeded to bitch at me once I remembered him.

ME: Oh, yeah! I remember you. How have you been?

Him: *Bad. Your code has failed.*

Long Pause

ME: What? What code?

Him: *Your site code. It's not working. You need to fix this shit now. My site is a goddamned mess.*

ME: Dude, that was around 10 years ago! And we wrote it together, remember. I taught you so you would be able to fix it.

Him: *Nope. I don't have a clue what you did. But it's messed up. Not working at all.*

ME: You mean you haven't touched the code in 10 years? You should have moved on to something else by now. A CMS, or a blog or something.

Him: *Fuck no. When it ain't broke, why should I fix it? Except now it is broke, the site's a mess and I paid you all that money back then, so you are responsible to fix it.*

""All that money"". Heh. With some further questioning, he proceeded to tell me he didn't want to lose his ""followers"" over the years - he was once mentioned on TV and had nearly 1,000 hits in one day! - so he had kept the site the same. I also found out that once he had roped a guy at his host to re-code something because they had changed the way you connected to the database. But, he persisted, it was still my code and I was responsible. I tried to calmly let him know that what we had done was a fun side project and 10 years on I wasn't under any obligation to fix anything. But I felt sorry for the guy. This shit was obviously his whole life. So, I volunteered a couple hours to see what I could do. I went to the site and every page showed the ASP code. I used his login info. It was a Linux box.

ME: You changed web hosts, didn't you?

Him: *I don't know. My cousin said (host name) was great and I think we switched. He said he moved me. I have no clue what he did.*

ME: Your hosting the site on a Linux machine, they don't natively support ASP code. You can talk to your host about installing Mono, but I doubt they will. It might not even work if they do. You should really find a Windows host.

Him: *I already have Windows XP. The site still looks like shit. I can see the programming stuff. You didn't fix it!*

ME: Dude. You're using the wrong host. You need to use a host that runs a Windows server. Linux does not run ASP.

Him: *You run a web host company. Can you host the site for me? Shit, you can do it for free I bet. Help a friend out.*

Something in me clicked and I made one of the best decisions of the month. I decided to tell this guy to go fuck himself. I'm sick of leeches and morons and people still using Frontpage and 67% spam and tickets that say things like ""What command do I use to see my server desktop on my iPad so I can control it?"" and ""Should I defrag my server? I do it all the time on my Windows PC"" and ""My sites were down for 2 minutes today while the server rebooted because I locked it up with a rogue script so now I demand the month free""...

ME: Nope. Not going to happen. In fact, we're done. I'm sorry, I can't help you - but you should call that cousin and tell him he screwed you.

Customer: I'm being hacked! You have to get them to stop using my computer!

Many of the systems we have allow us to connect remotely to diagnose problems from the office, which can be a lot more convenient than having to send someone out.

I had one customer call me.  It was about a heating system in a multi-residential apartment complex.  This was an older system that didn't have automatic alarming when there was a problem, but we could still remotely connect to see what was going on.  (Note: It was the dead of winter in Toronto).

The conversation between me and the customer went something like this:

Customer: My building's cold.  Why is my building cold?

Me: I'm not sure, but if you can give me a moment to connect to your system, I'll probably be able to figure out where the problem is.  What's the address?

Customer: [gives building's address]

(a minute or so passes)

Me: Well, I seem to have found your problem.

Customer: And that is?

Me: Well, according to the system, your building is designed to be heated by three boilers, but two of them are reporting a burner lockout and can't fire.  You should probably have someone from [local contractor] out to look at the burner on boilers 1 and 3.

Customer: Yeah.  I know about that.  We shut off the gas line to those boilers down because of a leak.

Me: Well, without those boilers you're basically running at one third heating capacity.  That's why your building is cold.  You might be able to get by with one inoperative in the warmer weather, but you can't run in the middle of January on just one boiler.  It's not powerful enough.

Customer: Can't you do anything about it?

Me: Not from here.  Like I said, you should probably call [local contractor] I can get you their emergency service number if you like.

Customer: Can't you tell the working boiler to just work harder?

Me: Sir, it autmatically did that when the system started cooling off.  It's already running at 100% capacity.

Customer: What can we do about it?

Me: Get your gas line fixed and bring the other two boilers back on-line?

Customer: That's not an option.  What else can we do?

CrazyGitar,101,184,11omn0,604,"Background: I work for a small company that provides tech support to primary, infant and junior schools in the UK. This is when I was a technician and looking at day-to-day issues.

Story: Myself and a colleague, we'll call him SlightlyShortDood (SSD for short), were investigating a networking problem after expanding the ICT suite of the school. We saw that a lot of the computers were very slow to log on but because there were some that worked fine it looked like a network switch was possibly faulty.

The suite itself had a cupboard which stored the panels and the switches in a cabinet that was located above the one of the school's photocopiers. I was on a ladder looking at the cabinet, testing ports while coordinating with SSD. Unfortunately when I leaned into the cabinet to reach one of the higher-up connections when the whole thing detached from the wall.

That's right, a network cabinet came off the wall and on to me while I was stood on a ladder. SSD takes a moment to realise but I then ask for his help and he comes to assist.

My first thought was to not let it drop. I held on until SSD could take some of the weight. I then assessed what could be done that did **not** involve removing all of the patching so tried to remove the panel and have it squeeze through the gap the cables came through. No luck. SSD and I swap places so I take the weight and he looks at how to get it down without redecorating too bad but he also comes up short.

We're at this for over half and hour when a member of staff comes into the suite and sees us. We very focused and don't notice until she's stood there, staring at us. I'm not sure what to say, neither is SSD. She looks at each of us, up at the cabinet and then back to me. After a moments' silence she simply says, ""Can I use the copier?""

Okay, fairly routine call. I connect in remotely so I can see what they're doing. I confirm both drives (they have both a DVD writer and a Blu-ray writer) are detected by the system, and ask them to put in a blank disc. They do and say they hear it spin up, but nothing happens. Try the other drive, same result. I have them find a pre-made program disc, in case the blank is just messed up, but that can't be read either.

Now, if they'd only had one drive I probably would have been setting up a replacement at this point, but it's pretty unlikely for two drives in the same system to be failing like this, so I press on.

While trying each drive, I notice them calling one drive ""left"" and the other ""right"". Okay, system is on its side. Not a big deal as most drives can handle that. Still, perhaps these ones are being overly sensitive, so I have the user put the system upright so one drive is above the other. 

This time, when I have them put in a disc, they're having trouble getting it lined up in the tray. This doesn't make much sense to me; it should be even easier now. I ask if there's a spindle in the middle they have to snap the disc onto; no, there's these plastic pieces in the way. ""Must be those movable tabs some drives have to hold the disc in when the drive is vertical,"" I think, but when I ask them to just slide the tabs back out of the way, they say it's all one piece and no part moves.

Finally, I have them take a picture of the drive tray and send it to me. This is an adventure in itself, but nothing really unusual all things considered.

He replies, 'Here just turn the lights off it's easier to see the sparks when they are happening.' *lights go out* and we see nothing and then he's like, 'look there' we look at each other and have no idea what he's seeing but there was no sparks.

Thehorseisondrugs,116,145,w114o,597,"Bit of back story: I work sales/marketing/accounts/customer support/mind reader in a smallish computer store in a small town in a rural area in Australia.

We had an elderly gentleman bring his laptop, with the reported fault being, of course, ""it doesn't work"". Luckily, our guys are used to this, so the fault was clarified to ""doesn't power on"". Of course, the battery was flat and the customer didn't had his power adapter with him, so he was requested to bring it in. He called the next day to check of he needed to bring this in. Yes please, given the reported fault...

So he comes in, and asks me if he could just check to see whether it was something he was doing wrong. Sure, so I bring out his laptop, and plug it in. Charge light comes on, I point this out, he brushes this off. Push power button, light comes on, machine boots into Vista just fine, and rather quickly too to be honest. I ask if it usually does this, he says ""Oh sometimes, only when I shut it down"". Ok...

The machine ""gets a cursor, which is what it wasn't doing before"" (aka windows starts just fine and dandy). I ask, what now?

""oh, it only doesn't happen after I log off and then try to log on""

Turns out he had decided that the machine turns on faster if he just logs off. The computer hasn't been shut down in months, and froze on the login screen, and when it ran out of battery, it powered off and fixed itself...

So there I was, just being a tier 1 tech at my job, supporting users remotely. I get a call, the user's Single Sign-On isn't working with one website. Now, if you're not familiar, Single Sign-On is a program that tracks all of your login information whenever you sign into a website on your computer, and then it inputs it for you automatically every time after that so you don't have to type anything. It's like TiVo for lazy people, and it'd be great if not for two things:

People often forget their login info if they haven't typed it in since they got the computer, and SSO never works the way it's supposed to.

Well, I say to myself, this shouldn't be too difficult; this site has a known issue with SSO, and there's a nice workaround where we can just grab the login info from SSO and put it in manually. Quick, five-minute fix, tops.

So I remote in, I try to access SSO's login information; it asks for the user's smartcard PIN, as it's supposed to, and I have him input that for me. It comes back saying the PIN isn't correct, even though he typed it in right and is certain of it. Not wanting to second-guess his judgment, I figure it's an issue with SSO itself, and I run through the tedious process of fixing the program's checksum and renewing its GPO. Requires a reboot, takes longer than I'd like to admit.

Once we're back online, I'm shocked to see that it's still not accepting his PIN, which baffles me. It should work by now, damnit! So I ask him:

&gt;""That *is* the right PIN for your smartcard, right?""

&gt;""Absolutely.""

&gt;""And your smartcard is in the machine, right?""

&gt;""No, I forgot it today.""

&gt;""...oh. ...that would probably explain it. You can't open up SSO without your card.""

Call time 35 minutes so far.

&gt;""Well, what I was going to have you do is just open up SSO and get your login info, since you can still log in manually to the website...""

Of course, a nosy co-worker of mine stumbles across the file and tries to open it.  Unable to do so she rumbles into my office demanding the password from me, saying I ""have no right to privatize company property"".  20 minutes later after similar, rampant, nonstop stupidity she wears me down to the point where I gave her the password under explicit orders not to change anything without my say so.

I have several passwords for various logins and applications... after one hour I've tried over 50 variables of all my known passwords and nothing works.

Customer brings a Macbook Air to us to take a look at and see if we can recover the data off it.  It doesn't boot and Apple has told him it would be a $700 dollar logic board to fix.  So he's decided to buy a new one but would like all his stuff off the old computer.


When I asked him why he didn't bring it to me first (since he is a customer) his response was basically, well you guys don't 
have a fancy store like apple and since this is a fancy computer I assumed you couldn't work on it.  **sigh**


So I tell him I will do my best and will call him by end of day to let him know what I find.


I have a special adapter that allows me to basically convert the SSD drives that Apple uses to USB so I was pretty confident I could get the data off.  So I proceed to take apart the Air to remove the hard drive and to see if there are salvageable parts I notice that the keyboard ribbon cable is unhooked.


**sighing heavily** I plug in the keyboard cable and press the power button.  I hear the familiar apple tone and the Air boots back up exactly where the customer had left off.


I call the customer back and let him know what I've found and his problem the whole time was a disconnected keyboard cable (the power button is part of the keyboard hence you can't boot it), that I have his data and it's ready for pickup.

solid_force,80,138,rj6q5,590,"This was about two and a half years ago and this story is by far the best one i have experienced my self. 

Backstory: I got a temp job as a tech support for a large cableprovider as i was stuck on economic-shit-island. I got fasttracked into the job by a friend that worked there, he spoke for me and in less than one week i had a minimum wage job. It paid the bills and my friend got someone more intellectual than a doorknob to converse with at breaks.

The callcenter was quite small, 35 people working at most and less people during night hours. The center was open 24/7 as the contract with the cable provider specified. That meant that me and my friend often took gravyardshifts, less workload and management didn't care if we dose of from time to time when there was no calls. As long as at least one person was at their desk ready with the headset.

One such night in the middle of the week, me and my friend was playing chess at my desk and i get a call. I can't remember exactly but it went something like this (and mind you that this is translated):

-me: Hello and welcome to Derpcable helpdesk how can i help you?

-customer: Hi, my internet's not working. (yes, in all of the world they all sound stupid. Doesn't matter what language you use, that phrase is just stupid)

-customer: Herpderpstreet 123 in Derpingtown.

-me: Excellent. Can you be more specific about the outage. Is it just the internet that's out or are there other services that are out.

-customer: I don't know. I don't want to check, but i guess they're fine.

-me: Don't want to check? Why not?

-customer: Are you retarded! I'm not going in there to check!

-me: Umm, ok. Are you at the specific house that has this cable subscription?

-customer: Ofcourse i am! I'm with my laptop by the garage and the wireless isn't working.

-me: Ok can you see the name of the cable modem on the list of available networks?

-customer: NO! That's what i'm trying to tell you, the internet's not working. (Right about then i hear sirens in the background getting louder and louder)

-me: Can you please go somewhere so that i can hear you speak.

-customer: I CAN'T HEAR YOU! THE INTERNET'S STILL NOT WORKING!

The sirens got turned off and the customer is still shouting. I dial down the headset and try to understand the mess of sounds. After 2 minutes i get the customer back and he tells me he has to assist the firemen.

So I moved into Virginia (guess where) back in October, and got set up with a local ISP. When I got the modem/router^hybridmonster in the mail, I got everything set up, and being as ~~paranoid~~ security conscious as I am, I decided to get the 117pg instruction manual off the magical interwebz and configure my new modem/router to my liking.

    default

    default

    access denied

Wonderful.

After about a solid ~~day~~ few hours of trying get in, I gave up, and just used the thing as a modem and set up my personal, shiny router that I used at my last residence. All is well.

Fast forward to last night at about 7p.

I'm sick and tired of the crappy bandwidth, and decided to screw around inside the ~~hybrid monster~~ modem/router to maybe improve my bandwidth. So I pull up the magical 117pg user manual and proceed to enter in the default credentials, which I was never able to change.

    default

    default

    access denied

F this.

So I used the reset button^andanail to restore the piece of ~~crap~~ tech to factory defaults.

    Power: up

    DSL: up

    Internet: no dice

Fcuk, now I can't even ping the default IP.

I call the 24/7 tech support line (it was about 9pm by now) and I'm not able to get any help. Tired of dropped calls and lack of internet, I go to bed.

I recommence troubleshooting at about 8am this morning, until about 11am, when I call tech support back. They walk me through resetting the modem/router, when the call drops. OK, well I can get back into configuration, so I have my fun setting up WPA2+PSK, MAC filters, and all sorts of other fun. However, to my dismay, the internet is still not working, so I call back at about 2pm, and finally get a real trouble ticket submitted. I get told I'll get a callback in about 6 hours.

Great.

The callback finally comes back in a little after 6pm, with someone who actually works on the gear. Now for a truncated version of our conversation:

    ringaling

Me: Hello?

TS Guy: Hi, this is TS Guy from TS Company, am I speaking to Pipiopi?

M: Yeah, that's me.

T: Hey, I was working on trying to get you back on the internet. I was looking at your modem, and I don't mean to come off as rude, but it looks like I'm seeing all sorts of crazy configurations on here, do you know anything about that?

M: Yeah, I got into the configuration and set it up for my house.

T: Yeah, that's actually really surprising, how were you able to get in?

M: Well when I first got it, *insert all that up there in here*, so I was able to use the default credentials and configured it.

T: Huh. Well, that's pretty interesting, because you're not supposed to be able to do that.

M: Oh wow, I'm so sorry, It's just that every other router I've gotten from ISPs in the past were at their defaults, so I've configured them to my preferences.

T: That makes sense, but these are actually only supposed to be used as modems and not as routers, so when we send them out, their loaded with our configurations that only allow our onsite techs to access them, but not the end user. The reason I was concerned was because from my end it's hard to be sure if you're a malignant user that's setting up for a DDoS, or just a tech savvy user. Here, let's go ahead and get this thing reset to our settings.

We get the thing rebooted, and in conversation, I mention that I'm an IT in the Navy. Before the conversation continues, the modem is back up.

T: Interesting, now, for some reason, you're not able to establish an internet connection...and I can't even get into the configuration. Are you able to get in?

M: Let me see...*put in default credentials*...ok, I'm in!

T: That's odd that I'm not able to get in. Well, here, let me go ahead and pretend you're a tech onsite, and we'll go ahead and get this thing set up and ready to connect.

M: Well, I can load the default config file if you want to email it to my phone and I can pull it with a USB cable.

T: Yeah, that would be ideal, but here's the problem. This sort of thing has never happened before, and I'm not one of the guys that has access to the config files, so I wouldn't be able to give that to you. All I really can do from here is get you back online. Here's what you do...

And we get everything we can back to where it's supposed to be, and it's about 8pm now.

T: Now, typically, you're only supposed to use this thing as a modem, but since I know you know what you're doing, and since we've gotten this thing back up and running together, I'll go ahead and let you set her up however you want.

It is the late 90s and I'm working as an internal software developer for a major accounting/consulting firm. I am upgrading a PowerBuilder application used by a small but important group of people to access HR information from an HR data warehouse. My office is in a suburb of NYC, but the main office is in midtown Manhattan.

This may seem odd now, but 20 years ago there were plenty of network systems that competed with TCP/IP. My company had a large infrastructure of Digital Equipment Corp VAX/VMS machines, and had standardized on DECNET. By the time I was there, DECNET was being phased out in favor of TCP/IP, but there were still plenty of servers that were DECNET only.

I had the new version of the software ready to go. I had not only upgraded the front end to the latest version of PowerBuilder (which supported Win95 instead of Win3.1), but I had upgraded the backend from Oracle 6 to Oracle 7. The executive in charge of the HR group asked me to install the new version on her machine so she could do some acceptance testing before the upgrade was rolled out to her staff. I agreed to come into Manhattan for a day to perform the upgrade.

She, like many people in the company, had two PCs at her desk. One supported DOS/Win3.1 and was used for legacy apps that were not yet compatible, and the other with Win95 for newer apps. When I get to her office, I discovered that her Windows 95 PC did not have the drivers installed for DECNET. I did not have the drivers to install myself, so I called tech support...

&gt; **Me (Mike):** Hi. This is Mike. I'm normally located at $suburban_office. Today I'm at the main office. I'm attempting to install a new version of the HR Data Warehouse for $executive, but the DECNET drivers aren't on her Win95 PC. Can you send someone over to install DECNET?
&gt;
&gt; **TechSupport:** What do you need?
&gt;
&gt; **Me:** I need the DECNET drivers installed on $executive's Win95 PC.
&gt;
&gt; **TechSupport:** Why do you need the DECNET drivers?
&gt;
&gt; **Me:** I'm trying to install an upgraded version of the HR Data Warehouse.

&gt; **TechSupport:** OK. Hold on.

cobysev,103,122,wkrfz,590,"I work for the US Air Force as an IT administrator.  Now, I've noticed that most of the posts here are concerning idiotic customers you all have had to deal with, and for the most part, my submissions have been on a similar topic.  However, It dawned on me today that this group is called *Tales* from Tech Support and not *Idiotic Customers* from Tech Support, so I thought I'd branch away from the usual storytelling.  Since being in the military puts me in a unique perspective from a lot of you, I've decided to tell you about an dramatic experience I once had while deployed.

It was 2007 and I was deployed to a base called Kirkuk in Iraq.  The base was a joint Army and Air Force base.  We had two separate networks set up for the two services, since both had their own rules for governing their networks.  However, at some point, some high-ranking Army General demanded an account on our network so he could access our resources.  Then he decided his aides needed to have access as well.  Then his whole office needed access.  Somehow, more and more Army guys got accounts set up on our network until it eventually became the standard that all Army personnel gets an Army and Air Force network account.

Now, I would like to point out that the Army is a little more lax than us Air Force when it comes to network administration.  We'd get calls all the time from Army personnel complaining that they were blocked from certain websites that worked fine on their network.  They would complain that they can't check out their Facebook or Gmail from work.  The rule we generally go by is this: if it isn't work-related, then there's no reason to unblock it.  This not only promotes a professional work environment, but it also ensures that people don't access malicious websites and expose our network to hacking/viruses, etc.

Blocked websites weren't the only problems I had to deal with concerning Army personnel.  It was like these guys had absolutely no network training at all.  We had to enable port security on all our routers, switches, and a USB lock-down on all PC's because they would just walk in with a personal flash drive or laptop and just plug them into the network.  Talk about a huge vulnerability!  This of course meant that any time they fiddled with any of their cables, we'd have to head over to their side of base and re-enable them locally.

Any given day, our ticket log was over 90% Army problems.  We would practically be out of a job if they weren't on our network.  One of our head civilians in my office was actually fighting to get their Air Force accounts revoked.  *Let their own IT guys deal with their problems,* he'd say.

Okay, enough ranting; on with the story:

One particularly hot 140 degree day, I got a call from an Army office.  One of their computers had stopped running.  I heaved a sigh and drove over to the Army side of base to track down their office.  The office was just a small wood and sheet metal shack.  My boss later informed me that it used to be our office, before we moved to the Air Force side of base.  The Army used it as a type of supply depot.  There were only three Army guys here who inventoried and accounted for all the Army supplies.  One of them greeted me and led me over to his computer.

It won't turn on.  I tipped it and some sand pours out of the back vent.  This is a common issue in the desert.  Sand gets everywhere.  So I shook it out as best I can and then remove the side panel to blow out the insides and check for damage.

Damn, I forgot a can of compressed air.  I thought there was one in the truck I came in, though.  I went out to the truck and started rummaging through the toolbox in the back.

The next thing I knew, I was lying on my back with a ringing in my ears.  It takes my eyes a moment to focus before I realize I'm staring up at the sky.  I tried to get up and found that my head was spinning and my body ached.

When I got my bearings again, I realized that the shack I was in a moment ago had a chunk of roof missing and one of the walls was blown off.  A mortar had landed right next to it.  My truck was a little ways away, so I was just stunned by the blast.  I did a spot check on myself.  No holes, no blood.  No searing pain, just a dull ache all over, like I had just finished an intense workout.  I looked up to see people from a nearby building rushing toward the shack.  I made an effort to walk over there myself.

The shack was relatively small.  Two of the Army guys died instantly.  The guy I was helping was still alive, but missing an arm and parts of his legs.  He was slipping in and out of consciousness and didn't seem to know what's going on.  I wanted to help, but I was still dizzy and it was an effort to keep my footing.  There were already people standing over him trying to stop the bleeding.

A few minutes later, there was an ambulance and fire truck there.  There's no fire, but the ""Fire Dawgs"" ran around securing parts of the shack that might collapse.  EMT's are getting my wounded customer onto a stretcher and then off to the hospital.  A few hours later, he died in the ER.  I went to the hospital to get checked out and they just said I had a very minor concussion.  They gave me the rest of the day off and sent me back to work the next day.

At Kirkuk, the Anti-American groups off-base would try to scare us away by shooting mortars at the base once or twice a week.  They never really aimed for anything, they just pointed a mortar at the base, set a really long timer, then ran away.  By the time it went off, they'd be long gone.  Most of the base was just open, empty space, but every now and then they'd get lucky and actually hit something.  This was one of those unfortunate days.

Late that night, there was a send-off ceremony for the deceased.  Close to 100 military people showed up, including me.  We lined up silently on the dark flight line and rendered the slow salute as the caskets were carried onto the plane destined for home.  I made sure to attended every send-off ceremony after that, regardless of what hour of the night it was held.

Last year, we had a booth at a pretty big IT trade show. Now, there are a lot of douchebags at these shows -- most of them are middle-aged white men who have come more to ogle booth babes than to actually learn anything about the technology and service offerings. And plenty of big players pander to them.

We aren't big enough to hire anyone whose sole job is to man the booth, so we used our own staff. Most of the guys that work for us shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a potential customer, so about 90% of our booth staff were female. These are the ladies that help create our products -- designers, writers, developers, and systems engineers. And their booth wear is jeans and a logo t-shirt -- not the sort of thing that *anyone* could interpret as inviting sexual attention.

These girls got their fair share of inappropriate comments and the like, and we could all tell it was taxing. We gave plenty of breaks for them and tried to run interference as best we could. Until some asshole decided to try and grope the developer.

I was stunned - that's pretty over-the-line even for a venue like that - but my manager's reaction was priceless. From across the booth, I see him excuse himself from talking to a dude in a suit, quick-step over to the douchenozzle, and grab him by the arm.

He pulls the guy to the middle of the booth and says ""this assh-le just groped one of my employees. That is *not* OK, and he's gonna have a bad time."" He then proceeds to march the guy to the security guards at the door.

Manager comes back, tells the lady involved to go back in the ""closed"" part of the booth and take a breather.

Suit-guy says something along the lines of ""I can't believe you just did that to a potential customer"". I'm not sure whether he's pissed or impressed. Manager says ""I should have asked him who he worked for, because I don't want that assh-le's business.""

I wish more managers would be willing to defend their employees like that rather then let them take crap for the sake of ""good PR"".",How every manager should be,699
The_Beasts_Belly,108,104,1frero,585,"Background:  I work for a major Defense Contractor (We make everything from smart cards to smart bombs; ICs to ICBMs) and I work as the Technical Head of IT (pretty much the highest level person in the company that knows how computers work) and I'm only 25 (There is a story behind this if anyone cares).

Now for the story:

About 18 months I was put in charge of setting up a new datacenter (New building and everything).  I arrive to a completely empty 15,000 sqft datacenter with a few network racks in the corner with our cluster of border routers (4x Cisco ASR-1013), Load Balancers and our core routers.  I confirm that everything is plugged in correctly and get the fiber plugged in.  All was good for the moment.

Now to get us some internet.  I call up the NSP, get our shiny new AS numbers and IP ranges (nothing sexier than a fresh /16 of IPv4 and a /32 of IPv6).  Enter all that into the routers and after a few moment, the fiber comes alive and we start seeing some traffic, Its Aliiiive!!

Then came more traffic (Some IPv6, but mostly IPv4), then more IPv4 traffic so I get a bit concerned and call our NSP and they re-assure me that the IP range used to belong to $HostingProvider and everything should be fine (it was only about 60 MB/s after-all).  Over the next few days I get the rest of the routers, firewalls and Viprions configured and ready for the servers.  I then disabled BGP until everything was completed.

The next two weeks were full of 18-wheelers dropping off a 500 racks, 1000 ToR switches and 25,000 servers and 100s of shelves of SAN arrays.  It was a glorious sight: mountains of boxes as far as the eye can see emblazoned with the logos of HP, Cisco, NetApp and Panduit.  Then came the contractors: 6 to set install the cable trays and install the patch panels; a dozen to rack-and-stack the servers and cable them up; a dozen to image them.

All was right in my kingdom: servers had their OSes and applications; switches had their 40 GB trunks and joined to spanning tree; Drive arrays in the SANs were configured and prepared for use; cables were properly managed and labeled; the floors were cleaned and polished.  It was truly a heaven.

But there were dark clouds heading my way...

Launch Day came with much fan-fare, we can now retire our old servers and give them their well-deserved rest, hundreds of tickets will be closed, the champagne was at the ready.  There I sit at my laptop with my bosses and most of the C*Os, its the moment of truth.

My fingers did their dance typing 'bgp enable' on the router-cluster command prompt.

I declared ""Let there be light!""

The network came alive, the NOC displays showed network usage graphs rising:  100 MB/s, 250 MB/s, I start to get nervous as this is well past our normal bandwidth use.  It continues rising 500 MB/s, 750...  1000... 1500.  I am full-on worried now.  The Viprions start freaking out over the number of HTTP/404's the web boxes are serving up, the number of failed FTP connections, rejected mail...  Logs show the requests are for domains that we don't control, and there is a lot of them.

Now I am panicking

I disable BGP again and call up the NSP and after some escalations I come to find out that $HostingProvider is still actually using that AS number and IPv4 Subnet and that I had just managed to take out almost 50,000 Web servers and even more websites...  The engineer that assigned us the subnet apparently didn't even confirm it wasn't being used and didn't do their due-diligence.

Then began the process of getting a new subnet and AS number with the NSP; the next few weeks ended up being near hell for me, re-configuring all our Routers, Load-Balancers and firewalls to use the new subnet.  Then there were the thousands upon thousands of DNS entries I had to fix...  All because  an engineer was lazy and it managed to make it through all the people that are supposed to prevent this...

Rggoalie3,58,164,ys5fy,587,"I get an email this morning from the manager (I'll call her Jane) of one of the departments that I'm responsible for. It Reads:

""I don't know what you did with *Company Owner*, *Rggoalie3* but now no staff can delete icons or install the printer for *Important Company App* on their desktop anymore.

I understand tight monitoring but they have to have the freedom to customize their desktop with icons for portals etc.

They can't even rename an icon.""

Now, Jane holds a new position in the organization and I had in fact met with the company owner to decided what permissions her new position would have. And plans to modify existing permissions were drawn up, but not yet implemented.

I emailed her back and let her know that no changes had been made at all yet. I also explained that users can not install programs on their own because they don't have administrator rights. I made her a local administrator of all of the computers in her department so that she could authorize any updates or changes she sees fit. (Standard policy that the owner had signed off on the day before)

**Three hours later**, while I'm at lunch, I get a frantic phone call from my assistant telling me that Jane called twice followed by the owner because Jane couldn't do any work. WTF...

So I call Jane and she is obviously pissy at this point. And this is how the conversation goes:

**Rggoalie3**: Hi Jane, whats going on?

**Jane**: Well, my whole department has been sitting here with nothing to do all day because of the changes you made yesterday.

**Rggoalie3**: Oh, sorry about that. Did you get my email?

**Jane**: I've been too busy to look at it. I've been dealing with a 500k settlement issue. Really, I just need you to change back whatever you changed.

**Rggoalie3**: Ok, well, I made you an administrator of all of the computers in your department. Just reboot them 2 times (make really sure the GPO rolls) and then you can put in your username and password to let them do anything that requires admin rights.

**Jane**: Well, what did you change?!? Just put it back to the way it was.

**Rggoalie3**: Honestly Jane, we haven't done anything yet.

**Jane**: Then how come I could install the program yesterday but not today and why can't I rename icons like I could before?

**Rggoalie3**: Well, not all of the updates to the program need administrative rights to install. This one does. So you just need to put in your username and password for them and they will be set.

**Jane**: Well, it doesn't make sense why this worked yesterday and not today. I just need you to put it back to the way it was.

**Rggoalie3**: Jane, I don't know what to tell you. Honestly, nothing has changed.

**Jane**: So, basically more work for me then and you don't know why it doesn't work the same?

**Rggoalie3**: Well, I explained why the program doesn't install the same.

**Jane** (talks over me and starts going on a tirade that would make this page 3x as long. Talking about how she can't rename icons, so that isn't it. I think she asked what I changed 3 times and finally I told her that we could go around and around with it, but nothing had changed.)

**Rggoalie3**: What icons are you trying to rename?

**Jane**: The *Important Company App* icon

**Rggoalie3**: Ah, that makes sense then, that is a program that was installed as an administrator. So, you have to be an administrator to change it. If you make your own icon, you can rename and delete it all you want. Try it...

**Jane**: Ok... Oh... Well... Yea, that did work. Ok, well then I can fix the rest then.

**Rggoalie3**: Ok, well call back if you need any more help.

***2 hours later***

**Jane**: I'm sorry. I just realized I was completely wrong.

**Rggoalie3**: (long pause) Ok... Well... Thank you. Iv'e never had someone actually call back and apologise before. I really appreciate it.

**Jane**:  Well, I'm new here and I want to work well with you and I'm going to do what I can to make it right.

My first ""ticket"" (the office was far too small to need a ticket system) was for someone in a nearby cube trying to read data off of a cd. As she would start loading the (industry-specific, somewhat complicated) data, it would always die at the same point, throw an error, and crash. For reasons that I can't recall, replacing this disc was not trivial.

So, I watched it happen a few times to make sure she wasn't doing anything to interrupt the process without realizing it, thought for a second, and said, ""let me see what I can do with it."" Taking the disc back to my cube to see if it would work on my machine, I paused for a second... in a House-like moment of clarity (minus the brilliance, of course), flipped the cd over, and sure enough...a big smudge from an unidentified substance. 

I licked it in the privacy of my cube (that sounds terrible), wiped it on my shirt, and returned triumphantly to my co-worker.

catwiesel,49,187,16uuzh,587,"Hey, 

I've been on reddit for some time now, especially on tfts and I enjoyed it immensly.


I do work as an IT certified specialist but it appears we have decent customers so I dont have much to tell. However, on christmas I remembered a story that fits here quite well...


You see, I wasn't always in IT. In fact, after school, I started working in a bar, shortly after, I sort of owned it. Anyway, it did not last (not my/our fault - the new owner of the bulding diddnt give us another lease since he diddnt want a bar in there) and being unemployed being frowned upon, I had to search for a new job.
Long story short, instead of getting into IT what I would have prefered, I got stuck at another job working behind a bar - since that is where I had 5+ years experience. 


Please bare with me, I realise this is not techsupport related yet, but kinda important.


Now, this bar was a dive and a failure. It tried to be hip but it failed. Failed on an epic scale I did not think possible.
The owner was a guy, mid 40s. His (ex-)wife wanted the bar and he co-signed the lease. Some months later the women took all the money and skipped town. So now he was stuck with a bar and two choices: close it down and pay for the lease the next 4.5 years - or keep it open to recupriate some of the losses.


Few more details needed...
Above the bar were rooms for rent. They were reasonably priced. One of those in the 3rd floor was sort of an office (aka a bed and an old PC).
The music we played in this bar came from an Toshiba Vista Notebook.


So, I ended up working there. I wont bore you with all the crappy stuff that happened there, lets just fast forward to my last day I worked there...


Boss came in and told me to follow him in the ""kitchen"". There a package from an internet provider was lying around, as well as a new modem/router (AVM FritzBox) with a few cables attached. He proceeded to tell me that he ordered internet and asked if I could set it up so it can be used in the office (since he knew I was interested in stuff like that), he tried already but couldnt get it to work.
I told him that it will be hard since I diddnt think the wifi would get up that high and that he would in all likely hood need to get a wifi repeater for ~ 50 eur so it would work.
But for now, I, of course, said yes, I can and will set up the internet. He took a beer and went outside.
This was around 4pm in the afternoon on a weekday, no other customers and experience told me, there wouldnt be any for hours and if there would be, they would not cause much work.


So I proceeded to look at the FritzBox which was hooked up. It was all wrong, so I re-attached it correctly so it would get DSL and the phone would keep working when the boss came back and asked me what I was doing.

M: ""setting up the internet""

H: ""what? who told you to do that now? what if a customer comes in?"" (he was pretty anal about not ""slacking"" (smoking/sitting/eating/drinking/doing anything besides standing at attention behind the bar))

M: ""well, I assumed...""

H: ""no, stop it!""

So I stopped, thinking ""yeah, he will leave soon then I can continue""
And he did. Still I had no customers, so I went back ""to work"", set up the FritzBox, connected it to the music laptop per wifi, gave it the providers info and had internet. the next few hours (no customers) the laptop was busy getting updates and more updates.
In that time I set up a second box I found lying around in the box as a wifi repeater.


At around midnight I closed down the bar since I did not have a single customer the whole day. I installed the wifi repeater in the 2nd story of the building and went to the office. wifi was available, I set up the computer and again, lots of updates.


I wrote down all the stuff I did and why, the ip adresses, the passwords, put it with the bar related paper that we had to do every evening and went home. It was 1am.


At 7am I woke to the frantic ringing of my cellphone. It was my boss demanding to know why I would write I worked until 1am when I closed the bar at midnight. I told hom because I set up the wifi for his office, even saving him 50 eur becau...
He interrupted me, demanding to know who ever said me that I would be getting payed for setting up the internet.
That was the last straw. All time slowed down. I had to take so much crap in the last year from this unimportant, ignorant, posing penny pincher and there was only one thing I ever could do...


M: ""Listen. If you even THINK that you MIGHT find someone else stupid enough to set up your internet, save you 50bucks by ""hacking"" a router to serve as a repeater and update your two computers for 6 eur (my hourly rate - midnight to 1am) I will come to the bar immediately, rip out all the cables, reset all the boxes and delete all the updates and give you your money back...""

Immediately he tried to backpaddle ""...well *stammer* it wasnt ment like that just ... you know ... we dont have money ... I diddnt know ...""

M: ""yeah... right""

H: ""still, I did not say I would pay you for it but its ok, keep the money. we will talk about this at your next shift in 2 days. bye""

M: ""...""


I turned around, thinking about my life, this job and that idiot until I fell asleep again. When I woke up and after the mourning routine, I went there, gave him his key back and told him I will not be coming to work in 2 days. or ever again. I quit.


Probably one of the best decisions in my life. No 3 months later I had moved away and a better paying job with the best boss ever in IT (where I am still today)


I saw this guy at christmas again when 2 friends ""forced"" me to go to that bar since every other one was closed for the night already. He had trouble with his laptop and asked if I could have a look.

Working for the same small fruit company, in the operations department.

**Legs:** fruitcare operations, this is legs.

Gal: Oh hi. Is this the right line to call if my email wont work?
(Technically, no. My department dealt with a ticketing system for lower level work such as this, but I was in a good mood and had little work to do)

**Legs:** I can help you today. Please use the coffee ticket system next time, it makes it much easier for us to expedite your etc..

Gal: Sorry but I've submitted a few tickets and I've never received a response.

**Legs:** Ok! Let me review those tickets, can I get the ticket number ..etc..etc

Gal: Numbers, words

I proceed to read the ticket and immediately see why there was no response. Our ticket system is pretty advanced. When you select a problem it automatically gives suggested fixes for the issue, and at the minimum asks for basic information about the problem. The ticket also had the ability to be 'pinged' for updates by the user, rather than opening another ticket.

This user had opened 10 tickets over a span of 3 hours. 

**Legs:** Ma'am here are the fields you should fill in in the future, I see here that you have put in the problem field ""email isnt working"" with no other identifying information...etc...

Gal: Sorry. I will next time. Can you help me now?

I resume piecing together information from the rest of the tickets when I run across a sentence that baffles me.

Gal (in the ticket): I tried writing smtp.fruitcompany.com on the outbox, but it is still not working.

**Legs:** Ok ma'am. The server you are using looks correct. Can you describe the issue for me?

Gal: Yeah, I write the address on the outgoing mailbox but I still cant send emails. 
(I think it is a little strange the way she words this, I cant quite place why at the moment.)

**Legs:** Ok, lets open fruitpreferences on your fruit. Great, go to etc...click etc..Ok do you see the line ""Outgoing server""? 

Gal: (shuffling, sounds) Ok I'm at the mailbox. I see the line where I wrote smtp.fruitcompany.com 
(At this moment, I'm feeling a little more confused about the sounds that occurred. It sounded alot like she was walking somewhere, again...cant quite place my confusion. )

**Legs:** Ok, lets clear that out and put in sierra-mike-tango-papa-dot-etc...etc...

Gal: *pause..........* Ok, I'm not really sure what you want me to do. I already filled in the line and I dont know how to delete it..?

**Legs:** ..... (thinking she is confused) ok, can you highlight the text for me?

Gal: (audible *pop*, *squuuek**squeeek*) Ok I've highlighted it!

**Legs:** (confusion continues, mixed annoyance, this user is obviously doing something on the side. grumble.) Great, hit backspace for me to clear it out. 

Gal: .....on my computer?

**Legs:** (where else?!?!) Yes ma'am

Gal: Ok, one second while I get to it...

**Legs:** I'm sorry? Are you not at your computer?

Gal: No, I'm at the mailbox? You told me to go to where I wrote the server name and highlight it, right?

(I'm still not understanding, in retrospect....I think at this point I should have caught on.)

**Legs:** (Trying to salvage the situation) I'm sorry ma'am I think you might have lost me there. What do you see on your screen? You should see blue highlighted text smtp.fruit.etc..

Gal: I told you I'm at the mailbox, not my computer. I don't have a blue highlighter, should I be using a blue highlighter?

This story is about none of those, but the reason I am doing this job.

If you don't remember from previous posts, I work in advanced tech support for an ISP, handling issues beyond getting connected to our network.  We do everything - viruses, printer setups, networking, XBox port forwarding, helping Granny type an email, and keeping Farmville animals alive.

Today, one of our long-time customers called in, not with a problem, but to thank us for all the help we'd given her over the last few years.  You see, she had just gotten out of surgery, and the doctors told her she had a ""death sentence"" and would not be around much longer.  Before she left, she wanted to thank all of us for the support, help, and assistance we had given her, and with the patience we had shown in helping her.  

After this call, which was not to me thankfully or I'd be curled up in a ball right now, as I have helped her more than once; as this message was shared with my department, many of us had teary eyes, some of us wept.  

So for this customer, who I cannot name but wish I could, who took some of the last moments of her life to thank us for helping her, thank you for reminding me of why I do this job - to help people.  You will be missed, but your kind words will keep at least this tech in the trenches, fighting the good fight, helping people overcome their PC issues, and hopefully touching a life or two here and there, as she has touched the lives of the techs that have helped her.

On the fourth time, one gentleman, we'll call him frank, looks at me and says ""No way, you're not rebooting again until I finish this order."" One order I can wait for, no big deal. 

He finishes the order, promptly picks up his phone, dials another customer, and opens another order. I am a little upset at this point, but the customer shouldn't bear that burden, so I go back to the office to finish the changes to my giant spreadsheet. 

15 minutes later, I walk back out to the floor, and say ""I'm really going to reboot this time"", which only draws sighs. Franks pipes up again ""I need to finish this order first!"". 

Behind frank sits a guy we'll call stark. Stark is a friend to the IT department, never complaining, always asking how he can better help us help him, checking with us before downloading things or changing system settings (Users have Admin access, not my choice. *sigh*), that sort of thing.

My company is very vague when telling me what I specifically need to be prepared for.  I won't delve further into my distaste for my job, considering it pays the bills. 

This morning I was dispatched to a customer about 30 miles away. Standard stuff apparently: Slow computer, viruses, tune up, all that jazz. It was an HP all in one PC and it has a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse.

I arrive on site and the customer (a 60 y/o man with a 30-something y/o asian wife...) tells me ""Now the keyboard isn't working!"" so I do what any sane person would: Check the batteries. They turned out to be dead so I told him he would need new batteries and asked if he had any. This is our exchange.

**Me** : Sir you need new batteries. These are dead. I need two AA.

**Customer** : Why are they dead? I just bought this computer 6 months ago!

**Me** : Well, they're just batteries. You can't expect the keyboard to run forever without power. It's a really quick fix though.

**Customer** : Can we call HP? I want to use their warranty.

**Me** : (internally screaming) Sir, HP will not cover your batteries. They are a user-end part. They're literally just a few bucks, but If you find it a hassle you can use a wired keyboard.

**Customer** : But they said this computer is wireless.

**Me** : Sir, that's the internet connection. Wireless connectivity.

**Customer** : Just fix the damn thing! I'm paying $99 an hour!

At this point I get up, walk to my car, grab a wired keyboard and plug it in and get cracking on fixing his 'problems.' He says to me ""How come yours is working?"" and I explain that my keyboard is wired. I'll resolve his problems shortly.

Some time passes and I'm about to leave. I unplug my keyboard and ask the user to use it and he (again) says his keyboard doesn't work.

Right next to us was a remote for his TV. When he's not looking I open the battery cover, take out the AA batteries and put them in his keyboard. Boom. Working.

vonadler,127,129,171wx0,576,"Hi all. Some of you might remember me from [""I'll take the antenna down](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16b69a/ill_take_the_antenna_down/) and [Big Bad Badass Bastard Boss](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16jmmg/the_big_bad_badass_bastard_boss/). Since they were well recieved, I thought I'd return with another good story.

This takes place early summer 2002, when I was working at the ~~salt mine~~ call center doing internet support - and first point of contact support for the ISP that did a lot of radio LAN back in those days (same guys as in the watertower story).

This is the tale of the angry printer. And no, not a networked one. Literally. You'll see.

I walk into the office at 07:55 Thursday morning to start the 08:00 shift, and read up on my e-mail. During the night, at about 03:00 to be specific, a customer to [Radio LAN ISP] have reported an issue. His Internet is down. Very well.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""
Printer:  ""Hello, this is [owner] from [small printing firm FAR up north]. Our Internet is down. I reported this issue during night, but wanted to check if there's been any updates. Our customer number is [XXX].""
Me: ""Alright, hang on, I will check.""

I check in the system. This guy has bought class 1 support. It means he pays a lot extra to have 24 hour guarantee on his connection. [ISP] is required to restore his connection within 24 hours. Not business hours. 24 hours. And we're required to tell him just that, and immediately report it to the technicians. Which we have done during the night.

Me: ""Hi, I see that you have 24 hour guarantee class 1 support on your contract. I cannot see anything the techs have done yet, but your connection will be restored within 19 hours - 24 hours after you first reported it.""

Printer: ""Good. Please ask the technicians to hurry up. We got class 1 support because we need it. You see, we're a printing operation, and we take in all our printing materials over Internet. The files are about 1Gb in size, so our backup modem connection will not cut it. I have seven people standing around doing nothing because we have nothing to print. This is costing me a lot of money.""

Me: ""I will add this to the case and call the techs.""

Printer: ""Thankyou.""

So, I update the case and give the techs a call. There's no reply, but I leave a message.

I return to work, and after lunch I hear that my collegue has gotten a call from the printer. Slightly more irritated, but till correct and polite.

Come Friday, and I get a call. Note that the problem, according to contract, should have been fixed by now. The case has been updated with 'tested - no contact with the customer's local equipment' but nothing more.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""This is [owner] from  [small printing firm FAR up north]. Our connection is still down. The customer number is [XXX].""

Me: ""Sorry about that, I'm checking now...""

Angry printer: ""And don't tell me it will be fixed in 24 hours, it has already been more than that. I am paying seven people to drink coffee and read the newspaper.""

Me: ""Looks like they have tried to reach the local equipment...""

Angry printer: ""I know that already. Have you done NOTHING since then? Tell them to get their arse out of the wagon!""

Me: ""I will contact them immediately. It should be fixed within 24 hours...""

Angry printer: ""Well it is not. Get to it! Goodbye!""

At this time, I was a bit agitated, but the customer had been correct and not irate, even if he was angry. So I updated the case, called the techs and left a message when they did not reply.

Then it was a sweet, sweet weekend with two full days of respite from the ~~salt mine~~ call center.

When I get back for the 11:00 shift on Monday, I get called to the teamleader almost immedately.

Teamleader: ""[vonadler], we have a very angry guy up north called three or four times a day. You know the [ISP] account, can you check?""

Me: ""Sure.""

So I check. There has been no update from the techs. We have done our part - we have informed the customer that his connection will be fixed within 24 hours (as we are required to do) which seems to send him off into a spin each time, called the techs and updated the case. One of our guys have also e-mailed the tech lead of the [ISP] to inform him of the case.

Me: ""Hey, [teamleader]?""

Teamleader: ""Hey [vonadler].""

Me: ""I checked the case. We've done everything that the contract say we should do and then some. It is [ISP] that has not fixed this guy's connection as they should have.""

Teamleader: ""Thanks, I'll call [ISP] and hear what is up.""

Yet, the issue was not fixed that Monday. A collegue was thoroughly berated by the angry printer during the afternoon.

On Tuesday morning, the angry printer berated another collegue for quite some time.

On Tuesday afternoon, a tech from [ISP] got into a car to drive the 542 kilometers (337 miles) up north to where the angry printer's business was located. I worked the late shift (14:00-23:00) that evening, and got the call.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Tech: ""Hi, this is [tech guy's name] from [ISP], I'm onsite in [town FAR up north].""

Me: ""Hi. How is it going? Can you fix the connection""

Tech: ""Unfortunately, we have a bit of a... problem. I can't get online. Can you update the case for me.

Me: ""Sure.""

Tech: ""Ok, write this: We have a problem. We're going to need spare parts. BIG spare parts. The antennna has molten.""

Me: ""Molten?""

Tech: ""Yeah, looks like it was hit by lightning or something.""

So I update the case and call the angry printer to inform him that they are working on the issue.

Me: ""They are onsite now, but ran into some problems at the antenna. They will be needing spare parts, but they are working on the issue as fast as they can.""

Angry printer: ""Yeah, they checked the equipment here, and it was ok. I figured something like that. They better have it fixed quick, it is Tuesday now, and I reported this issue on Thursday!""

But spare parts like that does not come quickly. [ISP] suffered badly from the dotcom crash and was close to bankrupcy. They did not have those parts on hand, and had to order them. Which took time. 

And the angry printer called in. Three to four times a day, angrier and angrier, to the extent that we all feared any kind of call with his regional code. Other people who called in started to wonder why we exhailed with such relief when they brought up normal issues.

Two weeks after the initial report, I got angry printer on a call. The translation will not do his fury full justice, but I will try again.

Me: (cringing in fear) ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""I am sorry for what I have to do now. You know who I am and what my issue is. When will it be fixed.""

Me: ""Within 24 hours?""

Angry printer: ""**WITHIN 24 HOURS? YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR TWO WEEKS? ARE YOU INBRED CRETINS, OR JUST MIND-FUCKINGLY STUPID BEYOND ANY RECOGNITION? I HAVE SEVEN PEOPLE, ON PAY, HERE, EVERY FUCKING DAY. I HAVE PAID** [tens of thousands of dollars] **OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO HAVE CLASS 1 SUPPORT, AND YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT? YOU RETARDED FUCKING SCUMBAGS, YOU DEVILSPAWNED STINKING INCOMPETENT MONKEYS! HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO BREATHE WITH YOUR MIND-NUMBINGLY LOW IQ? HOW DO YOU EVEN DIFFER BETWEEN YOUR OWN MOTHERS AND THE SLIME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AQUARIUM? HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO BE SO INCOMPETENT? IT GOES EVEN AGAINST THE LAWS OF PHYSICS!!!**""

Me: ""I will put this in the case.""

Angry printer: ""YOU DO THAT! BYE!""

This went on for another week before they managed to fix his connection. Three to four times a day. The worst part was that the customer was right. He had paid a LOT of money to have a secure connection with 24 hour guarantee because he knew he was dependent on his Internet working. The relief was massive when we got an e-mail from [ISP] saying the issue was fixed. Then, another week later, a call.

Me: ""[ISP] support.""

Angry printer: ""You know who this is.""

Me (cringing in fear): ""Yes.""

Angry printer: ""Don't worry. I know it is not your personal fault. I just wanted to call and tell you I have terminated all contracts with [ISP], so you will not hear from me anymore. Bye.""

Me (with extreme relief): ""Thanks for letting us know. Bye.""

We did the human wave to massive cheering all over the office. So loudly that even the managers came out of their offices wonering what was going on.

The first part of the deinstallation is notifying users that the system will be going away and that they need to migrate to the VAX 8850.

The VMS operating system could display messages when you logged in. The UNIX equivalent of motd. Since users are notoriously bad at ignoring login announcements I would put in fancy ASCII banners and ring the terminal bell several times.  I would also change the banners around every few days so they would hopefully notice that something had changed. I would also change the data on the message and change up the wording a bit.

Then I sent email to every user on the system. When you logged in or were already logged in you were notified of any new email messages you had. So of course I am sending out a reminder email every week that the system is going out of service and will be permanently removed from the building. Please call me if you have any questions, issues, yada yada yada.

Then, because I know users don’t read login messages or email messages I write an interoffice memo, ON PAPER, and distribute it to the thirty or so users of the system, plus department heads.  So I have notified people three different ways, repeatedly, months in advance that the system is going away. 

So the big day comes, the system is shut off. A week later I have field service come in to take it apart and take it away. We’re trading it in for a newer, bigger piece of iron.
A few weeks after that a user, let’s call him Derp, comes to me:

Derp: “Where is the VAX?” 

Me: ""It was deinstalled and it’s not even in the building anymore."" 

Derp: ""What?!""

Me: “Didn’t you get my memo?” 

Derp: “Yes I did, I have it right here.” 

Now Derp was a bit of a packrat and he never threw anything out. So he is able to pull my memo out of one of the piles of paperwork in his cube and reads it in front of me.

AngularSpecter,65,105,1g4ggf,576,"The ISP I used to work for supplied both cable internet and satellite TV to small apartment complexes.  We just pulled in DISH TV signals on big dishes, transcoded them and broadcast it over coax to the buildings.  The residents had special DISH network boxes that could deal with the QAM encoded signal.

Anyway.... one day I was stuck working the phones because someone was out sick and I get a call from someone who has no channels.  This was during the time DISH was moving transponders around to make room for HD channels, so it seemed every week, everyone would lose half their channels and we would have to walk them through a channel scan.

So I start walking this lady through the menus to rescan for channels.  I tell her what buttons to press and what the TV should show...she would say ""okay"".  Typically we get them to the point where the box is scanning for channels (which takes a while), and tell them how to exit to the guide when it is done and ask them to call back if they are still missing channels.

So I get her there and ask her if she sees the progress bar and if she can tell me what the signal quality is.  

""Ummm, no.  My screen is just fuzz"".

I'm an electronics technician/electrician by training which pretty means I can work on anything that has electricity running through it.

We have a saying called RTFM. Most people don't realize how many answers a manual will give you. Hence my first story, the engineers that were too busy to read the f'ing manual.

Two engineers had been charged with setting up a facility to install configuration settings in some specialized equipment.

It took them about six months to become operational. Once they did become operational, our shop kept getting calls to change out a power supply about every three or four months.

Boss man hands me the trouble ticket when it comes in asking for another power supply changeout. These things were not cheap, but we were not paying for them. 

I arrived at the facility and took a look at the problem and talked to the engineers. They repeated their need for a new power supply and pointed towards a new one all ready to be tied into the buildings electrical supply.

I took a minute and looked at the gear and the error codes that they were getting. I asked the engineers for their book on the power supply. The power supply was shutting down due to overtemp. I looked at how filthy the filters were and realized that this was an easy fix.

""Is it OK if I just fix it or do you want me to replace it?"" I asked.

""You can fix it? Go ahead.""

In plain view of the engineers, I pulled the filters and cleaned them and plugged the power supply back in.

This was the fourth power supply that they had gone through.

Once the engineers realized how much money that they had blown on replacement power supplies they made one comment.

""Please don't tell anyone.""

Bonus: Routine maintenance instructions were on a label on the side of the power supply.

throwaway2685,52,122,vxjsp,575,"I work for a software company with support centers in the United States that has begun outsourcing more and more of our phone and online tech support to India (as is the custom).  

Entire departments have been hit with the axe on occasion over the past few years in lock-step with increased outsourcing support contracts in Asia.  It's a thing people think about on occasion, especially with mortgages and the other trappings of modern life in mind.  

Last year as part of what seemed to be a big initiative to get everyone 'pumped up' about the work we do for our customers, a series of tall cardboard cutouts were installed in well-traveled corridors representing customers holding up letters talking about how much our software helped them.  Development had cutouts where the letters (apparently real) were about how their data had been saved or problem X had been solved by the program, etc.  Marketing presumably got cutouts with letters from stores talking about what a mitzvah the products had been to their bottom line, etc.  

Technical support...  got cut outs with customer letters describing amazing technical support experiences they had received.  Not bad, right?  To paraphrase the general format, ""I had a problem and Tech Support was able to get me up and running quickly and it was a very positive experience.""  Cool, good to hear except...  in each instance, they called out the name of the tech support agent who had provided this amazing experience.  ""Sriharsha"" and other very Indian names were always the agents who had been so great.  

Now, I'm happy for them.  Our outsourced tech support folks do a good job and we're all in this together and so on, but...  when you have a domestic call center full of concerned employees and you put up a bunch of displays that talk about how great the outsourced support agents are, it sounds kind of like you may be sending some sort of message.  :(

I work in a copy and print center.

Some older lady brought in her laptop and asked if I could print an e-mail off for her. She booted it up and proceeded to get angry because her Internet wasn't working. I explained that she would need to connect to our store wi-fi to work. No, that was unacceptable and 'made no sense'. She 'didn't have to do that at home'. And started yelling at me that I did something to her computer to delete her Internet (??). I hadn't even touched her computer at this point.

She pushes her laptop toward me and says 'fine, you do it then'. I connected her to our wi-fi. (Oh god her computer was a mess. Her desktop was completely covered in icons). And gave it back to her so she could get to her e-mail. 'See, this is my Internet. I told you...' She half mumbles this in irritation.

Now, she doesn't know where her e-mail is ('usually it's automatically on there!'). I ask her what e-mail she uses. Gmail? Yahoo? Hotmail? She looks at me like I'm stupid. 'why does that matter?' At this point I'm getting pissed off. I have several other customers waiting on me. I mess around on her bookmarks, hoping that it was on there somewhere. Thank god it was. I connected her to the Comcast e-mail site. *She doesn't know her password.* After a few botched password guesses, she decides to call her son to ask him. I help the other customers while she does this. I come back and she gives me the correct password. I get into her e-mail. She doesn't remember which e-mail it was. I'm going one by one in her inbox. Nope. She then tells me it was from a few months ago. *Are you kidding me?*

I had to sift through 3 months of spam to find it. *It was an EXPIRED spa coupon.* I pointed out that it was expired and she waved it off and told me to print it out. I explained that I would need to transfer it to a flash drive to print off from our computer. She tells me that it should print off from her computer. 'Thats what it does at home!' I have a headache at this point.

Then, the Windows update thing pops up. I ignore it while I'm trying to transfer the file over.'What are you doing? You can't ignore that'. She pulls the laptop toward her and presses update, which requires it to shutdown. No, she didn't postpone it for '4 hours'. She does it for right. now. I am pissed off at this point.

The computer turns off and she turns it back on and lets the 100+ updates proceed. She's there for at least another hour letting it update before giving up and leaving. She didn't even get her coupon.","""Deleted the internet"" (x-post from AskReddit)",691

The script I'd written (in [Ten Minutes](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/qrqsa/ten_minutes_a_day/), above) had succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. Apart from the very occasional printer jam, changing the backup tapes, and occasionally rescuing users from fat-fingering, I had most of the day to myself.

Unfortunately, however, the script was very crude and in certain (rare) cases it would need a once-off alteration to a particular file in order to have enough information to do its job in future. This was an example of when I really, *really* wanted the user to call me directly instead of Trying Something Themselves. So instead of putting up an message saying ""Call the tech guy"", it displayed:
   
  
   
""Error! Not enough [magic](http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/magic.html).""
   
  
   
This fulfilled the purpose of getting people to call me immediately, because the message was so bizarre that they just wanted someone to make it Go Away. Of course, I'd rigged the script so that when they ran it for the first time after my adjustment on the server back end, it displayed:
   
  
   
""[More magic](http://catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html) found!""

So I've arranged to have a lot of spare time on my hands at this one government job, and I've been tinkering with the mainframe scripting language HQ has started developing. I've noticed that my manager (who is not part of IT, but I have to report to *someone* better-paid on the org chart) spends her entire Friday running reports.

And by this, I mean ""manually calling up over *three hundred* mainframe screens one at a time, waiting for them to load, writing down the numbers on a piece of paper, doing basic math on said numbers, and then punching the final handful of figures into a template report which is then physically printed out, goes off to HQ in the internal mailbag, and is probably binned.

It occurs to me that this is the kind of thing computers were invented for. If only there were a guy like me around to automate it.

Wait a moment - **I'm** a guy like me!
   
  
   
So I use the supplied increment and decrement commands in the scripting language to create a library of basic math functions, and write a script which will flick automatically through the 300 screens and record their numbers. (Fortunately, the screen names are very predictable and can be generated in a few loops rather than having to manually specify each one.) Then all the numbers are added, subtracted, multiplied and whatever to get the final result, which is simultaneously displayed on the screen and printed out on the manager's printer as a one-page summary.

The whole process takes about fifteen minutes from go to whoa, most of which is screen retrieval time. Coincidentally, it's also the exact amount of time specified in the union contract for the mid-morning break. So my manager could set it running on Friday morning, go have a nice cup of coffee, and have all her Friday workload done and printed out by the time she got back to her desk.

Given that she was a pretty good (and hands-off) manager, I casually mentioned after the first successful test run that I didn't see any particular reason why I should talk about the existence of this script to any of the other managers in the office. After all, it wasn't _official_, was it?
   
  
   
After that day, I could pretty much get away with almost anything on her watch. Including things like semi-accidentally undermining the state-level helpdesk, or the ""More Magic"" stunt. But those are stories for another time.

One day I was working on detective's PC trying to get a piece of software to work correctly.  I was beating my head against a wall trying to fix this 1990's crapplication so I got up and took a walk.

I was told that I could not leave the detectives office door open when I left, so I walked up and down the hallway a few times within sight of the door waiting for the urge to shoot the PC to pass.

When I finally calmed down, I walked back into the office and noticed a plant sitting on the desk right by the door.  The poor plant is obviously dying and is wilted over so I grab my bottle of water and walk back over to it.

At this point, I take a longer look at the plant right before I dump the water in and realize that I'm actually looking at a pot plant!  There is a small, wilted pot plant just sitting on this detective’s desk and I almost just watered it! It even had an evidence sticker on the side of the planter identifying it as a ""Marijuana Plant"".

I take a few pictures of it and email them to coworkers and get back to finishing up the PC.

As I am working, a group of detectives come back into the office, go over some warrants and leave out to go arrest some local thugs.  As the last one is leaving, I said ""Excuse me sir, but I think you need to water your plant.  It's dying."" 
He turned around and said ""I would, but I'm afraid my buddies would arrest me for cultivation.  That's a Marijuana Plant.""

After a few mins my techs tell me that two laptop screens have blown - looks like the backlight had popped.  Odd but not so odd as to raise an eyebrow.  Dell come and take them apart and put in new screens as per warantee.

A week later we have reason to have a couple of the same model laptops in the office and the screen pops on one of them.

I have a rant but the techy doing the job googles and after a while finds out.....
The laptops have magnets in the case to detect when the lid is shut - rather than a physical switch - so when you stack them up the laptop on the top is affected by the laptop underneath and the screen goes out.  Strangely it doesnt seem to come back on again when you move it..

So we phoned Dell to tell them that they had wasted their time and to ask them to make a note of it.  You can imagine how that went down with the call centre.

One Thursday in September at 7 PM, I pause, looking at the count of tickets.  I click an icon on my desktop.  And the Alleluia Chorus comes out of my machine's speakers.  MY manager comes over - I didn't know he was there - and says to me, ""What's the occasion?""

I point: 48 tickets.  22 emails. ""I'm going home before 10 on a weeknight for the first time since May.""

I do that.  I eat something that's not delivered.  I take a long, hot shower. And I sleep the sleep of the just. 

And at the end of the year, I was rewarded with the best review that anyone had ever heard of, and the best raise percentagewise I'd ever gotten.  The people at Messaging Support... most of them got canned in a run of layouts the next year.

Peanutbuttah,64,119,1nqvq9,567,"So I work for an outsourced IT dept., and we have one client who, aside from their multi-thousand dollar debt to our company, also have the most problems out of any other client. 

So today I get into the office at 9:02. 9:03 and the phone is ringing. I pick up and immediately start getting ripped apart by the owner of this particular client. (Side note--their email was down for a few days this week because of a funky conflict between Outlook and an antivirus.)

Her: I just had to pay my employees, but they haven't worked all week because YOU didn't fix our problems.

Me: Your email problem was particularly hard to fix because we had trouble even diagnosing it, and it is fixed now. Only so-and-so's computer still does not work, but I am working on that as we speak.

(So-and-so could not connect to the internet through Chrome, so we had run an antivirus the night before and then shut off her computer)

Her: Well you need to fix that--oh wait, so-and-so is in my office now, she said she's fixed the problem with her computer!

Me: No, *we* fixed the problem. I ran an antivirus last night, and now she is booting into her virus-free machine.

Her: [unintelligible due to accent]

Me: Are there any other problems that you are experiencing? Why did you call?

Her:  No, no problems.

So then I go to double-check on so-and-so's computer by VNCing in. Within seconds of me getting on, I have a call from so-and-so, who INSISTS that she fixed the problem herself, and not only that, but she is officially disallowing me from working on her machine anymore.

~~~~ wavy lines indicating impending flashback ~~~~

Year and years ago I was working for a one store high street PC shop (One Step Beyond, Norwich, if anyone cares).

A roving sales guy occasionally rung in new business, in this case he'd sold a PC to a woman so she could do her graphic design. It had the works for the time, both hardware and software. I remember Adobe Photoshop 5 going on there, and a bunch of other stuff for webdesign and graphic manipulation. It was also my first introduction to a Wacom tablet. 

Pretty expensive bit of kit, I remember it came to the best part of £1500 all told (19"" CRT, printer etc etc). 

Anyway, I got a call from the guys down stairs. The woman who'd bought it was on the phone and was complaining about it. She'd only just received it and was claiming it didn't work. At all. I took the call (I was a wet behind the ears 17 years old nerd in his first job).

""It doesn't work"" she yells.

""Errm... what doesn't work exactly""

""This bloody computer""

""Yes, I undertand that... does it not power on? Is there an error? Anything else?"" I'm shitting it now, I have to test all these things before they go out. What if I made a mistake!

""It doesn't do my graphics, I need it to make my pictures!"" 

*...extended conversation with increasing horror and confusion on my part and furious rage on her part...*

So it transpires that she isn't a Graphic Designer. She's simply heard about being a graphic designer, and that you need a computer to do it. Our sales guy has got in there, sold her *everything* and happily ignored the fact she obviously doesn't know what she's doing. 

She genuinely expected Photoshop to literally draw stuff for her. She had no clue. I can only imagine she sat in front of the computer and did [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE).

It ended up with her threatening to come down to the shop with placards and her kids, saying that we ruined her business and that she couldn't afford uniforms for her children thanks to us.

I believe that at that point we capitulated, refunded the computer and let her go and be mental somewhere else.","""I need it to make my pictures!""",706
dalgeek,79,100,124uj8,569,"I used to do consulting for a company with rather paranoid management, and most of that paranoia focused on the IT department.  IT was the magical place where bits were arranged but no one understood how, and since the CEO was a bit of a sleazebag himself, he assumed that anyone doing something he didn't understand could not be trusted.  Since I was the consultant, I was often approached to deal with things with an outsiders perspective because I wasn't caught up in the day-to-day politics.

One day the assistant to the COO comes running to me about a potential security breach and describes someone trying to ""hack"" into a computer.  It's a typical hit-and-run, giving me just enough details to think ""WTF?"" and leaving me to figure out the rest.   I hit up the help desk guys who had been dealing with the situation already; the initial complaint was ""erratic mouse behavior"", so they replaced the wireless mouse with a wired mouse.  That didn't fix it, so they did full virus, spyware, rootkit scans to no avail.  However, to upper management, ""erratic mouse behavior"" is a clear sign that someone is h4x0ring your company and stealing your dataz.  Hey, the CEO configured a switch once, he knows these things.

The whole hacking idea gets upper management spun up and they task me with locating a suspected mole in the company who they think is funneling customer data to the competition.  Funny they ask me this, since the guy they want me to investigate is one of my hires (maybe they forgot).  Anyway, the mouse situation is on the back burner (in my mind) while I start digging into SQL and VPN logs, looking for anything unusual.  As I'm neck deep in SQL audit logs one of the helpdesk guys runs over and says ""Hey, it's doing it again, come look"".

I walk over to the vacant workstation and sure enough the mouse cursor is wandering around the screen.  It's at a locked log in screen and the movement doesn't coincide with any elements on the screen, so it definitely did not look purposeful.  I stand up and look around, noticing that the girl sitting across from the cubicle with the possessed mouse was vigorously editing spreadsheets, clicking all over the place.  ""Hey, J, move your mouse to the left"".  She moves her mouse to the left, the mouse on the screen jitters to the left.  I peek behind the computer and find that the help desk guys had left the wireless receiver plugged in after they replaced the mouse.  Why? Because the keyboard needed the receiver.  And everyone in the area had the same $30 Logitech Keyboard/Mouse combo.

Unfortunately the avalanche that was started with the hacked mouse cursor had already broken away from the top of the mountain and was picking up speed.  The DBA who was being investigated opened his mouth to the COO about something that set off the lawyers (who were already on edge over the data breach) so they fired him.  And anyone who worked with him, had drinks with him, or said ""Hi"" in the hallway more than once a week.  All told, 15-20 people in IT were canned within the week.  The only people left were the IT manager, a handful of developers, the help desk guys, and one network admin.

The most ironic part?  The data breach was not perpetrated by the DBA, or anyone else in IT with high-level system access.  Why would a bunch of people making near six figures risk getting fired or arrested?  Nope, it was the $10/hour sales drones who were screen-scraping customer data as they went through accounts and emailing it to their former coworkers who now worked for the competition (the e-mail trail was found later).  There was some poetic justice though; the company was being sued left and right for various reasons, and they fired all of the technical people who could have bailed them out.

TL;DR - $30 hacker mouse starts avalanche of paranoia, which culminates in 15-20 good IT employees getting fired while the sales drones who actually were stealing data are left unscathed.",The mouse that roared (and killed the IT department).,669

Silver_Star,194,133,1941ck,564,"In the 7th grade, I had a 'computer class'.

The material wasn't how a computer works or what software does it was basically, 'A CPU is like the brain, video cards don't exist, RAM doesn't do anything, this is what each peripheral does, now lets practice how to type incorrectly.'. 

Since the teacher only knew how to 'type', and had no idea what anything else did besides what was in her teaching guide, I was generally the person who could fix anything.

I know now why you shouldn't be looked up/down to as the class IT, but I didn't know at the time. I liked the status.

When a computer on the otherside of the class room started acting all weird, obviously the video memory from the looks of it, I was blamed. Why? Because I was the only one capable of using a computer and *therefore* I was the only one capable of breaking it. 

Confused as these accusations, I offered to fix it. It was a simple reboot, but the computer teacher refused to let me do that, saying it would break the memory. 

Not sure why I was told to fix it, and then when I said how, I was denied...

Anyway, I got out of school suspension for three days because of that. When the district IT came to fix it, which was *turning it on and off* the very same day, I wasn't even provided amnesty.

Now Read On...

Working to keep two thousand top-level civil servants happy day-to-day meant a lot of running around, but no moreso than the weekend we were summoned and told that the central building in HQ was rejuggling the internal locations of all its teams for whatever arcane reasons had drifted down from the politicosphere. This meant that volunteers were being sought to perform the physical breakdown, relocation, and reassembly of approximately a thousand PCs across many floors of government offices, over the course of a single weekend.  

Hell no.  

...and volunteers would get double overtime bonuses.  

Hell yes!  
   

And so it was that I found myself and four other ~~penniless bastards~~ strapping volunteers walking into the workplace on a Saturday morning for a rundown on which computers in which locations were being moved to what desks on other floors where. This was not so much a problem in the cases where the move was taking place on the same building floor (and both sides of the floor were accessible from each other instead of there being a wall in the way), even when the layout was somewhat mazelike. Break the PC down into components, wrap the cables, tote the PC (and CRT monitor, of course) to the other side of the building, plunk on desk, reassemble and remember to plug the network cable back in.  

We got started with these in order to warm up and because it was easy to keep track of each other - just yell across the floor. And it wasn't too hard - the most annoying bit was lugging a desktop case and 17"" glass tube in one go while trying to make sure none of the accessories got dropped along the way, while making sure everything got to the right desk (some of which were not labeled).  

So far, so good. We got through about 25% of the workload by lunchtime, and considered ourselves on track.  

Then came everything else.  
   
  
It turns out that it takes a significantly longer time to stump across a floor-maze with a double-armful of IT kit, juggle it in order to press the elevator button, wait for the elevator, juggle the kit again to press the floor button, ride the elevator, trudge across the other floor, dump the gear and reconnect it, and then walk all the way back. We started to fall behind schedule. By the end of the day, we'd done perhaps 35-40% of the total moves, and were a bit discouraged. We made our ways home thinking about what we'd need to do tomorrow.  

Sunday, we arrived back in the office, and one of our compadres had had an Idea. He'd found some goods trolleys in the maintenance department, and, uh 'borrowed' them. They weren't anything fancy, just giant skateboards with long handles on, but you could fit maybe three, four computers on them at a time. Surely with this increase in productivity, we could transport everything so efficiently we'd be done by lunch!  
   
  
...yeah.  
   
  
Lunch rolled around, and we were still only about two-thirds complete. We were also slowing because we'd been leaving the longest hauls for last, and these were taking more and more time. We weren't going to make it.  

And then someone found the tubs.  

The plastic storage/transport tubs were apparently used at one point to transport large amounts of physical mail around the building. These things were about three feet high, about the same across, and nearly six long. If you've seen large plastic storage tubs, you know what I'm talking about. We saw them, and instantly realised that there might be a chance to make this work after all. One ~~blatant theft~~ *borrowing* of the tubs later, our new PC transportation regime went like this:  

1) Everyone showed up to the source location for a move. We then proceeded to rip the PCs apart like we were looking for gold coins in the wreckage.  
2) The base units and monitors would get tossed into the tubs, which would go on the trolleys. Eight, ten, twelve at a time - a dangerously swaying tower of breakable IT kit. Then, a trolley-wrangler, a stablizer, and someone carrying twelve sets of keyboards and mice would hoof it pronto to the nearest elevator.  
3) Everyone left behind would continue stripping PCs down, or if there were none left at that location, move on to the next one and start componentizing like they could sell the parts.  
4) Meanwhile, the trolley squad unloaded all the PCs and parts at the destinations and left them in pieces. One person stayed behind to manage reassembly - they would rejoin the disassembly team once they were done. The other two took off at a run to the next location where there were piles of beige bits waiting, snag one of the disassemblers to be their third, and the process repeated.  
   
  
Effectively, all of us were continually on the move or doing *something*, whether that be pulling PCs to pieces, putting parts-puzzles to rights, or booking it between those two ever-changing locations with an unstable cartload of expensive things. HUT HUT HUT!  

With fifteen minutes to spare, we made it. And come Monday, we had *absolutely no idea* why a couple of people were ringing us to say their computers weren't turning on, or their keyboards weren't responding, or their screens were upside-down... still, out of a thousand moves under heavy time constraints, even our management acknowledged there were always going to be one or two which needed a little fine-tuning.  

It was, we all agreed, simply a mysterious coincidence that the affected people were overwhelmingly ones who'd irritated the IT department in the last three months. And at least none of them had to look at my latest invention, which I'd dubbed Cthulhu's Desktop...  
   
  
   
...but that's a story for another time.

PKLKickballer,141,137,rukwd,561,"I maintain a basic conference room.  Until last week it was nothing fancy, just a projector and computer which sat in an AV cabinet.  When I inherited this, people who wanted to use their own laptop would unplug everything in the cabinet and hook it up to their own computer.  Obviously, I'd be called on almost daily to re-plug everything in right.

I started updating this system.  Step 1, put in a KVM switch which was clearly labeled, easy to access hookups to networking, video, audio, etc, along with detailed illustrated instructions posted nearby.  People still unplugged everything.  Step 2, signage on the AV cabinet reminding people to use the other connections and referring them to the nearby instructions.  Still destroyed daily.  Step 3, a sign taped over the connections on the back of the computer with my phone number and (nearby) office number and a note that pleaded for them to simply plug into the other connections.  Sign is torn off and cables unplugged.

Finally I decided to replace the ancient system I had inherited in there with something more modern and foolproof.  A projector with wireless capability was installed.  Instead of a computer in the AV cabinet, I provide a laptop, pre-configured to work with the wireless projector, as well as get online via wifi.  Hey, no wires to screw up!

Still though, I left an ethernet cable and a vga cable coming out of the wall, just in case somebody needed to plug in.  They are cables, but really there is no way to plug them in wrong, and they won't affect the operation of the provided laptop.  Sure enough, I peeked in and saw somebody happily using their own laptop without a problem.  All is right with the world.

That is until this morning when the custodians asked me if I meant for the cables to be thrown out.  Huh?  Well, with no way to plug things in wrong, the people decided to finish the presentation, unplug the cables from the wall and throw them away.  Why?

MrTig,132,138,1qonc9,565,"So back to my days of technical support for many an ISP, we had a repeat caller for slow internet access.

The customer used ADSL, which I'm sure most of you understand comes with in heavy italics and bold letters ""up to"" next to any figure. This chap was on ""up to 8meg"" and within a fair distance of his exchange, about 1.4km, so he should be getting between 3-6meg all depending on other factors.

Cust: My connection is really slow, it keeps getting worse and you guy's never solve my issue.

MrTig: Okay, let me take a quick look over your previous tickets so we don't go over old ground.

MrTig: Okay, I can see you've done pretty much everything we would normally ask you, just to check you've not moved the router upstairs or to another non-master socket?

Cust: Nope, it's still there as you told me, blinking away.

MrTig: Right, I need to run a line test, give me a few minutes and I'll have the results. -5 Mins- Right the line test shows that it does appear to be dropping off every day and then coming back up again in the morning, you've not got any home alarm system plugged into the line or an emergency medical service ?

Cust: Nope, just my phone through a filter and the router filtered.

MrTig: Hrmm, let me have a look at one more thing. 

Noticing that this issue seemed to happen daily at around 9-10pm at night and come back on at roughly 7am every day I had an epiphany.

MrTig: Sir, could I ask, when you decided it's time to call it a night, are you by chance turning off the router?

Cust: Yes, it uses up power doesn't it. I thought that be fine.

MrTig: In this case, that'll be the problem, could you leave it on for say the next week and monitor the line for me, I suspect you'll see it get better within a few days.

Sure enough within two days the line has retrained itself from 256kbps (essentially a diagnostic level speed) to 4200kps.

kilamumster,84,201,16gtb5,566,"It was a complaint call that I will never forget.

At a former job, I would come in early and there was a bit of quiet before the tech support calls would start rolling in. On this morning, though, there was a voice message waiting. The display indicated it had come in late on the previous night, a sign that it was one of the bosses. Serious stuff. Uh-oh. I sat up straighter and retrieved the message.

At first, I was mystified-- between having trouble understanding the loud ranting and trying to identify the caller's voice. It was a woman..no, a man, with an effeminate, deep voice. Who is this? I wondered. 

I listened to the message again, and made out bits of it, all spoken passionately and dramatically, ""last night... came in, rude staff, especially woman at front..."" I thought, wait... we aren't open late, and there is no woman at the front desk. What is this?

""I know it was late but shouldn't give customers attitude...never been so upset in my life...  surely going to call your national office!"" Ah. National office? It was a local company, no national anything.

The caller continued, ""And we are never buying your pizza again!"" Ah. That sealed it, apparently our support line telephone number was one off from the LargeCardboard Pizza Chain neighbourhood restaurant number.

What to do? After I'd stopped laughing, listening to the call again, laughed some more? Well, she (we'll call her 'she') was upset, and had a good point. I think she deserved to have her complaint heard by the right people. It was a slow day. So I called her back!

I was gentle, very straight with her that I know she didn't know it was a wrong number, so she should call the correct one and definitely tell them her story. She was embarrassed. I said it could happen to anyone. Said I wished all of my callers cared so much about doing a good job. Wished her good luck and closed the call.

Me: Uh... Sure.

I didn't witness the incident, but a few of my coworkers did. This poor user, I shit you not, **ran himself over with his own car** on his way into the store. 

Apparently, before exiting his vehicle, he neglected to take it out of drive. Predictably, it rolled forward, and he somehow managed to become pinned between his car and the car parked in front of him. He wasn't seriously injured, though he never did get his router issue resolved.

CleanBill,115,113,u3rrk,561,"Back in the 3.5"" floppy disk days, I had a small office customer who had 3-4 computers there for their accountants. I used to do maintenance on their PC's. The secretary there mentioned that accounts and turnover were completely on the computers and if that was lost, all the books would be gone. I offered them to setup daily backup copies to keep all data safe in tapes.

Their CEO refused on the grounds that it was ridiculous to pay someone for something he could do himself.

Fair enough, so as time went and as you can imagine shit hit the fan and all their data was lost due to a new virus (back in those days, a common occurence). So I asked for the backup copies to restore all the accounts info and the CEO went :""sure here they are....""

SURPRISE!!! he handed me pages and pages of photocopied disks that he religiously performed everyday (you know , an ACTUAL PHOTO ON PAPER of the disk). You should have seen how angry the guy got when I told him that's not how you make backup copies of data....

It wouldn't matter to him:

* How many times I explained to him that data on disks was stored in a magnetic support and photocopy machines work on refracted light.

* How many times I explained to him that it didn't matter he photocopied religiously all data everyday and that all pages were ordered (really? like it made a difference and I would go ""oh sir! My apologies, since it's all so neat and tidy everything is going to work"").

* He insisted I HAD TO try to recover the data somehow using the photocopies (!!!). No matter how many times I went through point 1 and 2 , he would still insist ""JUST TRY DAMN IT!"". Needless to say unerase tools proved unefective...

* He threatened me to give bad feedback to their associates about me. I told him fair enough, as long as you explain everybody the whole story, specially the part were he foolishly thought he was making COPIES by PHOTOCOPYING THE MEDIA where the data was stored on.

Oh and I forgot the best bit. One of the things that he suggested was ""maybe I should have made color copies instead?"" .... I wanted so badly to tell him ""reaaaaally? reaaally dude? are you reaaaally that dumb?""...

When I was still going to school I used to work in a gas station as a clerk.  A little down the road there was a Dairy Queen franchise whose owner used to come in quite often, and we'd shoot the breeze.

Eventually I got a job at Best Buy in the Geek Squad (literally behind the gas station).  One day the man who owned the Dairy Queen came in to get some RAM installed in his laptop.  Delighted at seeing me again (and remarking that he had just asked the people at the gas station where I had went) I got his specifics and we started to chat like old times. He mentioned that his daughter was going back to Europe at the end of the week for her second year of college and that he was not looking forward to the phone bill.  His wife and daughter were really close and they would talk daily, so the international charges added up fast.

I asked him if his daughter had a laptop and he replied in the affirmative.  I plugged the laptop into our network and I went to skype's website.  I explained to him what VoIP was, and that if he got a headset for his laptop and his daughters he could talk to her for free over skype.  He could even use a webcam to literally see her whenever he wanted.  He thanked me and promised to look in to it when he got home.

A couple of weeks later he came back and started to thank me profusely.  He said that skype was working perfectly for them. He had also purchased a webcam and while the internet was sometimes spotty where she was causing the video to cut out, it was an immense relief to be able to see his daughter on a regular basis.

rederic,84,107,10y3d6,556,"###The Adventures of Pete

*Pete was an older gentleman I worked with. He talked his way into a management position by hypnotizing the company owner with jargon and buzzwords. ""Java"", ""Drupal"", and ""automagically"" were the core of his vocabulary. Pete wasn't with us for very long, but he will always be infamous.    
These are The Adventures of Pete, and I assure you they are mostly true.*

##\#001 Meet Java

It was Pete's first week on the job, and to us lowly peons it was clear that although Pete may have once been well versed in technology and computing this was no longer the case. Middle management told us that the owner hired him to relaunch our flagship product, a web-based service powered by PHP and SQL, using Java. Java, as Pete loved to remind us, is the wave of the future; there is absolutely nothing it can't do.

Pete's insistence on change was met with resistance, and rightly so. The programmers had just spent the last two years optimizing spaghetti code written by a man who got up and left the company in a hurry, and they weren't too keen on learning a programming language just to ""revitalize"" a rapidly growing website as a Java desktop application. Especially since they were also expected to provide technical support.

More new faces began to appear at the company, and after some questioning and vague answers, the Office Manager was able to piece together that Pete was creating positions at the company — and filling them. What nobody suspected, however, was that Pete was also preparing his new hires to move forward with the second phase of his plan to increase revenue at the company.

I walked into the office on a Monday morning, early as usual. The receptionist had powered her computer on, stepped away to start the coffee brewing, and was just returning to her desk.    
""What the fuck is this?"" she exclaimed as I walked by.

On top of my job description as a graphic designer, the IT and networking duties had fallen into my lap months before. Looking at her monitor, I noticed with some confusion the typical user login prompt… with a Linux UI. I figured somebody left a Live CD in the tray by accident, or as a joke, and assured her I would take care of it as soon as I got settled. I proceeded to my cubicle, turned on my workstation, and gaped in horror.    
""What the fuck is this?""

It wasn't just the receptionist's computer, and it wasn't a Live CD prank. Pete, with his newly hired minions, had taken it upon himself to install Linux on every workstation of a company that relied on Windows software. His explanation? ""We can't move forward with Java until the entire office is Open Source.""    
And that was only week one.

robotortoise,168,152,1lu0rh,557,"So I'm enjoy playing PC games, and, like a lot of people, like using the Wii/Gamecube emulator Dolphin. I can usually run games at 60 FPS at 1080p, including CPU intensive games like Super Mario Galaxy. (Yes, they're MY backup games. No piracy here....for Wii games, anyways.)
So my story of tech frustration begins. No, it's not a story of a senile old man or a chubby child, or a young idiotic teenager. This is the story of *my* incompetence. This is the story of passion. Of drama.

And most of all, this is a story about transparency. When a computer says something, *it means it.*

I was frustrated. I had been fiddling with my PC settings for HOURS and still it was running slower than usual. Dolphin was running much slower than normal. Like, visibly slower. Half speed, even for non-CPU heavy games. And nothing I could do could fix it. I tried installing and uninstalling, and finally I just gave up, telling myself it was my GPU. (As I was getting a new GPU regardless.)

So my Asus GTX 660 arrived in the mail. I took multiple pictures of me holding it like I was a love-deprived neckbeard suddenly with a rocket-sexy girlfriend (Wait, I was, wasn't I?) and I installed it in my computer. ""No biggie,"" I thought to myself. This baby is an Nvidia card. I already have Nvidia drivers. It'll be a piece of cake. It got stuck on the BIOS. Like, it would get stuck on the BIOS splash screen and wouldn't let me press any keys or ANYTHING. I was pissed. (It wasn't my PSU, before you think of it. I have a 750 watt PSU, and it's NOT overload at all.)

I tried clearing the CMOS, installing the new BIOS, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, using the card on other computers, replugging and unplugging contact pins and PSU cables, talked to ASUS tech support for three hours, (they had *no clue.*) reinstalling old GPUs, (worked fine) putting my new card in another computer, (Card wasn't bum) and eventually just gave up and sent the damned thing back to Newegg for a $30 fee. (&amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;)

The kicker? 
It was an Asus motherboard. It was an ASUS M5A99X EVO R2.0. ...yeah. So apparently Asus can't make their own hardware compatible with itself.

Anyways, after I got a new GTX 660 from EVEGA that worked, I ran Dolphin, hoping it would work. **IT WOULDN'T.** 
Enraged, I clicked through setting after setting in a rampage, hoping for something eating the CPU or GPU. I uninstalled my Antivirus. Nope. Scanned for malicious software. Found two things, but still slow gaming. And you know what bugged me even more?

I had a GT660 and a AMD FX-8530, two (relatively) high-end components, and games like Team Fortress 2 were still dropping below 60 FPS. Constantly. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

Finally after being fed up with Windows8000 for the last time, I bombed it. I inserted that little inconspicuous disc labeled ""Windows 8 Boot Disc"". I reinstalled Windows.

Now, this is nothing new. I've done this countless times before. But those were in times of necessity. (New motherboard, slow computer, yada yada.) But this was a whole new level of piss.

And you know what? 
**It worked!**
I was running Super Mario Galaxy at a constant 60 FPS at 1080p! I was running Team Fortress 2 at a constant 60 FPS! I was **on top of the world!** Danger? I LAUGH AT YOU! POWER BEFORE MY TREMBLE MIGHT! MWHAAHAHAAA!

....shit. It happened again.

My computer was running games slowly again. Back to the grinding 45 FPS. I was like a console peasant trapped in a computer Master Race's body. My soul was crushed. 

Why, cruel fate? Why can't I run games at a slightly faster speed than all those around me? ***WHAT HAVE I DONE?!?***

Luckily, I hadn't done much the day before, when Dolphin and games were working fine. So I went through all I had done. I installed Office 2007. Hm....doubt that's it. I had Office 2007 before, and it worked fine with games. I removed some apps at boot with Soluto. Could that be it? Nope, as I later found out adding everything back to boot.

What could it be? What else did I do on that sacred day of destin-.....Oh.

Oh. Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

I slowly pointed to the Start menu, typing in ""power"". I clicked on ""Power Options"". I changed it to the default plan.
...Everything worked fine. The games all ran at a solid 60 FPS.

Power-saving plans save power, all right. They save power, and limit performance. Even if your CPU is clocked at 100% in the Power Saving settings, that doesn't do any good. It's still gonna limit you. Maybe it also limits your brain's CPU abilities as well, as I found out.

[deleted],154,194,10ih8u,555,"The following short tale of woe was observed recently. The characters are Shebeast, an aged chain smoking manager who adds up Excel columns using a handheld calculator, which pretty much says it all, and Jehoshaphat, a remote software company technician whose actual name I don't know so I gave him one I liked. This story is from the perspective of a bemused observer as related to me.

Shebeast calls and yells at technical support because her software isn't working. What this actually means, is that her software isn't working the way she expects it to and is, in fact, working fine, but regardless some updates are in order. Jehoshaphat walks her through running the updates, which consists of the highly complex task of typing in an URL and pressing run, then next twice, during which time she complains non-stop about working features of the software that she doesn't know how to use, and how she doesn't have time for this. 

*Yes, she's so busy today because she's using a handheld calculator to add and manually enter the results of the additions of columns from Excel, and she is so abusive to the staff that no one dares explain to her the wizardry that is Excel's column summation function.*

Post update, the technician asks Shebeast to reboot the system by clicking start, clicking shutdown, and selecting reboot. She responds to these instructions by pressing and holding down the power button on the server, then informing the technician that she has followed his instructions. It's at this point that our faceless observer has to leave the room for fear of their headache becoming terminal.

Which is funny, because without decent technology, we don't make *any* money, but I digress. Recently, the PHB and I managed to convince senior manglement that yes, it **was* a bad thing that everyone stored business critical work - you know, stuff that, if it goes missing, costs loads of money because contracts get missed and shit like that - on local hard disks of computers that were, for the most part, 3 years old.



    
So, we managed to get budget to buy a reasonably decent fileserver (8Tb raid 6 storage) and tape backup unit, and sent specific instructions - with reminders - on how to move data from users local hard drives onto the server. We pointed out the joys of tape backup, and of being able to share documents and work without trying to email 10, 20, 30 or even 50 meg files to each other, or walking around the office with a bunch of USB keys to swap files. we walked around and specifically asked people if they had successfully moved their data to the server share, and assisted if they had problems.


    



And Lo, all was happy in the world.


    


Or so I thought.


    


Yesterday, as I was about to go home (isn't that *always* the way these things work), one of our training developers (makes internal and external training course material for staff and clients) came to me and said her computer was giving her a disk error which indicated a pretty catastrophic failure.



    



No big deal - we'll just give her a new laptop with a standard image, stick on her custom software and then get the failed unit repaired.



""But what about my work? Can you move that to the new computer?""



Cue look of absolute, complete and utter astonishment on my part.



Turns out that saving her data to the server was too slow when she was working at home via VPN, so she kept her local copy, and all her work, for the last **2** years was on the local disk. when she'd told us she had moved her data to the server, she flat out lied when she said she'd done it.



    



Much weeping and wailing occurred when I said I could, in all probability, not recover her data - despite my best efforts - without the management coughing up big dollars for a professional data recovery agency, and even *then*, if the bad sectors had data on them, it was unlikely they'd get it all back.



    



I'm sure the brown smelly stuff is going to impact with the rotating air distribution blades over this, but it's not going to stick to me - I've got documented proof that I checked with everyone about moving their data - a signed checklist from **every** user, even.



**tl;dr** Everybody lies. With apology to Greg House.

With all these rooms, I can proudly say I've built a pretty solid reputation for my quick turnaround for solutions and coverage for all of my responsibilities.

So, today, one of my bosses approaches me and says ""Just the guy I was looking for!""

Most of you know, with the correct tone, this basically implies ""I know you're good, but you done goofed.""  Naturally, I was a bit nervous.  Surgeons and doctors are notoriously picky and egotistical; lots of things will set them off and really don't require a good reason to get angry about some perceived slight against their OR.  At this point, I was about as excited as though someone told me I needed to finish my vegetables before I could go play with my friends, but this boss is one of the better ones and if he's coming to me like this I must've goofed somewhere...

But where?

Well, as it turns out, Boss has the answer.  Apparently, a room ""told me"" about a room not having image capabilities to a wall-mounted television ""almost 2 months ago.""  Also, they really needed this wall image to display mri/ct scans for an important case coming up and the doctor was not happy at all that the room couldn't handle ""basic"" tasks.

Naturally, this is now an emergency.

At this point I was doubting myself.  I had set that room up myself and tested each connection.  Network was good, cables were good, machines were fine and the program was running flawlessly providing any image they could possibly want from any hospital system.  Frankly, I've got the small battery of tests down to a science; where'd I go wrong?!  Did I really miss this and they ""told"" me?

So, I venture down to the room in a leisurely manner (i.e. ""power walk"") and open the door...

*To them using the monitor with absolutely no issues whatsoever.*

Well, great, now to figure out what happened.  Some quick interrogation reveals to me the following annoying discovery.

The person in question who said it ""wasn't working"" assumed the monitor would turn on *automatically* if he brought up images...

*So he kept the monitor turned off until he ""needed"" it, and when it didn't work he tried to pin it on me.*

Best part about it is that it wasn't a single offender; someone in the room backed him up that a monitor was to turn itself on when he brought up the images.

justMaku,235,174,xo4ou,554,"So, here's the story from strange land of Poland where Arctic bears wanders on streets and users type with one finger.

So, I was working for a medium size company (About 50 employees, 60 machines, 10 servers) doing everything. From tech support to server administration. Company's owner was old man always selecting selecting the cheapest solutions. So no AD, no SAN, Windows XP Home Edition on most of the machines etc. Most of the employees were young people, they had some knowledge about computers, but there's the story of the youngest of them all (being 19 years old at the time).

Let's call her Kasia (because that was her name). Kasia worked in ticket sales, mostly responding to emails from customers about the pricing and making reservations. When she joined the company we had no PC for her so the company had to buy a new one: a Windows 7  Dell Laptop. We had to clean all of the Dell's shit from it, add user shares, configure email accounts - normal everyday stuff. But we didn't had time to do one thing: install security updates. As I said before: no AD, no deploying, just download, install, reboot. Because the boss told us about new employee on friday, and she was starting on monday, we just gave her the laptop on monday morning, told her how internal systems works and warned her about possible updates installs she may see.

""Yeah, ok, it's fine, I have same PC at home, no problems, I know computers"". Nope. She didn't.

After 2 or 3 months I've got a call from her:

""Hey, you have to turn off the updates!!! I can't work at all, they pop up every week and they take forever to install!!!!!! You said I will have to install them only one time!""

Sigh. Ok, maybe there's something wrong. I go to her desk, and she starts screaming at me, pointing to the display. I take a close look, and all I see is Windows installing some kind of update. 

* Me: So... What's the problem? How long have it been like that alredy?
* Her: I don't know. Minute? Two?
* Me: Oh, so that's normal, when did the last update took place?
* Her: Last wednesday
* Me: That's normal too, Microsoft publishes new updates all the time, do you remember how long did it take to install last update?
* Her: 2-3 minutes, but that's not true, Microsoft doesn't so much updates! There must be something wrong with this PC!
* Me: Excuse me, but Microsoft does publish updates as soon as possible when they found new vulnerabilties
* Her: But my home PC never had any updates! My private Laptop doesn't update at all! I want this PC to work that way too!

Okay, and now I know where are we heading. There are two ways now: just  ignore security policies (which were pretty non-existient) or act like douchebag and show her she's an idiot. I took the second one.

Me: *sigh* Ok, I see you have your private laptop with you, let me show you something.

She starts her laptop, shitloads of programs on autostart, dozens of icons on desktop, pinky background, I belive I've even seen a thumbnail of a picture of her naked.

But most important thing: her private laptop booted into Windows 7 Ultimate.
So i just cloed it, flipped it over and checked one more thing: yup, it had a Windows XP sticker on it. Jackpot.

Me: I'm sorry but you have illegal operating system installed on your laptop. That's why you don't have any updates. Microsoft is not kind enough to give them to the thefts. And one more thing. You can't bring this device here. We don't want to have any problems with police or Microsoft getting reports about illegal software from our network (of course I made up that part).

Now Read On...

---  

[In the last exciting episode](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/u5yeu/weeklong_rebuilds_let_me_see_that/), the week-long workstation rebuild process at my employer had been cut down to 24 hours. This did free up some time, although of course the Helpdesk received absolutely no recognition of this improvement.  

It was about this time that, musing on the rebuild process, I asked myself why it was necessary at all to physically transport the PC away from its desk and building, into the Helpdesk area, crack the case, attach a floppy drive, and so on and so forth, simply to rearrange the bits on the hard drive. After all, they all had network connections, right?
   

So I looked at the build disk images, and of course they were pretty much shells around booting a PC, establishing a network connection, and then just pulling down the workstation software. Pretty simple. In fact, there was really no reason to run them from floppy at all except that it was convenient when the hard disk got formatted.  

Now, sure, we *could* have simply stuck a two-meg partition on the workstation and booted/reimaged from there, but management didn't want to do that. Sigh. Thus the whole debacle with floppies and the related schlepping of PC carcasses back and forth.  

*However*, if, for example, the repartitioning and reformatting processes were separated out into a batch file of their own, the entire rest of the build process (sixty to ninety minutes) could be run to completion from the hard disk.  
   
  
Hmm!  
   
  
Some slicing and dicing later, I had an FDISK-and-FORMAT batch file which would also ask which OS to build to, copy the relevant sections of a floppy build disk to C:\BUILDDISK, kick off the build process, and then clean up after itself. And while we couldn't get approval for a keyboard stuffer capable of driving FDISK, FORMAT was fully automatable from the command line.  

(And yes, I know now about FDISK &lt; inputfile, but I didn't at the time.)  
   
  
Workstation rebuilds now consisted of:  
- stick a floppy in the workstation and reboot;  
- choose an OS (it would write a flag file to the floppy);  
- fly through the FDISK repartition options;  
- watch the workstation fast-format automatically and copy files down to the hard disk; and  
- eject the floppy and boogie on back to the Helpdesk while the workstation self-built.  
   
  
After a couple of process refinements (sticking an A4 sheet over the keyboard saying ""DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE THIS [end-of-build screenshot], and turning mice upside-down because the rebuild software used at the site was fragile and stupidly sensitive to user input), this new method worked brilliantly. Apart from having to hang around for the fast-format, it didn't waste much tech time - and certainly less than having to crack a case, attach a drive, run upstairs to the server room each time etc - and we could GBTW in five or ten minutes. From the user perspective, a week-long process which had dropped to one day was now almost entirely completable over a lunch break. Scheduling most of the rebuilds for lunches or at the end of the day also enabled us to minimize disruption to employees and teams overall in cases where a PC needed rebuilding but was still more-or-less running and being used.  

   

The best bit? Users could now no longer play the old ""Oh the computer is busted, time to report it and spend the next week doing bugger-all at my desk until IT gets it back to me"" game. Anyone pulling that stunt now got two hours, max, and most managers in the public service at the time would not assign your work to someone else if you were only offline for two hours - you just had to suck it up and work harder. Particularly if one of those hours was your lunch break anyway!  

Funny, how a lot of employees who had annoyed the Helpdesk over the years, and were well-known to be slackers, suddenly found their best work-avoidance excuse utterly destroyed in the weeks that followed. I got a LOT of ""Oh God no"" looks when I cheerfully informed them *and their boss* that instead of a week's downtime, I could now have them up and running in ninety minutes flat, and that they could use a workstation in the next section over in the meantime so they wouldn't miss a *single minute* of work...
  
   
  
Of course, all this extra productivity meant that the users also had more time to test the rather Swiss-cheese-like security around the government systems. Thus leading to the incident I like to call The Alsatian Porn and the Executive Printer...
   
  
...but that's a story for another time.

Another story from my magical job at the now closed dial-up company.
*****

There are times where you just get calls that blow your mind.  I've already posted about some of the stranger ones, like the cow eating the phone line or the illiterate drunk who wanted internet for Porn and NASCAR.  This is another tale of mystery and action whereupon our intrepid hero once again is in shock on his way to victory.


This repeat caller was one that I got from my first day on the job almost to the last day on the job.  He called in at least once a week.  It was always the same story, the same steps to fix the issue, yet he never seemed to remember them.  It even got to the point where I knew his wife's name, his childrens' names and even his pet dog's name.  


This gentleman was a nice enough fellow.  A bit daft in the head from what he claimed to be a brain injury - probably why he couldn't remember things - but was polite, loved to laugh, and was in general someone that made the job well worthwhile.  His problem every week was cleaning out malware/spyware.  


It was simple enough to walk him through how to update Malwarebytes and run it, and since he had a 2nd phone line - and the queue was almost never busy - I didn't mind chatting with him for the half-hour to 45 minutes it took to download malware definition updates and get through the scan.  Being as how I could see what websites he visited from my end - working at an ISP gives you access to things like this - I knew it was a porn addiction, but didn't say anything, as he was an affable fellow and decent enough on the phone.


This went on for those 2 years.  Near the end of my time at the company, when I told him I was gonna be leaving in a couple of weeks, he was sad, but asked me to be patient with him as he wanted to walk through the steps to clean up his computer one more time and write them down so he could do it on his own.  No problem.  I spent nearly 1 1/2 hours on the phone with him doing this.  


Then the phonecall was over.  About 5 hours later, it was nearing the end of my shift, and I noticed on our Radius Server that he was dialing in over and over and over.  I called him up to see if he was having issues - standard procedure for us at the time: if they are dialing in over and over, call them to help them before they call us all frustrated.  


It wasn't him I got when I called.  I got his wife.  She had no idea the computer was even attempting to dial-on as it was downstairs in the basement and everyone but her was out of the house for the evening as her kids were at a friend's house and her husband out with friends at a local college basketball game.  Since that was the issue, I told her it was probably a dialer (for those that remember, illicit programs designed to dial into long distance numbers to rack up huge charges that are hard to dispute).  I advised her it would be a good thing to go turn off the computer and unhook it from the phone line until it was cleaned up of the malware.  


She went downstairs to check.  Cue her suddenly breathing in loudly followed by an earsplitting scream, loud banging and doors slamming and heavy footsteps, the sounds of a gun going off, glass shattering, and then heavy breathing.  


She got back on the phone as I was starting to call the police to go to her house, and the following is a paraphrasing of what happened after she explained the ruckus:
*****
Apparently, her husband had lied to her about going out with his friends.  He had snuck their neighbor's underage daughter into their basement and was having sex with her while watching a likely illegal type of Porn - apparently the source of the dialer I had her go to check on.  


I have no idea why she had to point out the type of porn, but she did.  She got mad, and in her rage, shot her TV with her pistol while running the neighbor girl out of the house.  She then 'calmly' told me to stop dialing the police - I was in the middle of dialing her local police dept. - and that she would call them and report him herself.

themasterkser,143,132,1jujd3,556,"So a little bit of background about what I do:

I run tech support for thermostats, basically determining whether an issue can be solved over the phone or if a technician needs to be sent out to someones' house to service it on-site.

We get alot of wacky calls in the office, but today this one took the cake.

I'm sitting at my desk, idly browsing reddit, when a wild caller appears! He starts off by asking me disjointed questions about thermostats and air conditioners. Normally I wouldn't mind answering fairly random things like this, but there's a queue building and I want to wrap this one up quick.

So I ask him what seems to be wrong with his thermostat. Of course, he doesn't answer me and continues to ramble about things unrelated. So it's one of these calls. Sigh.

After a few minutes of this back-and-forth nonsense I manage to pry out of him that his air conditioner outside is running, but the temperature inside his house isn't going down.

This is a fairly common issue that people call us for. Their compressor outside is running but the air isn't being cooled, and the compressor isn't stopping. It's usually a frozen line or a freon leak, and has nothing to do with the thermostat. We don't service air conditioners here, only thermostats.

I calmly explain this to the customer(he's getting progressively more upset), and he goes ballistic. He asks if I'm a ""technical person"". I tell him that I am technically-minded, and had a good idea of what was happening. He says ""NO. I mean are you a TECHNICAL PERSON?"".

-""Well sir, I'm not HVAC certified if that's what you're aski-""

-""Then how do you know?!"" ""I want to speak to a TECHNICAL PERSON!""

Now here's the kicker: The thermostat he has installed is a model that we no longer service, as per our contract with the local utility.

-""Unfortunately I won't be able to put you into contact with one of our technicians, as we do not service this thermostat""

-""You installed it i want it fixed! yadda yadda""(This continues for a few minutes of him ranting)

-""As much as I'd like to help you, we don't service this thermostat. I cannot have one of our techs take a look at it. Even if you replaced the thermostat you would still have this issue, it really isn't something we can fix here anyway.""

And this is the point where he prettymuch guaranteed that after finishing the call the rest of the office would know of his dickish behaviour:

-""Do you know the function of a thermostat?!""

-""Well yes, it's used to regulate the temperature in the home, sir.""

-""Well then I want it fixed because of that!""

-""I.. I don't quite understand. We went over this, I can't fix your thermostat.""

-""Do you know what 'THERMO' means?!'

Now normally I would not let a situation escalate to the point where a customer is speaking to me in such a rude tone, and I definitely would not put up with silly questions aimed at belittling me, but it's the end of the day and he's sort of entertaining.

-""Well sir 'thermo' isn't a word, but if you're referring to 'thermal', then I'd say it means heat.""

-""NO, THERMO MEANS HEAT! YOU NEED TO FIX MY THERMOSTAT.""

-""I don't understand where this is going, but the bottom line is I'm unable to service the thermostat. As much as I'd like to help, there is literally nothing I can do.""

At this point the call devolved into him swearing at me in punjabi and hanging up.

So today at work, I sat down at my cubicle to notice that my supervisor had installed Windows 8 on my work desktop. Unfortunately, he had neglected to activate the installation. So I proceed to try the normal activation steps and get an error code that our Multiple Activation Key license had been activated too many times. So I called Microsoft.

This is where it gets fun.

The first person I talked to was very calm and upon finding out that I was trying to activate Windows 8 Enterprise, he transferred me over to an ""activation specialist"". This specialist proceeds to ask me for my installation key. As I don't have it handy, I inform him that I have the product key and asked if we could use that. He said no and asked for my installation key again.

When I told him that I wasn't exactly sure where to retrieve that key from, he proceeded to try walking me through finding it. Here's how the conversation went:

---

Me: ""I don't know exactly where I need to go to get that for you.""

Him: ""Ok, I will walk you through it. I need you to click on your Start button.""

Me: ""Well, I'm looking at the Tile Screen right now, where do you need me to go?""

Him: ""No, sir, I need you to click your Start button.""

***facepalm***

Me: ""This is Windows 8. I don't have a Start button.""

---

He then proceeded to get very frustrated with me and start talking to me like I was a child. He informed me that I needed to call a different number because he couldn't help me.

30 minutes and 3 transfers later, I finally got back to the same department, but someone who actually knew what the hell they were doing. She got it activated within minutes of getting connected to her.

TL;DR: Windows 8 doesn't have a Start button? What is this black magic?

bubbamudd,65,138,1a6too,552,"The majority of our executives and department managers have corporate iPhones and iPads...a little over two hundred total.  For the most part we don't hear a peep from 90% of them.  The other 10% call for help on passcodes, Exchange passwords, downloading Angry Birds (for marketing purposes only, of course!), etc.  Most of these calls come from our upper management.  These guys are paid $100K+/year, do million dollar deals, but can't remember their 5 character passcode to unlock their iPad.  Somehow I get tasked to handle all the iPhone/iPad calls.  No biggie.  It pays all the same.

I've helped him more times than I care to count, but he's always been cordial and can laugh about his shortcomings.  Well today he forgot his passcode and wiped his iPad.  For some reason this one wasn't in our MDM software so I couldn't clear out the passcode.  It's not a big deal.  I get it, configure it, enroll it in MDM and take it back.  He's out in a meeting, no administrative assistants around, so I leave it on his desk with a sticky explaining what I did, that I left him a voice mail with his passcode and if he forgets it to call me so I can clear it out remotely. Sign my name and leave my extension.

A couple hours later I get a call.  I look at caller ID and see ""Greg.""  Oh shit what now. :-)  He tells me everything is working, thanks for always helping him and he appreciates the fast, friendly service.  I tell him no problem, thanks for calling.  I hang up and can't help but smile.  He's the type of user that makes me love my job.  He didn't have to take time out of his day to thank me for doing my job, but damn if it didn't make my day.

ChrisFRKNRogers,68,80,1hg1k0,549,"The sysadmins on my team have always kept track of the dumbest trouble tickets we receive every year. The story you're about to read received TTotY for about 3 years ago.


We SA's rule over our kingdom of 8 reconfigurable lab spaces, with 8 individual networks, as fairly as seems just. Users don't have physical access to the systems, but through KVM's in their labs. As I'm sure most of you know, most KVM's allow only one workstation to have keyboard and mouse control on a system at a time, while multiple stations can view. Keep this is mind. This is important.


We received a call from a particularly stubborn (and arrogant) software developer from one of our labs. We've always known him to have a particularly foul temper, and usually dread having to work with this one.

*He attempts to gain control of the system through our own KVM, but to no avail.*


**SA:** Is there someone else working on-**Derpus:** NO THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. IT'S ONE OF YOU F*CKING AROUND.

PaintDrinkingPete,98,93,1k7scl,554,"This happened about 8 or 9 years ago, when our office was still running MS Exchange 5.5...

My boss at the time had previously been the head of the IT department, but had several years earlier become the project manager of our entire support contract (we provided several services, including IT, training, financial analysis, etc), so he was no longer working IT on a day-to-day basis, and as time went by, any knowledge he had retained become less and less relevant.  This, however, did not stop him from completely micro-managing our IT department on a daily basis (which really wasn't his job anymore), often making our lives miserable.  He would even often ""break"" things, just to keep us on our toes, testing us to make sure we responded correctly to the problems he'd intentionally create; usually these would be minor annoyances like stopping a print spooler, but obviously it wasn't the best way to manage.

He was also extremely head strong and would never admit when he was wrong, even though he had little experience actually working with any of the current systems we had.  One day, he's in our office poking his nose around and notices that the free disk space on our Exchange server is getting a *bit* low.  For what it's worth, it had been the way for quite some time, and given it's operational state, definitely wasn't anywhere near a critical state, plus we were in the process of setting up a new Exchange 2003 server that we would migrating everyone to in the very near future.

Well, he about flips out when he sees this, and rushes over to his office, apparently Googles something, then comes back on starts tinkering on the Exchange server again (I don't remember why, but at the time we could only console to our servers from a dedicated workstation in the IT lab).  Then, I notice my Outlook client suddenly says ""offline, attempting to reconnect...[etc]"", and here's our ensuing conversation:

**me**: Um...what exactly are you doing over there?!?

**boss**:  I'm defrag-ing the mailbox store to free up space

(Keep in mind this is a production system and it's middle of the work day)

**me**:  What?!? You should take the database offline first to do that, and it doesn't even *need* to be done!!!

Obviously he was trying to use Eseutil to shrink the database, but whatever it was that he did, shrunk our priv.edb file from 60GB to about 6GB, and no clients could connect to Exchange.  As you can expect, the phone calls start rolling in at an exponential rate.

It became obvious we were going to have to restore from a tape backup, however the last good backup we had was from about 3 days prior.  Luckily, all of our supported users (about 100 total) were using Outlook in cache mode, so we had to go to each user's workstation and make a backup of their cache so they could restore all their recent email messages.  My other colleague and I ended up working through the night getting the Exchange server back online and everyone's mailbox restored, and all my boss could say to us was, ""see, this is what happens when you don't monitor your servers for free disk space"".

solomon_pale,107,129,vdui2,548,"So, I used to work for a small company which created timekeeping and payroll software.  We had one user, let’s call her Sandy, who was particularly hard to deal with.  Not only was she rather dense, but her phone manner was . . . unique as well.  One of my co-workers described it as “Darth Vader sucking a cock.”  Unfortunately, that’s a pretty accurate assessment.  Funny thing is, I’d met her in person, and had no problems communicating with her, didn’t notice any heavy breathing or slurping, but for some reason, when she picked up the phone, she turned into a monster.

So she calls up helpdesk and reports that when adding PTO to timecards, the monetary totals are incorrect.  After initiating screen sharing, I had identified the issue.  She was attempting to enter very precise amounts of PTO (i.e. 6.18 hours), and our software only allowed PTO entry in hh:mm format.

Me:  OK, well, that dialogue doesn’t allow you to enter time in decimal format, so you’ll have to put in the totals as hours and minutes.

Sandy:  How do I do that?

Me:  Well, you’ll have to convert hundredths of an hour to minutes.

Sandy:  How do I do that?

Me:  Well, you can use Excel, or look up a conversion table.

Sandy: . . . 

Me:  Or you can use a simple proportion, with the number of minutes over sixty on one side of the equals sign, and x over 100 on the other, and solve for x.

Absolute. Fucking. Silence.

So I was on the phone with her for about 30 minutes, she read off the PTO amounts one by one, and I did the conversion for her.  So for that brief period, I was no longer software support, I was math support.

b1naryv1k1ng,167,144,13e9zl,554,"I'm a sysadmin for a decently large hosting company / server reseller, and mainly work in our main office doing support tickets. Every now and then though, we are needed to cover for our data center techs if they go on vacation and no one else can cover their shift.

This happened on one of those times.

The support ticket starts with the client just copying and pasting an error message, and nothing else. Thankfully the error was specific enough (there have been many times when I get tickets with that, and the error itself gives no reference to where it came from, or why exactly its an error). Turns out that ssh wasn't responding on the server and the client was logged into WHM trying to restart it through there, but it was failing.

I check our back end system for the root password for this server and immediately regret it. The password is 64 characters long, and is a completely random jumble of letters, numbers, and symbols. Granted, contrats on a secure password, but you've just ensured the fact that I will not be able to log into this server. For shits and giggles I do write it down and walk down the hallway to see if I can type it quick enough.

No. Not even close. Only could make it about half way through the password before the log in prompt would reset itself. After two more tries, I tell the client that because of their password, I will need to reboot the server and single user it to troubleshoot and to change the password while I'm troubleshooting.

Nothing is ever easy, and the client refuses to have their password changed, or their server rebooted. Client also happily informs be that ""You can actually COPY the password and right-click on the console to paste the password."" After explaining to the client that as much as I would love to be able to do that, since I'm physically standing infront of their actual server's hardware with a physical keyboard and mouse, its somewhat hard to copy and paste from one system to another.

Thankfully, since WHM was still working for the most part, I was able to just reset the password from there and log in at the console. Once in, try starting sshd only to find it giving permissions errors. ""Well, that's odd."" I think to myself. I then try restarting another service just as a test, only to find I don't have permission to do that either. Thinking I might be going crazy, I look at the prompt, and yes, I am logged in a root, why does root not have permission to restart a service. Check the sshd config, everything looks right. Then check the permissions on it.

Its owned by a cpanel user. Check the permissions in /etc/init.d/. Everything is owned by a cpanel user. Check a few other directories...all owned by a cpanel user.

At this point, I already know exactly what happened, and I decide to check history.

There are a few chowns on a couple files and folders, then a few more, then a few more. Looks like the client was troubleshooting a permissions error. And then I see it.

chown -R &lt;cpanel user&gt;:&lt;cpanel user&gt; /

Twice. I could almost feel the frustration of the client that resulted in running the command twice. Gotta make sure its done completely.

Needless to say, the server had to be reinstalled.

==============Stage 3: MedBay Offices==============

At this time, I was working Level 1 and 2 of the helpdesk for a regional medical facility. Times were stressful, as the other two Level 1 techs had just been fired or had quit due to better jobs, and the Level 2 guys hadn't been hired yet. Therefore, it's me, the buddy that got the job, and two others on the helpdesk for a facility of over 10k users.

Fantastic.

That morning should have been a warning to me. What was usually a 5 minute commute ended up taking 30. Thankfully, we have the first appearance of Former IT Boss! FITB was a woman in her 40s, with lines of stress in her face, but an absolutely gorgeous figure. Why do I mention that? Because she did. A lot. Anyhow, FITB knew the stresses of the IT grunts, and would often offer to pick up Starbucks. Her reaction to my mien when I arrived told her that it would be one of those days, and with some playful jesting and flirting, she went to go shore up the caffeine supply with a direct injection.

Sitting down at my desk, and feeling just a bit better from the exchange, I opened up my email. Back then, the facility was not using a ticketing system at all. Rather, users sent an email to a shared address, and one of us picked up the incident. As my email began to update, I started seeing more and more tickets from one user.

Accounting Douchebag.

AD loved to believe that he was the most important cog in the company gears. He also had an irrational hatred for IT, as well as an overinflated notion of what he really did at the company. He worked for a man who was, sadly, a good person, but a bit meek. AD and I had butted heads many times before, but today was the qualifier. As I sifted through his emails to the tech line, I noticed that they were all the same issue, but with increasingly hostile remarks. I should note that the first email and most recent email from AD were only thirty minutes apart.

Issue: User cannot print. Easily stated in this manner, and would be simple to start troubleshooting.

Issue as AD reported it: I AM DOWN AND CANNOT WORK PLEASE RESPOND

I mention to my compatriots that I was going over to Accounting to fix the problem. As I rose, my work cellphone chirped with a new email from AD, and the following jab:

I AM STILL DOWN LIVES ARE BEING AFFECTED GET ONE OF THOSE USELESS TECHS UP HERE THIS INSTANT

Eye twitch. I instead head for my boss's office. At this time, my boss was an awesome guy, and we'd just recently implemented our Black List. The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever. This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us (with proof) that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication. We reviewed the ""case"", and as he saw the stream of insults and near-profanities, he pulled out the familiar black folder, and said the words I had longed to hear.

**Boss**: Granted. Area88, you are released to execute on your own recognizance. 

That's all I needed to hear! I make my way to accounting posthaste and locate our villain for this series. He's (literally) red-faced with anger and throwing items around his desk. Before heading for him, though, I slip in to his boss's office. The boss is pleasant, but knows why I'm here. The boss is informed of his worker's new status, and I make my way out to work the actual problem.

The Cast:

**88**: Area88guy, our hero, the IT grunt, and pilot of the IT Gundam

**DC**: Douche Canoe, the Accounting grunt

**AB**: Accountant Boss, possibly too meek for actual supervision.

*FIGHT!*

**88**: Morning, DC. What seems to be wrong today?

**DC**: Don't fucking play games with me, shithead, I put in a ticket. Fix it!

**88**: Glad to, as soon as you tell me exactly what is wrong. I can see your laptop is up and running, so you aren't ""down"" as reported.

**DC**: Don't be a smartass. I can't print. Fix it.

**88**: That will require you to move. What happens when you try to print?

**DC**: Nothing happens, moron, or I wouldn't have called you people! God! Who the hell hired you people?

**88**: DC, I'm not in the mood for your temper today. Step out of your cube and I'll analyze the problem.

DC proceeds out of his cube, where he begins to rant and rave to anyone listening about how IT is incompetent. His boss gets an earful in particular, but he didn't seem to mind. Especially because we had sent, to his printer, a printout of all of DC's emails for this incident.

Anyhow, I'm here to work, right? Well, it turns out DC attempted to install a PDF Converter, which would masquerade as a printer. However, without the proper access rights, it had only installed so far. As I checked Services, I noticed the Print Spooler was off. All it took was an uninstall of the Converter and a restart of the service before the test page spat out of the printer at his desk. Wonderful! But here comes another print job...

...and the Accounting Xerox spins up...

...and the General Office Xerox spins up...

...*and the CEO/CEO's assistant's Xerox spins up*...

What in the...? I check the stupid, proprietary print job program that we've got to see what happened. We'd installed it to be doubly sure that important print jobs weren't dropped, and though it was coded in-house, it worked, at least. What it shows me is that when DC couldn't print to his printer, he opted to send it to every printer within walking distance. What was his most urgent of print jobs?

A coupon for a buy one, get one deal at the local pizza joint.

As the printing cacophony began, DC managed to quiet his tirades long enough to look over at what had printed. Snatching it up, he yelled that it was about damned time IT did something right, and nearly bowled me over getting back to his desk. Had his boss seen it, I would have laughed and maybe bumped into DC, but his boss had headed for the CEO printer to retrieve the job. As DC sat down, ranting and raving, I retrieved the print job from the Accounting Xerox. Waiting for the boss, I decided to start the conversation.

**88**: DC, you told me that you were completely down and that lives were at stake. Why did you say that?

**DC**: Shut up, kid. You don't know a damn thing about what I do here. I know that you people won't leave your precious office for something minor.

**88**: Well, I do know that you do absolutely nothing related to patient care and have no relationship with any department that does. So no, lives were not at stake. You further stated that you were completely down, no doubt a phrase you picked up from (Hot Accounting Chick) when she was, and figured it'd get you a response ASAP.

**DC**: I don't give a fu-

**88: Shut. Your. Mouth.**

I had just about had enough, and I put enough of my real personality into the intonation that even DC stopped, staring at me with a slack jaw. Part of me thinks he knew he had screwed up, but I can't be sure. All I know is that I was tired of it. He'd done it to me a lot, and I could handle it, but the tech who had quit had done so because of users like this.

**88**: With the authorization of (My Boss and his position), and backed by (Director of IT), I am notifying you that you are now on the IT Black List. This means that you will *not* be permitted to submit helpdesk emails, you will *not* be allowed to delay any updates, and you will *not* be responded to in any form regarding an IT-related incident.

**DC**: You can't possib-

**88: Let. Me. Finish.** Furthermore, all IT incidents will need to come through your supervisor. The details of those incidents must clearly and succinctly outline what the problem is. 

I leaned in closer.

**88**: Your treatment of myself and my fellow technicians is no longer wanted or desired. Good day.

As I left, and as DC began to fling insults my way, the Accounting Boss stepped in front of him.

**AB**: DC, step into my office. I'd like to discuss this list of emails that IT has provided for me regarding your helpdesk conduct.

For example, every email he ever sent had no subject line, and no body.  They all had attachments named Document1.doc, with an ALL CAPS letter with what a normal person would put in the body.  He was writing his letters, then putting them in virtual ""envelopes"" and sending them out.

-jackschitt-,154,105,u4sk1,545,"My unit also shares our office with the reigonal VP and his secretary.  They have access to more confidential information than the rest of us, and I'm only allowed very minimal access to their systems -- basically, I can't do much above telling them to call the corporate IT desk, and I don't have authority to do anything beyond the very basics without explicit permission.

So her computer dies.  The VP puts a special order in to have the new one replaced overnight.  My only role was supposed to be to take it out of the box, set it up, turn it on, and call the IT department to finish the job remotely.  Fine.

So I'm setting this all up, and the VP is sitting there making random small talk.  The secretary makes a comment about ""Why can't Jack just do it himself?  Going through corporate takes forever!"".  The VP then goes on about how ""these systems contain highly confidential data and the security for them is airtight.""  He continues to go on for a good five minutes rambling on about data security as if we were protecting some kind of state secrets or something.  

So I turn the computer on, and I'm getting ready to call corporate and pass it over to their IT.  The VP is still rambling on.  Having dealt with their help desk (and subsequently ignoring them -- I swear their level 1 support is whatever custodian happens to be walking by the phone at the time...), I decided to try to log in by just typing ""Help Desk"".  No password.  And it fucking worked.  

I was floored.  Not only was I able to log in with no password, the account had *full admin rights*.  I proceed to remove the password for the secretary's account and logged right in.  This caused the VP to stop mid-speech and say ""Hey...how the hell did you do that?"".  My reply:  ""The top-notch security that you think is there is nonexistent.""  

He insisted that the since he demanded the system be overnighted, this was a one-time fluke and someone was in a rush and just skipped a step.  I then walked over to his machine and proceeded to do *the exact same thing*.  

His jaw was on the floor.  Anybody who had physical access to any computer could have stolen all the data they wanted just by typing ""Help Desk"" and going to town.  

Phone calls were made.  Heads rolled.   Needless to day, the VP was particularly embarrassed by watching some low-level IT guy get into his system in seconds *while he was talking about the security of the system*.

bobcat,177,213,1bezax,547,"I woke up at 2am and went to read TFTS, but HORRORS! No internet! 

Now, I've previously told about how I got AT&amp;T to reduce my neighbor's phone+DSL bill by $20/month AND up the bandwidth from 768kbps to 6Mbps, and in return he lets me use his wifi for free. [I also set up his new laptop] 

So I log into his 1701HG and... all the settings are wiped. I call AT&amp;T and immediately say ""Hi, all I need is the provisioning code for the modem."" and they actually go off script and give it to me! Well done!

I enter in all the setup info, and there's no DSL signal. I'll have to wait for morning and go over there and fix things.

Well, it turns out he was on the phone to AT&amp;T the day before for over an hour, trying to fix his inability to get on the net. AT&amp;T support had him swap filters, phones, wires, reset the modem to factory default...

I swap the filters, phones, and wires back to the way I had set them up before and connect with my Nexus 7. We have internet!

Now I look at his laptop. Can't browse, not even to the modem [this is where you fucked up AT&amp;T, you should have realized the problem was the PC]. I ping google.com. That works. Perhaps some malware has borked something, added a proxy or altered the hosts file? He tells me he installed Norton 360, there's no way he could have gotten a virus.

Norton 360... When I set the PC up, I installed Microsoft Security Essentials. Obviously some evil do[good]er has influenced him to pay money for the superior [ahem]  protection of Norton 360...

I take the computer home to work on it over night. Can't browse, can ping. Proxy setting blank, hosts file untouched. I Google that. Oh, someone said this happened to them, and Skype still worked. Try Skype, it works. So ICMP and UDP work, TCP is blocked. Interesting. Boot into safe mode. Everything works. Reboot. Maybe it's Norton? Try to remove it. Nothing seems to be happening. What? Malwarebytes is on this thing too? Try to remove it. Error message about broken uninstall. Great.

Time for System Restore! I go back 2 days, before the latest windows update. Damn this takes a long time... reboot. I can browse! Try to remove Norton again. Nothing. Pop! ""Windows has installed important updates and needs to shutdown"". Go ahead, I'll get some coffee. ""Installing update 1 of 3...""

I'll have to go to the Norton and Malwarebytes sites, get the softwares, reinstall them to uninstall them. ARRRGHH!! Can't browse again! I delete the wifi profile so it won't update again, run System Restore again. On my PC, I go to download 360... no trial version on the site? At least I couldn't find one. Well, maybe he bought it directly from Norton, let's try logging in with his email and password [of course he has one pw for everything]. Well, that worked, I take a look at his account. He bought the family package, 3 copies of Norton 360 [for him, daughter, grandson]. And there are 0 downloads left. You mean I can't download again? WTF Norton?! WHY!? Trying to stop pirating?

I obtain a copy of 360 by other means [wink wink] and a copy of Malwarebytes, put them on a flash drive, install them and uninstall them, reconnect his wifi, let windows update again, reboot, and INTERNETS!

I reinstall MSE and bring the laptop back.

I tell him that the problem was indeed malware, and its name is Norton 360.

These are The Adventures of Pete, and I assure you they are mostly true.*

##\#002 The Light Switch

It was Pete's third or fourth week with the company, and he and his minions had settled into a happy routine. One of his three new hires had already quit, realizing he was woefully under-qualified for just about everything, and Pete was told in no uncertain terms that he was not to hire anybody else without clearing it with the owner.

I was working late, trying to figure out why our two big printers disappeared from the network and brought production to a halt, and Pete was the only other employee left in the office. He didn't have anything to do as far as I could tell, since he just followed me everywhere I went like a lost puppy. Our travels took us into the server room, where I was fiddling with the network cables trying to find the one leading to the switch that served the printers. No, they weren't labeled.

Pete's face lit up like Christmas as his eyes took in the splendor of rack servers and networking equipment.    
""Why don't I have any of this?"" Pete asked.    
""Any of what?"" I replied.    
""These!"" he exclaimed, pointing at the rack.    
I shook my head and laughed. ""Those are the servers, Pete. You and your team already have access to them."" I pointed to one in particular and said ""This one hosts your development environment, among other things. I've found what I'm looking for, come on.""

Pete followed me to the production room, pestering me incessantly and disrupting my thoughts as I tried to sort out the problem. I finally realized that the uplink port on the network switch used by the printers had burned out — nothing a crossover cable can't temporarily fix.

It was the first time I had locked up the office, so I wandered around for a few minutes trying to find all of the light switches while Pete returned to his office and made his preparations to head home. I stumbled across a switch in the office next to Pete's that didn't seem to do anything, so I flipped it off and on a few times while looking around. Sure enough, it controlled the lights in another room: Pete's office.

I stepped through his door and pointed up at the lights as I asked ""Did you know that the switch for these lights is in the office next door?""    
""Oh, no,"" Pete said. ""These lights don't have a switch, they just stay on all the time. They use less energy that way, but sometimes they short out. I think they need their ballasts refilled.""

I spent another five minutes toggling the lights in his office, trying to explain the cause and the effect before I got tired of his increasingly insulting comments and shooed him out the door so I could lock up. In spite of my best efforts, Pete never learned that the switch controlling the lights in his office was in the room next door.",The Adventures of Pete #002 The Light Switch,675

Lineov,75,130,x2u91,546,"EDIT: Grammar

So I work at a University Help Desk, we get some pretty strange stuff from time to time...(my personal favorite was someone asking us what the price of milk was)  At any rate...

The apartment style living center just off of campus is controlled by Residence Life and for the life of me they have their internet configured through a local cable company instead of running through the University System like all the rest of the Residence Halls.

For the longest time we kept getting phone calls from people new to the Apartment style living center saying that they couldn't setup their internet and we told them to contact the cable company or residence life because there's simply nothing we can do to support them besides generic ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""

So finally a user, Derpina calls saying they can't get internet in their dorm and I ask if they've contacted Cable One, and apparently Cable One said that they didn't work with that particular building.  I then asked if they had talked to Residence Life and they had said that they needed to talk to Cable One.  Mind you this conversation had been across 3 or 4 different phone calls and I was really starting to feel bad for this person who was getting the royal run-around.  (I don't feel this way anymore, i had my sympathy gland removed last week.)

So with Derpina still on the line I call Res Life and I after a short introduction say, ""Assume that I have just come to campus.  I'm trying to setup my internet in this Res. Hall... what's the first step.  And so for the next 45 minutes we go through bit by bit (starting with room sign up) to figure out what we could possibly be missing and apparently there's a form that needed to be filled out that only the Residence Life has access to.  They send that form to the cable company who then activates the internet in the room.

I then ask ""Have you guys ever, considered, actually telling anybody about this form?  Y'know maybe letting people know that this step needs to be completed?""  To which he responds ""No.""

I very audibly smack the receiver against my head mumbling loud enough for them to hear ""stupid, stupid, stupid...etc...""  After a few moments of this I tell Derpina, ""this is the form you need to fill out.""  

Since that phone call with Residence Life, I'm not sure what they did, but we've never had a complaint regarding the internet issues in the Apartment Style Housing ever.  (~ 2 years)

I work in IT for a large company and I bring my lunch to work some days. Although I am capable of putting ham and cheese between two pieces of bread, my wife tends to make me lunch on those days. 

On this particular day, I opened my lunch bag to find a hot pink Post-It note that simply said ""I Love You"". I took the post-It and stuck it to the bottom of my monitor. 

After I finished my lunch I received a phone call about some technical issue (I have long forgotten what it was about). I assisted the customer for the better part of an hour and soon fell into IT auto-pilot mode. After trying several well-known trouble shooting steps the issue was resolved.

I go back out and verify the name.  I ask if there's another name it might be under.  I return to the back, re-check all the shelves, then check the bench.  Nothing.  I pull up our tracking system and try a few spellings of the name, still nothing.

OK, this is going to be a problem now.

I go back out and say ""I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble tracking it down, could I get your phone number so I can try looking it up that way?""

And with that, she goes from 0 to murderous-bitch-from-hell.

&gt;""WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'VE LOST MY COMPUTER? HOW COULD YOU LOSE MY COMPUTER???""

""Ma'am, we haven't lost your computer, I just didn't see it when I looked.  If I can get your phone number, I can look it up in our system and it'll give me a better idea where to look"".  Thinking possibly it got sent off for service for a hardware fault we couldn't do in-store.  Or at least I'll find notes on it saying it's definitely completed, or actually waiting for OS discs, or something.

I finally coax her number out of her and plug it in. Still nothing.  Fuck.  I ask if there's another number it might be under, she says no and just gets louder and more obnoxious.

&gt;""YOU'VE LOST MY COMPUTER, I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN, YOU GUYS ARE ALL INCOMPETENT AND YOU'VE HAD IT FOR A WEEK NOW AND HAVE BEEN GIVING ME THE RUNAROUND EVERY TIME I CALL, AND THE GUY FINALLY CALLED THIS MORNING TO SAY IT WAS READY AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'VE LOST IT???""

Now I'm starting to get confused.  I'm pretty sure if we'd had a system for that long I'd know about it - as I said, we typically had people back out the door in less than two days.  Well, there's one more thing I can try...

I ask her if she has the receipt, knowing she probably doesn't, but that will have the ticket number on it, and with that I can DEFINITELY track it; ticket numbers are infallible.  Of course, she doesn't, her husband probably has it at home, despite our repeated reminders to customers that if they want anyone else to pick it up, they HAVE to have the receipt.  I have nothing else to go on, though, so I ask her if she can call him and ask him for the ticket number.  She continues to call me incompetent and bitch about our awful service, but she pulls out her phone anyway.

After a few words to him (none of which were ""do you have the receipt for the computer"", more like ""these idiots have lost my laptop""), she hands the phone to me.  HE then starts cussing me out for losing their computer.  He slanders my competence and uses language I normally won't stand for, but I need this damn ticket number from him.  I finally get a word in edgewise to ask him for the info off the receipt.  He won't give it to me, he just keeps yelling.

Then, something clicks.  The *guy* said it was ready?  I ask her who she talked to.  She said ""I don't know, I think Ryan or something"".  Well, the person who did our calling that day was called Tabitha, so something wasn't right.

I say ""one moment, let me check something"", and hand the still-squawking phone back.  In the back room, I pick up our phone, and dial the other big-box store in the same shopping center that also services computers.  I get my friend who works there.

""Hi Nate, do you guys have a computer there under the name of Dorner?  You do?  And it's ready to be picked up?  Great.  She'll be in in a minute, you might want to have it ready"".

I go back out and say ""Ma'am, I've figured out where your computer is.  If you go out and turn left and head over to our competitor in the next parking lot, I already spoke to Nate over there and he has your computer waiting for you"".

And in a blissful moment, she finally stops yelling.  She looks at me glassily for a moment, but refuses to deflate.  ""Oh"", she says, ""he swore he dropped it off here.  He must not have had his coffee that morning"".  And turns and walks out, without even so much as a ""sorry I was such a colossal c**tpuffin to you for the last 20 minutes"".

And that is the story of the worst customer I ever had.

Ocramzeej66,153,133,uk1ah,544,"Before I spin my tale, I'd like to introduce myself. I work in entry-level tech support for a major US computer company, where I handle approximately 20 different accounts, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare facilities/hospitals. Furthermore, I happen to work the night shift, 7pm-7am, with only one other agent in queue. Simply put, it's the Perfect Storm of Entry-Level Hell.

We begin our story shortly after I started my job with the company. I'd had some experience working on computers from a few high school classes, and from tinkering on my own rig, however this was my first actual tech support job- hell, my college degree was in Engineering Tech: Robotics. As I had only been there a couple months, I was still in that phase of ""Oh god, I'm gonna screw something up and get fired."" However, I had thankfully already mastered the art of **bullshit**.

This fine evening, I received a call from a rather irate doctor. He was using a portable scanning device that authenticates through a medical records program known as Cerner. Now, the problem with these units was if they lost their wireless signal for even a moment while you were logging in (and this happened quite frequently at this hospital), their cerner account would be locked, so they'd have to call in to have it unlocked. Well... this doctor had the unfortunate bad luck of having it happen to him multiple times that day. So by the time he gets to me, he's rather upset. The call goes something a little like this...

**Me:** ""Thank you for calling the Derp Service Desk, this is Ocramzeej66, can I get your last/first name please?""

*information is gathered*

**Me:** ""Thank you, Dr. Herp, what can I do for you today?""

**Doctor:** ""It's these damn C5 units! I've gotten locked out of Cerner again! This is the 4th time today! You know, it's people like you that let people die every day!""

**Me:** ""... I'm sorry, sir? I apologize that you keep getting locked out, it's an issue with the wireless infrastructure, it's nothing we have any control over.""

**Doctor:** ""SEE!? There you go passing the buck again! You're letting people die every day because you can't man up and take responsibility! This issue needs to be fixed NOW""

**Me:** ""Sir, if you have an issue with the way the hospital's wireless infrastructure is set up, I recommend you bring it up with your hospital's IT Director. It's unfortunately nothing that I have any control over. I would fix it if I could, sir.""

**Doctor:** ""That's unacceptable. Now, since you're such a lazy sack of shit, I demand that you bring this issue up at your next staff meeting. THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED!""

**Me:** ""... Yes sir. I will be sure to do this at the very next staff meeting. It's unacceptable, and you've motivated me to take responsibility for our actions.""

**Doctor:** ""Good. It's nice to see someone listens to their betters these days.""

I went on to unlock his account again, and he was able to log in. I should note, however, that since I've been employed here... we've never had a staff meeting. But the next one we do...

Craigglesofdoom,70,87,1bxk4c,542,"[This story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1bvrcw/laptop_faith_healing/) reminded me of a good one that I have. I actually work at a bike shop, which let me tell you has a LOT of interesting stories, but that's for another sub. This is a story a good friend and customer of mine told me.

His mother (we'll call her Mary) is an administrator at a Catholic nunnery in New England. They do a lot of community work and are wonderful people, but...not very tech-savvy, as one might guess.

So, something had happened to their networking equipment. I'm not sure of the details - it wasn't completely inoperable, but it was certainly not working properly. Mary had scheduled an appointment with their IT contractor, but he wouldn't be able to come in for a couple of days. Meanwhile, the nuns did their best to fix it through prayer and faith, which was ineffective to say the least.

The IT guy came by, and Mary showed him to the server room. He went to work and about five minutes passed when she heard him yell ""OH JESUS --- AAAAAUGHH"" some fumbling, and then he rushed by with his tools in tow. She was in a phone call and couldn't ask what was wrong, but a few minutes later she heard sirens outside. After going outside she discovered the distraught IT guy on the steps being questioned by several police officers from the homicide squad.

Increasingly alarmed, Mary asked the officers what this was all about. They said the had received a call from the IT guy about discovering human remains in the server closet. Thinking this impossible, she took the officers to the closet. When they opened the door, they saw what the IT guy had seen.

The nuns had exhumed the body of their founding nun and placed her skull and several other bones on top of the servers to assist in their prayers. They had neglected to tell ANYONE, even Mary.

The remains were returned to the tomb and the nuns were given a very stern talking to about proper protocol with IT, as well as bones.

And a lock was installed on the server closet.",Get Thee to a Nunnery!,629

PolloMagnifico,134,173,1fhlzc,543,"I'm still putting the finishing touches on Part 7, so consider this as a quick little appetizer to hold you over until then. I suddenly remembered this as being a great example of the crap I saw come through my door that had been BUTCHERED by Nerd Patrol.

So a gentleman enters my store with a computer problem. Specifically, his laptop won't come on. Hitting the power button causes the fans to spin up, but nothing appears on the screen. However, the screen comes ON. After it runs for about 30 seconds, it shuts itself down.

I'm flummoxed. If it were memory, there would be some kind of error code on the front panel. If it were the processor the LCD wouldn't even power on. It could have been the video, but that doesn't explain the restarting. Maybe it's the video AND a heating issue? I tell him as much, and offer to hold it for our standard diag cost.

I take it into the back, hit the power button, and to my amazement, the machine comes to life! It posts and then goes into windows!

What... what the hell? So I fiddle around with it for a bit, and decide to give it a restart. Now it's dead again.

Cycle the power a couple of times, but it just keeps repeating the symptoms it came in with. Suddenly, I notice something. The front bezel (the section of plastic above the keyboard that has all the touch sensitive buttons) is lighting up and blinking like mad. The whole thing. Double weird.

I decide I'll start with some component replacement. I know it isn't the HDD, because the system isn't even booting. On an off chance, I pull off one of the back covers and see a single SODIMM. This means the other one is under the keyboard. Oy. So I yank that SODIMM, power, nothing new. Replace that one and start working my way towards the other memory bank. Since I had to disassemble half the laptop to get to that one, I decided to look for any scorching that might indicate a short or heat damage.

It was by sheer dumb luck that I saw [this](http://i.imgur.com/Clv6RkK.jpg).

Now, the picture is blurry, but if you look closely you'll recognize it as one of the cables that connect external laptop components to the system board. you'll also notice that it's pins have been ABSOLUTELY MAULED TO HELL. I have never, ever, in all my years of working with computers, seen one of those connections get damaged like that before or since. This particular cable goes to the top bezel.

Pow. I yank the cable from it's other end, replace the bezel, and the machine hums to life. I turn it off, replace the cables, machine wont start. Yank em again, machine comes to life again! I send it through a series of reboots (restarts, power downs, battery out, battery in, AC out, AC in, etc etc) just to make sure. POSTS and logs into windows every time.

I call the customer. Actually, first I sent the picture to my manager and some other techs I know asking ""Have you ever seen anything like this!?"" Of course none of them had.

THEN I called the customer.

PM: ""Hello Sir, I have some great news! I managed to fix your computer!""

Cust: ""Oh, that's great! What was wrong with it?""

PM: ""Well sir, I found a cable that connects the touch buttons above your keyboard to the main circuit board of your computer. Somehow, the pins on the cable had been completely mangled, and we found scorching on them to indicate that they were in fact shorting out. I've honestly never seen this kind of damage before, I didn't even know it was possible. Have you recently taken this computer somewhere else for service?""

Cust: ""Actually yes! I took it to Nerd Patrol a little while back to have them replace the keyboard.""

PM: ""And you didn't try to get into it to replace the keyboard yourself?""

Cust: ""No, I don't know jack about those things, and this laptop was expensive."" (This sentence might be in the running for the smartest thing I have ever heard leave a customers mouth)

PM: ""You are a very wise man.""

The customer comes to pick it up, and I show him that cable and explain how it could have happened. Since the bezel was easy to remove, I showed him the connection and everything. I didn't charge him for the work, since it was technically fixed during the diagnostic. I suggested that the next time he need work done, he bring it to us first.

Ormuzd,70,93,1iu1fn,538,"I’ve lurked this page for a while now and always thought about submitting a few of my stories but they all seemed a little run of the mill. Until something that happened a few months ago that finally came full circle.  I think I may have finally found my white whale.  Prepare for a wall of text (sorry).

Toward the beginning of this year we moved into a brand new building.  It is a wonder of modern technology that literally everything can be controlled via one of our central networking rooms.  One room for building management (HVAC, lights, elevators, the works) and one for networking and IT.  I was one of the few people that got to spend a lot of the time in the building during the construction phase so I know where just about everything is.  Generally I tend to be more a database and networking guy but I love to get my hands dirty and will play with about anything people will let me so my current job has expended to handling most of the minor problems we experience when moving into a new building (read as “shit breaks”).  And thusly I have been requesting a raise due to all the added job duties I’ve been performing which management had been abruptly ignoring.

So fast forward to about mid May as temperatures start to get over 100*F (38*C).  I come into the office at about 8:00, about 30min before the normal crowd gets in so I can have my morning in peace just for a bit.  I’ve checked the network and nothing seems out of place and picked out my general task for the day then head over to the kitchenette to make some instant oatmeal.  I hang out in the kitchen for about 20min talking to one of the mail guys who was passing though and start to head back to my desk (it is about 8:35 at this point).  As I’m about 20 steps from my desk I can hear the phone ring and it cuts out just before I get there.  I got to sit down and see who was calling when I notice my email has a lot of unread messages and my desk phone has 6 missed calls. This is the point I feel a disturbance in the force.  Well not really the force but my cell phone goes off and I do not recognize the number (no one really calls my cell).  I answer my cell with my general level of morning enthusiasm only to find out that it is the secretary of the head of the company, there were no greetings or pleasantries from her only the opening statement “We have a problem!  It is currently 89*F (32C) in this office and no one is doing anything about it.”  I flounder for a minute as I’m not sure why someone is called me about the HVAC system when I notice all my emails have a headline along the lines of A/C not working followed by names of the Executives (or their assistants).  Before I can get out that this is more of a Facilities issue not an IT one I get told “Neither of the HVAC guys are answering and you’re the only person the guy at the help desk could think of who would know how to fix this.”  I ask her to hold just a sec while I try to scrape together some sort of answer, eventually settling on “There is nothing I can do from my desk here so I’ll walk over to the facilities room and see what is going on then give you a call back.”  She hangs up and I start checking though all the emails that have piled up when I notice all of these people have similar office numbers, then it hits me the A/C handler for their part of the building (which mostly consist of the higher-ups) has completely stopped working.  

As I get over to the facilities room I hear the ominous beeping coming from one of the terminals.  When I turn the monitor on the first thing I see is the red warning text saying; “Air handler #X FAILED, fault 26”.  I go looking for a phone to call back the secretary to tell here their A/C is fucked when I notice a white board with 2 of the facilities guys name on it say they would be on vacation this week and for the other guy to have fun (there are 3 people that normally work this room).  I call the secretary back to inform her that the entire AC system for their part of the building has failed and 2 of the 3 guys that work on that system are on vacation and the 3rd is MIA, to which she is pissed because apparently it has gone up 2* since I last talked to her (who would guess 10ft glass windows with no way to block the light would cause a room to heat up like an oven if it didn’t have a dedicated AC system).  I inform her the best I can do is try to get a factory tech on the phone and see if they can get a repair guy out to us sometime today.  “That is unacceptable how can we be expected to work in this heat, is there anything else you can do?”  Not wanting to say no, because then my day would just get worse since I was already in the email chain I would be dealing with it either way at my desk I say, “I can go check the physical unit while I try to call the factory guys maybe they can tell me what fault 26 is and if it is simple I can fix it, or maybe they can tell me how to reroute some of the cooling from another part of the building to you guys.”  It is at the point that I find out I was on speaker phone with her and the President was listening to what was being done when he speaks up thanking me for working on this for them.  They hang up and I find the number for the manufacture prominently displayed on the screen of the computer with the error message and call them only to find out they are in a different time zone and do not open for 2 more hours.  It is at the point I realize this day is going to be my own personal hell.  I say fuck it and start walking up to the maintenance area because being anywhere someone else can contact me is out of the question at this point.  

When I get to the air handler room everything is dead quit and actually kind of peaceful.  I stand in the middle of the room staring at this huge machine that I’ve ever only seen once during construction when I was helping hook it up the network for the facilities guys.  As I’m walking around it I notice a piece 1” conduit lying in the middle of the floor completely out of place.  I kick it up against the wall and look at the side of the machine where it was laying when I notice a white box about the size of a small computer tower with a small  screen on it that says “Fault 26: Power interrupted” with 2 options ‘restart’ and ‘view error log’.  It also has a nice scratch down the front of it that goes right over a few of the other buttons.  That is when it hits me, the 1” conduit was something some dummy leaned against the wall and it fell over hitting this box causing it to freak out and turn the power off.  I press the button beside restart and after a short loading time the AC unit roars back to life.  As I’m walking back down to my area I decide to pass though the Executive offices just to make sure the cool air is making its way down to them.  As I’m wondering around the halls staring up at the ceiling with my hand raised to feeling for any airflow the voice from the phone stops me to ask what I am doing.   I inform her I was the IT guy she talked to about the AC issues and I was just coming though to see if they were getting cold air.  As we are standing in the hallway the first signs of cool air start to come out of the vent we are standing under.  Her mouth drops open as she realizes the AC is back on hugs me while thanking me for performing some kind of computer magic and runs back to her office.  I decide to take the long route back to my desk where I sit down and delete about 40+ emails all complaining about the AC and go about the rest of my day.  This all managed to occur before 10:00AM

2 months go by and no other major issues have popped up.  I managed to track down the missing tech that was working the facilities room alone that day only to find out he had been in the hospital with food poisoning.  We had a good laugh over the story and he bought me a bottle of Jack as payment for my troubles.  Mid July comes around which means the mid year awards ceremony, which generally means a way for the sells guys and management to pat themselves on the back for all the hard work they do.  All the tech guys and I are hanging out in the back making the usually crude jokes just waiting for the free food and drinks at the end when the President takes the stage and says he has one more special award he would like to present followed by a 2 minute speech about all the hard work this individual does that goes unnoticed.  All of the tech guys are kind of laugh and I hear the comment “Wonder which boob is getting this award.”  Then the president says, “Will Ormuzd please come up here.”  Dead fucking silence, few people outside of the techs know who I am and all of them are too slack jawed to say anything.  I make my way up toward the stage while he tells an abbreviated and kind of exaggerated story of how I had gone above and beyond to fix the AC for their offices.  I accept the award and shake hands when he informs me this award comes with a bonus and the raise I had been asking for plus some.  I just stand there kind of stunned when from all the way in the back my fellow tech guys burst into applause.

TL;DR: Reset a computer and justified my existence to management.  Got paid.

[deleted],141,190,143mx9,542,"So, as my boyfriend loves this subreddit, but does not wish to make a reddit account account (HA, make one now! Go on, I know you will read this!), I figured I would post this tale of humor and woe, regarding his new job in a customer support/engineering role.


He has been there for just under a week now, and has been fitting in quite well. From what I've been told, he loves it there, and there is even a pin ball machine in the lunch room. 


So, two days in, and he listens in on his first tech support call with his supervisor, just to gauge what it would be like. It apparently went as so... (after all the customer service number pleasantries) 

**Customer (C)**: We're having a few issues accessing files at work


**Supervisor (S)**: Ah ok, let's get this fixed up for you. What server are you trying to access?

**C**: We don't have a server.

**S**: But you still use our systems?

**C**: Yes, on this laptop.

*At this point, the supervisor put it on speaker phone for people to listen to.*

**S**: So all the files for your data base are on that one laptop?

**C**: Yes.

**S**: Can I talk to your manager?

**C**: I think that is me.

**S**: Good, well can I talk to your IT department head?

**C**: I think that is me as well

*The amount of -headesk- was astounding.*

**S**: (In an attempt to try and get somewhere with this guy) So, what went wrong with the laptop?

**C**: I don't know. Everyone just gets the files off this laptop. We keep it on all the time.

**S**: Hang on... does the laptop have administrator privileges?

**C**: Everyone in the office does.

**S**: So no firewalls or protection? Do you have any back up to go on? (Such a hopeful question)

**C**: We never bothered with back ups. This has happened before, so we just assumed it would happen again.

**S**: Wait... how many times has this happened?

**C**: Three

By this time, the people listening were facepalming so hard their hands were just about touching the back of their heads. Apparently it was a tradie (laboring) workforce who didn't have much in the way of an IT person, and had basic use of a data base system. A whole years worth of work, lost. The worst thing was is that they just wanted to see if they could recover the files, not improve their system in any way. 

Honestly, it was the worst amalgamation of circumstances surrounding a tech support call he could have witnessed. Although, after being on this subreddit, I have heard worse.

MysticBlackmoon,163,119,zofgg,540,"Working for a university, we naturally have a lot of people using Internet Explorer by default. People who aren't tech-savvy, people who get IE with their default computer installations, etc.; we have Firefox installed on all university machines as a matter of procedure, but we can't really control anyone's private hardware, and I don't really begrudge people for using IE, even if I personally condemn it.

However, IE is enough of a problem with the university website, and especially Moodle, that it was disrupting normal workflow here at the helpdesk. Throughout about the first year I spent here, roughly half or more of our tickets could be boiled down to ""I'm on the website, but [x] isn't displaying!"" ""Are you on Explorer?"" ""Yeah..."" ""Well, quit it."" It was starting to get in the way of the real problems, so a couple of our guys decided to do something about it.

Their solution? Make a gigantic graphic telling people something to the effect of, ""We've detected you're using Internet Explorer; this browser can cause problems, so we recommend using the free browser Firefox instead,"" with a link provided. The graphic is bright yellow, and big enough that to see *any* page on our site, you need to scroll down a bit to get past it. 

Naturally, this still posed a few problems, such as one memorable call that went, ""Ugh, what is with that big ugly yellow banner on the webpage? I keep having to scroll down to see anything!"" But for the most part, all was well.

Until tonight, however. A couple people attempting to log in managed to completely miss the warning banner. One of them had apparently been using Firefox until recently, but had accidentally set her default browser back to IE without knowing it, and was befuddled.

&gt;""I keep trying to log on, but everything looks different. Some stuff isn't showing up.""

That was my first clue.

&gt;""And there's this big yellow banner in my way! That was never there before. I don't understand what's going on, can you fix it?""

Suspicions confirmed; I decided to have a little fun of my own, though, so I followed up with a concerned voice and a wry grin,

&gt;""Hm; that's interesting. Can you tell me what the banner says?""

NumbbSkulll,98,124,17jqe6,545,"I work in IT for a medium sized school district. Got a email in mid November saying a user's computer had froze up and asked us to look at it when we get time. We're short a tech right now, so I put it on the low priority pile, and never really thought about it again...

Fast forward to last week (Mid January). Get a call from above user, wanting to know when we were going to take a look at her computer. I told her that computers freeze up all the time for various reasons, and that we had put been putting it off until we got caught up, or until it started to cause her a problem.

She kind of got pissy with me, and said ""How much worse of a problem could it be? I told you in my email that the computer froze up!""

I asked if its been freezing up more often, and again I was told ""It froze up in November!!""... 

I then asked her if it had been acting up since it froze in November...

She replied.... ""No its not been acting up! Its been froze since then!!""

I had to quickly mute the phone to keep her from hearing the laughter!!! After a few minutes... I kindly instructed her on how to force restart the computer, hung the phone up, and sat in disbelief for the next several minutes.

But our IT guys leave everyday by 4.30p and are never on weekends, and our office is a 24hr center, so after hours it's mostly just Ops trying to fix things.  Since I'm the youngest in Ops by a fairly good chunk of time (29, next youngest is 41) and the only one to have ever taken any sort of computer classes/training, I'm default tech support when things happen.  

My office personnel in general are not computer savvy. More than once I've had someone call and say ""My computer is broken!"". *Ok, well, what happened?* ""I was on a call, and I left for break, and when I came back it was all black and won't turn on!"". *Is it powered on?* (we work in call center bays, lots of wires all tangled together under workstations) ""Yes, the red light is on.""  *Is the monitor on?* ""Yes, I just told you the red light is on."". Go over there, monitor not turned on. Sigh. So many older people have no concept that the monitor is a separate entity....

I can't open this document is looks all weird and won't work right.""  *Ok, is anyone else having this issue on this document?*  ""Yes! TeamLead2 can't do it either!""  I'm thinking maybe she's trying to open a Powerpoint slide, or a flyer of some sort to email out to her teams.  So I walk over there, she opens Word, and it pulls up fine.  She says ""See?!

* * *

I had been working in the store for a good half year by now and the summer vacation was just a few weeks away. Working in the store had been good for the last few weeks. The regular customers were finally accustomed to me and did not ogle as much anymore and uncomfortable interactions were at an all time low. Not responding to the webcam offer probably had made its rounds and made the creeps give up hope and move to other things.

Don had a newfound love for playing video games and was locked up in his office for hours on end. I did not know what he was playing, but it was probably an MMO as I sometimes heard him talk and shout in his office. One of our headsets was missing too. 

Richard and Frank were in the back working on the computers, at least that was what I wanted to believe; they were probably browsing through peoples files and copying whatever they found interesting to their hard drives. We had been sold out of ethics a long time.

I was cleaning up the store, which was slowly but surely recovering from its midlife crisis. A poster had made its way on the store windows again and one of the tables had already disappeared to the back.

A middle-aged woman came into the store. She had an old IBM Thinkpad in her hands and I signaled her to go up to the counter.

When we both got to the counter she put down the Thinkpad and I asked her what was wrong. She told me that she had bought the computer here over a year ago and was using it without any problems until yesterday. She had been typing an e-mail on her computer when it just died. She had tried to turn it back on again, but it did not work, and neither did replugging the battery and charger. 

I checked with a different charger; nothing. I tried with a different battery; nothing again. I now had to tell her the problem was probably with the power management on the motherboard. To be sure, we had to open it up and see for ourselves. Repairs would probably run into the high hundreds for a motherboard replacement. She did not like the estimation. 

“But I have a warranty!” she said with a somewhat threatening voice. “Only for the first 6 months,” I said, “It’s a refurbished model”. She did not want to pay hundreds of dollars for repairs, and honestly I could understand that. “I’ll see what other options we have for you.” I checked the store computer if we had any comparable notebooks in the back that could replace the broken one. We did; the exact same model with a slightly better processor. She asked what the price would be. “$249,” I said, “and we will switch the hard drive so you will still have all your files.”

She did not want it. Knowing that we had another computer, she tried to get that for free because she had a warranty. “Can’t you just switch them? Your boss doesn’t need to know,” she said. I was not going to switch the notebooks. 

By now she had made enough noise for Jeremy to come to the counter as well. Her face lit up. Not thinking anything else of it, I turned back to the PC to look up the price for the motherboard of her notebook. Before Jeremy could even say anything she said, “I bet you can use some fun around this place”. I looked up; she had pulled up her shirt and was now showing her boobs to Jeremy and me. “Get my ThinkPad replaced and I’ll let you play with them”. She saw my surprised face and frowned. “Sorry, I don’t do girls, sweetie.”

Before us now stood a 40-something woman with her top off. She probably was pretty back when she was my age, but that had faded away from the large amounts of sunbathing she had done. Her skin was orange and old, looking like the surface of Mars. Her breasts were saggy and wrinkled. She had a bit of a weight problem, but wasn’t obese. Jeremy quickly replied with what had to be his magnum opus: “The fact that I work with old computers doesn’t mean I like all old things.” Her personality sphere malfunctioned; it was a critical hit on her system. Jeremy continued on, “please pull up your top and either pay for the repairs or leave the store.” I was laughing at this moment, adding to her anger.

Her charm had not worked. She demanded to speak to the boss. Neither Jeremy or me wanted to deal with her anymore today. We told her Don was out for the day and would be back tomorrow morning. She left, saying she would be back the first thing tomorrow morning. I didn’t care, I wasn’t scheduled until one in the afternoon. 

When I came in that afternoon the first thing I did was to check the stockpile of notebooks. The ThinkPad was nowhere to be found. I did not want to know what happened this morning. Don’s office was closed as usual, and I was not going in. I went to work and had an uneasy feeling all day; Jeremy had the same. At around four Don came out of his office. He was leaving early; he had a date with somebody he met this morning. 

Jeremy later went into his office to look at his internet history: he had been looking up dating advice all day.

So this next story happened about a few weeks before Richard and Frank got fired and may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: if you meet yourself reading this, don’t make eye contact.
 
I was working in the store when a father and son came in. The father was a man in his late 50s and looked like a mix of a British lord and a crazy scientist. The son was a perfect stereotype of a Hollywood computer geek with an extra dash of social awkwardness.

They were looking for a new notebook he could use for college. He would be studying computer science in the fall, his father told me. The son remained silent and probably felt uncomfortable in the situation. I noticed that he kept looking at me - he knew what was going to happen and he could do nothing about it.

“My son deserves the very best notebook to make his study a success,” the father said loudly, as if he was proclaiming the word of God. Thinking about it, I should have said something along the lines of, “and thats why you chose our store, you will only find the very best quality here.” However, I know I could not have said that with a straight face.

I tried to pry out some more information about his needs, but the father kept insisting his son would study computer science, and nothing less. I gave up on trying to pinpoint what he would be specializing in and showed him a number of notebooks that would be suitable. All the ports you could possibly need, a good CPU and enough options to upgrade the memory and storage. We actually had some decent notebooks in our shop.

The father was a self proclaimed computer scientist himself, as he had read all the computer magazines religiously since 1995. He quickly dismissed everything I had said and looked at me with a stern face of disapproval before saying “That notebook cannot be faster than the other one, it has more gigahertz!”. This was not going to be easy. 

I tried to explain that the megahertz of the CPU were only part of the performance of a computer; there were many other factors to consider. He looked at his son and asked him if he knew about this. Still uncomfortable with the entire situation the son silently said that yes, I was right.

The father did not care to apologize for his stupidity and quickly changed the subject to one of the other notebooks - a rather old off-brand notebook. This computer was from 2005 and nothing special. It was too late; he was in love with it. It was perfect, other notebooks be damned. I saw the look in the eyes of his son and tried to persuade the father to buy one of the ThinkPads instead. They have a better build quality and are in the same price range. He was having none of it. We walked to the register with the notebook and a collection of the burning antivirus and firewall software that had been rated the best by his computer magazines.

At the register, the father finally noticed that his son had been looking at me all the time. He went silent for a few moments and probably arranged our wedding in his head. His demeanor changed. He now wanted to buy me too, for his son.

“You and my son seem to have a lot in common, with computers and things,” he said in a rather over friendly tone. I said, “We probably do. Your total will come to $499; how would you like to pay?” He ignored my question. “Do you play any computer games? He plays them constantly.” I looked at him and said “I share a Gamecube with my sister, how do you want to pay?”. He ignored my question again and kept asking questions. Finally he asked how much he should add to the $499 to have me go on a date with his son. His son hid his face in shame, he wanted to leave. “Can you stop asking these questions and just pay your total?” I asked. Not taking half measures I added “I have a boyfriend anyway”. He refused to believe me and now got a little aggressive, demanding a photo of this boyfriend of mine before he was going to pay. I was never going to get rid of him. I had become more assertive by now, standing my ground and about to cancel the transaction. 

Suddenly Richard and Frank got out of the back and walked up to me, putting their hands around me and kissing me on the cheek. Richard from the left, Frank on the right. They looked at the father and son and said in unison “We are her boyfriends, is there anything we can do for you?”. The father was shocked by this love triangle. He quickly grabbed his son and walked out. Richard and Frank had been listening in the back from the beginning and had seen their opportunity. I was happy they did, though I felt like smashing my head into the glass counter afterwards.

So a few years back my laptop died.  Well more accurately the power jack in the side of the laptop came loose on the motherboard, and power would no longer get into the running hamsters and make computer go zoom.

It was of course, 3 days after the warranty expired (I am sure that comes as no surprise to anyone) but I thought I would call Dell anyway to see if they can help.

Tech:  How can I help you, what is the problem, blah blah blah

Me:  The power adapter plug on the motherboard is loose and I can no long get power.  Can I get a replacement?

Tech:  Ok, can you get into Windows?

Me:  No, the laptop has no power.  The batter is drained, it cannot boot up.

Tech:  Can you log in to Windows?  We need to check a few things.

Me:  No, the laptop has no power.  It cannot boot up.

Tech:  Ok, cannot log into Windows.  Can you hit F8 when it is booting up so we can do a logged boot up.

Me:  No, the laptop has no power.  It cannot boot up.

Tech:  Is it network cable properly plugged in?

Me:  Ummm, no, but that is irrelevant.  The laptop will not boot up, there is no power.

Tech:  Well your system I see is no longer under warranty.

Me:  I know that.  That isn't the issue.  What can I do about the problem I am actually calling about.  Do I need a new motherboard?  Can I get a replacement jack?

Tech:  I can't help you unless you boot into windows and we check a few things.

Me:  Please listen to me.  I cannot boot into Windows.  There is no power coming from the wall into the wire into the jack onto the motherboard.  Period.  Do you understand?

Tech:  Well I can't help you with that.  We do however, have a sale for xxxx that we can give you for 599.99.

Me:  This conversation is over.

Tech:  Thank you for your call.  Please tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how was this experience.

Me:  A very generous 1.

Tech:  Why would you say that.  I solved your problem.

Me:  Really?  I am sitting here frustrated with a broken laptop, how would I be satisfied with that.

Tech:  I gave you an option that will solve your problem.  Your experience is a success.

chewieconcarne,74,137,wwqty,539,"So about two years ago when I worked for a small business, we had an outbreat of that lovely Antivirus 2007 variant.  You know the one.  Poses as a fake AV scanner, hijacks your system and demands you pay $$$ to get rid of the viruses on your system.

Well after having cleaned off the upteenth system I sent around an email to the company describing the issue and alerting people what to do should they find their system infected.  I included a pretty laymans term explanation and even screen shots.  I added (which included red font, bold, and like 30pt) the words, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU PAY THE $$ ASKED BY THE PROGRAM.  CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY SO THAT I CAN REMOVE THE VIRUS AND RESTORE YOUR SYSTEM TO WORKING ORDER.

So I send this out and people thank me.  About 2 hours later, I get a call from one of the older folks in the company saying, hey I saw your email and my system was hijacked.  I said, no problem, bring it on by.  He tells me then that he decided to pay the ransom thinking it would fix the issue.  I said oh dear lord no, didn't you read the part of my email where I said to not do that?? He says yeah but...

I'm like, oh boy.  So I tell him to bring the system on by and I start delousing it. Meanwhile he's asking me if it was a bad idea to pay the ransom.  I tried to explain to him not only did they now have whatever he agreed to pay, but also his credit card info.  Thanks to him not listening to my email, I had to instruct him on calling his CC company to put a watch on it, and reverse the charge if they could.

Last I knew it turned into a CC nightmare for him.  At least his laptop was cleaned after.

depricatedzero,72,139,1pmwx7,538,"So from another thread I made a comment and people are asking for the story behind it. It's not as weird as it sounds at first, but perhaps today is particularly apropos for sharing.

I used to support a major restaurant chain. As happens sometimes, one of our VIPs died. A few days later, we're in the process of shutting down his accounts, when suddenly an email comes in from him. I pondered over it for a moment, it read along the lines of (names are obviously changed):

    Subject: Laptop Refresh for Marla  
    Hi, I need to have Marla Singer's laptop refreshed. She has a T60 and it runs really slow. 

    Thanks!
    Tyler

So we did discussed it amongst ourselves and decided that there's the off chance this was stuck in his outbox and only just sent. So we replied asking him to bring it up.
About an hour later, Marla shows up with her laptop and is all like ""Hey, Tyler wanted me to drop this off for a refresh. He's really busy and couldn't do it himself."" So we take the laptop, check it in, send her on her way, and write up a report to HR.

I'm not sure what happened from there, but the laptop was retired a couple days later and as far as I know no new one went out.

trrwilson,56,104,1iq36t,534,"Background:  Field support for a large bank. Until our recent VOIP conversion, this included analog phone systems.  Also, some of the buildings I work in are old.  Very old.

Here's some history of the building I had to visit.  When this building was first turned into a bank, 25-pair cables were run to each office and teller station.  They provided a connections for the terminals (yes, terminals) and phones in each office.  Eventually, they upgraded to BNC network connections for the PCs, which required running coax for each terminal.  The continued to use the 25-pair cables for the phones. After that, they ran CAT-5 for the PCs, still using the 25-pair connections for the phones.  Some time in the early 00s, they remodeled the place completely.  New CAT-5 was run for the PC and the phone for each office and teller station.  The termination points on the 25-pair cables and BNC cabling were cut off and stuffed into the wall, then the boxes were covered with blank plates.

What they never did during all of this, was pull the old cables out of the walls. The 25-pair, BNC, and old CAT-5 were all still there, in a huge rat's nest in the corner of the comm. room.  The new cables were terminated very neatly on a rack right above this, with all the new runs tightly bound together and disappearing into the ball of unused insulated copper below it.

One day, I got a call to check out a phone.  No dial tone, no power, all the others in the branch are working.  I grabbed a spare phone, my phone tools, and a couple cables, then went out to see them.  I arrived and verified what the user was saying.  Yep, dead phone.  I replaced the cable going from the phone to the wall.  Nope, still dead.  I replaced the phone.  Nope, still dead.  I replaced the cable going from the phone system to the patch panel.  Nothing.

Now things get to be a pain.  I re-terminated the phone jack in the office, but that didn't help.  My last thing to try was re-terminating at the patch panel.  I didn't have a jack that fit the panel, so I got a biscuit jack so I could just pull the wire off the panel, re-terminate with a new box, and attach the box to the side of the rack.

In order to move the wire that far, I had to pull it out of the wrapped bundle.  I started undoing the velcro strapping, pulling the wire out, then replacing the strapping on the remaining bundle.  Finally, I got down to the last strap, stuck right in the middle of the rat's nest.

At this point, I discovered it was a literal rat's nest.  I reached my hand down and heard rustling and squeaking and saw a large rat poke its head out at me, then start climbing the cable bundle, using the velcro strapping like rungs on a ladder.

I screamed like a little girl and jumped back, and knocked my toolbox off the table, scattering tools and connectors everywhere.  The tellers heard this and one of them came running, thinking I must have hurt myself.  They sew me, backing out of the room, a mess of IT debris, and a rat, perched on the rack.  After a few seconds of staring, it scampered down the cable bundle and disappeared into the same hole in the wall as all the cables.

After a visit from an exterminator and an electrician, they figured out the rat had chewed through tons of cables, mostly hitting dead ones, until it finally bit through a live one, causing the phone to die.  Thankfully, the manager was able to convince the electrician running the replacement cable to pull out all of the old ones that weren't being used, hopefully preventing future rodent visitations.

LoganPhyve,96,114,14ocm3,536,"Here's one from a few years ago I think you'll all enjoy.

Some time ago, I worked for a casino/hotel as a sysadmin. I loved my job and the people I worked with, but it got crazy from time to time due to SLA's and uptime necessities. 

6 months prior to the incident, I had become a brand new father and as such, spent the last 6 months doing nothing but working, keeping house, changing diapers, and trying to get sleep where possible. Having a super-colicy baby is no cake walk and both my wife and I were beyond tired and stressed all the time. 

I was off the on-call rotation this particular week, and my wife and I decided to try to squeeze a date in, since it had been at least half a year since we had spent time with just each other. We had decided to see a movie and grab dinner, made plans, and dropped our 6mo daughter off with my parents across town for the first time ever.

About halfway through the movie, my on-call phone started blowing up. We were required to carry our phones 24/7 in the event we were needed for any reason, even off-hours, though we never got on-call calls when off the schedule. If I'm getting a call now... something serious is going down. My co-worker was the first to call. I ignored it and continued with the movie. My manager rang my phone moments later, and again, I ignored it being off schedule on my first date in who-knows-how-long. Another minute passes and my director rings me. This one I can't ignore, something must be seriously messed up for him to step in at this point. I take the call outside the theater door.

""You need to get down here asap. I know you're off rotation, but this can't wait. One of the construction workers was running an excavator trenching for some new plumbing install and snapped our fiber trunk from the NOC to the hotel and casino. They're completely dark right now, hotel and guest services and the casino floor are down. We need to get them back online ASAP! How soon can you be here?""

I told my wife what had happened and she reluctantly agreed we'd have to reschedule. I was usually the day-saver there, having the skills to create a workaround for something like this on the fly.

I rush to work while formulating a plan in my head. I had facilities on the phone gathering some extension cords for me. I had my co-worker on the phone next, to find me several 150+ foot runs of cat5e and a switch. Then security, to get entrances and exits set up for immediate access.

When I got there, I quickly assessed the damage and went to work. I had facilities help me pull power out to the middle of the parking lot, where we dropped a 5-port gig dumbswitch. Out of each side we ran a line back to the core in our NOC, and a IDF panel in the back of the casino. After a few minutes of cross-parking-lot cable stringing, plug and play, and finger crossing, we were able to establish a link between the remote IDF and the core in our NOC. Slowly but surely, remote network gear came back online and we had to reconfigure the systems to work over the new link. At a blazing single 10/100, we were back in business. Temporarily. No comparison for 3 pair of fiber strands, but it let us take care of our customers. Time to deploy when on site: 20 minutes.

We had an emergency repair service come in and help us patch up what was left of the mangled fiber. The runs were pulled so hard, it unsheathed the glass from the casing and pulled the conductor out of the cable looms and almost all the way to the wall conduit leading out underground. It was a fugly mess.

We were able to patch in a few unused links from another run, and temporarily repair one or two of the dead runs for some temp service. We needed a few days to figure out replacing the damaged runs. The repairs tested working, and seemed to carry signal just fine, so we had a bit of time to get some new runs set up over the next two weeks.

After re-establishing the temp fiber links, we decom'd the temp cat5e run, reconfigured, and brought everything back up. Everything came back up FF, and we were ""restored"". My total time on property was about from 5:30pm to about 12:30am to address the issue. Total downtime was about 45-50 minutes, iirc.

Being on-call sucks... but it does sometimes feel pretty rewarding when you're the hero that pulls the business back out of the oblivion of a downtime black hole. I don't even remember what movie it was, either. So much for trying to have a date once in a while.","Another testament to the joys of being on call 24/7... ""Someone snapped the fiber trunk""",650

So, like most ISPs, we have a spam filter installed server-side on the ISP mail server. Customer's have the ability to log in to this service and customize it, adding to the black/white list and adjusting the frequency they receive the ""Quarantine Report."" 

The quarantine report is just 1 single email with a list of all blocked email, with an option for the customer to release any non-spam messages that may have been erroneously blocked. 

Today I got a call from an angry woman regarding her quarantine.. 

Essentially, she finds it very upsetting and offensive that she is getting reports in her inbox that are talking about ""enlarging male genitals"" and other ""smut"" every day. She was sure to remind me throughout the call that she is a CHRISTIAN Woman, and that this kind of thing is NOT appropriate from a company. 

I offered to remove the quarantine reporting service, so that these reports would no longer show up for her, but she did not accept this as a solution because she wants to review them to be sure that there isn't anything that needs to be released from it. 


It came down to an impossible call. A call with no solution, other than for me to control the nature of the spam she is receiving. 

I think she felt good inside, yelling at me about her superior morals. Personally, I wanted to inform her of two more possible solutions: 

1) Just stay off the internet and other public forums where her closed world-view may be threatened or 

2) Pray about it and have Jesus become her new spam filter. 

Of course I couldn't say this, and simply repeated that I could stop the reports from coming, but that I can't control who is spamming and what they are spamming about.

I work tech support for the school part time while taking classes.  I know how hard it is to be a student, so I give a STEEP discount for my services when other students need help.

Yesterday, a guy gives me a call.  He asks me, ""Can you do anything for me if I've been hacked?"" My first thought was ""Hacked...right. Everyone thinks they've been hacked.""  So I ask him, ""What is your computer doing?""  He responds, ""Well, this window keeps popping up from the FBI saying I need to pay them $200 or they are going to arrest me.""

Ah yes. FBI Moneypak.  I've actually been reading up on this one the past week just in case I encountered it in the wild. My body was ready.

I told the guy, ""You haven't been hacked, but you do have a pretty serious virus. I can take care of it for you.  My rate is $20.""  He brings me his laptop, leaves for his class, and I go to work.  This variant was one of the easy ones, just a startup menu item, an .exe file in appdata/roming, an .exe file in a temp directory and surprisingly NO changes to the registry.  I manually cleaned up what I could and used Malwarebytes to take care of the rest.  

The next day I give him back his computer, teach him how to tweak his startup a little using msconfig, and explain safe surfing practices along with some trusted free antivirus solutions.  He had been using Norton when he got this one and was unhappy with it.  This is an older guy. I think he's working on a Doctorate.  He asks me, ""How much for the work?""  I respond, ""20 bucks is my student rate.""  The guy puts some folded bills into my palm and says, ""The rest will help when someone else has a hard time paying you"" then he smiles at me and walks away.

I opened up the bills in my hand and see $120.

[deleted],81,97,18qpkk,530,"I work in a call center for a very large, very popular computer manufacturer.  The computers I support are known for not getting too many viruses or intrusions, so when I get someone who claims they've been hacked, they're one of a few things: old, completely illiterate when it comes to technology, or crazy.  Or all of the above.

I get a call from a lady who claims her computer has been hacked.  It's been a few months, so the deatils of the call are a little bit fuzzy.  It's not too long, and really only a few elements to it.  But here ya go:

 I ask her name and reason for the call, and she quickly exclaims how worried she is that all of her information has been compromised.  Seeing as how usually most errors I see on a daily basis are user error, I ask her how she knows this.  She replies:

""I called Geek Squad and a guy came out to my house to fix my computer.  Well he stole all of my information, and then proceeded to set my WiFi password to 'murder.'  He did this right before exited my house and killed my dog.""

At this point, I was stunned.  I've had crazy stories and drunks, but nothing like this.  ""Ma'am, I would suggest you call your local law enforcement and get in contact with Geek Squad with the name of the associate who came to your location.""

""I already called Geek Squad!  They said they didn't have anyone by that name even employed there.""

At this point, I could do nothing but refer her to law enforcement.  I saved the case number, forwarded it to my manager, who proceeded to crack up down the aisle as he listened to it.

[deleted],65,151,v3j72,535,"This guy...he's going to be a problem. He started last week, and he's about as technically inclined as a potted plant. Every day it's been something different. The first day, he couldn't get into his machine because the starting password we gave him contained the ""@"" symbol. So he was trying to log in using his e-mail address as the password. This was day one. He also got lost in the (about 85-90 people, single story) building trying to show me back to his desk. 

Our network will lock users out if there are too many failed login attempts. So at one point earlier this week, he came back to tell us he was locked out of his system for trying passwords too many times. We log into the Novell console, see that this is not the case, so I head to his cubicle to go take a look. He was ""locked out"" of a third party CRM application that will not lock you out, no matter how many times you fuck up the password. I still have no idea what the hell he was talking about.

Today, however, he really got me. He brought back a calculator (you may know it as an adding machine) and asked us how to turn down the volume. My supervisor and I looked at each other, equally confused, for a second and I finally picked it up. I looked at the top. The bottom. The back, the front, the sides. 

Me: ""I'm...not seeing a speaker anywhere.""  
He: ""No, I mean the uh...sound it makes when I push the buttons.""

My supervisor and I share another confused look.

He: ""Like the plus or minus buttons.""

Having a degree in accounting, I'm somewhat familiar with adding machines. It finally clicks with me that the ""volume"" he's referring to is actually the sound of the machine printing the operations on the paper roll. Turned off the built in printer and he was good to go.

TotalSuck,115,67,1im86i,528,"Hi,

My first time post, sorry for my bad English.

I work in Finland at the IT-company that provides other companies with the IT-solutions. We also take care of companies workstations.
One of our customer is our own city and we renew every workstation that this city has like fire departments, schools etc.

One day we took  about 30 workstations with new monitors to a cityhall. After switching most of the computer we notice that one workstation have a 15"" LCD monitor that was probably made in 90s. The monitor also had two ""blackscreens"" on it.

After few moments of wondering the owner of the workstation comes in and says ""no, no, no don't change my monitor"". We said that we have to change every monitor. The lady reply's that ""This new monitors give me headache, because of the electricity that comes from the monitor"".

We try to explain her that this are new LED-monitors, they are bigger which will help you with your work and the light can be dimmet.

She said that she will test that monitor on her co-workers workstation. She went for the testing and after 15 seconds she said ""no I cannot work on this monitor, it gives me headache"".

After that we reply that we will leave you with the old monitor, but we would need to get adapter for the new computer (old monitor --&gt; new computer... no input)

I ask her that do you own a TV to which she reply that yes. I ask her what kind of TV you have. She said its big and flat. I ask her and do you get headache from watching the TV to which she said ""no, but thats because TV's do not have computer inside of them"".

thndrchld,287,139,xmo5e,534,"A few years ago, I was working at a little mom-and-pop computer repair shop right down the street from a reasonably-sized private college.

A girl from the college comes in, in absolute tears.  She pulled a laptop out of her bag.  

Apparently, the night before, she had a party in her dorm room.  Some drunken idiot had spilled a FULL glass of beer into her brand new laptop that her dad had JUST bought her.

In her haste to try to fix it, she had attempted to take a hair dryer to it on high.  She had melted the keyboard.  In addition, while drukenly trying to fix it, she had dropped it and cracked the screen.

The laptop was filled with beer, melted, and had a broken screen.  

""My dad's gonna be here in three hours!  You have to fix it!  Dad's gonna kill me!""

Needless to say, there was NO way we could fix it in three hours.  At the very MINIMUM we would have needed a few days to order the parts.

She bawled when we told here there was absolutely no way we could do it in time.

She ended up buying another of the exact same model from the Circuit City down the road, and passing it off as the one her dad had bought.

Christmas_Pirate,163,108,1m3g9x,528,"/r/talesfromretail suggested I post this here since its kinda tech support. It is certainly the same kind of end user stupidity which is more or less appropriate here.  I work as a manager at some library in one of those fancy Colleges we all hear about.  Now if any of you are at all familiar with these bastions of thought they can get rather pricey and you can get some right entitled twats that think because they spend thousands to go there they should get the royal treatment.

Anyway, a couple weeks ago the freshmen moved in, which happens a day or two before the rest of the 
classes. This year the move happened to be on a Sunday and as such, most services were closed. The library was open for a short time as a general area to get information like where such and such building is and for the occasional over achiever to get books. Usually its a pretty easy shift to cover, however, an easy shift wouldn't be a tale... lets call the tale Rich entitled Prick or RIP (get over it).

Christmas_pirate: Hello ma'am, is there anything I can help you with?

RIP: Actually yes, my son just moved in and we can only register two devices on the network, I was wondering if you could set up his iPad for him. (She has an ipad with her and evidently isn't a big believer in self reliance, or maybe the son was just unpacking... my hindsight is biased)

CP: I'm sorry Ma'am, that's something ITS handles, but I doubt anyone is over there. They should be in tomorrow.

RIP: Well can you give me their phone number?

CP: Sure hold on. Ok the number is 555-herp.

RIP: Thank you. *proceeds to call* There's no one answering, could you get me the head of the department's number?

CP: I'm sorry, I don't have that, I only have what's on their website. (I do have the other number, but I know the guy in charge well enough to know he is not there right now, and even if he was, he wouldn't be happy I gave something like that out to a non-employee).

RIP: Ok, well is there anything you can do about it?

CP: Again I'm sorry, but that kind of thing is handled by ITS and I have no idea how to go about registering your son's electronics.

RIP: Do you know how much I pay for my little derp to go here? ""DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM""?! (She could be one of the few people that give millions or a Dean's wife, I have no idea, but I still feel that escalated quickly)

CP: Again I'm sorry Ma'am but there's nothing I can do, your son can use any of the computers here if he needs to and there are various computers around the campus...

RIP: This is absolutely unacceptable, get me your manager!

CP: I am the most senior person here right now, my manager won't be in until tomorrow. (Again its Sunday and besides a few dining workers and campus safety I am the ONLY staff member on campus)

RIP: You're lying, you're just a student, get me your manager. (I also graduated from a similar island of higher thinking a couple years ago so reasonably people assume I am a student)

CP: Actually, I'm the Night Manager here and normally we aren't even open sundays during the summer, the only reason we are open now is because my manager asked if I could come in specifically so they didn't have to. There isn't anyone else here.

RIP: Fine then get me their number.

CP: Ok, its 555-derp.

RIP: No not their school number, I want THEIR number!

CP: I don't have that (I do), but even if I did I can't give you that (I can't its their personal phone number for emergencies not a company phone).

RIP: This is absolutely unacceptable, I'll be speaking with [big fat-cat on the board] and I'll have your job! ಠuಠ^excellent, ^severance ^package!

CP: I'm sorry I can't help you, but unless there is something you need help with using library resources I'm going to ask you to leave.

*RIP leaves in a huff presumably to console her son who is undoubtedly crying in a corner because he can't watch Breaking Bad, Play Civilization V, AND chat with his friends on ~~Facebook~~ myspace at the same time*

**Edit**: mam -&gt; Ma'am, I don't know how to shorten words good.

trrwilson,63,117,1k2gxx,534,"Quick background.  IT support for a bank, we're a 3rd party vendor, poop always rolls downhill, and we're at the bottom of the hill.  Oh, and this is a long one.

About our banking software: it has two parts.  A UNIX mainframe with terminal emulators on each PC, a web based GUI which is easy to use, and has some functions that UNIX doesn't have.  The GUI feeds info into UNIX, and UNIX actually runs the transactions.   Each branch also has a unique number for lots of reasons.  However, not each branch number refers to an actual physical location.  We have ""shadow branches"" that are set up so employees can still do banking transactions, even if they aren't an actual branch.  This comes into play later.

Second bit of background info: each physical branch has a check printer.  They are named in such a way as to indicate which branch they are at i.e. CHKPRT12345.  When a branch opens, a print queue is created in 3 places.  There's one on the windows print server, one in UNIX, and one in GUI.  Our company has no access to the GUI or UNIX servers, we only have access to the windows print servers. The bank's internal IT department has to create the UNIX and GUI queues.  Some of you can probably guess what's coming.

A few months ago, a regional HQ in a city about 3 hours away was moving.  Along with the move, a ""shadow branch"" is upgraded to a full service branch. Meetings are had, plans are made, dates are decided on.  At this point, the bank's project manager, let's call her Retail Moron, or RM, has to submit assorted requests to various departments.  One request is to have the check printer be set up in UNIX and GUI because it's an upgrade from a shadow branch to the real thing. Any predictions about what happened yet?

Well, the big day rolls around, me and my boss spend all day Friday tagging and unhooking about 75 machines.  Movers then haul the stuff to the new building.  We spend Saturday hooking it all up and installing all the new equipment in the about-to-open new branch.  This included submitting the info for our new check printer; our server guys set up the windows queue like they're supposed to, and successfully print a test page. We left the building at 6 pm on Saturday, with me staying through to Monday to do day-1 support.

Surprisingly, there were no day-one issues except one lost mouse and one broken docking station.  I take care of those few things and I'm ready to leave, when the branch manager (BM) comes up to me.

BM: We can't print checks!
Me: OK, let me take a look.

Printer is pulling paper, NIC is working, the server team can print test pages.

Me: OK, whatever problem you're having is with UNIX or GUI.  The printer is working fine, but some part of the banking software isn't seeing it.  You'll have to call the help desk; they can send a ticket to these teams.
Her: OK

A week passes, then I get an e-mail from RM.  My boss has been CC'd, as well as his boss, the contract manager, BM, and our help desk supervisor. ""Branch 12345 (the one that was just upgraded) isn't able to print checks and no action has been taken.  This needs to be resolved immediately!""

I go through our ticket history and find out the user never called the help desk.  BM went straight to RM and started whining.  Because it's high priority, I have to load up a spare check printer and head out at 5am the next morning so that I can be at this branch at 8 am.

I show up, and the printer is in the same state it was in before.  The NIC is working, it pulls paper, and test pages from the server will print.  Our remote support team and myself know that it's a UNIX or GUI issue at this point.  I e-mail a person from each team explaining what's going on.  They ignored us almost all day, we put read receipts on our messages, and they weren't even looked at for 5 hours.  They don't want to mess with anything unless I replace the printer.  I replace the printer, our server team sets up the print queue on the server.  After all this, I'm back to where I started, with the new printer behaving just like the old one.  At this point, it's 6 pm, and all the UNIX and GUI support teams are gone.  I haul my exhausted self back to my home office.

Our teams spends the next three days trying to get a response from the UNIX and GUI programmers.  We're forwarding e-mail from retail moron to the programmers, but they just ignore us with the bravado of people who have too much job security.  On the third day, the GUI team coughs up some news.  The printer doesn't exist in GUI.  They'll create it, but it won't go live until their maintenance window, which is overnight between Wednesday and Thursday every other week. This is in 8 days. They're actually apologetic about the whole thing, but maintenance is maintenance and can't be rescheduled.

Throughout this whole ordeal, Retail Moron is getting more and more shrill and threatening. She's fairly new to the job, and has a HUGE chip on her shoulder because there was a lot of competition for her position when it opened up. Accusations of incompetence are being thrown around, mostly directed at our company.  We're not giving this enough attention, even though the bank internal IT is what's holding things up.

First thing Thursday morning after the maintenance window, I call the branch.  Still no check printing.  It has to be UNIX at this point. But no, they're forcing us to replace the printer AGAIN.  I then drag my extremely grumpy self back to the branch, replace the printer again, and get a repeat of the previous events.  The printer is physically sound, it's on the network, the windows print queue is working, and it exists in GUI.  At this point, we're all screaming at UNIX to check the programming.  Finally, we get a break.  The reason they won't do anything is because they site is still listed as a shadow branch.  Because of assorted regulations and policies, they need an official request before they can upgrade it from ""shadow branch"" to full-service. They also can't create the UNIX queue until the upgrade happens.

At this point, RM loses her head.    She starts accusing people of trying to make her look bad and get her fired.  Heads are going to roll.  If she gets her way, none of us will even be able to get a job involving any electronic device, since we are that incompetent (I'm paraphrasing from various e-mail and comments made during meetings)

We start going through project logs and find out that Retail Moron never requested anything to do with the check printer.  The submission form keeps a log of visits.  She never once even opened the website to submit the form.  The b**** wind went out of her sails in an instant.  She couldn't berate or lie her way out of a situation she had created. At this point, since the branch has been without check printing capabilities for over a month, the request is rushed, the UNIX group has to do an immediate programming change, execute their testing immediately, and push the changes into production as soon as testing is complete. All this mean a fair bit of overtime for some highly-paid UNIX guys.

We and the UNIX team billed Retail Moron's department for nearly 200 hours of project work, as well as travel expenses.  Last we heard, she was fired and is working as an entry-level teller at another bank.

I got some cool things out of it and was given a special parking spot for the month that I didn't use once since it was farther away from my normal entrance and desk than where I normally go, but I digress...

I was working T2 support and we were required to take T2 calls, answer chats, answer emails and take T1 calls.  I worked the night shift and it was always much busier at night than during the day.  We are also not allowed to go busy (not take calls) to make outgoing calls or to do any of the other responsibilities.  We can also only call by 9PM at the latest and I started at 3 or 4PM (time is kinda foggy).

We would have non stop incoming calls and 20 minute - 2 hour waiting times until about 10PM depending on how bad our admins screwed things up.

Joe was the top trader for our company's highest revenue trading desk. It was Monday morning shortly after market open following a weekend of major developments in his sector. A few minutes downtime could cost his business tens of thousands of dollars and I was the only first-line support guy in the office.

The prior emergency I was rushing to attend melted into insignificance. I doubled back for the stock room and with a new keyboard under my arm I sprinted the length of the maintenance corridor to burst onto the middle of the trading floor opposite Joe's desk.

Joe had a Bloomberg keyboard and as anyone who has seen one will testify, they are sturdy, dependable devices that rarely fail. More often than not it's a loose cable or a software problem so that was my train of thought as I skidded to a halt.

""The bloody keyboard is bloody knackered"" said Joe in his thick cockney London accent. ""I'm losing money 'ere, see if you can fix it pronto.""

A quick visual inspection revealed nothing obvious. In fact Joe's desk was a conspicuously tidy example of sanitation compared to his fellow traders, whose filthy input devices almost certainly contravened the Geneva convention ban on biological weapon stockpiling.

Typing on his pristine keyboard produced nothing but the mouse was working fine. I ducked under the desk to check cables but everything was plugged in properly. With no time to troubleshoot the new keyboard was swiftly unboxed and cabled up through the desk conduits to his workstation below. A quick switch of the connectors and a working Caps Lock light confirmed it was alive.

""So, what happened?"" I asked Joe. ""No idea son, it just stopped working"" he replied. ""Oh well, these things happen"" I reassured him. ""I'll take the old one away.""

And with that I picked up his old keyboard and tilted it into the box, only to have a torrent of lukewarm coffee piss out over the desk, new keyboard and my freshly dry-cleaned shirt and trousers.

* * *

My days as the vengeful wench of the east had passed and I was back to working in the store. It had been two months of nothing and by now it was already November. My trip to Sweden with 3 of my friends was only memories, photos and junky souvenirs. I was bored — really bored.
 
While I was mindlessly browsing on the internet behind the counter, a customer came in. He was only the 5th one that night. Only 2 hours to go until closing.
 
The customer was dressed in a blue-black business suit that was 3 sizes too big for him. It was actually quite the accomplishment as he would easily hit 400lbs (180kg) on the scale. He wore unmatching light brown shoes underneath the suit. He missed the necktie and an overall sense of how a suit should be worn. Girls do take notice of your clothes.
 
He stood in the store with a sense of authority. I wanted to walk up to him, but he quickly put his hand in the air and, as if proclaiming the word of God, shouted “I AM JUST BROWSING!” No help? Fine by me. He started looking at the notebooks on display one by one and was shaking his head at each of them, mumbling underneath his breath.
 
He turned his attention to me and again with a raised voice said “WHY DON’T YOU HAVE ANY MODERN COMPUTERS?” I don’t know what he expected to find when he walked into his store; we are clearly in the business of selling refurbished and last-years models.
 
Staying behind the counter, I looked at him and said “Sir, you can lower your voice? I can hear you perfectly fine from here.” I paused slightly and continued: “we mostly sell refurbished notebooks, but we have a few new Sony VAIO models in the back that have not been put on display yet. Do you want to see them?”
 
The VAIO notebooks were the newest models available in Europe. Why and how we had them, I don’t know. I went to the back to get one out and show it to him. I got back just as he started furiously pacing around, angry that I had taken so long. I was away for a minute. “Why don’t you have this stuff on display!? You are making a customer wait! My time is worth a lot of money! This is not how a business should work!"" 
 
I decided to ignore this comments as he wasn’t attacking me personally. I unpacked the VAIO and showed him the specifications. This notebook had the best configuration of all the notebooks in the store, but it wasn’t good enough for him. “I need a better GPY,” — that is not a typo — “I need to do important business work on this computer!”
 
“You mean a GPU,” I said. “That’s what I said,” he replied immediately with irritation in his voice. I decided to ignore his comment again. “Why don’t you tell me what you need the computer for and maybe we can find something that suits your needs,” I replied in a last ditch effort to get this man to stop complaining and actually work towards finding a fitting computer.
 
“It’s probably too complicated for you, but fine, if you want to know,” he replied. It was around now that I started becoming agitated and started to lose my cool. “I handle import, export and distribution for many big companies in Germany. My company is worth millions. Do you understand this?” 

“Yes, I do know what all those words mean when put into a sentence, but I need to know what you want to use the computer for.”

“I need to keep important spreadsheets and contracts, invoices and letters and copies of shipment papers and use websites for tracking.” He just needed an ordinary notebook, with maybe a bigger hard drive for storing his library of 20kb word files.
 
I told him I felt that this computer would meet his requirements with a wide margin and asked him where he felt it did not. He replied that it doesn’t matter, “You are not helping me! I want someone who knows what he is talking about, not some GIRL.” He had played the gender card; I raised him a Don.
 
With Don coming in his demeanour changed. Maybe it was because Don was even heavier and bigger and it impressed him. With Don taking over and repeating exactly what I had said, the notebook was suddenly fine. He wanted to buy it now. The “GPY” was also good enough. Don’s work was done here. A sandwich was waiting in his office. I had to finalise the sale.
 
When we got at the counter the big important businessman wanted to know about our premium services. While I still think that Ron and Don were intimately familiar with the offerings of premium services, we never used that terminology. We only sold some shoddy extended warranty and Chinese knock-off USB-gadgets with our notebooks.
 
As such, I told him he could purchase 1 year extended warranty that covers some of the hardware defects that the notebooks are prone for. It must have been at the register that he finally started to register my face, as his next comment was sudden and unexpected from a man that just minutes ago called me “some GIRL.”
 
“I was hoping you’d be a premium service,” he said to me. 

I had been working at the store now for over a year now and had built up a tough skin. I wasn’t the shy, easily flustered girl anymore; I was the one that knocks. I answered him with an air of arrogance,  “that would be quite a few levels higher than premium.” I paused slightly, “How’d you like to pay for your notebook?” What I hadn’t realised with my new found savviness was that I was talking to the important business Gorilla that was worth millions. I just gave him an opening to keep trying.
 
He was quick to react and started talking again about his multi-million company and how he would dominate the export and import for the whole of Europe in just a few years. That I could be there with him was the underlying tone of his story. 
 
I quickly cut him off, pointing out that I was not interested in any way, that I was only 17, and that my comment was a bad attempt at a joke. He did not lie about his persistence. It was very much there. After a few more misplaced comments from him about me I had had enough.
 
“Please stop with this. I don’t believe you are worth millions and honestly no money in the world would make whatever you are fantasizing happen.” His grin changed into a frown. “Stupid girl, you just don’t recognise a true man when you see one”.
 
He ticked me off. I was done being polite.

I started yelling at him, “Do you know why I think you are not a true man? For one, you are in a second hand computer repair shop. If you were worth millions you would be in a different store. Two; your designer suit isn’t a designer suit. It’s a cheap black market knockoff from Hugo Boss. The fabric is wrong, the stitching are wrong, the buttons are wrong.” He was getting angry. “Besides, it’s 3 sizes too big; it’s not even tailored”. 

He slammed his fist on the glass counter and pulled up his sleeve, showing a Rolex watch. “Does this look fake to you!? It’s a 50,000 dollar watch.” I replied to him simply, “I cannot believe that. If your suit is fake, why would your watch be real?”
 
While I might sound cool now, I sounded more and more like one of those awkward girl on those scripted reality shows from MTV. Those that explode in rage and fail miserably in delivering the message.
 
By now Don had walked into the store again to hear what the commotion was all about. He saw me and the 400 lb Gorilla shouting at each other. He started calling me all kinds of names; I kept on repeating calling him a fake.
 
Then out of nowhere, and in front of Don, he hit me in the face. I don’t know if he hit me because he felt cornered being called out for being a fake, or the fact that a seventeen year old kid was insulting him. 

Don dropped what he had in his hands and walked up to the supposed multimillion dollar Gorilla, pushing him towards the door. Don shouted at top of his lungs to “LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK.” He gave another push. The Gorilla became aggressive and hit Don in the face. Don reacted with a headbutt. The Gorilla took Don with him in his fall, knocking over the tables and promotional material. Two fat men were now wresting and rolling around on the floor. I did the only thing I could do: I called 911.
 
It took well over a couple minutes before any police arrived and pulled them apart. I was scared of what would have happened if Don had lost the fight. They had been all over the store by now, finally ending in the back, the Gorilla with his back on the floor. The store was a mess. They were both bleeding. Blood smears were on the walls next to the back door.

When the police came they arrested both Don and the Gorilla. They took a statement from me, helped me close the shop and brought me home. Don called me later that night, apologising for what happened and asking if I was ok. He gave me the next two shifts off; Frank and Richard would clean up. 

Don seemed to still be a decent human being under all those layers of saturated fat. I was happy Don took responsibility and tried to get him out of the store instead of charging him extra for damaging goods.
 
The businessman was charged with assault, but things never went anywhere. He got off with a fine and the same happened for Don. Ron wasn’t too pleased about it all. Jeremy told me that all he seemed to care about was where the cops had been in the store and if they had taken anything. When he learned they had been in the back Ron exploded in anger to Don. 
 
4 days later when I came back to work again, I had been working for over an hour and noticed something strange in the upper corners of the store. We had state-of-the-art cameras covering every square meter. This was Ron’s work. Security cameras in a store should make you feel safe to a certain degree, but for me it just felt eerie knowing that Ron would probably be watching.

mystimel,73,135,wqfbi,525,"A little background: I've had a job for about 4 or 5 years at the local public library. One of my main duties is to teach basic computer skills one-on-one to people who sign up (mostly seniors and clueless older adults) Although I'm mainly there to teach people how to use the library's system (weird public interface/outdated software), sometimes people will bring in their cell phone, laptop, or ask me questions about their home setup. I try to be helpful when I can be. 

One of my favorite students was a Norwegian man. He had a heavy accent and was always polite and adorable, smiling and asking questions. Sometimes his wife came along and watched him learn. They would look up pictures of Norway on Google, and liked to ask me what the internet could do. I tried teaching them email, searching, Google maps, Wikipedia, etc.

TLDR: One day funny old Norwegian man comes in looking puzzled and says ""My computer, it von't move. Nothing happen!"" speaking of his home desktop computer. 

I quickly explain that it sounds like his computer is ""frozen,"" and explain to him that the simplest way to fix it is to hold down the power button until it shuts off, wait a minute, and turn it back on again.

""OK! I vill try zat vhen I go home""

On our next appointment a week later he comes into my office area beaming, and puts his hands on my shoulders. Immediately he exclaims in triumph ""I defrosted it!!"" 

It took me a minute to figure out what he was talking about. Of course a frozen computer needs to be defrosted. 

BTW my second love besides computer lessons is teaching ESL which is probably why this story is one of my favorites. I teach ESL as my main job for 20 hours every week.

[Mr. Trimmer and I](http://imgur.com/pVoTx) He participates in toastmasters club, where he gives speeches, and he is also an artist. He mainly uses the computer to look up information for his speeches, but in November he also comes in to look up pictures he might draw on his yearly hand-drawn christmas cards. He often comes in just to chat and he will bring in pictures of the painted portraits he does of his relatives, friends, or of their pets. One day he asks for a picture of me, and I give it to him and a month later he brought in that painting of me. It must have taken him forever. He's very old but very sweet and calls me ""darling"" I worry that he won't live too much longer, but I'm happy that I will always have that painting he gave me to remember him.

terahurts,160,91,mxen2,525,"My dad's a semi-retired domestic electrician, he does odd jobs like adding extra wall sockets and wiring peoples garages on the retirement park he lives on.  A few weeks ago I get a call from him asking if I know anything about network wiring (I'm by no means an expert, but I know the basics), since step-mum's boss wants dad to completely re-wire an old cottage and he also wants network points all over the place.  I the basics over the phone and suggest that I pop over and take a look as it'll probably be easier to explain on-site.  

So off I drive to this rickety old cottage with a few hastily printed diagrams to show dad.  As I'm explaining the concept of patch panels and switches and how each socket needs it's own run of cable back to the patch the owner arrives.  Introductions are made and we start talking about how many sockets he wants, and where they are all going to patch back to.  He draws out a diagram showing various network sockets in each room, but no termination point.

When I mention patch panels he stops me any says

'I don't need a patch panel, I want all the sockets on the same ring.'

Me: 'Ummmm, you want all the sockets connected to *one run* of Cat6?'

Him: 'Obviously'

Me: 'You want *all the sockets* connected in a *ring*?  That won't work.....'

Him: 'I don't see why I should pay for all that extra cable when your dad can just do it in one go!'

Me: 'But the minute you plug more than two devices in nothing will work!'

Him: 'Stop trying to rip me off, I asked an expert in PC World and he said it should be like a ring-main!'

Me: '................!'

I advised dad to do it the way the owner wanted but get him to sign a disclaimer to that effect.   Dad spent a couple of weeks doing a complete electrical re-wire and adding the owners new 'ring-main' network topology, got his disclaimer signed and walked away a couple of grand better off.

Last night I get a call from dad telling me the owner had just called him.  He'd moved in, plugged his PC, Router, Xbox, IP security cameras, and networked smart meters in and nothing was working.  He wanted dad to go out and fix it.  At no cost.  Apparently he has 'no memory' of my 'you're doing it wrong' conversation or of signing anything to that effect.  Dad emailed him a copy of the note he'd signed, along with a suitably outrageous quote for putting things right.  Which will involve ripping up all the new polished wood floorboards, filling the understairs cupboard with network patches and either chopping channels in the newly replastered and decorated walls, or sticking plastic trunking all over the place.","Cat6, the know-it-all and my dad.",616
hulkwillsmashu,105,78,1modsa,522,"So, I get this call from a former customer, claiming that we're hacking his computer today and believes we're going to charge him. Didn't really make any sense, but I told the guy I'd be happy to look into it. He reads off a message from his screen, and it's a bandwidth notification screen that pops up on a customer's browser when they get close to or go over their bandwidth allowance for the billing cycle. He hasn't had our internet service in over a year so this makes even less sense than before.

So I start trying to get some information from him, I ask him who his current ISP is now, ""I dropped your service because you were ripping me off so now I'm connecting thru wifi"". At this point, I'm thinking cell phone network or even satellite, but for him to get the bandwidth notification, it just seems fishy.... So, he tells me that he doesn't pay for the wifi, and then he rattles off the name of the network he's connected to. I hear the name of the network, and it's got a smart ass name that I would name mine, if I were in that kind of mood. He's connected to a neighbor's wireless and stealing their bandwidth!!!

So, I start trying to explain to him that that while he is not connected to us thru equipment in his house, he is connected to a neighbor's unsecured wireless, that connects with us. This is why he's seeing the bandwidth notice. I explained our bandwidth policy, explained that while we aren't going to charge him for the overage, he could potentially cause his neighbor to be charged extra. You'd think hearing this, he'd realize what this means, and pretty much decide to stop stealing his neighbor's internet. You'd think, but oh fuck no, you're wrong.

Its at this point that he decides go into full psycho, conspiracy nut mode. He begins to tell me about how the internet is free, and it's companies like me that have taken that internet away from people like him, and started charging for it. This is the problem with 'Merica today. I began to explain that the internet is not free, it costs money to maintain and provide the service, so there has to be a charge for it. 

Him: ""Well, what about all these companies and stores that provide free internet? There's no charges for that, are you calling them liars?""

Me: ""Those companies do pay for the internet themselves, and usually provide it to customers for free, as an incentive to come in and purchase goods or services.""

I tried everything with this guy, logic, even tried appealing to his moral sensibilities. Nope, just kept going back to ""the internet is free, I'm calling him a thief, and calling the companies that provide ""free internet"" liars. The government is in control of all this, and my own personal internet service at home is paid for by his taxes (we're a cable ISP, and while I don't pay alot for my internet, I do pay for it since I want the fastest speeds). After about 20, 25 minutes of this guy's BS, and since I can't determine which customer he's stealing from by the network name, I decided to try a new tactic:

Me: ""Ok, lets take a look and see if you are connected to one of our networks....""

Him: ""Ok""

Me: ""Type in the address bar, www.IP, and I know it sounds weird... chicken.com.   www.ipchicken.com."" 

So he does this and I get the IP address, which is one of ours...

Me: ""Ok, so that's definitely one of our networks, which means, if you don't have our service, then you're definitely connected to your neighbor's wireless network, and will potentially cause them to pay extra...."" Trying one last time to realize the error of his ways....

He starts his conspiracy bullshit again, and finally about 10 minutes later, I finally got him off the phone. But I had what I needed....

I used the IP address he gave me, to look up the actual paying customer's account, and about an hour later, I had gotten ahold of that customer. I explained the issue, without giving any specifics or who it was. He was very grateful that we had found this issue and would take steps to secure his wireless immediately. 

I really wish I could see the look on the guy's face when his internet was shut off lol.

I work in a mobile phone repair kiosk in Australia and i usually have customers just coming to get their phones done, they don't want to chat much and just get a price book in and leave. I had an old man (OM) come in today with a old nokia phone that was no longer ringing, when he got text messages it rang and in settings it rang just when he got calls it made no sound. It was diagnosed to be a software issue and we decided to factory reset the phone. 

because we were fairly busy and i had to wait to use our POS i started talking to OM, he was asking me about my job and how i got into the tech business, my parents own the company, but i have always been interested in taking apart electronics to see how they work. we talked for a while and he said ""im 87 years old, the most technological thing we had back in my day was the telephone, i think its good that you know so much about this at a young age"" (im 16) he talked about how he only used the phone for texts and calls and he needed help to use his computer. It was just a very pleasent exchange.

We eventually got the phone restored to factory settings and all his contacts transferred back on and it was ringing again, haazaa, i gave him a ring to test and it was all good, i set the phone to maximum volume (he had a hearing aid) and gave him the phone back. he asked how much for the help, and i said it was free because i didnt really do much, and it only took like 10 minutes and was a good change from the usual customers, he called me in close and said something that made my day, he said "" if you have a mum, tell her i think your brilliant""

shell_shocked_today,62,140,11nl03,526,"Here's another one of my stories of when I was a consultant.  If you recall, I was working for a consulting firm based out of Texas in a high travel position.

This week I was returning to South Carolina, where I had spent some time working at a client's location.  I was working on implementing part of a bigger enterprise rollout, and putting it politely, the rollout was fucked.  I was contracted to a different consulting firm to help them on the project.  

My chain of command went: Me, Project Manager, 3rd Party Project Manager, Client Manager.  And, I was the only rep on-site from either consulting firm, so I had to deal with all of the angry complaints from the customer on why this project was two months late.

And, to be honest, they customer deserved to be upset.  They had been promised a lot of things that hadn't been delivered yet.  And, the software I was implementing from my firm - it turns out that this customer was one of the first clients that was using certain functions, and I was finding serious bugs in it.  

I was getting nightly builds of the software from our engineering department to resolve the issues.

Finally, I got a clean run of the software through the sample data set that had been supplied.  It was Thursday evening, and I was set to fly home on Friday.  I had a friend's wedding I was going to on Sat, and for me to make it, I needed to be on the 2pm flight on Friday.

I was thrilled that the data worked, because I didn't want to come back the following week.  So, I emailed the client manager that we had a clean run of the data, and that we could run through their live data tomorrow to see how it went.  

I stayed late working on the system documentation, and had everything ready so that I should be able to leave by noon.

So, Friday morning, the manager was too busy to supply me with the data.  Finally, just before noon, she comes with the 40 000 page data sample which needs to be parsed.

It turns out that the sample data set I had was NOT representative of the live data set....  Information which was in a fixed field in the sample data was free form text in the report.  The data set was seriously inconsistent with the sample data, and to no great surprise, the report was not parsed correctly.

The manager then blows up in my face, starts swearing at me, telling me how I am not allowed to leave until this is fixed, and how the lawyers will be after my company, etc.  

Like I said, I needed to be on a plane by 2pm, and she had waited until noon to supply the data.  There wasn't even time for me to look to see whether this would be an easy fix or not.

I tried telling her that I would be back on Monday, and that this would hopefully be able to be resolved in a day or two.  That just made things worse.  She is screeching at this point.  People are groundhogging out of their cubes to see what is going on.

I interrupt her, inform her that I have to leave now, and that if she has an issue, here's the number for the VP of professional services.  He'll be happy to listen to you.

As I walk out the door, before she has time to reach her phone, I have my cell speed-dialing to the VP.  Luckily, I have been an excellent employee with no complaints from customers in the past.  I explain what happened, and say that I had needed to leave before I blew up at her.  But, that if he needed me to, I could go somewhere to cool off for a bit and go back.

His response was ""Hell no.  You won't be going back there until you get an apology from her.""  I was told to catch my flight, and that they would let me know where I'd be working the next week, but it wouldn't be there.

I spent the next two weeks working at a nice easy gig, until I got a phone call from South Carolina.  The manager was calling to aplogize, and asked if I would consider coming back to work.  Apparently the VP had sent the 2nd string consultants there to 'help' her the previous two weeks....   

I told her that I hadn't ever told my management I didn't want to work there, and that if she would like me to return, she needed to talk to VP, as he was responsible for my schedule.  I then called VP to let him know she had apologized....

I spent the next week in South Carolina, successfully delivered the product to them, and made everyone happy.

But it was a strange situation at the end.  I received a thank-you letter from the client for my hard work at the same time they were suing the consulting company they had hired for the project. 

But nothing bad happened to my company from there....

SerBeardian,90,151,1owddm,532,"Today I had a lovely win, so I wanted to share it with you all. Sorry for the long post.

Preface: I work Frontline Support for the small/medium business services of a major Australian ISP. We deal with both internet and email/domain issues (for domains hosted by us) as well as general computer issues directly related to internet access.

The Story: I get a call this morning from a dealer (Basically a franchise-style sales/support for our services) who has this client that has recently set up his emails with our domain and is not able to send any mail.

I had just written up an ""Ultimate Guide to Domains and Emails"" for our team to use, and am pretty savvy when it comes to domains, so I think ""This will be easy enough"" and run through the basics:

Is the domain with us? Check. Are the Registrar/Name Servers/MX records acceptable? Check. No glaring problems with the Domain? Check. Mailbox set up and working on the Mail Server? Check.

Everything checks out, I tell the dealer to connect the customer through.

...1 minute later, the call drops. I'm weighing up whether to try and contact the customer direct or take a different call. I decide service is a better choice and start hitting the contact numbers on the account.

3rd attempt I get through. Let's call the customer JG. Older gent in his early 70s. I introduce myself and explain that I was supposed to be helping him out but the call dropped with the dealer. He seems friendly enough but in a rush. I ask him if he's ok with me just remoting into the computer and setting it up for him. He gives the ok and I prep it from my end.

I get him to go to www.logmein123.com, no dice. Try again, nothing. I send him an email direct link and it doesn't come through right away. 

At this stage he's pretty upset since he's been having problems for a month and we're roadblocking from go. He's gotta make a call overseas in 5 minutes and can't hang around.

I try and get him to call me back when he's done since our queue is fairly full right now, but he's having none of it and wants a call back in 20 minutes. I say fine, I might not be able to in 20 minutes, but I'll call back same day.

2 standard calls and an hour later, the queue is low enough to warrant an outbound call. I hit up his number and get through right away (Btw? This guy picks up the phone like he can hear me dialling...).

He's feeling a bit better since he got his call through ok, so we get started. Try the website, no luck getting through. Send him 2 emails, since the first one arrived, but they're not going through.

Finally, he mentions that he had some DNS problems the other day. I think he's probably still having them, considering some pages do load after a while, but others don't.

Windows+R

cmd

ipconfig /all

DNS servers are something strange, not ours.

We joke about what they might be and I figure we can just use Google. (since I can never rememeber the IPs of our DNS servers...)

Win+R

ncpa.cpl

Network interfaces

Right click&gt;properties&gt;doubleclick TCP/IP v4.

IP and DNS are auto, so no real idea where the others are coming from.

I get him to set the primary DNS to 8.8.8.8 and the secondary to the old primary (in case it's actually important).

Pages load almost instantly, computer works great now. Huzzah! More jokes.

About an hour so far and we finally get to logmein and I get him to download the file.

Bam. Anti-virused. Fuck Norton.

Takes 15 minutes to get around Norton and get logmein downloaded and working. Finally, I'm in and in control. Let's take a look at Outlook.

Two emails. One with another ISP. One with us.

Hit send/recieve. SMTP server is asking for user/pass. Ok, that's strange. Our smtp server doesn't needs a user/pass.

Check settings, all correct. Correct user/pass, correct mail servers, correct everything. Problem doesn't go away.

Recreate mailbox, fiddle with every setting I can think of.

JG needs to have lunch. Makes sense since we've been at it for about 2 hours now. Figure, may as well call Domain Admin while he does, check to make sure the domain is OK.

Call them, they agree it's a weird situation but we can't make heads or tails of it.

Get back to JG and let him finish his lunch while I poke and prod the computer. He's done in a few minutes, and we get back to general chit-chat while I fiddle with it. Coming up on 3 hours and I'm finishing in 15 minutes.

Now, thoughout this whole time, the connection kept dropping out, every few minutes. I mention this and JG drops the bombshell that broke the case: His previous ISP was a wireless one, using a dish/antenna on the roof and he got ADSL because it kept dropping out a lot, especially bad weather.

No...

No way it's that simple.

www.ipchicken.com.

IP does not match his static IP with us.

He's still using his old bloody ISP service!

Copy SMTP from his other ISP email.

Paste into SMTP for our email.

Done and freaking DONE.

Everything works. Emails send ok. Emails receive ok.

We laugh it off.

I get him to send an email to the dealer to get him switched across to our equipment and change the SMTPs back.

Support complete.

Bonus round!

He asks me how to renew the license for Norton, since he doesn't like using his credit card online.

I recommend using a free AV instead and get him to ask the dealer or his It support, since we can't recommend any specific AV programs.

JG: ""Aw come on, nobody will know.""

Me: ""Well, you know, the calls are recorded and all.""

JG: (laughs) ""Well alright, I'll just get (dealer) to recommend one, but if anyone's listening, I'd like to say you're absolutely brilliant.""

Me: ""Wellll...my manager is sitting right over there, how about you tell him yourself?""

JG: ""Sure! Why not?""

MG: ""Cool! I'll get him in a sec!""

Grab my Team Leader (Who's a pretty cool guy.) for a commendation.

He comes over, starts chatting with JG and taking down notes...and then they start talking about AFL and what teams they support.

Turns out, JG used to play for my TL's favourite teams growing up and was pretty much his childhood hero. My TL is speechless (and he's always got something to say.) and stammering over the stunned realisation that he's talking to one of his heroes.

After wrapping up the call, I log off and begin signing out to head home, pleased with my double win.

TL;DR: Spend 3 hours fixing an email problem with a simple but hidden cause. Get TL for commendation. Customer is TL's childhood hero. ++Brownie points.

Tier Two was the summer of love.  I labored willingly and gleefully under her stern discipline, my fellow Tier Two monkies pulling alongside me.  Pay went up.  Life was good.  


Then I got the night shift, and the keys to the palace.  


Night Shift was the best thing ever, especially once I trained myself to wake instantly and quickly to the ring of the phone.  I spent many nights sleeping at work and playing during the day, zero missed or dropped calls and high satisfaction ratings.  One memorable evening, I was building legos in the helldesk, and the phone rang. 


""Thank you for calling $Best_ISP, how can I help you?""


The reply was velvet over shapely hips, the caress of softness on naked skin.  It was one of the sexiest voices I have ever heard.  


""Great, now I'm going to have to put up with some young buck giggling about my username AGAIN""


It was also a rather irritated sexy voice.  I hastily assured this unknown user at the other end of my line that I was a trained professional buck, regardless of my age.  She said she would give me a chance.  Then she unloaded on me with both barrels. 


""OK, my username is Phone_Whore, my primary email is Phone_Whore@Best_ISP.net, and my secondary account is Proper_Name, which is of course Proper_Name@Best_ISP.net.   I have two of your biggest DSL connections, and one of them keeps dropping offline.  I'm losing income because I'm unable to reliably upload my videos.  I am a sex cam performer, is that a problem?""

I had been prepared for this.  This was the absolute peak of my career, and it was a call I had taken while playing with legos.  I took a breath to cover the pause. 


""No, Ma'am, I don't see how that could be.  I have your account details up, and both accounts are in good standing.  I do see multiple connections attempts on your secondary account, this is certainly indicative of a problem...""


We troubleshot the problem, which turned out to be a split pair at the NID - the customer was about 200 feet away from the DSLAM, so even with a split pair (-30db signal right thurrrr), she was able to connect..   occasionally.   I chatted with her about webcam technology, and commiserated about finding a device that could autofocus worth a damn - a problem I still have.  The call ended, the account was noted, and I had a smoke before going back to my legos.


But the story doesn't end there. Three days later, I get back from a drunken weekend of smoking pot and playing RIFTS, and I pull into the parking lot to see the boss's car - not my demigod of a tier 3 trainer, but our corporate overlord.  She who's power it is to bind and to loose.  She who gets off at 5pm - 2 hours ago.


Oh.   Oh balls.


With every minor misdeed and excursion outside the rules playing in my head, I stride into the helldesk to get my walking papers.


Instead of that, I got an early review, which meant a minor raise two months early.  I got a letter of commendation in my file, and a strong personal kudo from the boss (and she bribed in chocolate - hell yes.).  Phone_Whore had called back the next day during normal business hours..   and asked for the boss..    and it turns out, I was the only employee of $Best_ISP to have ever been professional enough not to make a joke or be amused or offended by her username.

aj4000,118,153,16j1fk,526,"Being a field service technician for Retail Wagering terminals means I had to deal with not only our customers, the terminal operators, but their customers as well. 

In my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/153lv8/oh_thank_heavens_youre_finally_here/) I told the story of an old lady who forgot how to use a key. This story is the tale of a belligerent patron who felt he had to resort to violence... 

In addition to the background I gave in my previous story; We worked 12 hour shifts, 8am to 8pm, 7 days a fortnight, including weekends. Friday and Saturday were our busiest days.

I had a service call one Saturday for a single terminal venue whose internal barcode scanner had stopped working. I'd attended this venue previously an knew that a replacement was required. The whole process to change it would take around 5 minutes. The operator (who was a nice lady that we'll call Ms Nice) called out to the customers that the terminal would be down for a few minutes, and if they wanted to get their bets on, to do it now. 2 older gentlemen did so, and thanked us for letting them know. A third man, probably mid-40's (who I will refer to as Mr Angry), just grunted and paid no attention.

Getting the go ahead from Ms Nice, I open the lid and get to work. 2 minutes in, Mr Angry comes out of the viewing area at top speed with a card in his hands, skids to a halt on front of the disassembled terminal and frantically looks for the card slot. After about 5 seconds, the realisation that the terminal is down kicks in, and Mr Angry gets angry...

**Mr Angry:** *points at the disassembled terminal* ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!!??""

The outburst is so loud and sudden, that it actually startles both myself and Ms Nice.

**Me:** Um... Sorry sir, just replacing a faulty part, I'll onl-

**Mr Angry:** *cutting me off* On a fucking SATURDAY!? You little c*nt! Why the fuck would you pull this bullshit on a Saturday!? (Yes, he actually called me that... Welcome to Australia.)

**Ms Nice:** ""Sir, please refrain from using that language. I called out saying the terminal would be down for 5 minutes and to place and bets you wanted, but you didn't-

**Mr Angry:** ""I should be able to place my bets whenever the fuck I want! This is BULLSHIT!!""

He then scrunched up the ticket and threw it at me. It hit me in the face, but it was only a little piece of paper, so...

""You'd better hope it doesn't win."" *Points at me* ""You watch your back! I should take you out to the carpark and fuck you up, you little fuck!""

Mr Angry then storms off back to the viewing area, and while I quickly get back to finishing the scanner replacement, Ms Nice picks up the card he threw, smooths it out, reads it, and then places it on the counter next to the terminal. ""Just in case..."" She says.

Another minute passes and I'm almost done reassembling the terminal and Mr Angry make another appearance...

**Mr Angry:** *pointing at me* ""YOU! You cost me over $5000! Because of YOU I missed my bet! You owe me $5000! I had $XXX to win on that winner and- 

**Ms Nice:** *cutting him off* ""ACTUALLY...  "" *She holds up his discarded card* ""You had 50 cents for a place on number Y, and it ran dead last...""

The look on Mr Angry's face was absolutely priceless. The kind of dumb, shocked look, coupled with his face going ghost white. He said nothing more, turned, and left the venue. 30 seconds later the terminal was reassembled, tested and working beautifully.

I saw Ms Nice a few more times after that, and she said he hadn't been in since then.

**TL;DR:** Would you care for a serving of threats with those lies?

EDIT: fixed bolding, censored the c-word...

EDIT 2: Seems a few people are confused about how our roster worked. It spanned over a fortnight, or 2 weeks. We were rostered on for 7 of the 14 days. It started on a Tuesday. We were on-shift Tuesday and Wednesday, off-shift Thursday and Friday, then on-shift again Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Then it would alternate, off Tuesday and Wednesday, on Thursday and Friday, off Saturday, Sunday and Monday. 

It was a great roster and actually worked really well for what we did, and it shit all over your standard 4 on, 4 off roster where you're working at least one weekend day for 5 weeks in a row...",Because threats of violence are a sure-fire way to get what you want.,679
MikroMan,115,117,12mjfr,524,"So, a year ago, our school bought about a dozen of new interactive boards. And the weekend they were delivered, the school's IT guy wanted to set up the first one. 


My class was the first one to be in that particular classroom on the next Monday morning. Obviously, we noticed the fancy, shiny new smart board. The teacher was excited, and quickly decided to try it out. It powered on OK, projector displayed the image, but the computer wouldn't correctly install the drivers. 


Teacher: Hey MikroMan, could you help me with getting this set up?
I walked over to the computer desk and started checking: USB cable connected, power cable for the board connected, LEDs on whiteboard working, screws holding tightly... Wait!? Screws? 


About 2 cm from each border, in every corner, there was a screw holding the board on the wall. In the parts of the interactive area.


Yep, you read it right. The IT guy mounted the whiteboard by screwing four screws into the pen-sensitive area covering the electronic circuitry. I can't imagine how the guy kept his job afterwards... The damned thing cost 3000 EUR (3800 USD) a piece and he completely destroyed it.


They were never able to fix the thing up. I was there when the official company support tech came to check if they could do anything, and he just stood there dumbfounded for about a minute. Our school had to buy a new one and this time, the company's tech support was present, to ensure ''normal installation''.

This morning I'm working away on issues like always when one of the admins calls me. 

""This is Derpa, I have a guy on the phone saying there is a problem with windows.""

""Oh, okay. I'll see what I can do.""

I take the call and it is a guy with a very heavy middle eastern accent. We work often with people from that part of the country and have had some great experiences. One of our major clients outsources all there IT needs and we work great with them. I'm excited for this one. 

They guy lets me know he is from ""Mircosoft call center"". Oh ya. Not ""the"" Microsoft call center, the one located in the Garden of Eden and plated with gold and diamonds is it?

he continues to tell me that my computer is seeing a report that there is something wrong with it. I ask him which computer. We have over 100 computers in the building not to mention all the servers. So I ask him if the report to him included a computer name or Ip address. Looks like the report to him only include the information ""Windows 7"", and nothing else. But he is pretty adamant that it is the computer I am currently sitting at. 

Well if he is so sure I had better let him troubleshoot this for me. So I proceed to let him troubleshoot it. 

""You see the c t r l key on your keyboard?"" he askes.

""yes I see the control key on the keyboard."" I reply

""Yes the ctrl key."" he asks again.

I let him know again I know the key.

Finally he gets that I know which key it is. He then continues, ""Next to it is the windows key. Press that and the R key""

""Yep, done that. What do you want me to run?"" I reply.

""Type I N F and press enter.""

""Got it I have the INF folder up.""

He continues going on tellling me that all those files are responses to the virus that I have and we need to fix it.

I then start to see if he will play. I ask him again how he got my info and what my name was. He was good enough to know my first name from the Admin Assistant that transferred the call to me. But doesn't know my last name. 

I then ask him where he worked. Which again is just ""call center"". I then asked him for some random made up Microsoft reseller partner number. 

Hey then asks me if I am IT. I say yes. His response is classic, ""Liar, you're not IT"" and hangs up on me.

Note : Am working in a medium sized office running on a fairly stable network infrastructure. I'm not tech support (anymore) here, but I know enough to know my way around PCs and networks. Most of the users here are fairly competent for the most part when it comes to computers, so I never thought I'd experience the following...


I was sedately going through my work, when I noticed that many of my windows were stuck in the Green Ring of Death (Firefox users should know. I'd prefer Chrome, but the web-based system I am working with seems to be a little more stable in Firefox and IE, and I am not touching IE &gt;.&lt;). 


Walking over to the IT desks to inquire (and grab some free chow), I find that I was not the only one with ""Internets Downs"". As I walked back to my spot in the cubicle jungle with some jelly beans, I see more and more people standing up and chatting/loitering/raging. Very soon, it was the whole office.


By now, our comrades of IT are frantically checking and double checking the connections, which eventually led to all of them crowding into our small server room to individually check each connection. After some time consulting the Network Gods, they marched out and proceeded to our boardroom single file. A minute later, they marched right back out, then went back to their desks, laughing amongst themselves.


Not to be left out of the levity, I sauntered over to our IT manager's spot and asked ""So what happened?""

WheredMyMindGo,113,94,yyy0u,523,"Background: I am a female IT manager for a medium sized company. Aside from helping out on escaladed issues and running over to hit mute on a team member's phone before they let an end-user have it for being incompetent, one of my 'benefits' is sitting in on 'technically related terminations' with HR. Our end-users generally work in either MWF or THS shifts.

I present to you the events leading up to my Tuesday morning:

Tuesday (one week prior): Level 1 receives a call about a tablet that is acting funny and keeps re-directing the web pages to other 'not appropriate' sites. We assume some malware and clean it up remotely. Problem solved.

Wednesday: No calls from that location, but we received an email commenting about the amount of lag on the internet that day.

Thursday: The Malware is back with a vengeance (on that tablet only, thankfully.) The tablet is re-directing again and slow as molasses. Because we have a web filter, not only are the sites bogging it down , but the web filter is going crazy with alerts all over the screen saying ~~'No! Bad end-user!~~ Page Blocked due to Content. Please contact your administrator.'

Everyone is aware of the web filter and that it is tracked by IT. However, they are also aware that it’s only really checked if a problem arises (we don't like to be over-bearing internet police.) It is also a cheapy one so we don’t track by user. So, out of curiosity, I checked the filter logs from the day before. I was ready to see some 'not appropriate' sites in the log and was not let down.

As policy states, I notified HR and showed them a printed version of the log. Confused about what some of the sites and terms were, they looked them up on their computers whilst I sat there. The looks on their faces told me that damage had been done. They requested that I track down the user and watch the logs live on Friday (when the user will work next.) The woman in HR (still unable to make direct eye contact with me after going to those sites for some reason) then thanked me for my assistance. Her face clearly questioning the happy bubbled world she once knew 10 minutes ago. 

Friday: I watch the logs and find the user. To ensure the evidence was concrete, I connected to the tablet and print screened shots while they were using it. To my convenience, they were logged into our user-specific inventory site in one tab and naughtiness in the other. The print screen with the username displayed in the corner tab of the naughty site was more of an artistic icing on the cake for making me track this in the first place. End of day -- I let HR know. After seeing her face the first time, I made sure to include the print screens I took to see if she could make that face once more. She could. 

Monday: HR decides we are flying to that location to 'discuss' this activity with the employee and their supervisor. :: wait for it to register:: 'we?'  Yep! Tomorrow morning. 9am. Conference room at that location. Please bring all collected documentation to be shown as evidence.

Tuesday: D-Day. 9 am meeting begins. Clearly, the employee had not been brought up to speed on the situation and thought he was there for a good reason like a promotion or raise. All smiles and professionalism.  I watched his soul sink and his face turn pale as our conservative bubbly HR lady began to read off the website on the log with a pep in her voice. As I sit there like a fly on the wall, she pauses as she does not know how to properly pronounce a word. She leans over to me for clarification – “That would be Hentai, Ma’am.”

In the end he was terminated without any protest. His only justification being that he mainly used the tablet in the bathrooms. I handed him a copy of the printscreen to ensure he had it for his records. I’m trying to not crack a smile as the immature child in me is going [omgomgomgomg! Hahaha!]

As we go to leave, the HR lady stops him and says “How on earth do you even find something like Space Dicks?!” I bit the inside of my cheeks to keep from laughing. I had missed Reddit in the logs, but apparently the HR lady had not.  

We are currently sitting in a coffee place killing time before we fly back. The HR lady turned to me and said ‘I never really appreciated IT until now. The things you must see and the people you have to interact with. I always wondered why IT people were so quiet, now I know. There are things on the internet that you just can’t unsee.’  I am attempting to keep a calm consoling face as she is clearly disturbed by what she has seen, but have been typing this story in the interim to avoid laughing. I don’t know why I even want to laugh at her for that, but I will TOTALLY stay professional and release this onto Reddit instead. This has been an adventurous and entertaining tale from Tech Support that will keep me smiling for at least a few days. I know it’s not a glamorous one of technical networking feats, but to me it has still been pretty awesome.

Raphman90,355,124,wprq7,521,"Alright so first off I'd like to say, I love this subreddit, you guys have some great stories.

Anyway, I'm not in tech support myself, but I am a software engineer. So as all of you are familiar with, I help all my family with their technology needs whether it's trouble shooting computer problems, or showing them how to work the TV.

My mother owns her own company, and one day she comes home with an iPad from some of her clients claiming that they couldn't connect to their WiFi and asked me if I could help in anyway. Naturally, I can't do anything at my house about it (my mother is fairly technologically inept) and tell my mother that I'd have to go to her clients' house to see if I can fix the problem.

She calls them, and asks if that's okay. They agree and we head over. Once there I'm greeted by the nicest elder couple I've ever met (the husband is in his 90s and the wife in her 70s I believe). So as I'm troubleshooting their problem, the husband is telling me about his son(from a previous marriage) and how he was one of the first people to do computer-generated art back in the eighties. He also mentions that his son has passed away(which was pretty sad). I try everything I can think of to get the iPad connected to their encrypted WiFi, but I couldn't get it to work. I even reset their router to try to bring it to factory settings, for some reason it doesn't work.

Now I'm pretty exasperated as I couldn't figure it out so I decide to try one last thing. The woman tells me what her password is, and I guessed that maybe the tech who used it made the first letter a capital. Boom, iPad connected to the WiFi, the woman was ecstatic. 

As I go to leave the husband insists that I take a couple pieces of his son's one of a kind artwork, and forty dollars as payment. I try to decline the generous offer, however he insisted again, so I accepted. The next day I promptly took the artwork to get custom frames made for them. They should be ready today. It just goes to show you, sometimes awesome things happen.

**EDIT**: If you guys want, I could post some of the pamphlets that the husband gave me of his son's exhibits when I get home later tonight.

**EDIT 2**: fixed a spelling error

**EDIT 3**: I called and they said *maybe* they'd be ready  tomorrow. In the meantime, [Here's a scan of the pamphlet that I have] (http://imgur.com/girHV). Also: Damn this got a lot of attention, Thanks!

 So replying to you all about the pamphlet, I think got you all. Does anyone have a better suggestion to deliver the actual goods? it was a pain replying to you all XD

YouBWrong,122,111,19e77z,517,"Gather 'round young support professionals, and listen to old Uncle YouBWrong tell you a spooky tale from days of yore about every IT guys worst nightmare.

I've been with my company for a long time now, and I've made the whole gradual transition from the early decentralized days when you were given an office full of people and an IT budget and left alone to decide on infrastructure and servers and PC builds etc., to where we gradually centralized everything across several sister companies internationally.

In the end shuffle of all that re-organization I wound up in the server support team for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).  Of course managers will always sign off on integration long before things are actually integrated.  So we still had several offices in several countries where we had no idea what was actually there and how it was being managed.  Turkey had three such offices (Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir).  There's one guy who takes care of all three offices and he just got caught ordering servers that he was buying with company money and then selling for private gain.  So he's out and they hire a new guy.

The new guy is only supposed to handle local desktop support since all of the server stuff has been centralized, even though nobody on the server team knows anything at all about the boxes they have.  His first day in Ankara where his actual office will be, the new guy gets a call that none of the users in Istanbul can log in.  He hops in his car and drives out there and sees pretty quickly that there is a problem with the servers.

He tries escalating it to us but nobody can remote into any of the IPs he gives us.  After a frustrating day of trying to handle things remotely my boss puts out the call to see who can make it to Turkey quickest.  I'm in Frankfurt which is a major hub for air travel in Europe, so I win.

Okay, I get there and they have two racks of servers.  Their server room doubles as their storage closet.  It has a mobile air conditioner in it that crapped out a long time ago so temps are pretty goddamned high in there.  I take a quick inventory and they have a couple of Lotus Notes servers, an old file server, and a virtual host server with a DC running on it, SMS and another file server.  Every one of these servers has melted components inside.  I'm not using ""melted"" as a euphemism for broken.  They are physically melted and worthless.

I do what any one of you would do and start looking around for the tape drive.... but there isn't one.  So.... new guy...  where's the backup?

He runs off and asks the people who work in the office if they know anything about the backup and comes back with a hand full of DVDs, the most recent of which is a year and a half old.

Some of you are probably thinking exactly what I thought.  ""This sucks, but we can pull the hard drives and still get the data.""  One of our sister companies is actually a top provider of data retrieval so we send the disks to them.  They charged €16000 and still couldn't get anything off of the disks.

- - - - -

To fully understand this, we need to back to May 2012, when I was sitting in my paper-signing session with the HR rep from the HR firm that handled the hospital chain's account. I was sitting there, signing and initialing various things in the standard form contract, when I saw the intellectual property clause in it that said that basically, the client owned any and all IP I conceived of that could be job-related, even if I thought of, designed, and coded it completely off-hours on my own boxen.

Sure, it's probably not going to stand up in court, but no one wants to face lawyers, right?

So I crossed through that paragraph, initialed next to it, then wrote out the following very neatly in the double-spacing between the lines:

    REAL_NAME owns all intellectual property created by him in the course of his employment at CLIENT_NAME, 

    pursuant to relevant nondisclosure agreements and the applicable laws of the jurisdiction this agreement

    was signed in (the city of Austin, Travis County, Texas). All code, scripts, software, or other IP that 

    REAL_NAME may create in the course of his employment are his property, and are simply licensed to 

    CLIENT_NAME with a nontransferable, nonrenewable license until such time that he or CLIENT_NAME terminates 

    his employment at CLIENT_NAME. Should REAL_NAME, for any reason, cease employment at CLIENT_NAME or 

    any facilities that CLIENT_NAME owns or services, all licenses to use any IP created by REAL_NAME, or

    any and all derivatives of such, are immediately revoked.

Now, I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me that that pretty clearly states what the terms of my code are for the purposes of this international megacorp who just HAPPENS to be the sole IT provider for this hospital chain (anything I make, I own; you just get to use it while I'm employed there).

Any HR droid or lawyer worth their salt would have parsed that and thrown it back in my face going ""HA HA, OH WOW. GTFO.""

My HR rep, who played up the stereotypical blonde HR rep act very well (though she was quite good at her job), simply flipped through the pages and looked at the bottom to see if I'd initialed them. I don't think she expected to see anything out of the ordinary, and if she saw this, she sure didn't let on.

She gave me a copy of the contract, filed it, and left, and I drove back to my previous job (the one with the bleached-blonde vapid pennypinching harpy) and turned in my two weeks' notice on the spot.

**BUT ENOUGH FLASHBACKS...**

- - - - - 

In the not-too-distant past, I'd been taken off my normal project (rolling out eClinicalWorks to the multitude of clinics that my company owned) and been placed back into the general project pool.

I loathed it.

I loathed it with every fiber of my being, with the fire of a thousand gonorrhea sufferers peeing, with enough rage to make /r/shitredditsays look like a glade of hippies stoned out of their gourds on high-quality weed. I was stuck on projects like the rebuilding of an ER (which required me to be there at 3 IN THE DAMN MORNING), the move of an OB / GYN office to new facilities, and the support of the Derplesoft migration.

Even worse, I was rarely at my personal cube any more, and was instead stuck sharing a storage room converted into a makeshift office on the fourth floor of Derp Children's with four other techs, none of whom even remotely had the drive or intuition I did (and the PMs shared my sentiments on that, and were amazed that two of them were even hired).

I'd secretly begun looking for another job after that.

Meanwhile, my erstwhile PFY had been dutifully filling my role on the remaining eClinicalWorks projects; he kept busy with them, as well as... other things.

It's these other things that drew my attention.

I had opened up the eClinicalWorks installer folder on our DFS share to show another tech an example of good scripting - e.g. my automated installer and prep script - and I noticed a new folder inside there with the PFY's name on it. Curious, I opened it, and what was inside nearly made me go Sephiroth-on-Nibelheim-grade angry.

The folder contained scripts - several scripts, all of which were MY code.

Without credits attached.

AND WITH TYPOS IN THE ECHOED TEXT!

He even left the lines of code I'd had in that uniquely identified my scripts as mine in (e.g. specific file paths that I'd set up with nonsense words and file names, and commands that he didn't understand) and the variables unedited too (what kind of coder, unless they're a wee bit mentally unstable - or like me - would use %userderp% or %passderp% as a variable?).

See, I can tolerate people taking my scripts... if they ask me, or if I post them publicly. The version I'd posted up on Reddit wasn't the newest; in fact, it was version 1.0, and the newer versions had TONS of things that I'd improved or changed due to license key changes / GPO edits / redundancy. He'd taken the newest version of the script without asking me, trimmed out the credits, audio notifications, safety / integrity checks, and added. Fucking. TYPOS.

THAT'S what pissed me off more than anything. He took my work, passed it off as his, and then didn't even have the decency to make sure everything was spelled correctly (for example, ""Windows Update"" was spelled ""Windoes Updaet;"" similar typos were spread throughout the script).

If you're going to do something shitty, at least DO IT RIGHT, and hope that the people who can call you on it don't!

The project managers for eClinicalWorks knew about it. Hell, the one who was my former boss even CONDONED it and said he didn't care. ""You're off the project, what do you care?""

""It's MY work and I replaced the IP clause in my contract with something I wrote. You're too damn right I'd care about someone passing off my code as their shitty work, ESPECIALLY when I have changelogs and the original source to back up my claims.""

I immediately yanked my scripts - ALL of them - from the shares and moved all my work-related documents into a 4GB Truecrypt container on my laptop (AES - Twofish - Serpent with a sixty-character passphrase. I'd bet against Fort Meade on that one). 

Revenge - nay, JUSTICE - for something like this was not something to be meted out lightly. This was something I had to think on.

And as I sat back with the four other techs in my converted, cramped storage-room-cum-office, I loaded up [Super Mario Crossover on my rather tiny screen](http://imgur.com/a/SdbOt#0) (though admittedly with a rather excellent sound system, for which I forgave it), and pondered how best I could exact something that would make even Cartman go notbad.jpg.

CA1900,83,84,1a79wn,516,"Back in another life in the late 80's, I was working a summer in my father's office as part paper-pusher, part tech-support. (Small office, so really no need for a full-time tech guy.) The other partner in the firm, unfortunately, is an unbelievable jackass. He's never wrong, even when he is. We all know the type.

Anyway, summer usually means summer thunderstorms, and we all know what that means. This was long before UPSs were common or affordable, so we didn't have such luxuries on every desk, but we did have one on the file server, where all the user data was stored.

It's early afternoon, just after lunch, and we get a good crack of thunder followed by the power going out for half a second and coming right back on. I hear a bunch of the computers reboot, including the one at my desk. I log back in, resume where I left off (I lost maybe ten minutes' work), and didn't think much of it. That is until I hear the thunder of Mr. Hostile stomping down the hallway and staring right at me. I was the tech guy, so everything was naturally my fault.

""I've been working on this document all morning. What happened?""

I explain the power fluctuation.

""Well where's my document? I need my document!"" he yells at me.

""It should be wherever you saved it.""

""Wait, what do you mean, 'Save'?""

""You know, where you save it to our file server, so it's secure, backed up to the tape drive, and so forth.""

I get a blank, confused stare.

We went back and forth for a few minutes, until I came to a horrible realization: He has *never* saved a document in his entire life. He would type his drafts, print them out, and have his secretary retype and format the entire thing from scratch. Letters, long contracts, everything -- all typed twice.  He had been working on one of these drafts for *five hours* when the power blinked, and he lost all of it.

I tried to show him, and he just couldn't grasp the concept of the file directories at all. After a couple of hours, we both just gave up.

For all he used that computer for, we should have saved a fortune and just gotten him a typewriter! To him, that's really all it was.","Wait, what do you mean, ""save""?",600
jfiaff,58,97,10vt1o,515,"So this past summer I worked an IT job at a company that owned and operated restaurants, night clubs, and hotels all over Los Angeles and Hollywood.  This was a really cool job because I got to go to all of these high end nightclubs for “work.”


Anyways, one day I realized we were running dangerously low on loaner laptops (we were expanding and hiring a lot of new people who all needed laptops).  I do the logical thing and draft a few purchase orders for five new laptops for each department (restaurants, nightlife, hotels, events, and corporate).  Each purchase order has to get approved by the VP of each respective department as well as the CFO of the entire company.  The CFO goes ahead and approves all of the orders, and so do all of the VPs, with the exception of the nightlife VP (this guy is kind of a prick).  Anyways, I go ahead and place the orders for all of the laptops except for the nightlife ones. 


A few weeks later I get an email from the VP of nightlife saying that his laptop crashed.  I go through some general diagnostics with him and eventually I tell him to bring it in and I would back up his hard drive and re-image it.  


Then the following dialogue takes place:


Me:  “The reimaging process takes about three hours and seeing as it's already pretty late in the day, the soonest I could get it back to you is tomorrow morning.”


VP:  “That is unacceptable. There is an event tonight at [insert nightclub name here] and I need a laptop tonight.  What about one of those?” He points to the bin on my desk labeled, “loaner laptops.” 


Me:  “Well unfortunately those laptops are reserved for other departments and there are no spare laptops allocated for the nightlife department.”


He then starts cursing at me and telling me that I need to a better job of fairly allocating technology.  I kindly remind him that I tried to order five spare laptops for his department earlier that month and he was the one who denied the purchase order.  He starts yelling again saying that he's a VP and he should be able to just borrow one of the corporate laptops for the night.  I explain to him that I can't just give out laptops to people in one department if they came out of another department's budget and that I could potentially lose my job by doing so. 


He storms out of the IT office and slams the door behind him. The next morning, the PO for the laptops is signed on my desk. 


**TLDR:**  VP of department is too cheap to buy laptops and then yells at me for not having spare laptops. ",Why don't we have any laptops???,612

**IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT PAST, PERHAPS LAST THURSDAY, AD...**

- - - - -

Scene in - a blissful Thursday afternoon, with me in my corner office, the boss out of the office thanks to his kid being newly born, the juices from the Keurig flowing... yes, truly a day worth of Elysium. However, an urgent call to the project manager changed all that, and he came storming into my office as though he were possessed.

""Jack,"" he began, in his Nigerian accent, ""I need you to go to $CLIENT_NAME.""

""Pray tell, why?"" I muttered, quietly sipping at my coffee and playing Sins of a Solar Empire. ""You are aware $BOSS_NAME ordered me not to leave the office if I could avoid it, and you're to send bitch-boy, yes?""

""I know. You're the only one who deals with shit like this, though,"" he said, continuing on through a blissful haze of unawareness.

""What did they do?"" I said quietly, picking up the Aperture Science mug on my desk. ""I will not appreciate driving out to bumfuck nowhere for them because they decided to fuck around, or the cosmic shitstain they call a director of IT fucked up again."" I raised my voice. ""I do not suffer fools lightly, Isaac!""

He obviously didn't get it, and informed me of the situation, though delicately, no doubt to avoid offending my sensibilities (ha).

The firm had a suite of in-house coders, and all but the lead developer had quit en masse over the week. The lead developer had turned in his immediate resignation this afternoon, but the stupid bastard thought he had locked his machine beyond what we could do to get into it. On top of that, they'd all taken their code and started a rival firm, one specifically dedicated to doing what the original firm did, but they hadn't made the modifications to their contracts that I had, and the lawyers were soon to get involved.

I sighed and packed up my kit, then drove through the beautiful Austin hillsides to reach the firm in question. The last remaining developer was there in his office with the incompetent head of IT looking on frantically, and a huge shit-eating grin was on his face.

The head of IT pointed me towards the developer's two machines, and with a slight smirk, I powered them on, noticing the huge grin on the dev's face.

""Oh, a BIOS password. Well. It's not as if I haven't seen these since I was in high school."" I ripped the jumpers off the machines' motherboards, resetting the BIOS passwords. The developer's face fell a little, going from total elation to mostly lolwut.jpg, and I booted to TuxPE off my USB key (shameless plug, since I wrote the damn thing) and removed the local admin password via NTPWEdit.

After a quick reboot, followed with a login session as local admin, I added the Domain Admins group back to local admins (aww, it was cute, he thought he could beat me), then rebooted the machine and started a disk image.

I turned to the lead developer, whose face had suddenly developed a thousand-yard stare, and smirked. ""And that, my good man, is why you don't bet against a Bastard Operator."" I made special care to emphasize the capitals, and his jaw dropped when he heard the term. ""Chuck, care to escort him out and call the lawyers?""

The portly head of IT used his considerable bulk to escort the lead developer out, and with a grin, I RDP'd to the domain controller (I built it into TuxPE) and reset the lead developer's password, then shamelessly looted a few shots of the high-end whisky (Glenfiddich) I knew that the head of IT kept in his desk drawer.

A short drive later, I was back at my desk, and able to tell the story to my coworkers, to their infinite amusement.

The first was on my second day in training. Customer didn't like the update to our shitty inferior email service (no one does), but of course it's my second day in training so it's all my fault and **I** need to realize that my terrible email service has competitors. She took down my id number, chewed me out, wanted to talk to a supervisor to complain about me because obviously I was doing a shitty job not fixing an update to a service I have no control over and minimal training on. She then proceeded to chew out the supervisor and take her number down too. It's not awesome to be sitting there with the rest of your training group looking at you while a supervisor has to finish your call. :C

The next call was the same day actually. Drunk, possibly mentally ill woman calls in wanting to fix her internet connection. She immediately starts crying about her son dying. I do my best to be kind and empathetic while still attempting to troubleshoot her modem. She sucks at it and is extremely drunk, is marked in notes as an abusive customer. The troubleshooting doesn't get very far before she starts swearing and screaming at her computer (and into the phone, so my ear rings for hours). Then she rambles on for a while as I slowly get up the nerve to piss her off just enough to get her to hang up the phone. Finally she mentions wanting compensation and I latch onto that and tell her we can't do that (correctly). Another few ear shattering screams and choice names before she slams down the phone.

And the last one was from today. All good calls right up until the last fifteen minutes of course, I get a lady who doesn't know her email address from her old dial-up account, and rather than listen to me she's just going to keep re-entering variations of incorrect addresses. Finally she listens just long enough to log in to facebook and then she complains that her facebook games keep crashing and she wants a tech sent out to fix it. I try to explain to her that her ISP is not responsible for updating her flash player and she loses it. Obviously facebook is the internet and we're supposed to fix everything on the internet.  I'm not a confrontational person but her whole attitude the entire call has been slowly pissing me off. I just want to get her off the phone at that point since I can't help her anyway and we're wasting each other's time. I tell her if the tech has to come without doing any troubleshooting of her modem there may be a charge (which is pretty much the case). She gives me an earful and hangs up.

Now Read On...  

----

So we had this Netware network running Windows 3.11 and Win95 workstations over BNC-connected Token Ring, and like all government systems it was a bit behind the times and not terribly well planned. One of its problems was that due to the significantly pre-registry age of the workstations, they stored most of the user and application configuration in INI files, and the logon and logoff processes including the copying of these files down to the workstation on logon and back up to the user home drive on logoff.  

The problem arose because, as in so many other environments, whoever wrote this process didn't stop to think about the issues which could arise from thousands of users who used different workstations from day to day. Yep, that's right, there was nothing in the INI-copying function which first removed existing INI files from the destination. (Partially valid as there were half a dozen ones vital for the running of the workstation, but even so.)  

The result? User A would log on to a PC. Their INI files would download to that PC. They'd log off, and their INI files would remain on that PC as well as being copied to their home drive. User B would log onto the PC. Their INI files would download. They'd log off, and their INI files *plus those of user A* would copy back up to their home drive. User B would then log on to another workstation, where both sets of INI files would copy down to the workstation, and when they logged off, they might pick up INI files from users C, D, and E who'd been using it before - not to mention that the workstation now had INI files from C, D, E, B, and A on it, and would be passing those on to users F, G, and H in the following week.  

So while a new user to the department might have ten or so INI files which belonged to them, as soon as they logged onto a workstation, they would pick up another eight hundred or so. Some workstations had as many as two thousand INI files on them, mostly because staff tended to install (against the AUP) lots of little shareware games which used them. Logging on and off now took thirty minutes or more as the machine tried to copy thousands of these things over the ageing network, particularly during as almost everyone in the multiple buildings had the same schedule and so arrived and left work at the same time.
   
  
On top of this, there were problems where the few actual valid INI files would build up enormous amounts of junk in their subsections because some of the logon processes would merge the user settings into the existing workstation copy of the file. And on top of *that*, all it took was for one copy of an INI file to have the read-only flag set, and it would not be overwritten, but instead would copy up to a user's home drive on logoff. If a user logged on to a PC with one or more of these, and the wrong interface settings came up, their first instinct was usually to log off and log back on, and then try another PC - meaning that the read-only INI files were now not only on the original PC, but on the user's home drive and the second PC, too. These 'vampire' files were ridiculously difficult to kill, as they could be exterminated again and again by the Helpdesk but would keep popping up as long as there was a single copy anywhere on the network. It didn't help that the executives tended to fly around the country a lot and log onto random PCs in our other city offices, meaning that any exec who came back from a visit was almost guaranteed to have a bunch of these vampires sitting in their home drive, starting the whole process all over again.  

Something had to be done. However, as my previous scripting experience had largely been limited to batch files, I needed something a little stronger.  

I sat down with a copy of *Perl for Dummies* and wrote a script called Buffy.  
   
  
I built Buffy to kill vampires. It was designed to patrol the network servers at night, whereupon it would scan through all user home drives, wipe out the unnecessary INI files, pull the guts out of the necessary ones and rewrite them, remove the read-only attribute from whatever was left, and generally act as guardian of user settings, preventer of the spread of vampirism on the network, and all-around watchdog.  

It was three-quarters documentation and comments, in excruciating detail. It logged every single thing it did. It took backups, verified the backups, checked that any changes it made conformed to correctness, restored from backups if something had gone wrong, and was generally hyper-conservative in its work. I tested it on some test accounts, using horrible messes of INI files copied from live users, and it worked perfectly. All it needed was access to the servers, which I (being a low-level peon) did not have. This is *why* I had written all the documentation and use notes, so that I could give it to the (effectively) Level 3 server team for implementation.  

I had written Buffy in spare moments gleaned from the unrelenting waterfall of incoming tickets, during lunch breaks and government tea breaks, and otherwise largely in my head while working on other items. I would arrive early and pore over Perl syntax, stay back late and run regexes. It was my very first Perl script of any length, and a labor of love. I worked on it for weeks, polished it until it shone, and then went cap-in-hand to the Level 3 team.  

""Guys,"" I said, ""I know we're having a problem with network response in the morning and evening, and with INI files being read-only and copying themselves around the network. I know it's causing problems with service levels and the ability of staff to do their jobs. I have here a script, with full and complete documentation, which I think might be able to help. Would you have a look at it?""

trashdigger,94,171,stqz8,517,"I work in IT supporting a corporate environment. I'll never forget this one moment I had, getting on two years ago now...

It was one of those simple days, one of those days where you're able to really help people because there aren't hundreds of people lining up to beg for help. That's when someone, a woman probably in her late 40s, phoned up and cried down the phone at me, exclaiming that the **DEVIL HIMSELF** had appeared in her shared folders. I was skeptical to say the least. Not quite one for imagining the devil raising from his throne to cause some havoc in a little shared drive... but more that the devil himself was real.

At first I just guessed that her assumption that **LORD SATAN** had infiltrated her folders on the network was her way of describing that she had lost some files, perhaps they had moved around or deleted themselves through *scary* voodoo magic. Her description, however, was fairly vivid. She had entered her shared folder looking for a certain file, and could only describe her *terror* as she found **EL DIABLOS** staring back at her, right there.

Naturally; she immediately closed the folder (to protect everyone, obviously) and phoned IT, and not her priest, to report the infiltration of the lord of the underworld.

I have to point out here that I'm not really joking when I say this woman was fairly hysterical. This was not a person who phoned up and jokingly said ""lol the devil's here guys"" but actually displayed the signs of fear, save for urinating upon oneself. After the moments of confusion finally subsidided, I decided the only course of action was to connect to the PC and see for myself what exactly was going on.

I asked her to guide me to where this folder was, and although she was reluctant... well...

hoinurd,84,100,1ehjtr,511,"This happened a few years back....

I work for a small manufacturing company with limited IT resources.  We had, at the time, an in-house Exchange 2003 server with about 100 mailboxes.  

Well, eventually the size of the store was getting too big, we were running out of hard drive space.  So my bright idea was to move the Exchange store to a temporary external drive (after a couple good tape backups of course), shove bigger hard drives in the server, then move it back.

So, Saturday morning, I hooked up an external drive, and started the move process within Exchange....

I don't know how many of you have ever tried something like this, but once you start moving the store, there is no cancel option.  So it starts moving.  And immediately I see a BIG problem.  And then two seconds after that I realize what the problem is.  And then one second after that, my life flashes before my eyes.

This old server, an HP DL380 (G2 or G3 series, can't remember) has USB 1.0 ports.  It's moving data to the external at an incredibly slow rate.  And like I said, there's no cancel, so I have to let it go.

I started that process mid-morning Saturday and it didn't finish moving the store completely until 7pm Sunday!  

At this point I'm screwed, I can't start moving it back or people will be without email for two business days.

My only choice was to run the Exchange store on an external USB drive for an entire week!  It worked, there were a few glitches along the way.  I had to restart the store several times due to I/O errors, but it made it through the week.

In the interim, I purchased a USB 2.0 add-in card for that POS server.  Finally when the weekend rolled around, I installed the USB 2.0 card, and moved the store back to the internal RAID drives.  It took 20 minutes to move it back!

Pretty scary deal, running a 100 gig Exchange store on an external USB drive for a week.

Melanie1001,130,146,u1fku,510,"I know it took me a while, but here's my 2nd sexism in the tech world story.  This takes place just a few months after beginning work at my current workplace.  So a bit over 11 years ago.  By this time I was over 5 years strong as a technician, but of course still learning.  

I received a trouble ticket for a faculty member, his computer was in an endless cycle of rebooting.  Never good, figured something was bad off there.  So I go look at the desktop - sure enough, it's pretty hosed, won't boot no matter what I do.  So I take it back to the workroom, back up his data, reimage and restore, setting it back up for him. Everything was working, and when I leave he is happy and I am feeling good that I helped him out and got it back to him quickly.

And then one day later I was substituting on the helpdesk for someone who was out sick.  Mr. faculty member calls back, saying his computer is just not working and hasn't been since it was worked on, and he was just incredibly unhappy with the shoddy work of the tech.  Which of course I found confusing since when I walked out, all was happy for the both of us.  Through this bit of conversation with him, it was painfully obvious he had no clue I was the tech he was lambasting.  But I tried to be professional - no reason to get up in arms, perhaps I can fix it.  And to not let on that I was the technician he had been complaining about, I was going to pretend to transfer him to my line and change my voice a bit.  OK maybe a tad silly, but I was just trying to keep all parties happy here...and this is the conversation that ensued

**Me**:  May I transfer you to the technician that worked on your computer?  She will be the most...

**Him**:  *cuts me off*  no I don't want to talk to her, she didn't know what she was doing

**Me**:  *feeling a bit offended but still trying to be a professional*  Ok, then can I input a new trouble ticket for you?

**Him**:  No. 

**Me**:  OK, then what would you like me to do?

**Him**:  I want to talk to a technician, just not her.  I want to talk to a REAL technician.

**Me**:  *at this point...yes I'm boiling, I tried to be a professional but I know my tone was not as friendly here*  Well then who do you want to talk to?

**Him**:  Who is there?

**Me**:  *looks around naming off people, and as soon as I mention the first male name*

**Him**:  Yes, him, I want to talk to him.

**Me**:  *grumbling* of course...

And I transfer.  And went ballistic after the tech was done talking to him.  Found out that wasn't the first time that faculty member had pulled that stunt.  I felt better, at least somewhat, knowing I was not alone with that slap in the face.  

Oh and his problem?  Non-functioning computer?  Nope.  One program had a particular setting he liked, and it had not been set up that way.   Program still worked - just not how he liked it.

I am still at the same place after 12 years, as is this faculty member.  And of course he still has trouble tickets.  Want to guess who has a bare minimum of a week wait when he has problems?  ",I want a REAL tech,656
xlThalionlx,204,171,t081b,512,"Ah yes, I'm back with yet another strange and bizarre tale from my career in tech support. Today I will move forward in my career a couple years when I began doing tier 2 support for a major University that shall remain unnamed. Yes, my time with this University brought forth some of my most famous moments in tech support, so without further delay lets jump right in!

Tier 2 support at this University mean that I dealt with all sorts of special folk, students and faculty alike. On this particular evening I received a support call from a disgruntled Prof, and the conversation went something like this:

**Me:** Tech Support, this is herp derp

**Prof:** Yeah, uh, I need to recover some, uh, files 

*Judging from his voice and feebleness, he was at least 70*

**Me:** OK, were these files located locally or on an external device?

**Prof** They are in my house. 

**Me:** ..*sigh*.. Are the files on your computer or are they on a disc or portable USB drive?

**Prof:** Well, they should be on my computer here. 

**Me:** Well here is what we are going to do to make things easier, Im going to open a remote support session with you so I can access your computer and try to see if I can locate what you are missing. Im going to email you a link and you just need to click on it. 

**Prof:** So you will have access to my machine and see whats on it? 

**Me:** Yes.

**Prof:** Oh, Um, OK then...

*So after about an hour of trying to get him to get to his email, click the link and install the extension, I get access* 

*I am greeted by dozens of saved JPEG icons on his desktop. This is gonna be fun.*

**Me:** What type of files are we looking for?

**Prof:** Urm, Videos. 

**Me:** OK, lets browse to some of your default folders and you tell me if you see them. 

*I browse to the default video folder and nothing is in there at all..and I assumed there wouldn't be, as I assumed this guy didn't know how to move them, so to the downloads folder we go!* 

*Upon opening the downloads folder, I am greeted with many, many thumbnails of nekkedness.*  

**Prof:** Oh I think they be in here..

*no shame in his voice at all*

**Me:** Well, Ill leave it to you to browse through these files and locate what you need, just give us a call back if you need anything else, OK?

*At this point, different helpdesk employees are gathered around me enjoying the hilarity of the situation I'm stuck in*

**Prof:** could you move my videos for me so I could find find them easier?

*By now, the pervy Prof is now on speaker phone for all to enjoy and Im being cheered on to move the videos*

**Me:** OK, I will move them in a folder on your desktop

*cheers erupt from around me*

*Scrolling through his bag of goodies, I come upon a few videos that appear to be home videos by the thumb nails...*

*nope. nope. nope. nope. nope. nope* 

**Prof:** Oh yes, please move those as well

*At this point, the crowd around me clamoring for me to indulge the old perv, so I oblige. However, I get a sudden mouse seizure and instead of clicking cut, I click play. What comes up in the lovely Windows Media player can only be described as a nekked old dude spread eagle on the floor and a dog nearby.*

**Me:** BLAAAH OK, soo...lets close this here...um....OK, so.....

*Frantically hitting F4*

**Prof:** Whats the matter young man, haven't you ever seen  a nude man?

**Me:** Excuse me? 

**Prof:** Are you not comfortable with nudity?

**Me:** I don't think this is appropriate sir, so I think at this point....

**Prof:** Seriously, its just animal porn.



*At this point, the entire helpdesk team is on the floor dying laughing and I am completely astonished as to what is happening. I end the support session and wish captain happy pants well on his way. Little does pervy prof know, it was University policy that all support sessions are recorded and documented. I still own a copy of this phone call to this day* 

Alas that brings me to the end of yet another tale of tech support debauchery! If these tales are still continuing to keep all of my new found fans entertained, I will continue to share them!

Some years back we got a call from a site owner yelling and ranting about how he wasn't going to stand for our extortion, he was going to report us to the authorities and demanding that we take down our 'blackmail page' from his website immediately!

Naturally we were somewhat surprised by this and asked him what the hell he was going on about.

*You've f....ing changed my site so no one can get to it unless they buy your f...ing [Company Name] cookies!!*



He'd apparently stumbled across an article about web security and in a state of terror upped the security settings on his antiquated copy of Internet Explorer to the maximum. This resulted in a ""This site requires cookies"" page displaying when he visited his site, which he somehow interpreted as a demand that he phone us up and order a packet of baked goods before we'd let him continue through to the homepage.

We (somehow) managed to maintain straight faces while explaining what was going on. He grudgingly accepted the explanation but in no uncertain terms expressed his displeasure that the IT industry could use such 'confusing' language.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, fellow TFTS patrons, matrons, and gender-neutral-trons! 88 here with another tale of that most blessed of lists, the Black List. For those not in the know, one of my previous positions had this idea implemented. At this time, my boss was an awesome guy, and he'd listened to my idea of The Black List, had me get the numbers together, and pitched it successfully to the C_O level. The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever. This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us (with proof) that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication.

We last ran into Heavylegs when she was removed from the list two months prior to this incident. It had been an interesting two months. Her relationship with LesbianTech had devolved into some very catty attitudes both at work and away from work. LT and I had become friends, and I got to hear all of the details, whether or not I wanted them. This culminated in their breakup roughly a week before this incident, and LT took some time off to get her life in order. Amazingly, she'd grown a backbone, but she'd also developed a distaste for IT, and took a vacation to see where her head was at.

One more bit of information, as it was necessary. I had also befriended Heavylegs. She and I managed to forge a friendship over a mutual practice of the martial arts. Roughly a week after her inclusion on the list, we started meeting up for sparring sessions every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. These were great for getting the stresses of life out of our minds and some frustration out of our bodies. I had no idea what this would lead to in the future, but for the first two months, it was purely friendship. I used this time to encourage her to work towards the communication goal of the Black List removal process, and she started to come around over that two month period.

On to the story. Heavylegs worked in a part of our company that was well-known to be something of a meat grinder: grueling work, tons of overtime necessary to keep up, and people washed out quickly. Heavylegs actually enjoyed the work, and the challenge, and she would often rise to the top of the Employee of the Month lists, only for her conduct to knock her out of contention. As she worked to change her attitude, however, she finally gained the coveted parking spot and gift card to Large Bird grocery store.

This absolutely infuriated The Mistake. 

The Mistake is so named because she delighted in telling each and every person who spent more than five minutes with her that she was precisely that: a mistake. Her parents hadn't meant to have her, she said. The abortion had failed, she said. Whatever. I made sure my techs stayed far away from her, and dealt with her myself. The L1 guys had far too much to deal with already; they didn't need this particular ball of crazy mucking it up for them.

The Mistake had heard about Heavylegs and her Black Listing, and thought it was a perfect reason for her to be disqualified from ever holding the title of Employee of the Month for their department. We didn't care; HR specifically excluded the Black List and its participants from any sort of harassment, meaning someone could be Employee of the Year if they wanted, regardless of whether or not we had them on the List. The Mistake didn't care for that, and campaigned for justice in the easiest and most noble way that anyone ever coul...

...nope. Can't even finish that with a straight face. She was passive-aggressive to the extreme. To anyone.

Well, as this incident rolls around, she'd been collecting ""signatures"" for people who believed that IT's Black List was enough of a reason not to be EotM. It may have had a few signatures, I don't care. What did bother me was that her submitted ticket metrics quadrupled during the month that she was going to war. These weren't all completely stupid tickets, but neither were they things that I would suspect were happening by coincidence: 

1. We replaced the batteries in her wireless keyboard and mouse no less than five times during the course of one month. The batteries we had lasted far longer than that, were rechargeable, and were tested before being deployed. 
2. Her monitor cables ""suddenly"" stopped working three times. When I tracked this, I noticed that the nonfunctional cables were actually damaged, and were likely damaged intentionally by someone pulling a pin out of place in the connector. 
3. The computer would randomly shut off, restarting and needing to run CHKDSK. Upon inspection, the power cord looked like it had been manipulated away from the wall plug in such a manner as to bend it. This was replaced twice. 

That's ten tickets per month, not including tickets for email being ""lost"" and other stupid things on our proprietary system. Maybe a bit excessive, but I like to be absolutely certain, so I rocked on down to the L1 room, ordered some Chinese for everybody, and went desk to desk. ""Tell me about The Mistake, and your interactions with her."" I would say, and they would respond. Oh, did they ever respond.

The Mistake was a needler. She would constantly belittle the techs when they were on the phone with her, or in person, with dozens of little phrases. My favorite was actually ""Why do they pay you people to do this when a nutless monkey could do it!?"" when it came to installing batteries. One of my L1s had a healthy and robust fear of the woman, because she apparently found him attractive enough to flirt with. He described her as ""a Glaad bag filled with oatmeal and beaten with sticks"" and ""having fallen from the same ugly tree as Honey Boo Boo's entire family"". Both techs would be forced to spend 25-30 minutes for the simplest of tasks because The Mistake would block the way out of her cube until her inane questions or disgusting flirtations were answered.

Chinese food was had, drinks were promised, and I told them to pass me her next ticket. They did so, eagerly, not one hour after our lunch. Another battery ""failure"". I'd instructed the techs to check the batteries when they went down, but they'd eventually just replaced them in the vain hopes of getting out quickly. I picked up a pair of dead batteries that had yet to be recharged and headed on down to her desk. As I approached, The Mistake was standing at the entrance to her cube and waiting. She deflated a bit when she saw it wasn't her Tech In Shining Armor, but that didn't stop me.

**88**: Our Hero, Kamen Rider IT. 

**TM**: The Mistake. Like The Voice, but without Christina Aguilera. Or talent. Or devoted fans.

**88**: Morning, Mistake. I hear your batteries are dead in your mouse again.

**TM**: You people should just replace the fucking thing.

**88**: Knock off the swearing or I'll give you a wired mouse.

*I enter the cube, while The Mistake grabs a sheet of paper and blocks me in. I mime the act of replacing the batteries, instead just reseating them. This takes about fifteen seconds, due to wanting to give the right impression.*

**TM**: You need to sign my petition! It's to stop people from being awarded gifts by the company if they're on your list!

**88**: I don't need to do anything. Our list is excluded from that sort of consideration. It's our list, not the company's list.

**TM**: What do you mean?

**88**: We made sure HR knew what our plans were with this list, and it isn't considered part of the company's strike policy.

**TM**: So?

**88**: So your plan isn't going to work. People can still be Employee of the Month. They're on our list because of how they treat us and our policies.

**TM**: I don't care, sign this! It'd be the first useful thing you do all day!

*I've now finished.*

**88**: It's that sort of attitude that led us to establish the list. By the way, your mouse is working again. If you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my desk and work on other issues.

**TM**: You aren't leaving until you sign this.

Full stop. My voice has been calm and collected this entire time. The Mistake is starting to get louder and higher-pitched. This is attracting the notice of a few people in the area... including Heavylegs, who is laughing her ass off after the last statement.

**88**: I'm not in the mood for this today, Mistake. You need to move out of my way. 

**TM**: I'm not going to give this up, asshole. I shouldn't even be alive right now, and I've overcome worse adversity than you!

**88**: You have ten seconds to get out of my way.

At this point, Heavylegs is nearly falling out of her chair. Other workers are grinning, because my size and bulk - six foot five, 300+ pounds - are going to be carrying me right through this five foot two, 200 pound woman if I so choose. You can't call me a Gentle Giant without saying Giant. Someone, though, has also done me another solid: I see HR Girl out of the corner of my eye, watching and taking notes. Later on, I find out it was Heavylegs. 

**TM**: You think you can knock me down? Just try it. I'll sue your dumb ass for sexual harassment and damages!

Fine, bitch. Black List time. I'm agile for my size, and so I take a step back and put my hands on her chair. I notice The Mistake is trying to root herself to the ground, still clutching that stupid petition, so I place the chair directly next to her, on my side of her cubicle ""door""... which was waist height.

**88**: Last chance, Mistake.

**TM**: Try me, asshole.

Can't say I didn't warn her. With one leg posed on her chair seat, I vault her cubicle's ""door"" wall piece, thanking the gods that it was tightly screwed into the floor, as well as thanking the building planners for high ceilings. I land with what I can only describe as a badass-in-my-head pose: how the Terminators would appear after coming through time: one knee, knelt, fists on the ground. I stand, brush my shoulders off, and start back to my desk, giving Heavylegs a wink.

I took this one on my own to my badass boss, and we sat down and discussed it. I made mention of The Mistake's campaign against Heavylegs, and I also reminded him about Heavylegs's relationship with LT, who had just left for vacation. I finally mentioned that Heavylegs and I were sparring partners three or more times per week, and mentioned that I was concerned that bringing down the hammer could be perceived as playing favorites. I then outline the incident that has just occurred, and mention that HR Girl was present for the conclusion. He calls her in, she verifies, and we hatch the plan.

For once, I got to dispatch my boss, instead of the other way around. I made sure to be nearby in order to hear all of the fun.

**Boss**: The Mistake, with the authorization of (Director of IT), and backed by (Director of Operations) as well as supported by (HR Director), I am notifying you that you are now on the IT Black List. This means that you will not be permitted to submit helpdesk emails, you will not be allowed to delay any updates, and you will not be responded to in any form regarding an IT-related incident. Any attempts to flag down an L1 or L2 technician will be ignored, and any attempts to corner an L1 or L2 technician will be noted by HR. HR Girl is here to discuss your attempts at harassment of my L2 technician earlier today.

Alpha Counter delivered. Mistake immediately begins sputtering a defense, and my boss starts to walk away as HR Girl deftly steps between them to discuss the HR part of the deal. I meet the boss back in his office, hand him my collected data, and that familiar black folder comes out. One high-five later and I'm delivering the good news to the L1s. 

There was actual cheering.

SepDot,178,163,1a2qrp,515,"Preface: I sold my grandparents my old computer around four or five years ago, as I had just upgraded to a new rig. This of course, meant that I was now their personal tech support. They would call me every now and then with the typical stuff, but for the most part they were pretty good with it. When ever I do anything on their computer, they will sit beside me, and usually write down everything I tell them. This was great as I really only needed to show them things once.


Fast forward to the middle of last year and the thing finally gets to the point where it can't handle what they want to do with it (Photoshop etc). As I worked for a large chain computer store at the time, I sold them a moderately powered all in one desktop and all the little extras they needed. And me being the tech support, I was tasked with setting it up and moving all their stuff across.


I've already set up the new computer and we are getting into what photos, documents, music etc they wanted to keep from the old one - the first stop was My Documents. Now, this was Windows XP, and of course they had the folders set quite large with thumbnail previews. To be honest I don't know why I didn't just grab the whole folder, but I drop into My Docs and scan the folders to check what was worth moving, and that's when I see it.

***

The store was still doing well with selling Chinese knockoff items, but the sales were declining each week. Obviously it was because people started to notice that with these devices you get what you pay for. Ron and Don however didn’t think so, it was all about service and the distance between us and the customer.

The atmosphere in the store was still bad 2 months after the store outing and mainly the tension between Jeremy and Don and Ron was at an all time high. Jeremy who could be so indifferent at times now had strong opinions whenever it concerned me.

He did not really like the store all that much anymore. He had never really had to much of a problem with it, but started dreading going more and more every day. He wasn’t unhappy in his life or developed any desire to get a degree higher than college dropout. He just felt like leaving.

I had seen Ron and Don during the week interviewing a lot of new people, subjecting them to the same assignments I had gotten when I first came here. I saw a few people I recognised from school and was a bit surprised about it since all of them knew my stories about working here.

It took another full two weeks before we had another team meeting. I was getting sick of these things. Aside from the usual folks we now had two new people: Marcel and Johan.  

“These are our two new employees to make sure that the store is staffed while you guys are out on the road,” we were told.

“Excuse me?” was the first thing Jeremy shouted. “What is this about!?”

“Well, we are going to offer service at home for our customers.” We all paused.

“So this will mean that most of the time Jeremy, Frank and Richard will be on the road with our new staff joining in as the new daytime store employees. We already have a few reservations for our service for tomorrow, so you’d better be on time”.

They quickly ended the meeting and said goodbye as if we weren’t allowed to even say anything about it. I now had Marcel and Johan looking at me. I grabbed Jeremy’s hand and left quickly; I was not going to deal with them too.

* * *

When Jeremy went to the store the next morning he had gotten a bike from Ron with the stores logo printed on the crate in front of it. “It’s healthy for you, and good for the environment!” Ron said rather cheerily, “and you have an appointment in 10 minutes, so you better hurry.” He put a list of all the addresses in his hand and closed the store door.

Jeremy didn’t like going to other people’s houses to fix their problems. He was happy fixing their computers, but not dealing with the people standing behind him, yakking on about them. He tended to get all kinds of questions as to whether he could look at their TV and vacuum cleaners as well, as they are all electronics anyway.

Pricing for the service was premium to say the least. Easily 2 times more expensive than bringing the computer to the store. However, many customers didn’t know this and lost their calm quickly after Jeremy told them the price. He really did not feel comfortable doing this.

* * *

Meanwhile, I had to work with Johan and Marcel on a Saturday shift so as “learn them the ropes,” as Don called it. Hopefully it would not end like it did with Alex. I quickly learned that Johan and Marcel were in their thirties and had worked in a couple of other computer stores, but their resumes were rather empty when asked about them. Work experiences were few and far between, it seemed to me. It wasn’t too hard to figure out why this was; they were hard to get along with. 

Johan and Marcel tended to know it all better. They weren’t stupid, but smart was another story and social even more so. They found themselves to be managers because of their age and infinite wisdom about computers. I can understand why they were hired: Ron and Don saw their younger selves in them.

My shift with them was rather strange. I knew just about everything about the store: how to work the systems, how to best stock the store, how to make best use of the space and most importantly how to deal with the customers. But somehow they knew it better then me and were glad to show me my mistakes.

A customer came into the store while I was explaining to them how the register worked. It was a customer I knew, and actually really really liked. He looked like James Randy and loved old computers — the older the better. He didn’t come here because he liked the store that much, but because we often had old stuff lying around that I sold him on the cheap. 

He had invited me once to his house to see his collection of computers and it was simply amazing. He had been working in computers all his life and had designed circuit boards for many systems throughout the years. He had taken the time to explain to me how the systems worked and how complex they could be. If I had to give my reasons as to why I am a hardware designer these days he would be on the list. 

When he saw me in the store, he walked up to me to say hi. He didn’t, however, get the chance, as Johan and Marcel were fighting each other as to who was going to help this old man find a new computer. He was overwhelmed at first by the insistence and aggressiveness of them both, but quickly recovered.

“I only want to be helped by Leila as she has helped me countless times before. Please go do something else instead of harassing me,” he said calmly, pushing both of them aside. He walked up to me and asked for the old Pentium processors I had called him about. Meanwhile Marcel and Johan gave me an evil look while I walked away to get the processors.

After that shift I started working less at the store, doing only Saturdays and some weekdays at night. I did not want to work with them. Working with Richard, Frank and Jeremy could be tiring at times but at least it was fun and we didn’t make each other feel like shit.

* * *

Meanwhile Richard and Frank were having the time of their lives going to their customers together. They had convinced Ron to let them handle all the appointments and scheduled them to their benefits, often going together to the same customer.

You could tell they had even more fun browsing around people’s computers and finding out what dark parts of the internet they visited when they were actually with the persons in their house. Getting free drinks and food from the people wasn’t too bad either.

Jeremy, however, was finding it harder and harder to go to work every day. It wasn’t something for him. He really did not like it. It was about 5 weeks in when he came across the prototype of a bad customer.

The customer had the vague problem that his computer didn’t work. He never gave any specifics about it, so Jeremy went in without any idea. The computer was old and fragile. It looked like the computer was a victim of domestic violence, or at least was dropped a couple of times from the concrete stairs of the flat it was residing in. The keyboard and mouse weren’t in any better condition, and the screen had what looked like a couple of bruises. 

Jeremy tried to talk with the customer as to what was wrong with the computer, but no matter what question he asked, the computer was always just “not working.” Giving up, Jeremy went to work and tried to start the computer. It didn’t work. When he checked the cabling he found that the power cable had been completely torn apart. He replaced the cable and tried again. The computer turned on.

Hearing the startup chime from Windows, the man rejoiced and quickly pushed a huge list of poorly described problems into Jeremy’s hands saying he should fix those problems as well. Somewhere around an hour into this process the customer started becoming angry and started shouting at Jeremy calling him a slow and worthless. He also wasn’t going to pay anymore “because he was taking so long on purpose just to rip him off.”

When Jeremy tried to calm the man down, he started throwing books and other stuff at him. Jeremy stood up and left. He didn’t care about the money, or his job or anything. He just wanted to get out of that house and to quit his job if they were going to keep making him do house calls.

If it wasn’t for Richard and Frank, he would have. Richard and Frank had secretly started their own business in a business. They kept two agendas: one from the store, and their own one. Reservations would be distributed around a 60:40 ratio on the agendas. Easy cash, and no-one was the wiser.

The scheme had been working brilliantly for some weeks and Ron and Don did not know anything about it. That was until they got greedy. They had been called by a old couple that had trouble with their TV’s set-top box. Given they could earn a quick buck and the problem would not be difficult to fix, they took down the job details in their second agenda.

When they were at the old couple's home, they found the issue quickly. The set-top box just needed to be restarted and the only way to this was by taking out the power connector and putting it back in. It worked again. To keep suspicion to a minimum they fiddled around with the setting and doing some other non relevant stuff for another 20 minutes and declared it fixed.

They charged 75 euros. The couple paid. Two weeks later the couple had the same problem and they charged 75 euros again. It was now that the couple’s son found out about this and went ballistic in the store at Don. 

Don didn’t know anything about it and called Frank and Richard. They tried to keep the situation under control but the sixth sense of Don must have picked up on the missing money. They were forced to show their secret agenda and it was now Ron who went ballistic.

Frank and Richard were fired, right there and then. It was mostly about the money that never reached Don and Rons pockets, but also damage control to keep the rightfully outraged customer happy. But it was too late. The damage was already done.

I asked her to follow the cords and she said, ""Well they aren't plugged in at all.""

DeafeningFish,103,141,yr7ap,508,"About 5 years ago I was working for a very small ticketing agency in Toronto. They were a third party merchant for numerous small attractions in the city, and all ticketing was done via their website. I was working doing basic tech support, mostly helping older people print tickets and navigate the site.

Despite most of our business being local, we did have a few out of town clients. One in particular was a fairly large amusement park operating on the west coast. One day, around noon, I recieved a frantic call from an employee at said park; lets call him Ted. The call went something like this:

DeafFish: Hi, how can I help you?

Ted: The park just opened, and the ticket scanner isn't working! This needs to be fixed RIGHT NOW! People are waiting to get in!

DeafFish: When did this happen?

Ted: Just now! The first one went through fine, but now they won't scan.

DeafFish: Ok, let's see what we can do. Is there a red light coming from your scanner? (just checking if it's on, but if you ask directly they tend to be offended...)

Ted: Yes, of course! It's scanning, but the tickets aren't going through!

DeafFish: Alright, well it may be a problem with the POS software, can you try updating the program?

*5 minutes pass...*

Ted: I got an update, it's still not working. I've scanned **this** ticket like twenty times and it keeps coming back ""INVALID""

**And then it clicked.**

DeafFish: Can you try scanning a different ticket?

Ted: *a little taken aback* ... yeah, I guess so.

jana007,79,98,1pmwlq,512,"I've experienced the angry customer, the stupid customer, the ungrateful customer. I've helped my friends with computer problems, my parents, my distant relatives, and of course even my friends' friend of a friend of a friend. I have never been actually thanked or even rewarded when I do favors for others and I always try my hardest to do my best. 

I work user support at a university doing desktop support and some basic server maintenance. I get paid less than half of what my supervisor does and I do any task that could possibly be asked of me, even if it's out of my skill set. Make an MDT server? You got it. Create our website? You got it. Learn MySQL? No problem. I have not had a raise in 8 months I have worked here and my job description remains ""basic desktop support."" 

I was told I would be receiving a promotion soon, something away from desktop support, to a position that would allow benefits and vacation pay. I had to wait two weeks to speak with my boss, and by the time he had time to speak with me, he had already forgot, but he thanked me for my hard work and asked if I could look into creating more graphics for an additional project.

I was heartbroken, and the week just kept getting worse. More and more work, and less and less appreciation. I am the first one to work and the last one to leave.

I had helped an older user with a computer problem during my lunch break about two weeks ago. I couldn't tell if he was angry and mean or just overwhelmed by his technology. His laptop ended up having a bad mobo so I figured the least I could do was backup his information to some DVDs, it was only 8 gigs. I thought nothing of it.

Today I just set up 3 new hire computers, just to be told I needed to move them, not once, but twice, then of course there is the constant wave of user help requests, and then reminder e-mails of tickets I haven't had time to get to yet. I finally had enough time to sit down and have a breather when the older user came in my office and without smiling or making eye contact he handed me a card and said ""here, it's a thank you card."" Then awkwardly nodded his head at me and left.

mlwilliams,55,112,16m0jg,506,"So I work as remote support for a company that deals with server based gaming machines. My job involves attempting to resolve various issues remotely through VNC, if we can't fix it then a field engineer will attend and repair it on site, we're also responsible for assisting the engineers if need be. In this instance the engineer needed to replace the hard drive on the terminal which meant the network settings needed to be reconfigured. Usually it's very simple, the engineers just need to open the door, login using their credentials and insert the IP addresses in the network menu. In this case however the IP addresses kept resetting whenever he hit apply. So the engineer phones remote support asking for assistance, I pick up the phone.

**Engineer:** I've just replaced a hard drive on this terminal and whenever I try to save the IP addresses they reset, you're not able to connect to it are you?  
**Me:** (I try to ping the IP address) Nope, can't connect, we'll have to configure them through the control panel then, you'll need to plug in your keyboard and drop the terminal down to Windows.  

(I guide him through exiting the software, he's now on the Windows login screen)

**Me:** Ok. *Username*, *Password*.  
**Engineer:** There's something wrong, it's not working.  
**Me:** Of course it works, it's the same username and password on every disk. *(So I guide him through spelling the username and password, letter by letter)*  
**Engineer:** It's still not working.  

So I was on the phone with him for 20 minutes trying to explain that the username and password cannot be wrong and that all the terminals have the same master disk. I continue my attempt to try and guide him through the process of logging into windows. I'm getting to the point of telling him to replace the hard drive again.

Turns out he was entering both the username and password in the username field and leaving the password field blank.

sezzme,104,111,1gy4bx,504,"(EDIT: dang, this turned out longer than I expected.  My apologies. A TL;DR has been provided.)

-------------

This dates back from back in the days before Pagemaker gave way to Adobe InDesign.  

So there I was, younger version of me working away in a print shop when an order came in from the local cable company office.  They had some 11x14 pages that kinda looked like a spreadsheet, with text inside each box, cell, whatever the heck you call it.  This was a lot of text in very small type.

What they wanted seemed simple: change some various bits of text in certain cells and send it off for printing.  Copy a block of text from one column and replace the existing text in another column.  Seemed easy enough...

Not quite.  Whoever originally created this graphic file had decided that the best way to format the text was to type something in a cell, hit the spacebar several times to end up in the next cell, type that text, rinse and repeat.

This text was not in column format to start with. So when I tried to change or cut the text, whatever text was below that cell just went kablooey.  Yikes.

What we needed was to convert this word salad into pretty much one looooong column.  Then I could easily format it back into proper multiple columns in Pagemaker.

After pasting the text into whatever word processing program I had at the time, I started copying and pasting by hand to try to transform it into that long column, timing the work as I went.  I then did some math and realized that completing this job as/is would take about 8 hours.

I called my boss over to look at it and tell him the bad news.  After some discussion he was about to break the news to the client when I had a brainwave and told him to come back in a couple of hours.

I immediately called a fellow geek and said:  ""Email me a copy of Word Perfect 5.0 NOW.   I'll explain later.""

I used to create newsletters in Word Perfect 5.0 back in the day.  One thing I loved was the macros...  you could do some pretty neat, complicated things with WP5 macros.  You could take a bunch of spaces and turn them into a single semi-obscure character (such as a ^ symbol).   Then you could create another macro to notice the ^ and do something cool with it, such as copy whatever text was below it and paste it wherever you wanted.  

Too many years have gone by for me to remember the exact macro sequences I created to accomplish what happened next.  All I know was that I started by having it change the damn spaces to some obscure character, then used that obscure character as the beginning of a series of macros to have WP5 cut and paste each bit of text into one sweet long column which I could easily format properly in Pagemaker.   This included deleting the obscure character as it went from one bit of text to the next.  Total time:  45 minutes.

I showed the boss what I did.  It blew his mind.  He praised me in an employee meeting later that week.

Some experienced coder later told me:  ""Sezzme, you think like a programmer!  You were doing real programming right there!""  That compliment felt even better than the boss bragging on me. :)

TL;DR:  Desktop publishing environment.  Dragged Word Perfect 5.0 back from the dead to reformat a bunch of badly-formatted text into a sweet, convenient, clean column format, changing 8 hours of work into 45 minutes.   Took advantage of macro capability that only this ancient DOS version of WP had, as far as I knew.   Got compliments from the boss.  Some coder later told me I should be a programmer.

munky9001,115,165,yt3gl,508,"This is from my first ever IT job. I got a job for a small ISP as a linux and network admin. I found routing problems(not fix), I maintained the dns and mail services, and I did commercial intertube installs. Now something that is common is that ISPs provide a relay host for business' mail servers. The purpose largely is to keep your owned ip addresses clean from any lists. That way if 1 customer leaves and you give their IP to someone else there's going to be no problem of RBLs for the new customer. So naturally lots of businesses are doing this and just about every IT place would immediately blame the ISP mail servers.

Well back story is that there was this one customer who spent loads of money and was constantly spending more and more. They had 5 mlppp internet connections(used at most like 1 dsl connection) and other services we were selling and they were in line to buy our future products. They 'needed' basically none of it. The part however is that the IT person at this place was a 10 and she always got her way. She also had a very large budget but she didn't have the first clue about what to do in her job; however everyone bent over backwards for her because she was very flirty and hot.

So I get a call from her saying 'no emails are being sent out' and i check postqueue I see nothing stuck. I check mail.log and grep for their domain. I tell her, ""I am seeing here that I am getting emails from your business and they are being delivered, for example so and so sent an email 2 minutes ago with subject of 'blah blah' I then check and see nobody else is having problems. I send a test email to her to see if she received it and she could reply. According to her she never received it. So I check mail.log and follow the transaction. Their mail server absolutely did receive the email. I ask her to tell me what email they were trying to send to and see if there's something? I get told and I send a test email explaining the situation briefly. The person gets back to me within like 1 minute. I also check mail.log and I can see my email, I can see past emails from lots of other businesses. I never see a single attempt from anyone at this applicable place.

So I basically drew the line. I said that their mail server isn't my responsibility and I'm much too busy to do a back and forth with her. That their exchange server must have some block or their antispam is blocking it or smtp connector is pointed the wrong way. I didn't know what was wrong but it was certainly not at my end. She counters, 'We have an SLA with you guys and for every second we are down this is costing us millions, we are going to sue you if you don't fix this' Which mind you they're a non-profit which had only been open a few months and they'd gotten ridiculous cash from the government to open their doors. I reply, 'Well we don't have an SLA with you and nothing is actually down that we are responsible for so there's really no point in threatening a lawsuit. Plus the only way I could fix this would be to connect to your server and fix it'

She liked that answer, 'Well you better connect to the server now and fix it' and I reply, 'I can't connect to your server without a contract and indemnification of liability and I don't even want to fix it; so this is pretty unlikely for me to fix for you. However I gave you some ideas why it might be down and really the question you should be asking is 'what changed?' and that will tell you why it's not working.' She then admits, 'Well I was just on there changing settings and then it stopped working' I just stayed silent for a good minute and she would say, 'are you still there?' and I would just say, 'yep' and after about a minute of basically silence she's like, 'so have you finished thinking about how to fix it?' and I'm like, 'No I was just waiting for your words to sink into your own head. You did something and now it doesn't work... just undo what you did.'

She was angry again, 'I don't remember what I did, I changed lots of things. However if you don't fix this for me I'm going to go to your boss and tell him how terrible you are and cancel all our services if he doesn't fire you.' Well I happened to want to quit at this point so I reply, ""would you like me to give you my boss' phone number?"" now of note here, my boss absolutely hated when we gave his # to customers, because he would chill at home doing nothing and would only have to work when a customer called him and he'd be extremely mad that we gave his # out. However in this case I already knew she had it and that's exactly what she said.

Then I basically was like, 'Well is there anything else I could help you with today?' and you could hear papers being tossed and then you could hear her cup her phone so nobody could hear her and she whispered, 'I want you to fix it for me or I'm going to get you fired.' and I respond, ""Sorry but this isn't going to happen, if you want I can tell you some phone numbers for some local IT businesses that could help you out."" You could hear her typing angrily and she's like, 'I've already racked up $30,000 in bills this month from IT businesses in the city. That's why I need you to fix it before my boss finds out and questions what's going on.' I'm was taken aback by that number and say nothing.

I think she was starting to realize wtf was going on, 'Fine I'll call one of the IT businesses and if we find out that it was you all along... you're done' and she hung up. I go tell coworkers about what happened and send email to my boss because I know he might care. I then find out how we got them to buy so many of our products... apparently anytime there's a problem like this we would just have her buy this new whizbang thing that they were pushing that month and while we installed or did that work we'd fix her other problem on the downlow.

I never did hear from her again as I quit that job not that long afterwards but my next job after that I had heard about how she would get them to do work and then she'd have another IT place go in find any problems and use those problems to not pay for the other. The IT places started to clue in and play hardball right back.

MalwareKiller,188,193,q4698,507,"This is my response to the post regarding [Hoarders](http://redd.it/q41xk), first a little background.

I'm the Computer technician for a school district. One of my duties at our elementary school is to ration out ink cartridges because it is believed that elementary teachers act as the students they are responsible for. For budgetary reasons and the fact that I work for a school that is budget conscious and likes to ""save money"" by freezing the budget come December. So I use to order about $3k in ink supplies for the inkjet printers and about another $2k in Toner supplies in September in anticipation for the school year. Or at least that is how it was until I went to lunch one day and didn't lock my office. I came back to find my entire cache of HP 27 and HP 28 ink cartridges, a 6 month supply GONE. I sent out an email regarding the incident and never got a response except for management who was upset with me for the loss.

SO in retaliation I assumed it was one of our employees with a printer that used HP27/28 ink (hoping it wasn't just someone looking to sell them on eBay, doubted as most are older and ... well I just doubt it.) I pulled inventory for the Elementary school, drilled down to Inkjet Printers, HP 27/28 Ink. 8 results... I waited until that evening when it was just me and the custodial staff. I then went from room to room as I have a master key checking desks of the teachers on my list. 7 of the 8 had 4 or more cartridges that I could find in assorted places from desks to closets to cabinets. During my late night raid I collected 43 cartridges leaving only 4 behind for each teacher, 2xHP27 and 2xHP28.

Then next morning I then reported to management what I had done and the number of cartridges that I had confiscated, and reported that this was a faculty issue not an issue of me not locking the door as a number of these cartridges were 5+ years old based on the manufacturing date on the boxes, so this preexisted my employment. Apparently the teachers come to me and just ""say they need new cartridges, meanwhile they are just storing them for a rainy day.

I now have a locked closet away from my office to store the supplies in...

Oh yea and I also shot out and email tanking everyone for returning their additional ink cartridges. I have since cut my ink expenditures 25% as the dated ink was still good and I used the surplus to offset expenditures.

Over the ext month I had several faculty members come to me and report that someone had stolen their ink cartridges…

I never disclosed to the district what faculty members it was that I recovered the cartridges from, figured it dint make that big of a difference as I was getting a locked supply closet. I’m not sure if these were the actual “thieves” or just hoarding teachers.

If you like this let me know as I have many more stories as many of you do.

Edit: Those of you thumbing me down if you look at this again please let me know what you didn't like, the only thing I can think if was the fact that I raided their rooms.

-----------------------------------------------

Greetings, fellow tech support gurus! 88 here with another tale of that most blessed of lists, the Black List. For those not in the know, one of my previous positions had this idea implemented. At this time, my boss was an awesome guy, and he'd listened to my idea of The Black List, had me get the numbers together, and pitched it successfully to the C_O level. The Black List was a set of people who would receive absolutely no technical support whatsoever. This was communicated to their bosses and was not lifted until the supervisor had assured us (with proof) that the user in question had been reprimanded and instructed in better communication.

I have an absolute hatred for people who use whatever buzzword happens to be popular. Sure, there are times that such words are useful, but other times they are more of a hindrance than a benefit. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1kchjw/the_black_list_accounting_douchebaggery/) was an example of someone who knew what to say to get IT to respond immediately, and it got him in deep water.

My least favorite word is ""urgent"". In any capacity of IT, this word is seldom used properly. ""URGENT!!!!"" can range from a keyboard with a stuck key to a massive city-wide power outage. At FirstAid, we made sure to stress how much we loathed seeing that word, and encouraged better classification of issues. 

No one listened. Including the microbiology and testing facility. Everything was urgent to them, and not just ""urgent"". I could filter out ""**URGENT!!!!1**"" from our ticketing system and find no less than 20 hits. All from this department, whose R&amp;D nature made them think they were the most important group at FirstAid. The day in question was no different.

A new tech had recently joined the group, and I shall nickname her Girl Power. Why? GP was outgoing, social, bubbly-but-not-braindead, and most of all smart as a whip. A box of whips. A crate of whips on the USS Whip. Gp knew her stuff, but hadn't yet had the chance for practical experience beyond a Tier 1 helpdesk position. She was my first hire, and I was immensely proud to show her the ropes. To this day, she's like a kid sister, and accompanied me on any rounds I needed to make. 

I arrived one morning with my frequent armload of caffeine and fried sugar for the L1 techs, and noticed that GP had brought them a case of Coke that morning. A tear threatened to break past my defenses, but I sucked it up and distributed the doughnuts as best as I could remember. Several L1s mentioned that GP and The Boss were looking for me, so I squared everything away and headed for my desk. 

Nearly immediately after logging in, I was pulled into a three-way IM conversation by The Boss. It turned out that there had been a bit of a disagreement with the microbiology and testing labs regarding a series of computer issues that they were having. 

They thought we should devote 100% of our resources in IT to fixing their computers, and my Boss disagreed.

The first message after The Boss explained things made me giddy with excitement. You see, GP had not yet been hipped to the Black List, and while she'd known we were hiding something from her, she hadn't yet figured it out. So, when we were sent: 

The Boss: 88, time to brief your shadow on the list.

...I may have peed a little. 

Boss explained that three of the seven primary lab computers were experiencing slowdown of a degree that could not be remotely determined. L1 techs had failed to placate the labrats' complaints and cries of ""URGENT!!!!111oneone"", and someone had decided to fill out a ticket for the issue...

...every ten minutes...

...since 2:00AM that day.

It was currently 9:30AM.

The Boss released us to execute on our own recognizance, and I swung by GP's desk to pick her up. Armed with our wits and our skill, we headed for the facility. I briefed her along the way, and I swear her eyes took on a glow that could only be described as ""**PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER!**"". I then described the ""itty bitty living space"" part, and also told her what to expect at the facility.

Any of you who have done time near any sort of medical testing or waste will know that the smell is abysmal. It smells like Godzilla took a runny shit on a bloated corpse, added jalapenos, and then cooked it all for a few years. Between this and the nature of the work, anyone entering the facility was required to wear biohazard suits after checking in. 

We did so, and entered the facility, making our way quickly to the affected testing area. What we found was no less horrific than a library with collapsed bookshelves. I'm no biologist, or biochemist, but the state of this particular lab went against every fiber of my being. GP choked on what I can only suspect was bile as we took in the scene, while I deftly stepped in front of her to meet the onslaught of researchers.

Alpha Douchebag decided to step up first and declare that we were ""hours late"". I raised a hand and cut him off. ""Don't care. Lead us to the affected machines."" More sputtering and cursing ensued, and I raised my voice. ""I'll call the board and have your team shut down if you utter another syllable. Lead. On.""

Stunned silence, shocked face, and then finally blessed movement. We were led to three machines in the back of the room, near some of the dirtier sections of the room. The machines in question were filthy and indeed sluggish. I logged each user out and shut the machines down, a nagging suspicion in the back of my head. Instructing GP to disconnect the other two machines, I unplugged mine and put it on its side. Opening the case confirmed my suspicions.

What could best be described as a growth of bacteria had crept into the motherboard. It had started at the ""bottom"" and found a power line, snaking its way towards the processor fan and the primary hard drive. The former was, I can only hazard a guess, protected by the fact that it was moving ""blades"" that somehow kept the monster at bay. 

The hard drive's board, however, was covered, and to this day I have no idea how this gunk hadn't made it INTO the drive itself and fried it.  I immediately dropped the drive into the case and reached for one of the phones to call The Boss. A similar clunk behind me told me that GP had found something similar in one of hers.

88: Boss, you really aren't going to believe what we've found here.

AD: IS THAT YOUR BOSS? PUT HIM ON SPEAKERPHONE, YOU IDIOTS NEED TO LEARN THE MEANING OF URGENT!

Boss: I heard that. Don't bother. What did you find?

GP and I described the scene in excrutiating detail, all the while keeping AD at bay. I eventually handed GP the phone to tell her share of the story and squared off with AD.

88: Explain to me why-

AD: SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR! MY BOSS IS (middle management person name) AND SHE WILL NOT BE PLEASED AT THE LACK OF PROGRESS!

88: Perhaps, then, you should go ahead and call her down.

AD: I WILL!

AD trundled off to call his boss, and I turned back to wait for GP to finish. She did, and handed me back the phone. The Boss authorized the Black Listing even before I asked about it, but I wanted to make sure we had this one nailed down.

88: Boss, is Matcha watching the cameras?

Boss: He can be. Do you need evidential backup?

88: I do. Plus, I need you down here. (AD) is pulling his boss down here, and we're going to have a serious issue on our hands. If you can, bring HR Girl. You aren't going to believe the state of this room.

Boss: I believe you. We're on our way.

Hanging up, I informed GP of what was about to go down, and she actually wrung her hands with anticipation. We stood back and I moved the machines to give the cameras a somewhat better view, but I knew better than to try to get pictures myself.

In came The Boss with HR Girl, and both began to inspect the room. When The Boss came down to us and looked in the computers, he actually gagged. ""Words never do this sort of thing justice."" GP and I agreed, and HR Girl was positively green in her suit. AD and AD's Boss arrived next, and were stunned to find GP and I with backup. AD barely entered into his tirade before his boss started walking toward us. The Boss held out a hand to indicate that she should inspect the computers. She did so, with that trained calm that most researchers in movies are portrayed as having, and looked at me, then GP, and finally my Boss before speaking.

""I'm a computer idiot, and this looks bad even to me. Are these machines broken because of this biohazard?""

The Boss looked to me, and I shrugged. ""I cannot be certain. I refuse to work on this machine, however, due to this biohazard. I refuse to let any technician under my umbrella work on this machine for the same reason, and we do not have a safe room prepared for this sort of instance.""

My Boss nodded his assent, and AD's Boss nodded as well. She turned to HR Girl and my Boss. ""I formally apologize for this breach of containment for this bacteria. I will get to the bottom of this immediately and accept any sanction for our team that is necessary, as well as providing information on which bacteria this is.""

AD was furious. The Boss grinned and nodded at me, and I delivered our favorite line to AD's Boss regarding her workers. ""We have a list of several people who felt it necessary to submit tickets every ten minutes this morning about this issue, neglecting to inform us of the state of your lab. These users also decided that it was necessary to use words designed to make this problem our top priority. In hindsight, it should have been everyone's priority. Due to their conduct with our ticketing system, with the authorization of (Director of IT), and backed by (Director of Operations) as well as supported by (HR Director), I am notifying you that your techs (names here) are now on the IT Black List. This means that they will not be permitted to submit helpdesk emails, they will not be allowed to delay any updates, and they will not be responded to in any form regarding an IT-related incident. HR Girl is here to witness this, as well as to take evidence for FirstAid as necessary for conduct in this lab.""

AD's sputtering obscenities could be heard behind all of us, making sure we knew that we were all morons and that their very important research was being ruined by our carelessness. AD's Boss was red in the face, either from anger or embarassment. She nodded with my statement and apologized again, and we took our leave. 

For the next week, L1 techs were treated to lunch by the Microbiology and Testing Department as an apology for flooding the queues. GP was a bit shaken from how disgusting everything was, but caffeine set her straight. We decided to completely destroy the hard drives, since they were little more than OS drives with shortcuts to various network programs/drives anyhow, rather than even attempt to clean them. They were disposed of in accordance with state and federal laws.

Oh, and AD was fired, and I think sued. The litigation would have left his asshole in ruins. Turns out he was the main perpetrator of the lab's condition.

I never stepped foot in the labs again.

DorkJedi,44,69,1c18fh,507,"So I worked under a CFO-level woman, and her husband was head of HR. She was sister-in-law to the owner.

She calls me in to her office and wants to know why her email is full of porn.  
Uhh.. let me check.

What happened was she recieved an email with a picture attached. Outlook opened it in the Microsoft Picture Viewer from cache. A cache it shares with IE... so the preview bar at the bottom is full of porn.

Simple answer- a user on this computer has been doing a LOT of porn browsing from the look of it. However, this is the travel laptop she and her husband pass back and forth for travel. She is also a very puritanical fundamentalist Christian....

psmylie,99,93,x4uct,507,"I was working on a ticket that had me baffled (it's now fixed). Sadly, it was one where the person involved was not able to do a large part of her job. 

I got a call from this woman's manager, upset that it was taking so long to fix. The conversation went like this: 

Her: I've noticed that the ticket is still in normal severity. This application is critical to her job. 

Me: I know. I've been trying everything I can think of, including asking techs from other departments. 

Her: Well, I think we should increase the severity on the ticket. Also, I think it should be escalated. 

Me: You want to change the severity on a ticket that I'm already working on? 

Her: Yes. And escalate it. This should be escalated. 

Me: I'm not sure what that would accomplish. I'm already working on it. 

Her: Just tell me who I need to talk to in order to escalate this!

Me: Um, okay. Talk to (manager's name) at (phone number). 

About twenty minutes later, I get a call from my boss. 

Boss: Hey, you still working on that ticket? 

Me: Yup. 

Boss: Okay. Well, do it more intensely, it's been escalated. 

Me: Will do!

So, I started typing with extra vigor, and mouse-clicking with the focused intensity of a laser. 

Still have no idea why she wanted to escalate something that was already being worked, though... 

Oddly, I figured it out about a half-hour after ""escalation"", which means that I've probably just reinforced the whole ""escalation = stuff gets fixed"" thing in her head. ",This should be escalated.,600
derbeaner,74,139,x257a,507,"Quick backstory. I worked at a grocery store in high school. I worked the security position at the store. I wasn't a security guard, I was employed by the store and did carts and stuff too. Anyway. I used to stand at the entrance of the store and make sure people didn't walk out with things, check reciepts, etc. Next to me, was a little booth that had a computer, and sold pre-paid debit cards. There was one person working it, and, you guessed it, she was completely computer illiterate. I have no idea how she acquired this job. 

Anyway. One day, her computer was being slow, and she asked me if I happened to know anything about computers. It was a slow day, and I was bored, so I asked my manager and she said I could help her. A previous employee had been going on ""free movie sites"" so there was a ton of adware, Trojans, the works. So I ran an optimization on the machine, cleaned it up, and it ran like new. 

This is where I messed up. I should have never, EVER, shown her I knew ANYTHING LIKE THAT about computers. Let's just say, after about a month, I was basically running the booth for her. I walked her through everything, all the time. 

One day, the store was closing up, and she was getting ready to leave, and she dusted the computer tower too before leaving (which she had never done.) She came up from her cleaning, and said in a worried voice, ""derbeaner, I think the computer is on fire, I see sparks.""

I quickly walked over, and asked her where they were coming from, and she pointed at the back. I inspected it, and didn't see anything but the usual dust and LEDs. She kept telling me, ""Look, there's more sparks.""

I finally realized that she was pointing at the LEDs that show a connection on the ethernet port. I have never, in my life, wanted to slam my head against a concrete wall, in my life, until this moment. 

I told her what it was, and she said, ""No, I really saw sparks!""

I finally just agreed with her and made up some BS about them coming out from the fans. 

The next day, I came into work, and she had a brand spanking new Dell computer.

TechGurl8721,70,128,t6qp0,506,"It's a wonderful day already. The rain is pouring, the winds are howling, and in my head a migraine has started that I can only attribute to the very *thoughts* of coming into work.

I'm only two calls into the day and I get a gem. I know from the labored breathing and high pitched, shaky voice that either the woman on the phone with me is giving birth or having a panic attack.

Cust: ""Oh GOD!! A person. My internet isn't working. What's *wrong*?""

The woman is clearing experiencing the later of my theories. I manage to get her details. Enough that I can work with anyway. And I find out that the modem is showing a red internet. DSL and sync shows solid signal. Modem probably just needs a reset to kick start the connection. 

I check details on the model of modem. That it's one of ours without any custom settings as far as she's aware. I check previous logs, yep, no custom settings as far as I can see from our end either. Great.

""That's perfect. Now, if you look at the back of the modem. You know, where all the cables clip in? You should see a small little pin hole. You should be able to use a pen, maybe a paperclip or pin and what I want you to do is to push it into that hole and hold it in. The modem will reset in about 10 seconds.""

Cust: ""Okay...""

There's something about her voice that has set me on edge. I have to double check.

Me: ""Do you need me to go over it step by step with you?""

Cust: ""No, I'm pretty sure I understand.""

All of a sudden she's calm and a lot more confident. The hairs on the back of my neck start rising.

There's about a minute of silence then. I'm assuming she went off to find a pin or something small. But then comes the grunting. Now, let me just say that with the noises the woman was making I was going back to my original theory of panic attack and doing a little re-evaluation.

Me: ""Hello? Can you hear me?""

I can hear the grunting in the background and if I wasn't worried before I'm worried now because it's being accompanied by a fairly noisy banging.

I'm calling out on the phone hoping that she can hear me and that she comes back. So far my brain is running away with itself and I'm now theorizing that she's actually giving birth to a robot.

As I'm sitting there with a confused and slightly scared look on my face I hear a male voice in the background. There is some raised voices and then some laughter.

The laughter made me feel a little better. But only a bit.

A few seconds later the phone is picked up by a man. The son of the woman in question that called in. He proceeds to explain that his mother, after being advised on a reset, wasn't able to find anything small enough and so decided she could *hammer* a philips screwdriver into it instead.

Proceed me to order a new modem.

**TL;DR Woman can't find pin to reset modem. Hammers a screwdriver into it instead.**

-jackschitt-,93,107,11or3o,500,"I just overheard a conversation between one of our operations managers and the receptionist.  (For the record, neither one works in IT.....thank god.  They're from a different department.)  

OM:  You really should stop using wi-fi and start using your cellular data plan instead.  It's much cheaper.

RE:  Really?  I always thought you should use your home or work wi-fi and just use your cell network when you're out on the road?

OM: No no no.  My friend just told me that they're going to start charging $12 an hour for people who use wi-fi instead of their cell's network.  The cell companies want to be able to track your usage and they can't do that if  you're using wi-fi, so they're just going to start charging people $12/hr for those who go on the internet without using their network.

RE:  Wow.  I never knew that. 

*(I'm in the process of walking out when I see the receptionist fiddling with her settings, and I assume she's attempting to connect to her cell network instead of our wi-fi.  For the record, employees are expected to use the wi-fi instead of their cell network and are allowed to use it for personal use, but they're still subject to the usual restrictions.)*

Me:  OM, where the hell did you hear that from?  There's no way the cell companies could do what you're claiming they are going to do even if they were stupid enough to want to.  They *want* you using your wi-fi instead of their network because it takes pressure off their network.  

OM:  My friend told me about it last night.  She heard about it on &lt;some local talk show I've never heard of&gt;.  And they.....

*(At this point I stopped listening, as it was obviously one of those ""friend of a friend"" stories with no real merit.)*

I tried explaining it to her but she went into great detail about it.  You supposedly can ""buy"" an hour of using your own wi-fi for $12/hr, or 4 hours for $20 (!).  Or you can avoid the charges entirely by just using their network and letting them track you so you can get more ads.

Anyway we replaced the server and everything was fine for long enough time for Backup Exec 2012 to calculate disk trend.

Woman calls in; ""My boss is checking up on me and he says I haven't done my job in months. I go into the excel document and it has nothing since 2011. I saved that document on the server several times over the last couples days. Obviously something went wrong and you guys restored the server from an old backup.'

We say, 'We haven't but what files are you looking for? Let me help you.' She gives us the location that she saved it to; the place that the boss was looking. Sure enough the file hadn't been updated since 2011. We check the backups and they are all identical files. So obviously she's lying and she didn't save there. So we say, 'Did you perhaps save it to your desktop? because the file on the server now hasn't changed in weeks.' 

She didn't seem to like that answer, 'Just fix it and get my work back because I save that file to the server every day.' We explain 'there's no file by that name or even one saved recently with a different name. If it's not saved your desktop or my documents then there's just nothing we can do. Can we log into your desktop to see if we can find it?'

She really didn't like that, 'I save it to the server all the time and obviously you guys did something wrong and are trying to cover it up.

I don't usually get involved directly in supporting individual desktops in my current position unless it's something particularly odd. Occasionally though, my department gets a support request that nobody really knows where to send so we have to deal with it. We got one about a week ago complaining that ""company supported application X"" was not working on Windows 8. 

The answer was pretty simple, we haven't been deploying Windows 8 on anything and Application X isn't licensed for use on computers that we don't own and hasn't been tested on the new OS anyway, so use it on your work computer.


User looks me up in the directory and calls to tell me that he is using the software on his work laptop. I verified that he's actually using Windows 8 and ask who put it there. I shit you not, he comes back with, ""I did. I like the new start menu and I got the disc from [IT employee who shall be flogged with a rusty chain later] to try it out."" First thought in my head is ""screw this, I'm not cleaning it up"" and transfer the call to the genius who gave him the disc. Of course he doesn't pick up and I end up with the user on my line again. In the middle of me trying to explain to him why he can't have Win8, he responds with, ""Listen, it's MY computer and I'll put what I want on it."" The dude then proceeds to yell at me because nobody told him that this would happen, we should have been ready for Windows 8, his herpes is flaring up, it's all my fault because nobody told him not to do it and Starbucks didn't put enough sissy juice in his triple caramel latte this morning. I let the future flogee know what just happened so that he can go to the user's desk to back up documents and fix the mess that he created thinking that would be the end of it.


About 45 minutes ago, the same user calls me directly to complain that he can't get some bullshit app to work on his phone and needs help. We have a BYOD policy for phones here. Users get a monthly stipend and get to go out and pick whatever device tickles their nips, long as they can get to their email on it and answer calls.

I said okay, and proceeded to open up the laptop while asking the typical questions. What was he doing when it shut off, has he tried to get it back on, etc. He swears up and down that he has tried everything to make it power up. Now, reddit, when he says ""he tried everything,"" I am usually led to believe that he had the mind to push the power button. The second I press it and it turns on, he is instantly amazed like I just used magic to turn it on.

""Whoa! What did you just do?!"" I told him that I just hit the power button and that I was going to check it out for any problems. He had no idea that the laptop had a power button. I didn't have the heart to ask how he thought he could get it back on. 

After I worked my magic, the next question was ""how do I get google on?""

If this guy wasn't a walking facepalm, I don't know what is.","I know that some older people are not tech savvy, but come on.",656
squillo144,151,159,u8wvt,499,"Seems like TFTS likes a porn story as much as anyone, so here's my best one:

About 2 years back I was working at a reasonably sized ISP. A few of our clients had web/mail servers we had supplied to them. One month a client noticed unusually high bandwidth usage and wanted to know which pc/employee was using the most bandwidth.

I went onto the web server and quickly found the guilty IP address. I checked the logs and there it was - webpage upon webpage of porn had been visited. The client asked for logs of all the activity, which I started compiling.

Two thing quickly became apparent - this user was looking at porn the entire day. Pretty much 8am - 5pm everyday, and it had been going on for a long time. By time I finished there were logs for pretty much everyday going back a year. I can only assume he had a desk in a corner somewhere where nobody ever saw him/remembered he worked there. I don't know how he even got any work done

He was fired the day after they got the report, but I will never forget that spreadsheet of the sites visited. I wish I still had it- it went on for dozens of pages

TL;DR: fap fap fap",porn.lots and lots of porn,658
keenedge422,47,69,1o067i,507,"So I work for a university that offers Windows and MS Office for free to students. Occasionally we have calls from incoming students who try to download the software before they've enrolled in classes and the system rejects their attempt because their status shows as ""accepted"" rather than ""student."" This may have been the most shocking call I've ever received about the issue:

""I'm trying to download Windows 8 but the system won't let me!""  

**""Not a problem, let me look up your account... ok, it appears that you haven't registered for classes, yet, so you'll need to do that first before you can download the software.""**  

""Oh my god, this is such bullshit! I'm not registering until tomorrow! You mean I have to wait a whole DAY to download this software?! I want to download it now!""

***&lt;&lt;stunned silence from my side&gt;&gt;***

""Oh... oh wow... that sounded a lot less entitled and childish in my head... I'm really sorry. There's absolutely no reason I can't wait one more day. Thank you for all your help and please don't hate me!""

-------
It... it happened. A user actually heard themselves sound like a horrible person AND CORRECTED IT. 

I feel like I should quit now and go out on top.
