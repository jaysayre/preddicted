throwawaygu1lt,44,9,1qzqn3,17,"Hello, seeing as I frequent this sub a lot I decided to give this question a try. (using a throwaway in no small part due to being ashamed)

I've been having a lot of issues as of a year or so when it comes to being a decent human being. I don't like people, at times I even despise them. The only people I like are gone or unavailable to me. Before things got like this, however, I was also a part of the herd doing stupid things without thinking of consequences. I hurt someone's feelings many years ago for no reason and never apologised for it. The guilt's been haunting me over this in particular (next to a wall of other things) for so long it's almost always on my mind, which is why I tend to keep busy in any way possible (gotten to the point where I'd rather do anything than think about the past).

Here's my issue - apologising would fix nothing in my opinion. She's better off without me and I'm not really a part of her life any more, only a past that's irrelevant. Opening up contact right now would do her no favours and I have no intention of causing her any more grief because she's a nice person, unlike me.

TL;DR: Obvious solution to guilt is asking for forgiveness, not an option available.

4. If there's one suggestion or piece of advice you would give to a young woman who's considering abortion, what would it be?

Abortion is a very controversial subject and we hear a lot about it from political pundits, religious people and people we know. And it's no surprise, either: it's a subject that brings up when life begins, when is a human legally considered a 'person' with rights, whether government intrusion is justified. But, with all the yelling and fighting that goes on between the pro-choice and pro-life sides, we often don't get to hear about it from the perspective of someone who's actually experienced it first-hand. Well, I - and many other people - want to hear that perspective!

I'm also hoping that this thread can help clear up the misconceptions that people often have about women who choose to terminate their pregnancy. Misconceptions like 'Women who get abortions are selfish', 'Women who get abortions don't give it any thought before they do it', and 'Women who get abortions just don't want to deal with the consequences of their actions'.


If you yourself haven't had an abortion, but your girlfriend/fiance/wife has, feel free to answer! Same for those of you who have a close friend or family member who's had an abortion. 

**Just please don't attack anyone for their own decisions or their opinion on abortion.** I want this to be a safe place where everyone feels comfortable opening up about their experiences and feelings. If you want to have an argument about abortion and reproductive rights, there are many other threads/subreddits you can go to. :)","[Serious] Redditors who have had an abortion: What was your experience like, what were your reasons for doing it, and do you have any regrets?",18

Now its just getting really bad and I feel terrible living in this environment. I have 3,000 dollars saved up so far and I make around 130 dollars a day with my job.

This is my first time moving out, so I found a nice roommate in another city who said he'll give me a bedroom for 400$ per month.
I'll just be leaving while they're sleeping or whatever since I don't want to deal with any more drama, but the thing is, I have no clue on how to live alone. I live in Canada btw. So here are the questions: 

Do I need any documents (like my birth certificate, or high school diploma) and what if I can't have them since they're with my parents? Can I make new ones? What are essential cards that I need? All I have is my medical card, social security card and a debit card. 

Will earning 130$ a day be enough temporarily? I plan on starting college when I can but I can take a year off to get things straight. 

I don't have a license but I plan on getting one after I get settled in.

Any lifehacking tips on living alone would be helpful.

I guess that's about it, but any tips + info on living alone would be really really appreciated. I plan on moving out in the next week or so.

truth_hertz,0,0,1r0p0s,3,"I used to work retail during the holidays when I would go home between university terms.  One place I worked was a department store, and one day a family came in with a tag from the mall's ""Giving Tree"" that was set up for needy families.  The tag said that the requestor had a daughter and a son about the same ages as the two kids in the family that was buying the gifts.  I ended up helping the family for over an hour, buying things that the kids would have wanted for themselves; the young girl and boy were consulted at length over what clothes would be nicest, which shoes for the anonymous boy would be most admired, and which handbag the preteen girl would like the best.  The family ended up spending quite a bit of money, all the while talking about how great it would be for the two kids to have some nice things that would make them feel like they fit in at school.

Two days after Christmas I was working the returns desk and happened to get the return of all the lovely gifts that the donors had so carefully picked out.  Even worse, the mother had brought her two children with her to return these items.  The girl, who was twelve according to the tree tag, just stood silently sullen with her arms crossed, but the little boy, who was 8, was struggling to keep his bottom lip from trembling as he put the box containing a cool pair of  Nikes on the counter.  The mother acted disgusted with his lack of control and told him that ""you've known all along we weren't keeping any of this when we need it for bills.""

Because they had a gift receipt, our store policy dictated they could get cash for everything.  The mother was annoyed that the donors had bought a couple of the items on sale, so she wasn't entitled to the full retail price but she returned them anyway.

The looks on the faces of the two children broke my heart, and the attitude of the mother infuriated me.  I am pretty sure that she signed her kids up for this toy drive with the express intention of using it to get cash for herself.

Since then, I have never donated to any of these ""buy gifts for needy families"" schemes, because I don't want to get so emotionally invested in the purchase but be thinking in the back of my mind that I'm just being scammed.

Is there a way to make sure that the kids who don't have much for gifts this holiday season get something that their parents won't take away from them in favor of lining their own pockets?  Or are my options simply ""don't buy, or resign myself if I do""?",Is there a way to donate nice charitable holiday gifts that can't/won't be returned for cash?,3

God help me (its T minus 1 hour and counting b4 I have to be clocked in!!) I have often thought of putting this all down but haven't done it because of the emotional tax that has to be payed recounting it. I haven't yet been able to tell this story without seeing red and getting sad/mad/hateful/suicidal and tearing up  

In '94 I was living with a woman (we will call her A)for a few years when she tells me that she cheated with a person who she didn't really know, and could never locate since he was from another astate and it was a one night stand. She also told me she was pregnant.  I was upset to begin with, but after I cooled down, the thought of her alone with the baby was something I wanted to avoid. I still had deep feelings for her. The baby, regardless of how it arrived, was blameless. I stayed with her every step of the way throughout the pregnancy, all the DR visits, every pre-natal exam. I was there for every second of the delivery. I left only to go to the nursery and see the baby, who I will call D. I fell in love right away.  It didn't matter to me any more that I was not the biological father. I saw a little boy who needed me. 
I remember him lying his incubator in the nursery, I came in and was stroking his little head, whispering to him. He was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I vowed to him I would be the best dad in the world. I would never leave him, a promose I was forced to break.
I did something I am not proud of and would come back to bite me and almost derail my relationship with my father. I told my famaily that the baby was mine. It was either that, or tell them what happened and get pressured into leaving her or at the very least treating D as an outsider. Im ashamed of this and if I could do it over, I would tell the truth. I did come clean and tell them after the fact that I had lied and why I lied. We had decided to likewise tell D, at least in the beginning, that I was his father.   


We took him back home a few days later.  She had some post postpartum depression issues but I was there and took excellent care of our newborn. After the depression, I just continued to get up at night for feedings and changings. Truth be told, I loved it. I didn't mind. At the time she was going to a local university for nursing degree and I was D's full time care giver during the school year working night time as a temp, doing whatever I could to keep our heads above the water…selling plasma to pay for the diapers was a regular thing. I was right there for every single one of his firsts.  I took him everywhere I went and we were inseparable. He got sick a few times, he had some asthma  as a small child. I was there by his side the entire time in Children's hospital, I never left him until it was time for him to be released. This happened 3 separate times. 
When he was about 5, his mother started acting strangely. She would leave and not come home till later and later and later until she started not coming home for days on end.  She had become involved with some other guy I found out. We wound up separating and I kept our son with me most of the time so he wouldn't get confused while she got her life straightened out. I got an apartment for us and we were doing pretty well until the building caught fire and we lost most everything we had.  A friend took us in, gave us a room, watched my son while I worked.  During this time, I had D-----, his mom came over to visit him once in awhile but for the most part I had him with me.  About the time that A started not coming home, I met a woman I will call K, who had a  daughter named L the same age as D. She would look after D while I went to give plasma or to work , fed us and made sure we were okay. D and L became very close but there was never anything between K and myself until years after I had lost D.  
 
A wound up marrying this person and at that point, she started taking our son more often,  keeping him with her.  She told me that she was living in her Dads house and there was a room for our son, and this was to be his address now. I could still come get him (that lasted for a few weeks) and got harder and harder to do until I was being told to just leave when I came to pick up D. 
I got a summons a few days later to appear at a clinic to undergo paternal testing. I knew what hat meant. I was being dealt our of my little boys life.  A few weeks later, it was a matter of fact I was not  his father. I had no legal footing whatsoever. I got a lawyer and I fought, but in the end, I was not his biological father. I was not married to his mom. The only thing I had was my name on his birth certificate. 
There was one incident that stands out in my mind. I was awarded visitation at the beginning of the legal process. I was also to get D for a special weekend that was planned. I had the court order in my hand as I went to pick up D from A's mom.  I was denied by her mom and so was nto able to get D for the amusement part trip we had planned. 
In the end I lost my son.  The court saw no reason for me to be involved in his life. The last time I saw my son, he was telling me that he had a new dad, and he was supposed to call me by my name and that I was not ""dad"" any more.  ( this was a few weeks before I lost all rights to see him, I had come over to see him on his birthday, he told me he couldn't take the present I brought ( I still have it)  and his mom let me know that his name could be getting changed (he was named after my brother and father). I made the decision to not fight any more. The look on his face, the tone in his voice, his overall confusion about what was happening, all told me that it was time to stop fighting and let the inevitable happen.   
  

My family adored her (before she took D) and  D, My father sent her to Toronto to see Phantom Of The Opera, paid for it all. Threw outlandish Christmas and Birthday parties for D. My brother would make regular trips to town to see us. And even took us up to his house for a weekend. After A and I broke up, my friend  K and I took D and L to my dads for xmas and birthdays.  
  
I cannot convey the feeling of loss. There are no words that comes close to expressing the utter sense of hopelessness. The thought that my little boy needed me but I could not even see him. I was not going to see him grow up. I was never going to hear his voice again. It was as if he had died. I wanted to die. I didn't.  Id like to say that it has gotten easier to live with. It hasn't.  I have thought about him every single day since then. I celebrate his birthday.  He turned 18 this year. It would be nice to talk to him but I don't know where he is. I intentionally made no attempt to locate him since I wanted to stay out of his life so as to not confuse him.  It sure would be nice to talk to 18 year old D , but as for 5 year old D, he is gone forever.  

What did I learn? What was my lesson from this? Tell the truth. To yourself and your family.  Also, if you don't try to be a Good Guy Greg, be a Scumbag Steve or you might find your self a Bad Luck Brian.

Gone are the days of Jurassic Park and Lord of The Rings, movies that took filmmaking to new heights and showed audiences things we could only previously imagine.

I thought I'd pose the question to all intelligent redditors who love a great sci-fi, fantasy, super-hero, dinosaur, and monster movie... what's next?  *How do we make the next truly entertaining, ground-breaking Visual Effects movie when it's so clear that the people who pay us to make them are more than satisfied with the not-quite-great-but-close-enough visuals. Or do you think ""movies"" as we know them are on their way out altogether? If so, what do we do next?*

A little background on what I'm talking about. Well those crappy visual effects we all complain about; big movie studios have decided that VFX are good enough as is, since they can still trick you into seeing most movies with a slick enough ad campaign.  The only thing the big wigs at Disney, Warner Bros, Columbia, etc (the ones who contract the visual effects houses) care about is getting the same, barely passable level of visual effect CHEAPER. They don't care about art, or making better movies, or quality entertainment.

Implicit in this is that visual effects houses can no longer afford to innovate, they have to focus their efforts on trying to win jobs from these big clients and build and hire for facilities in countries that offer their clients big tax-payer funded rebates for working there. And this is a real bummer to artists working on movies because we see VFX with an even more critical eye than your own, and **we know** we're not producing anything near the quality we could be (not to mention the quality of the storytelling in general). 

*The really talented artists and engineers are leaving the industry altogether.* Studios have stifled their creativity enough, jerked them and their families around the world too far (chasing subsidized work), and have undervalued their work to such a degree that it's just not a stable or pleasant place to be any more.

Because of this mass exodus of talent and the big studio's satisfaction with the current level of VFX, I predict that the quality of VFX in big block-buster movies is only going to go down, or at best hoover around its current level.

As a frustrated VFX artist at a major VFX house myself (who just wants to make and share awesome things), **I'm looking for serious answers and innovative ideas on where we can realistically take movies from here, or if it's even something people want anymore.** If you just hate sci-fi, fantasy, super-hero, monster movies, please don't answer this one.",The state of Visual Effects in movies: Where can we possibly go from here?

I proved it by making them sit down, or spin around, against their will - they were surprised but accepted it. I took them outside and created a rainbow from my hand, saying, ""see?""

Then I took two of them aside and said, ""I want you to try and *remember what happens after I wake up, and tell me if I see you again. Tell me if you continue to think and remember anything, or if you just cease to exist then pop up again. You see, we're very similar - I can't remember what happened before I appeared in my world either! My life could be a dream too, like yours."" And then I woke up.

It's the sort of thing I'd probably do, if I really was ""lucid"" - be very excited, do some stuff and try to find out how this universe works. But one thing bothers me - I didn't have sex.

He also blocked out the inner bottom part of the room-door to stop the smell from getting out.

I called the police on him when he started arguing with me saying him smoking in the room does not affect my (im very health conscious) and that pissed me off. 

I told my father and mother, and now she's telling me that I should be careful and don't always strive to be the righteous person.

Alisha33,2,0,1r13k2,1,"   Older ladies of Reddit, I would like to pick your brains for a moment. I know it's a bit long so bare with me.

   I have noticed that girls my age (early 20s) tend to people pleasers. We try to positively accommodating to everyone and often apologize for incidences which aren't even our fault. Sure, we turn around and complain about shitty situations to a sympathetic ear but when it comes down to the moment we turn into complete doormats. 
   For example: Late last week I came home from work with a slight headache to the sound of our lovely upstairs neighbors' children running a marathon in circles around their living room, complete with periodic thuds coming down on our ceiling at the end of each sprint that shook the picture frames on our walls. The first thing I thought was ""I should say something"" followed far too quickly with ""Well, it is only 6:30. The kids don't really need to start settling down until about 8.""
Wait, what? I actually though this? They are making my pictures rattle and knocking on my already pounding head and I'm thinking about how I would inconvenience THEIR day by knocking on their door and asking them to tone it down??
It was at that point that I put on my shoes and walked upstairs to politely inform them that they were being a bit to rowdy and brought to their attention the effect it was having on my evening. 
I'm starting to realize that there's a difference between being assertive and being rude, being polite and being walked all over. And I'm beginning to understand that if I don't say something to people like my upstairs neighbors then nobody will. 

So I ask, Is this something that every woman has to contend with as they grow into themselves? How did you come to this realization if ever? And do you think there's something we can do to teach younger girls that it's not being bossy or a bitch if you politely but firmly state your concerns?

Thanks

Interview went very well, except on the item of compensation. This came up, and I was flat-out asked what I currently make. I'd seen a post a while ago that said if you let them know, you lose your bargaining power. So I was very vague, and simply said I was well compensated in the market for what I do, and that I'd expect to be paid accordingly.

1. Financed a new used car (first time in my name) 3 weeks ago and got insurance through the general.
2. Sunday night I was driving in the rain when the back tires slid and I lost control , ended up in a ditch but no injuries.
3. Police say that my back tires were bald on the inside to the point they were showing the wires.
4. I find out that the repairs will be too expensive for me to fix at this moment (estimate $1,500) 
My questions are:
1. Though I did buy the car as is with no guarantee is there anything I can do about the dealership selling me with the tires that bald? (I know it's very unlikely but I like to ask.)
2. Do I have to report the accident to my insurance company if I did no damage to anything besides my car and I want to pay for repairs myself? 
3. Since I won't be able to fix the car for a couple months can I pause my insurance? Will I have to say exactly why I want to pause or suspend insurance?
