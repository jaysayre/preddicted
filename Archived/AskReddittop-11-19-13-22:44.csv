The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight).*** College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars.|

Instead, tell her to ""dress for a first date with a guy she really likes"". Now, pick three places you'd like to go: someplace fun and active (bowling, pool, mini golf, go-kart racing, ballgame, etc), something romantic and classy (nice restaurant, upscale lounge, art gallery opening) and something in between (nice bar, coffee shop, comedy club). Now, when you pick her up, let the way she's dressed decide which you’re going to do: If she's wearing something sexy and revealing (dress, high heels, low cut top, etc.) than she wants to go somewhere classy and romantic. If she's sporting some jeans, tennis shoes or flip-flops, and a tee, the bowling ally or pool hall may be a good bet. If she's wearing jeans, high heeled boots, and nice top or blouse, than she's not really jonesing for the super romance treatment, and she put in more effort than mini golf deserves (eighteen holes of mini golf in heels... seriously?), so a comedy club or some place with live music is a good choice. And never, EVER, do a movie on the first date! EDIT: Men: You're going to wear a pair of CLEAN, NEAT jeans, a pressed stylish LONG sleeve button down shirt, nice shoes or boots (try to avoid tennis shoes of sneakers). Works for ANY occasion!|

Ever wondered just how Angelica could talk to the babies? Angelica is the only one who can talk to the babies because they are a figment of her imagination. She is spoilt, sad and lonely, because her Mother is constantly working and has no time for her. Her relationship with her Dad is superficial and unsubstantial, no real love is ever shown to her.

So how did it come about that Angelica would have to imagine these babies? Tommy died soon after child birth, a fact reflected by Stu never leaving the basement, inventing toys that his son will never play with. Chuckie died in the car crash along with his Mum, also reflected in the actions of his father; the crash has made him a pathetic nervous wreck most of the time. 

Most interesting is Phil and Lil. There never where any twins, there was just one baby. However this baby was a still born, and Angelica never knew the sex of the still born, so she invented twins of different genders.

Sadly, Angelica never uses her imaginary friends to comfort or entertain her, instead she is mean and nasty to them. She has invented this relationship with these babies so she can vent her frustrations of being a spoilt, lonely brat who has seen much hardship from these unfortunate parents; frustrations that can't be satisfied by a typical childhood relationship with a doll, albeit a Cynthia one.

Back in highschool i dated a girl for 6 months before she decided it wasn't working out anymore and she cheated on me with about 6 guys and stole my iPhone and wallet to buy drugs. I wanted to report her to the police like my parents encouraged me to and to prevent me from doing such her brother jumped me while I was walking home with his friends and busted open my lip pretty badly and threatened to kill me if i reported him or his sister (this is South Florida, so i believed he would do it).

My dad got a new job and we moved to a new city but i was still pissed about this whole situation so i did the next best thing. I created two fake facebook account of a random hot girl and guy, spent some time making it look legit with friends and such and added her brother on facebook with the girl and my ex with the guy. 

It wasnt too long before he started flirting ""me"" up and tried his best to get in this girls pants. on the other hand, having already courted my now ex i knew exactly what to say to charm her to the point that she was in love with me. This is where it all begins to get fun.

I started a sexting relationship between the brother and sister with me as the intermediate thanks to google voice. Both of them had fairly typical south florida bodies so nothing really gave anything away and i did a fair amount of photoshopping to remove identifiers in the room that may give away anything. 

This went on for about a month and a half totaling about 200 or so nudes between the two of them when i decided to reveal the curtain and send a group of unedited pictures that included key identifiers (face and rooms). 

Oh holy jesus how shit went down. I only wish i had some way to see how they reacted. Friends who still lived there told me her brother moved in with his dad that week and that they no longer spoke.

All in all, about 4 months till i got my revenge but it was amazing.

Awesome steak technique from ironicouch

""My friend's mother taught me how to cook steak a few months back, so far it has not failed me. You have to make sure your steak is dry, use a paper towel to dry it off. Heat the skillet before putting the steak on, you want to hear it sizzle when you place it in the pan. Rub the steak down with just a little olive oil and some sea salt and then place it in the pan for until it starts browning, so it doesn't take long on the stove, then put in the oven at 400 degrees F, for 10 minutes or even less depending on how rare you like it.
Everyone has their own method, but this was the simplest way I have heard it being made, and it always tastes fantastic.""


Another great steak cooking tip from FirstAmendAnon

""Alright, this is a great method, but leaves out a few important details. Here's the skinny on getting you perfect steakhouse quality steaks at home:
Buy a thick cut of meat like a porterhouse. If its more than 2"" thick it's usually better. Look for a lot of marbling (little white lines of fat through the meat). The more the better.
Stick the meat unwrapped on a rack in the fridge overnight (watch out for cross-contamination! make sure your fridge is clean). This ages the meat and helps dry it out. Then like an hour before you cook take it out of the fridge, pat it down with paper towels, and leave it out until your ready to season.
Preheat your oven to really hot, like 500F, and stick your (ovensafe!) pan in there. That will ensure your pan is super hot and get a sear on your meat quickly.
Season both sides of the steak with coarse salt and like a teaspoon of oil. I find peanut oil to be better than olive oil but it doesn't really make much difference.
Pan out of the oven using a thick oven mitt. Stick your steak in there, it should hiss loudly and start to sear immedietly. This is the goodness. 2 minutes on both sides, then stick about three tablespoons of room temperature butter and three sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the steak and throw that baby in the oven.
after about 3 minutes, open the oven (there will be lots of smoke, run your fan), and flip the steak. 2 or three more minutes, pull it out. If you like it more on the well done side, leave it a little longer. Do not leave it for more than like 5 minutes because you might as well just make hamburgers. Take it off the heat. Using a wooden spoon or large soup spoon tilt the pan and repeatedly spoon the butter and juices onto the steak. Baste in all its glory.
Let the meat rest for about five minutes. I use that time to make the plate prettified. Mash potatoes or cheesy grits on the bottom. Brussel sprouts on the side. Maybe some good goats cheese on top of the steak. Be creative.
This method is guaranteed to produce a bomb diggity steak. Like, blowjob-inducing 100% of the time. It's really high-heat and ingredient driven though, so be careful, and spend that extra $5 on the good cut of meat.
EDIT: As a couple of people below have mentioned, a well-seasoned cast iron pan is best for this method.
Also, the 5th bullet is slightly unclear. You take the hot pan out of the oven, place it on the stovetop with the stovetop on full heat, and sear the steak for 2min ish on both sides. Then cut off the stovetop and put the steak in the oven.""","Chefs of Reddit, what are some some tips and tricks that everyone should know about cooking?",14250

Originally I was planning on traveling through till the end of July but surprise tooth ache had me grounded early (turns out I need my wisdom teeth removed).  I've been home for the last week, catching up on sleep and getting organized for the upcoming school year (which starts next week).

I also [donated the money](http://i.imgur.com/DZhKK.jpg) I raised (via reddit) for filming costs since I managed to stay underbudget all trip (mainly by living off of the hospitality of redditors instead of staying in hostels).  

I'm interested in doing something similar next summer, but on a bigger scale/actually organized.  Something where you could vote on where to send me a on week to week basis.  In the mean time I'm going to work on turning the footage I took this summer into something (short documentary or music video or something).

I just wanted to thank everyone once again,

Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Expeditionary_Unit), could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? 

We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armor made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons like catapults and crude incendiary weapons. 

We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our ~~four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and~~ mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. 

We also have medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, and engineers, but we no longer have a magical time-traveling supply line (we did have but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll have to succeed with the stuff we brought with us.

So, will we be victorious? 

I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus.

Wow! Thank you for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel like a little kid who's won something cool, like that time my grandma made me a robot costume out of old cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that have been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank you very much, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make good use of Reddit Gold. 

Thank you to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always nice to receive recommendations from people who share your interest in the same things.

Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment like armor. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should have made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply line, instead replacing it with enough equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies?

Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win? We now have troops, their weapons, vehicles for mobility (including transport helicopters), medics and modern medicine, and engineers and all the other specialists needed to keep a MEU functional.

Okay, the past month and a half has been insane. Like I said in my last post, the code was originally signed to only run on the desktop that I was assigned, and also required a password upon starting. I felt secure in that they couldn't steal and rip the code and fire everyone. I then went to my manager and told him what I was doing. He asked me (In Dutch...) ""Is the program still on the work desktop, and did you do it on company time?"" I replied yes, and yes. I was promptly fired and expelled from the building. Once I left, I called my bosses superior (? or inferior?? the one higher...) and left him a voice mail saying what happened and that my boss fired me for it, but I thought he was being close minded and not open to advancing the company. I also got a call from my manager, telling me I have to give him the password... I told him I am no longer employed and am not required to any longer.

I get a call from my bosses boss, and he asks to have a meeting with me to discuss what actually happened and if it is true that it could save money, he would listen. but I was hellbent on refusing to give out the password. Not to be mean/defensive, but the code was not designed for anyone to use, it was very primitive in the way it had to be setup. I didn't want to be liable for someone using it incorrectly.

I met with him a week later, we discussed over tea about the program. I asked if I was doing anything wrong or immoral, and he said that the only issue was that I coded it on company time when I wasn't supposed too, and that the app not only was fine (no requirement to have it done by a person), but also saved the money lots and lots of money and they never even realized it. (They would have had to hire more people to handle the load, but didn't because everything was getting done.) 

Once we talked about it, he said I was very talented and asked why I worked in the line of work I do instead of software engineering, I replied that I found this job first and was making such great money-- which he didn't expect, and asked me how much I was making, me telling him the true amount. He was floored and cracked up laughing, I made more than my boss (but not the guy I was talking too). He told me he would love to give me a job doing software engineering for the entire companies systems. I agreed only if that the current employees wouldn't be fired and would be put into different places in the company. We came to a compromise that some of the useless people (There were a few...) would be let go (these people are morons beyond belief), but that he could find jobs for the rest (Translation was a big one, since us Dutch people have a culture of learning others languages, sales, HR and other departments, and a few of them were offered training for the jobs. A handful was kept on the original team but their job was changed from manual input to now they work with the tool I built. As far as I know, the bonus program was slashed a lot, but they're still making more bonus than before I bet since I was taking it all)

So now I am a lead software engineer over my own department, making the same base pay as I was making base+bonus previously. (No bonus, unfortunately haha) Most other workers moved departments or changed jobs in their department, so most people got a good deal.

Except my boss. They were upset with him before this, and were even more upset after him. He was notoriously a bad manager and he was fired over this. Oh well. They hired one of the previous people on my team to take over his job :)

clanspanker,2528,5163,144dcp,3408,"As a man that has reached the ripe old age of 48 I can promise you I have seen some shit go down. This one totally takes the cake for me though.

I was waiting out front of a truck stop back in the mid 80's. Sitting on a park bench with a guy that had a big Rottweiler kinda dog on a leash with him. I tried to make small talk but he was quite a sourpuss. So we sat in silence for a few minutes until the most unexpected thing I have ever seen, happened right before my very eyes.

While we were sitting there a big 18 wheeler pulls in without a trailer (bobtail) so he parks right up front like a normal car would. Inside the cab of the truck with the driver is a little monkey. The dance for the organ grinder kind. I think they are called Rhesus monkeys perhaps. Well the dog spots this lil monkey and proceeds to go apeshit over it. Lunging at the end of his leash and barking at the top of his lungs. Generally making a real spectacle of himself to say the least.

The driver is obviously upset, but not nearly as much as the monkey is. Actually upset may be the wrong adjective to use for the monkey though. In retrospect I think eagerly aggressive may be a more appropriate description for his disposition. He was pacing the dashboard back and forth. Never taking his eyes off of this very aggravating dog.

The driver opens his little triangle window that they don't make on cars anymore. The ones made for smokers back in the day. He yells out to this douche bag to call his dog off because it is upsetting his monkey. The guy laughs and says no way (I told you he was a jerk didn't I?). Says that his dog ain't bothering nobody. The dog hasn't shut up since he laid eyes on the monkey. I promise you he is bothering everybody for several blocks around. 

Now here's where things start to get interesting. The driver says that if he doesn't call his dog off he's gonna let his monkey loose on that dog. Douche bag laughs and says that his dog would eat that monkey alive. Upon hearing this the driver leans over and reaches into his glove box I guess. Pulls out one of those tiny baseball bats like you used to get at Astroworld or carnivals, and places it in the monkeys hand.

The monkey obviously knows what's about to go down because he is now trying to squeeze out of that little triangular window I mentioned earlier. This monkey has murder in his eyes if I have ever seen it. Driver hollers ""Last chance to save your dog's ass man."" In response douche bag lets his dog off of the leash. Now we have a situation that has escalated to the point where we have a dog jumping up at the window and a monkey screaming profanities right back at him. Well, the driver finally rolls down the regular window and out leaps all kinds of miniature primate hell. The dog never knew what hit him. Quick as a flash this monkey is riding on the back of this dog's neck. His two back feet all wrapped up in his neck fur with one hand hanging onto an ear. The other hand as you may have guessed by now is steadily and mercilessly raining down blows about this dog's head and face. I mean hard blows. You can hear them whap whap whap.

Well it only took a moment for the dog to realize he was in way over his head. He bolts yelping bloody murder as he runs away at full speed. I mean this dog is running so fuckin hard he's throwing up tufts of grass and dirt as soon as he leaves pavement. The monkey still riding him and beating on him the whole time. Douche bag acts like he wants to fight now but several people including myself stepped in to stop that nonsense. In a couple of minutes or so the little monkey comes loping back with his little bat still in hand, and leaps up into the still open window of the truck to await his master who has gone on into the store.

That wanker ran off to try to go find his dog, but I don't know if he ever did. My ride showed up and I had to go. Never again in this lifetime will I see something so totally crazy and unexpected like that. I am both fortunate and humble to have been so privileged to be present for such an event.

So Reddit, please do tell. What's your craziest thing you have ever seen in public?

14 thousand comments and counting.

I'm humbled and grateful for every one of the comments, upvotes and the endless amounts of music suggestions.

Currently the most upvoted comment isn't a song suggestion but rather a suggestion to listen to the music from the beginnings of its orgins. Here's the original comment below as submitted by GiraffeKiller- ""This is like introducing an Alien to the music of Earth. I wouldn't know where to start. Once you're through your kick on Classical, I might start with music from the 50's and progress through each decade. You can really see the growth of modern music like that.""

I think it's a wonderful idea, and will be blogging about my journey into the world of music. As many of you have pointed out; music didn't start in the 50's, so I'm going to start with the earliest written form of music… I'm going to start with Guillaume de Machaut's Agnus Dei. (Composed sometime between 1313 and 1365)

I am still posting my top 5 next week... It will be a difficult task considering all the submissions.

This week I am going to re-watch my favorite film of all time, Baraka. This will be my first time being able to hear the soundtrack of the film. I will be posting about that as well.

Also for all of those asking- the hearing aids I got is the Phonak Naida S Premium.

Again, thank you for all the kind words and shares!

Even if you’re not hearing music for the first time ever, I suggest looking through the suggestions and expanding your musical tastes. You never know how much more days you have left to hear.... Trust me on this one, you don’t want to miss out on a great song.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

I've never understood it.

My whole life I've seen hearing people make a fool of themselves singing their favorite song or gyrating on the dance floor. I've also seen hearing people moved to tears by a single song. That was the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around. 

I was born profoundly deaf and all music sounded like trash through my hearing aids. 

That is until a couple days ago when I put on a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years. 

The first thing I heard was my shoe scraping across the carpet; it startled me. I have never heard that before and out of ignorance, I assumed it was too quiet for anyone to hear.

I sat in the doctor's office frozen as a cacophony of sounds attacked me. The whir of the computer, the hum of the AC, the clacking of the keyboard, and when my best friend walked in I couldn't believe that he had a slight rasp to his voice. He joked that it was time to cut back on the cigarettes. 

That night, a group of close friends jump-started my musical education by playing Mozart, Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Elvis, and several other popular legends of music. 

Being able to hear the music for the first time ever was unreal.

I realized that my old hearing aids were giving me a distorted version of music. they were not capable of distributing higher frequencies with clarity, instead it was just garbled gibberish. 

When Mozart's Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it. At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Tears rolled down my face and I tried to hide it.  But when I looked over I saw that there wasn't a dry eye in the car.

I finally understood the power of music.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Obviously, I did the only sensible thing and went on a binge of music. 

Below are my top 5 favorites from my limited exposure to the world of sound.

1. Mozart's Lacrimsoa
2. The soundtrack to Eleven Eleven… I can see how this comes off as narcissistic, it being my own film and all but it's such a personal work that when I listened to it for the first time I broke down. I felt like I was truly seeing the film for the first time ever. I'm grateful that Cazz was able to capture the tone perfectly. We discussed the film and specific scenes with essay-sized reasoning/deliberations on what should be conveyed. The critical response to the film surprised me and I still didn't quite get it until seeing the visual images coupled with the soundtrack. 
3. Sig Ros's Staralfur 
4. IL Postino-Luis Bacalov 
5. Minnesota's A Bad Place

Ironically enough, I'm turning my hearing aids off more often than before because most sounds are even more annoying and the only times I have it on is when talking to people or listening to music/birds. 

Silence is still my favorite sound. When I turn my aids off my thoughts become more clear and it's absolutely peaceful. 

I hope that one day hearing people get the opportunity to experience utter silence. 

What exactly changed between my old hearing aids and my new ones? 

My previous hearing aids were only 4 years old but technology has gotten cheaper and better at an exponential rate since then. 

Before, I could almost hear the low frequencies at a hearing person’s level, but not as crisp... higher notes on the other hand, I didn’t hear at all. 

I never realized how little of a range my hearing aids picked up compared to hearing people until a telecommunications class in college. We were learning about radio equipment and the guest professor told us about how high human ears can hear and also compared to various animals. 

He turned around and turned the dial down to the lower pitches. I could still hear nearly all the low frequencies  like rest of the class. When he turned the dial in the opposite direction, I blanked out at about 40% and the rest of the class stopped between 90-100%. 

It’s an odd feeling learning something so profound about yourself at twenty one... But it’s not as odd as the things I can hear now.

It was during Lacrimosa that I realized I was truly hearing pitches I’ve never experienced before. It was like seeing a color I’ve never seen before.

I honestly never thought I would really be able to hear my own soundtracks because I have accepted my deafness, I have always been and still am grateful for all I've been blessed with so it was never a big deal to me.

Now... I'm overwhelmed and beyond grateful. 

But this is just the beginning. That’s why I’m asking you to give me the name of the most beautiful songs to you. 

I’ve posted the question on reddit and will listen to the top 30 upvotes and then post my top 5 from that batch.

So, amazingly, *crustlessmist* and *jwild98* determined the correct license and created a damning visual aid to show it within hours of my original submission. I gave the information to the police, who took over a week to respond to me, but said that they located the owner of that license and served papers to them.

Meanwhile, I had given the same information to my insurance provider: Geico. They ended up telling me that the other party was also insured with Geico and had submitted a claim just after the accident happened, claiming that they were involved in a hit and run(!). I asked and the agent told me that they claimed the car was parked and unoccupied when it was hit. The other agent got a recorded statement from me over the phone, which was extremely formal. She was all business until she asked if she could stop recording and I said yes, after which she said, ""Woooooow. I haven't had one like this in a long time!""

After some talking and investigation by Geico, they determined that I was the innocent party and I finally got a car rental from them (after a month of sharing a van with my wife and three kids, which is a pain when you need to get to work early). They didn't want to give me the rental earlier because they didn't know whether MY uninsured motorist insurance should pay for it or if we would find the other party and make their insurance pay for it.

Geico found out that the insured person's son had been driving that night and decided to lie about the accident when they got home. I still figure he must have been doing something illegal at the time since he had insurance and still didn't stop. I don't know, though. The police never told me his name and haven't contact me further regarding the issue.

Yesterday, they finally inspected and estimated the repairs my car would need. Today, they told me that they were declaring it a total loss and they will give me $2,800 (and change) for my 2000 Buick LeSabre Ltd. I'm not a car guy, but I remember him saying something along the lines of the ""rails"" being warped and the quarterpanels being bowed out and some other things. They were just looking at body damage and it was over the value of the car (it's not counting the mechanical damage that was done). I have until Friday to determine if I want to accept the offer for the title.

Geico also said they would pay for my medical bills, but it's a one time payment after treatment is ended. I have to give them HIPAA permission to get my bills from my medical providers and they will pay them. They also mentioned something about ""mental anguish"" and ""suffering"" but never mentioned a number. I guess a month without my normal convenient mode of travel and initially not being able to walk without immense pain after the accident count as anguish and suffering... so how much is that worth? I can't really think of an amount that I'd be happy to take if it were going to happen to me again.

So one day I'm sitting at a red light, minding my own business and a month and a half later I've lost my primary vehicle for an amount of money that can't cover a comparable vehicle. 

Still, it was exciting to hunt down the offender and at least get him to be held accountable for his prevarications and douchebaggery. Thank you for all of the help, reddit!

*Edit: saw the wall of text after I submitted and determined I should add a tl;dr*

**TL;DR**: Cops found ass who hit me and ran. Geico also found him. Ass had claimed hit-and-run on his own vehicle. Geico determined I was right and he was wrong. Geico says it will pay for my medical bills. Geico totals my car and offers me $2,800 (I have until Friday to accept). I now have no car.

**Edit:** It is amazingly difficult to keep up with the waves of people crashing into this thread. I just want people to know that I'm doing my best to read the comments, even if I'm not responding to all of them. And I'm totally getting the feeling that I need to speak to a lawyer. :) Thank you.

**Edit:** Wow! The number 1 spot on the front page! And I didn't even misspell anything in the title or make any glaring grammatical errors!

**Edit:** I just looked up the guy's name in the court website and found out that he's got a hearing coming up on the 14th. He was charged with ""Failure to Stop / Accident - MISD"" and the code section is [here](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-894). It says that it should be a Class 5 Felony. [This page](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-10) says that a class 5 felony is punishable by a jail term of 1 to 10 years, or up to a year in jail and/or up to $2,500 in fines. The court website lists that as the code section, but it also lists the type of case as a Class 1 Misdemeanor.

I've seen NASA endeavors generate a lot of excitement from redditors, so please, let me know how we can involve you! What would you like to see from us, what are your suggestions?

It was recently proposed that NASA eliminate all funding for mission-specific education and public outreach. This doesn't mean that NASA Missions will be ending outreach, but now more than ever we need public outreach that is effective (and cleverly funded). Engaging the public has also changed with the rise of the internet, and we're trying to keep up!

And sorry to those of you responded to the first post; it was removed. 

EDIT: Wow, you guys are amazing! Here seems to be the most common suggestions thus far: 

* **Explain to the public in a direct way ""why they should care""**. I like this. I'm going to suggest we put a page on the mission website with the title ""why you should care about ..."", and use it to explain, in plain English, the benefit of our mission to the public. 

* **More direct access to the scientists and engineers of the mission, and the ability to engage them in discussion and conversation**. The easiest way I can think of this accomplish this is an AMA, and maybe a discussion forum on our website to be implemented in the future. As of this morning I think the mission's PI (principal investigator = head of the entire mission) may be willing to do an AMA on reddit!

* **More/better interactive media (infographics, games, visuals)**. We are actively working on putting together some great media and maybe even interactive games for our mission, so I was happy to hear that this is desirable. We will try to make is easily available to the public as they are developed.

We have a breakfast laid on at work every morning, just a simple buffet of eggs, bacon what have you. Nothing huge and it's really only to feed about a dozen people or so. I am usually one of the first guys from my team to get to work and the kitchen was deserted as usual. I walked into the little kitchen, there was a ceramic egg tray thing with 12 eggs in it, like the bottom half of an egg carton with a socket for each egg. All spaces are filled with warm freshly boiled eggs. 

I take one, walk over to the garbage bin, shuck the shell then I walk back over to the food and stop dead. There are 12 eggs in the tray again. ***No one entered the room while I was peeling the thing***. I touched the mystery egg it was the same temp as the other eggs around it.

Not a big thing, nothing major, but something very strange. Given one does not get presented with strange eggs from a parallel universe every day I peeled and ate that one too.

Post your codes and I'll add them to the list!

cheat list:

1. Stop: Stop: Play. Skip advertisements in movies and go strait to the movie.


2. Dial 0 during most automatic menu phone systems to be taken to operator to route your call. also, mashing buttons may work as well. Whenever you have a voice automated phone system, typically saying ""representative"" gets you someone right away. **Update** In regards to Cheat Code # 2 I recommend this site: http://gethuman.com/


3.  keep a spare car key in your wallet/purse. If you have a bulky Key that won't fit in your wallet, get a key made that doesn't have the electronic chip on it. It will still unlock the car, it just won't start it. ***changed by popular request*** **Risk Update:** if your wallet is stolen they have your car key. All they need to do is go to your house some time later and take your car out of your driveway.

4. Riding a bicycle will save you lots of money on gas, parking, medical bills, and gym memberships.


5. If you are speeding and suddenly up ahead see a cop that clearly just tagged you, slow down and wave to him/her. Your odds of being pulled over are quite a bit reduced.


6. Don't be rude, but NEVER answer any cops questions when they call you in for questioning.


7. when getting lectured into voice mail, hit 1, pause momentarily. If you aren't put through immediately, hit *, pause. Finally, hit # if neither 1 or * worked. It is called the 1-star-pound technique, and it works for all cell carriers.


8. If your credit card magnetic stripe starts to get worn from use and being in your wallet, and doesn't always read in the card reader, you can use the plastic bag trick. Put the card in a plastic grocery bag and then swipe it. Not sure why it works, but it does.Taking it further though, you can simply apply a piece of quality cellophane tape over the mag stripe for a ""permanent"" plastic bag trick.


9. At the end of your shower turn the water really (or all the way) cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. **Update** update 9: It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems.



10. Macy's credit cards usually have a 20% discount on purchases. I pay with the Macy's card, then while still at the register, I immediately pay off the charge with my debit card. I just got 20% off my purchase and I never get a credit card bill. - this also works with JCP and kohl's cards.


11. **im replacing the free movie rental cheat because its unpopular...mostly with movie rental clerks :-/ heres a new one!** When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase. Google the promo codes. They're out there - you can get anything from free shipping to 25% off the purchase.


12. Turn it off, then on again.


13. Buy things out of season, this can save you money. Unless its food, then buy it in season.


14. When you have forgotten someones name, simply say : ""I'm sorry, but what was your name one more time."" They may act offended, but when they give you there first name you simply reply ""No, I meant your last name."" (more socially acceptable to forget). Bingo. First and last names.


15. When eating buffalo wings, the flat portions. You can detach the smaller bone on one end very easily, then twist it a bit and it will just slide out. You're now left with a big hunk of meat and only 1 bone, you can just bite it off into your mouth in one piece, flintstones-style. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRcOY-PvOC8


16. Gently work an orange in your hands to loosen the peel from the fruit. This makes it easy enough to get the whole peel in one shot.


17. Can't find your car in a parking lot? hitting the lock button trying to get it to beep? Extend the distance of key-less entry by putting the key under your chin. The signal will resonate in your skull increasing the range dramatically. I swear to god this works, and I'm told it's safe because the radiation is non-ionizing. **verification notice** from ddrt via AskReddit sent 20 hours ago 9 is called the scottish shower. Just sayin' EDIT: I just tried #17 holy shit it works!


18. If you get a ticket on the windshield of your car, you can potentially get away with parking illegally in the same lot for the rest of the day by keeping the ticket on your windshield. **edited** reduced from a few days for a single day.

19. Most tinfoil and saran wrap boxes have little push-in tabs on the sides. If you push them in, the roll won't fall out when you try to rip out a sheet of it.

20. Keep a list of all of the credit card phone numbers (1-800) in your cell phone. This way, if your wallet is ever lost, you can call them immediately to have them disabled. It's also a good idea to place all of the cards in your wallet on a copier and print a page to keep at home. This will give you access to your License #, etc. **Update:** You should update 20. If you lose your wallet.. as in misplace it.. put a hold on your credit cards. Do NOT cancel. If you cancel it can later show up on your credit report. If you believe you are going to find it later, placing a hold saves you the red mark on your report.


21. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank. ***Update:*** saw the gas tank one on an older reddit, turns out the handle thing is not consistant. But there IS usually a little arrow next to the icon. **Second Update** 99% of the time the gas door is opposite of the tailpipe. So far, I have only found that early-mid 2000 Pontiac Vibes break this trend. **Third update** if there is no arrow, then it most likely is on the passenger's side. I've yet to see one without an arrow that wasn't on the passenger's side


22. **this tip was unpopular, so im changing it** This one changed my life. If you're at home/work/party or GOD forbid your girlfriend's house and the toilet starts to overflow, take the lid off the back reservoir part and lift the long handle as far up as it will go. The water will stop rising and then you can quietly mutter curses at it till it goes back down (which it does, more often than not...) link to a Diagram: http://superhomeideas.com/images/toilet.gif 


23. to peel a boiled egg, roll it around on your plate for a while until all of the eggshell is cracked evenly. Then it's easy to remove the complete shell at once. After you boil eggs immediately place them in ice cold water for a few minutes. No vinegar or salt or oil or whatever people use. Shells slip right off

24. you spill any liquid that will stain on your carpet (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet - just rub it in with your hands. Leave it there for a few hours (for serious stains, up to a day) and vacuum it out. Voila, stain gone.

25. If you park in a large parking garage/shopping centre, get out and take a photo on your cell phone of the nearest parking sign (Area B2, etc). You will never lose your car again.

26. If you drive stick and the battery s dead, get some friends, put the key to the on position, put the car in 2nd and push the clutch down. have your friends push your car. when you get a decent speed going let the clutch up. (this is called ""Popping the clutch."" your car with start and you can drive around for a while to recharge your battery(provided nothing is wrong with the battery or the alternator). **Update** thanks for the input guys, i switched it from 1st geear to 2nd gear.

27. Tapping on the top of a beer or soda can will make it fizz less!

28. Peel a banana from the bottom, *which is one of /r/sciences 2nd highest scoring link of all time!* http://www.reddit.com/r/science/top/?t=all

29. 4,2,3,1 -- Vending machine cheat code. (As in, the vertical buttons machines, like this one http://www.enterprisevending.com/Images/vending.jpg ). will grant access to vending machine's diagnostic menu. most times the fun features are disabled, but i've gotten a free powerade and a couple cokes in the past.


30. **use this at your own risk *Re: #30, I worked as a parking enforcement officer during college and we can tell when it's fake. The fine for this offense (at the university I worked at) was $250, and usually a ban from parking at the university (i.e., booted or towed on sight).*** College Parking Cheat Code: Anyone who's gone to a college or university knows they usually charge a ridiculous amount of money for parking (usually $300+ for a semester pass or $10+ for the daily passes), a service that should fucking be free for students considering the high cost of education. Fuck them. Buy one daily pass at the beginning of the school year (usually a small paper ticket printed out a machine on the lot), take it home and scan it, photoshop the date for tomorrow, and print. Repeat for the next 4 years. Anyone with even the most rudimentary photoshop skills can pull this off convincingly. Even if your printer is shitty, from behind the tint and glare of a car windshield, it might as well be a 7-11 receipt. I did this for 2 years at a UC and saved hundreds of dollars.

AuntySoshal,2007,5594,1lxw5t,2664,"My neighborhood has a community gathering on the first Saturday of each month at a different neighbor's house. I'd like to go tonight -- someone even left an invitation on my door -- but I'm quite introverted, to the point that I've had panic attacks at the very prospect of spending time with people, even acquaintances. I've gotten a bit better about my fear, and I'm trying to overcome this mental block. I'm new to this neighborhood and I like the sort of people who live here, but...well, I've already started crying as I write this out, so there's not much chance I'll pull myself together tonight.

I realized today that if I had a plan, if I knew what to do after knocking on the door, I might be able to give it a try. So what does one do? On the rare occasions when I've gone to parties of any kind, my typical behavior has been to cling to a friend as if my life depended on it. What do I do without a crutch?

1. Knock on door.
2. Say ""Hello, I'm ____ and I'm new to the neighborhood.""
3. What????

A little more background, if you're interested. I'm 51, female, divorced for a couple of years. I really kinda need to locate a friend or two. If only they weren't so terrifying.

**EDIT:** I'm overwhelmed, y'all. Seriously. I created this throwaway yesterday afternoon because, as I paced around my house, it occurred to me that this was exactly the kind of question that AskReddit is good for. And boy, did you guys deliver.

I've received hundreds of helpful comments and dozens of wonderful, thoughtful, supportive PMs. If anyone should question whether Reddit is a supportive community, please point them to this thread. You guys, young and old, male and female, near and far, are my friends. Shame I can't take you all out for coffee or a drink.

For those who are asking, and since I kind of buried the OP delivery (OP delivers!), no, I didn't go last night. I waited until I was already upset before I asked you guys for help. I should've asked earlier. Should've had my wardrobe laid out. Should've bought that bottle of wine. But the next social is October 5 and I will put it on my calendar. I will plan and I will go. I know from experience that even those social situations I've dreaded and resisted, when I've forced myself to go I end up being fine. No one has shot me down or laughed in my face. It's the *going* that's hard, but the being there turns out all right.

Several of you have suggested psychiatric therapy, and I want you to know that I had considered it before and continue to consider it. I'm not at all offended. There's a reason these professionals exist. They help people who are miserable. Am I that miserable? I'm considering the question.

Thank you all again. You helped. I'm sure there are many besides me who have been helped by this thread, too, and that thrills me. We will make it.

VelvetJones12,6195,13721,12cqsd,2641,"So I was in a coffee shop this morning studying for a midterm.  At one point I look up from my table and I see a twenty dollar bill laying at the feet of an attractive blonde making an order.  I assumed it was hers since her wallet was open, so I walked over, picked it up and gave it to her. She took a look in her wallet and had all her money accounted for, so she told me it wasn't hers and said something along the lines of 'finders keepers'.  So without thinking I handed the twenty to the cashier to pay for her order and walked back to my table. A few moments later, the blonde walked over to thank me and give me the change.  I said ""I know that normally guys are supposed to introduce themselves first and then take a girl out for coffee, but since I did this all backwards, how would you like to sit down and give me a chance to introduce myself?"" She sat down. We talked. I got her phone number AND a date this weekend.  In no way could I have scripted it any better.

When I opened the register he pulled a box cutter out of his pocket and told me to give him all the money. My first reaction was to laugh. I couldn't believe I was being robbed. He then waved the box cutter around and swore he wasn't horsing around to which I told him he wasn't getting anything. He said he'd cut me and I told him good luck climbing over the counter to get me. He then placed his hands on the counter and leaned towards me. I grabbed a box cutter of my own and said look at that, a Mexican stand off. Now here is where it gets silly. The man asked if I was threatening him. I said no sir, still laughing at the situation. He then proclaimed he was calling the police and I said please do. He did and he WAITED for the police to arrive! He told them I brandished a box cutter and threatened his life. I then showed the fine officer our security footage and wouldn't you know it? He arrested my new friend. That's my favorite work story, call it bullshit if you want.

I was in seventh grade, and my older sister was in ninth. She was having a bunch of friends from school over. I thought I'd be hilarious, and hide in her closet before they got to her room with the intention of popping out and scaring them. So I'm in the closet just waiting, and my sister comes in the room with about four or five of her friends. They are all just talking for a few minutes, and I start to get bored. I decide it's time to make my move. 

I jump out, and I see something I had never seen in person. Boobs. Boobs everywhere. My sister and all of her friends are standing or sitting around topless and in their panties. I couldn't believe it. They all covered up and yelled at me to get out. 

Don't ever let girls try to tell you they don't do this when they hang out. I've seen it with my own eyes.


EDIT: I don't know what my sister and her friends were into, but it appears no other female on this thread finds my story reasonable. All I know is, I saw boobs.

Almost immediately I went over to her and started kissing her, doing things I know get her hot until we spent the rest of the night doing the dirty together. Afterwards, I remarked at how random that was -- I had a lot of work to get done and wasn't really in the mood before. She then informed me that she was horny and just used her ""trick."" 

What was the trick? For the past several months, whenever she did almost *anything* sexual with me, she made sure to put her hair up. Slowly but surely, she built up this connection that whenever she reached back to put up her hair, I would expect something sexy to happen. She had done this so effectively that apparently she could get me horny by just putting her hair up -- no foreplay or anything up to that. I was floored. I immediately remember her doing this to me in public all of the time, and I would never have made the connection if she hadn't fessed up.

So here's the story. This guy set up a facebook event for this party at this big hall and over 120 people RSVP'd. 700+ invited. So it's not like no one knew about it. Considering the amount of people that would know about it and come, even if they hadn't clicked attending, was that high this guy booked a massive hall that could cater for such a large event. This cost him around $1500 which included food, security etc. Then he decided instead of using an iPod, which would probably get lost/stolen on the night, he'd hire a DJ. That cost $400. All of this the host had spent months working his ass off so he was able to actually afford it and hold the 'best party ever!'

Come the night of the party, weeks of preperation money and organisation, this party is expected to go off! My sister heads off to this massive venue, 'fashionably late' aswell, and no one else is there. Much to their surprise, It's just an empty hall with lights going on and a DJ doing his thing. Then she finds the host and asks the normal questions; 'where is everyone' etc. He is as baffled as my sister was. Not even his best mates had shown up which was even more surprising. 

Now this is just the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing. The host then calls his friends. He asks them 'where the hell are you guys?!' and, obviously on loudspeaker an uproar of laughter comes from the person speaking and you can also hear it in the background. 

He starts crying and everything, absolutely devastated about what has happened. Not only is he out of pocket at $1900 least and knowing that all your friends possibly organised a boycott for this event . When I was told this story i couldn't stomach how harsh and horrible people can be. I never even though this happened, especially on such a large scale as this.

I've been on reddit for a while, and I really enjoy the community. I always wondered who the people of reddit are. So I make a [quick survey](http://redditsurvey.zxq.net/index.php) to find out.

This is not a scam. Every single question is optional, you don't have to answer a single question if you don't want to. It's 100% anonymous, I don't ask you a single question about your name or account.

You can look through my [reddit profile](http://www.reddit.com/user/JavaLSU/) and see that I've been here for a while, and am not just a bot trying to steal data.

If you have any questions or suggestions let me know. If you think of any new questions I can add them easily.

Now, here's the best part....INSTANT RESULTS!!!!  I've created a [real-time results page.](http://redditsurvey.zxq.net/results.php).  That's updated every time someone takes the survey!

I am a programmer at heart and figured out how to make a script do all my work for me. Between co workers, they have a 90% accuracy rating and 60-100 transactions a day completed. I have 99,6% accuracy and over 1.000 records a day. No one knows I do this because everyone's monthly accuracy and transaction count are tallied at the end of the month, which is how we earn our bonus. The scum part is, I get 85-95% of the entire bonus pool, which is a HUGE some of money. Most people are fine with their bonuses because they don't even know how much they would bonus regularly. I'm guessing they get €100-200 bonus a month. They would get a lot more if I didnt bot.

It was odd, but no biggie, so the class just bullshitted to pass the time.  Five minutes pass, then ten, when I finally spoke up

""Hey, HEY!  We should just keep reading from where we left off yesterday guys.""  I was a very charismatic kid.  Probably the most agreeable guy in school, the friends with everyone type, so everyone actually went along with it.  It's a play, so everyone who had a 'role' the day before just resumed it and we kept reading.


Well, 5-10 minutes later the Vice Principal comes in.  He was obviously surprised that we were doing work, but he didn't mention it.  He just told us our teacher was dealing with a personal issue and she would be a little while longer.


10-20 minutes more passed and she finally showed up.  When she opened the door and saw us there, all reading and paying attention, she burst right into tears of happiness.


She died a couple years later from Cancer, way too young.  She was only 40.  Around the time of her death I found out that was the day she was got her diagnosis/prognosis.  So on one of the worst days of her life, our class helped make it just a little better.

She received 19 e-mails back of people confessing, most of which were never even guilty of plagiarism in the first place.

MD786,2963,4019,elal2,2433,"My friend and I were pulling onto the highway yesterday when suddenly a Mexican looking kid waived us down and ran up to our window. He was carrying a suit case, the big ones like we take on international vacations and it seemed as if he had been walking for a some time. Judging from his appearance I figured he was prob 20-21 years old. He asked us if he could get a ride to ""Grayhun"". We both looked at each other and understood that he was saying Greyhound, and the only Greyhound bus stop in town was at this gas station a few miles down the road. It was cold and windy out and we had some spare time so we told him to jump in. 

Initially thoughts run through your head and you wonder... I wonder whats in that suitcase...is he going to put a knife to my neck from behind the seat... kilos of coke from Mexico because this is South Texas?... a chopped up body?...but as we began to drive I saw the sigh of relief through the rear view mirror and realized this kid is just happy for a ride. When we got to the gas station, my friend walked in and double checked everything to make sure it was the right spot but to our surprise the final bus for Houston left for the day. The next bus at 6:00 p.m. was in a town 25 miles over. We tried explaining this to him, I should have payed more attention in the Spanish I and II they forced us to take in High School. The only words I can really say are si and comprende. My friend and I said fuck it lets drop him off, and turned to him and said "" listen we are going to eat first *making hand gestures showing spoons entering mouth* and we will drop you off after"" but homeboy was still clueless and kept nodding. 

We already ordered Chinese food and began driving in that direction and when we got there, he got out of the car and went to the trunk as if the Chinese Restaurant was the bus stop. We tell him to come in and eat something first, leave the suitcase in the car. He is still clueless. When we go in, our food was already ready. We decided to eat there so he could eat as well. When the hostess came over, she looked spanish so I asked her I was like hey listen we picked this guy up from the street, he missed his bus and the next one is 25 miles over can you tell him that after we are done eating we will drop him off its ok no problems... and she was kinda taken by it and laughed, translated it to the guy, and for the next 10 mins all he kept saying was thank you. After we jumped into the car, I turned to him in the back and was like listen its 25 miles, I'm rolling a spliff, do you smoke? He still had no clue, but when we sparked it up, and passed it his way he smoked it like a champ. He had very broken English, but said he was from Ecuador and he was in America looking for a job to make money for his family back home. Like I said he was prob 20-21 years old. Shorly after, we arrived at our destination, and said farewell. Dropped him off at some store where he would have to sit on a bench outside for the next hour.. but I did my best. I hope he made it to wherever he had to go.

My man got picked up, fed sweet and sour chicken, smoked a spliff and got a ride to a location 30 mins away. I hope he will do the same for someone else one day.",Have you ever picked up a hitch-hiker? ,6452
Taodeist,6092,3906,142uxm,2431,"I admit I had one when he asked me. Back when I was about 13 or 14 my cousin and I were walking out of a restaurant in central Washington. It was late in the evening and already dark. There was a very large river nearby us and I saw a light in the sky that appeared to follow low above the it. Now there was a small airport across the river so I gave it not another thought to being anything other than a plane. But instead of turning left to the airport it suddenly increased in speed and appeared to shoot upwards and quickly across the town. Then it flew off to the right towards a smaller town about 10 miles away. It then stopped and hovered above it for just a few seconds before a smaller light came up from the ground, appeared to hit the first light, and then both zoomed away in the distance. 

I turned to my cousin and he just looked at me and asked ""did you see that too?""

BunsOfAluminum,1650,6211,r0e88,2421,"[Here is an album](http://imgur.com/a/HzYJT#0) of some pictures taken the night it happened and pictures taken this morning in the daylight. The officers tried figuring it out, but none of their guesses brought back any drivers. I live in Virginia, but this happened in a small city that has a university with ~13,000 resident students, so the license could be from any state (or even Canada, I suppose).

I have liability insurance on this vehicle. Geico told me that if they can't cover me that I can at least get coverage through the Virginia Uninsured Motorist fund (or something to that effect). My concern is that my back is very screwed up from this (it was a massive jolt). I've had moderate trouble walking, sitting, and moving today because of the pain. My car also started cutting off while driving to where I suddenly lose power steering, breaking, acceleration, etc while driving. Shifting into neutral and starting the engine fixes it for a while, but I only did that enough to get home. 

**TL;DR**: Got rear-ended while stopped at a red light and the guy drove off. My car is broken and my back is pretzeled and my only hope to find this hit-and-run class act is to decipher the license plate smudge he left on my bumper. Please help!

**EDIT 1**: Remember that the imprint is backwards from what the license actually says.

**EDIT 2**: The Virginia DMV [has an app](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/dmvnet/plate_purchase/select_plate.asp?PLT=&amp;PLTNO=) for trying out different license plate messages, if it helps. It seems to tell you if a license number is available, too.

**Edit 3**: Thank you, to whomever gave me a month of Reddit Gold!

**Edit 4**: Oh, my goodness. I just crawled out of bed and saw that the comment count has risen from 53 to 975! Time to start reading! Thanks, everyone, for looking!

**Edit 5**: crustlessmist [figured out the plate number](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/c41xem0) and jwild98 made a [convincing graphic showing how that plate number matches up with the impression on my bumper](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r0e88/last_night_i_was_rammed_while_stopped_at_a_red/c41y1tb)! Following that amazing stuff, the following unexciting update: I attempted to leave a voicemail for the officer on my case, but the voicemail system was not letting me in for some reason, so I called non-emergency and talked to an officer there who offered to give the officer a message for me. I'm going to try later today to call again. With this being a smaller city and it being the weekend, I'm thinking I might not have luck until Monday, but I'll keep trying.

**Edit 6**: No updates from anyone yet. I figured I'd go ahead and put the part number from the pieces I found on the ground here. 

One of them says: 

* 52127-06050    ITW    \^UP
* TSOP-1G    &gt;PP+E/P-T15&lt;    R
* TOYOTA

and the other one says

* \^UP    52128-06050
* TSOP-1G   &gt;PP+E/P-T15&lt;
* TOYOTA

The ""ITW"" on the top one looks funny... like it was scratched in by hand. ~~I'm trying to get a picture up, but imgur is having problems.~~ [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/F9kS4.jpg)... had trouble focusing with the cellphone.

**Edit 7**: Update: The officer on the case called me and I gave him the information that I've gotten here. He told me that he is actually off this weekend, so he's going to run the tag information on Monday and see if he finds anything. So, I guess I'll have to wait until Monday to learn anything new. I did give the same information to my insurance company, so maybe they'll get back sooner? I don't know.

**Edit 8**: Update: The officer on the case works nights, I believe (I was hit at night), so I don't think he's going to run the plate number until tonight sometime. My insurance company wanted to wait until today to see what the police came up with (although I've let them know about all of the work you guys did, too). I haven't heard anything today. The officer said he would try the plate number and see if anything came back. Obviously, we all know something's going to come back because the report someone ran came back with a VIN number, and I've had some anonymous reports PM'ed to me that point that license back to a town that is only 8 miles away from here, so I'm confident that 5MRTNS is the guy. Now I just need to keep the officers and insurance agents on it. I'll report back once something more significant happens.

**Edit 9**: Didn't hear back from anyone Tuesday. Wanted to give the officer a chance to call me (I believe he works nights) and wanted Geico to get a chance to do their own thing and call me back. I called Geico and the office on my case today around 11am. Left a message with the officer telling him that I'm following up on the lookup he said he was doing, because there's a felon out there and I've been going to the doctor and my car doesn't work, so I'd like to get insurance rolling. I'm going to call again later this afternoon. I think I need to be annoying.

**Edit 10**: I've been calling. Haven't gotten a call back from the police yet, and I can't get the officer on the phone to speak with (only voicemail). Geico let me know that they got the guy's address from the plate number and sent him a letter telling him to contact them. I told them, ""He's the offender in a hit and run. What makes you think he'll call you?"" My case worker is currently trying to get permission to run a report cross referencing their entire database to see if the guy has been involved in other claims and who his insurance provider is. I feel like they're probably doing what they can.

I just left another voicemail for the officer and told him that Geico was able to get the guy's address from their database, so I would assume that he should have been able to as well and to please contact me to let me know what's going on (and gave him 3 different phone numbers he could reach me at). I'm going to keep calling and am considering the current advice of getting the local news involved.

**Edit 11**: I left a voicemail a few days ago with the Investigations Office informing them that I was not getting any calls back from the officer on my case and could someone please let me know what's going on. That night, a Sergeant called me at home and told me he would be leaving messages with the officer and the officer's training officer, letting them know that I need to be contacted. This morning, I finally got a call from the officer, letting me know that they found an address for the plate, but haven't been able to contact the person yet. He said he's hoping to be able to charge the person by this afternoon and that he'll let me know either this evening or tomorrow.

Possibly humorous sidenote: He started his message to me (I was at work and he called my house, yay online voicemail) with: ""I just wanted to shoot you a message..."" the first part of which caught me off guard. :-P

**Edit 12**: The officer called my house again a few minutes ago. He said he served papers to the guy and (according to my wife) said that ""the individual"" seemed like he was just going to plead guilty and get it handled (of course, speaking to a lawyer may change his mind). The officer said that I probably wouldn't be needed in court unless the guy went for a trial, in which case I'd be subpoenaed, but for now my insurance company should have enough to be able to pursue the guy's insurance. All in all it feels rather anti-climactic.","Last night I was rammed while stopped at a red light and then the guy took off, leaving me with a LOT of back pain and a significantly damaged car, but nobody to take the blame.

*An anonymous billionaire is privately funding this.  You will never meet them.  They are not filming or recording any aspect of this; they simply enjoy knowing they have this kind of power.*

Each day you are woken up by a man peeing on you.  This man has been hired by the billionaire to pee on you.  They are regularly checked by doctors to make sure they are healthy and infection-free.  Regardless, urine is sterile.  Stinky, but harmless.  

As soon as the pee hits your face (and oh yes, he'll aim for the face) you can jump out of bed and go to the shower.  While you are showering the man who pees on you will switch your mattress, put on new sheets and leave $300 in cash on your dining room table.  

The above situation will happen every single day for the rest of your life until one evening you decide you do not want to be peed on the next morning and cancel.  Then it can never start again.  Ever. 

A few conditions:

-You may have as much or as little interaction with the man who pees as you want

-The man who pees will act as an alarm clock/wake-up call.  You can tell him to begin peeing at 6:30am and that's exactly when he will start.
  
-If you share the bed with someone he will be aiming for you.  Spashback onto the sleeping partner is a possibility.

-If you go on vacation he travels as well.  He will typically stay in the hotel room next to yours.


**The question is:  How long would you let this go on?**


edit:  Apparently R.Kelly likes to pee on people 

edit:  Obligatory ""Holy crap! Frontpage?!"" 

edit:  Now the follow-up question ...  **For $300 a day, would you rather be the man who pees?**  
Same restrictions would apply (but obviously in reverse).  This means that whoever you pee on you are bound to.  If they travel, you travel.  You will have to live in their city (or at least a sensible commute).  You will have to wake up early for your alarm clock function  It will be you to picks up the new mattress the day before and disposes of the soiled one.  Roughly an hour or work a day for $300.  Is this preferable to being peed on given the mobility restrictions?  

edit:  To address a common question:  Barring a once-in-a-lifetime emergency(""My water broke!""), you must be peed on in the morning.  This means if you wake up a few moments before your alarm was to go off you must lay there until the first drop of piss hits you.  You can have a conversation with the man who pees if you like.  Or simply maintain the world's most awkward eye-contact.  

edit:  For any Jack Bauer's out there:  Even if you do not have a regular sleeping schedule you must choose a time in a 24 hour period to lay down in bed and allow pee to hit your face.  ",How long would you let someone pee on you for $300 a day? Details inside,9680

Really, thanks to all of you.. last night roughly at this time I was moping around after getting home from that 'date'. Now I have countless hilarious stories to read through while drinking and kind messages from you awesome bunch.. worth it!


Story-time (warning: wall of text)

So I've known this guy for almost a year now, not really good friends or anything, more of casual acquaintances (we have a bunch of common friends and see each other from time to time, parties etc). A couple of months ago he started messaging me, first on Facebook, then by text (he got my number from a friend, he didn't ask me for it) and most of the time I responded just to be polite. He's nice enough, but not really my type.. so when he started dropping hints about 'meeting up', I just turned him down and said I'm busy, or we'd just catch up the next time there's a gathering with our friends, that sort of thing..

Fast-forward to last week and he asked me out again, which IIRC is the 6th time in the past 2 months. I finally decided to at least give him a chance, cos hey what could go wrong anyway, and who knows what I'm missing and all that jazz.. Worst-case scenario it would be awkward, but we've talked more than a few times so I was thinking it can't be that bad and we could actually have a pleasant time.

Date night comes and we meet up in the city after work. We have dinner; nice, cutesy Japanese place.. conversation was okay.. I was certain at this point that it's really not going to take off, he really isn't my type.. but I was having a pleasant enough time and he was a total gentleman and not bad to talk to.

The bill comes, and I was going to suggest a quick coffee before heading home. However, he said that there's something he'd made an appointment for us for and we need to rush off to make it in time. I was a bit intrigued and excited; was it a movie, or a show, a play (he knows I'm into theater)? So we hurry off and he took me to a high-end luxury mall with an attached wing for offices.. we went up.. wait, this is an office lobby.. what the..

It was a fucking weight-loss center.

So he explains that he's part of this company (he works for them on a part-time basis as a distributor) and he wanted to introduce me to their products which would 'revolutionize' my lifestyle and make the healthier I've ever been in my entire life. (FYI I'm 5'5"" and 135lbs). I was totally stunned at this point so I was just nodding like an idiot the whole time we were walking inside. He then left me with his smarmy 'teammates', who proceeded to give me an orientation about their company and a run-through of their health supplements (when he got to the part where the weight-loss products are, the smarmiest one said, ""Oooh now this is what you've been waiting for, I saved the best for last!"")

I just sat through it because I knew that if I started to say something, I was definitely going to burst and make a spectacle of myself (there was a seminar ongoing and we were at a little table to the side). After I flat-out said that I'm not interested in any of the products and frankly don't believe that I need health supplements (I eat well and exercise regularly), they started on the 2nd phase: introducing me to the 'business' aspect of it. Basically, it was a networking model of business where you not only sell the products, you also recruit people to sell them and they would be under your 'team', and you get a commission for every sale they make. They rhapsodized about the wonders of the product, how easy it is to sell, and how much money I could be making because they could tell I have the right kind of 'personality' and 'network' for it. Registration was 'only' $1,000, and it was consumable in products.. which I could either use or sell to get my registration money back immediately.

I wish I could say I flipped the fucking table and screamed at them to fuck themselves with their health supplements and hope they overdose on their products, but no.. right after the 'talk' I just said I should head home since it was getting a bit late.

The guy actually messaged me to say that he had a good time and he hopes to see me again.. and that I would reconsider their products and the 'business opportunity'. 

I called some friends up and went out for drinks because fuck your health supplements that's why

TL;DR Went on a date, guy brought me to weight-loss seminar, tried to sell me $1,000 worth of weight-loss products, and then tried to recruit me to join their networking business.

DENNIS-System,2077,9006,13b4yo,2380,"This question actually came to me from Mass Effect (can't remember which game in the series, might've been 3).  There some dialogue about how universal policy didn't matter as much to humans because of their significantly shorter lifespans compared to other races (I am probably misquoting, but I believe that was the general sentiment).  This got me thinking about the following questions:

* If the average human lifespan was significantly longer (e.g. 200+ years), would our morals, philosophies, choices be different?

* What kind of effects would it have on our governments, economies, or religions?

I guess two different ways one can approach these questions:

* If humankind had evolved to such a long lifespan thousands to millions of years ago.
* If in the next decade, significant technology allowed for humans to live much longer.

Thoughts?  Comments?

Edit 1:  A good point was made on how the body should age along with the increased lifespan.  For the sake of the post, let's assume it's relative.  So for example, the amount you would age in one year currently would take three years instead.  Of course this is just one viewpoint.

blind-with-worry,525,1084,ak2b8,2337,"I posted [this here originally](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9prfk/so_i_stumbled_across_some_nsfw_pictures_of_my_kid/) and then [this update](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9sw9t/so_my_kid_sister_was_put_in_a_mental_hospital_by/) back in October.

Summary: I innocently stumbled across naked pictures of my little sister on the Internet. From advice I received here on Reddit I confronted her about them. I found out after spying on her that the issue was much larger than it first seemed. She ended being put into a mental hospital because of me and I hated myself for that.

Okay, so my little sister (""Julie"") was in the hospital for almost two months. During that time she refused to see me. My mom, my dad, even two uncles and one aunt? She saw them at visits. But she refused to see me.

I was convinced the entire time that the reason she didn't want to see me was that she hated me. I must have re-read my second post about this a hundred times, just to re-enforce my belief that I had done the right thing by telling our dad about the situation. Believe me, the comments in that second post really did sustain me. I've never loved Reddit so much as I have during some of the worst sleepless nights I've gone through, nights where I felt like the shittiest brother ever. Reading your assurances that I had done the right thing really helped me get along through this very difficult time.

We were told two weeks ago that she was scheduled to be released on the 21st of December. This had nothing to do with money or insurance (my parents were paying out of pocket for her stay there but cost was never an issue). Apparently she has adjusted well to her new medications and is in much better, more sober state of mind now. 

I was thrilled to learn she'd be home for Christmas. I dreaded seeing her only because I have not seen her since the ""intervention"" that led to her being hospitalized in the first place. I was so worried she hated me that I even told my mom, upon hearing the news of her release, that I would gladly crash at my friend's house for a while.

My mom's response? ""Are you crazy? She wants you to be the one to pick her up!""

...

Sorry, I still get teary-eyed when I remember that.

So it turns out that the reason my sister didn't want to see me that entire time (two months!) was that she was embarrassed. She didn't mind seeing our parents or our uncles and aunt but she just couldn't handle seeing me. She felt like she'd let me down or something.

I drove nearly 2.5 hours out to the hospital last Monday (only the second time I'd ever been there), alone, and greeted her in the reception area. She literally ran over and jumped into my arms when she saw me. I cried like a baby, Reddit, and I'm not embarrassed to admit as much.

We talked a ton during the drive home. She has a much firmer grasp on her condition, now, then she did before. Best of all, and Reddit was right about this, she does **not** hate me for ""turning her in"".

She's healthy. She's safe. She's on medications to deal with her Bipolar disorder. And she actually thanked me for intervening before she did something stupid, like meeting up with that one guy (aka ""Asshole"").

I worried so much, for so long, for nothing. My little sister still loves me. And I did do the right thing. Thank you, Reddit, for all of your thoughts and comments during this time. I've been feeling miserable for so long, because of all this, but your thoughtful comments and suggestions helped me from going into despair.

This is why I love this site. Thank you again.

**/edit** A few things. First, to all of you well-wishers, thank you so much for the kind words and good wishes. They mean so much to me you have no idea.

Second, to the anti-meds crowd? Get a job. Sure, meds are sometimes over-prescribed. I won't argue that. But my sister didn't have an ""episode"" or a ""temper tantrum"" that was misdiagnosed as Bipolar Type I Disorder. While I'm sure that happens sometimes, you are in absolutely no position to gauge what my sister was going through. You don't know her, but I do, and trust me the girl who was posting those long, crazy messages on those image boards? The girl who confronted me and threatened me with all kinds of crazy nonsense the day after I talked to her? The girl, in short, who was off her medications? That was **not** my sister. That was my sister in a manic episode. If you have to ask the what the difference is between a manic episode and typical teenage angst/temper, you've never seen one. I hope you never have to, too, because they are scary. Scary scary. 

Sorry, I didn't mean to go on a tirade about that. It's just... frustrating to read some of the holier-than-thou, ""you do realize Bipolar is the ADD of the 2000's, right?"" type of messages this post has garnered. So fucking annoying. Go give L. Ron Hubbard some money but STFU on this post, please.

Again I'm sorry. The vast majority of the responses here have been so supportive and uplifting, but the few trolls who managed to get a bunch of upmods for being contrarian did sort of piss me off.

Done being angry, Reddit. 

Oh, as for her long term care? She's going to be in IOP (Intensive Out Patient) for the foreseeable future. That means, starting in January, daily visits to a local clinic where she'll receive both group and individual therapy. She's also going to see the psychiatrist she took a huge liking to at the hospital once a month until she finds a new doctor to replace her. She's fine with all this, and is actually excited about it. She has this journal she keeps showing me that she writes in when she starts to feel ""unbalanced"". She says it's like her own private ""group therapy"" but she can't wait to be in the real thing again.

Our dad took away her computer but he set it up in the living room, right next to the television set, and she's free to use it whenever she wants. She has absolutely no privacy on it but she seems to be okay with that. 

I think the biggest test will be when she goes back to school. She lost an entire semester because of her hospitalization and she'll be needing to go to summer school to make up for it and while she says she's fine with that, I know it sort of bums her out. Plus, school is usually a ""trigger"" (so I've noticed) for her bad depressive and manic periods. But I really believe she's ready this time. I've never seen her so strong and resolved to handle her condition as she appears right now.

Well, that's it. This is most likely the last ever thing I type using this account. As I mentioned in my original post, I have a real Reddit account that I often use and I simply created this one for this particular issue. I am very glad that I did, too. 

Reddit came through for me in a big way. I hope that others out there who are in any kind of strange/heart-breaking/etc. type of situation look to this experience and find inspiration to share their own story, whatever it is. The trolls and the assholes try to grind us down but Reddit is good at fighting back. I so fucking love this place. I love you all... yes, even the trolls and the assholes.

Adieu, adieu from blind-with-worry.

**edit the last** Okay forgot to mention... as to the Asshole:

Believe me, like most of you, I want to go after this prick. I really do. I actually had a huge argument with my father about this about a month ago. When I calmed down, though, I realized that the legal advice he was getting was correct: fanning flames risks spreading fire. What my sister needs now, what our family needs now, is time to heal. Would it feel good to crush that motherfucker? Sure. Would it draw everything out, though? Definitely. That would not be a good thing. Sometimes what feels good is actually bad or at the very least can make a situation worse than it already is. 

Let me put it like this. Say I posted his Gmail username here. And Reddit went to town crushing him in all sorts of ways. So he decides, ""Heck, that bitch ratted on me. I'll show her!"" and he ends up reposting the obviously self-shot images to every site and image-board, maybe even here on Reddit. Not only would that humiliate her but it might have legal ramifications for her.

What's done is done. Trust me, I know it's a bitter pill to swallow. I'd like nothing better than to meet this asshole someday and do things to him that would get me 20-life in a state prison. But when you think on it logically, what good does that do for my sister? For myself? For my family?

As tempting as it is to send his wife an anonymous letter, too, there's just one problem... I don't have his address. 

In short, I'm just going to have to leave my revenge fantasies to my imagination and Tarantino movies. This asshole/douchebag will likely slit his own throat one of these days anyway. In the meantime, no fanning the flames. Doing so spreads fires.

All of them seemed really excited about what they just witnessed, and honestly--I was really stunned that 8 of us had ~~independently~~ decided to pay for the car behind us.  

After the madness that was Black Friday, and the horrible behavior that usually accompanies it, I just couldn't help but be amazed at what I had inadvertently been a part of. I've paid for people's meals/groceries/coffee before (especially around the holidays), but I've never been on the receiving end of a ""pay it forward"" chain or somebody that helped keep one going! **I know the 8 of us didn't solve any major world crisis this morning or *really* help anyone out, and the woman behind me may not have actually liked having her drinks purchased by me**--but the semi-anonymous gesture of buying your neighbor's coffee on a cold Sunday morning just...moved me. I just couldn't stop smiling. It was as if kindness was contagious this morning! :D And just thinking about a possible ""pandemic"" of kindness leaves me breathless. 

I'm sure this isn't even the most impressive ""pay it forward"" scenario that people have encountered, so I want to hear your tales! Maybe some of us have all been a part of the same chain of kindness. :)

*Most common drive-thru locations for kindness-chains*: Starbucks, Tim Hortons, McDonalds, and Taco Bell. 

**Edit 4:** I just wanted to do a better explanation for how this entire thing occurred, for those of you who've never seen a drive thru cafe. So, in a typical American drive thru you will pull into a driveway that wraps around your favorite cafe/restaurant. Shortly after pulling into the driveway you will roll up to a [giant menu with a microphone](http://blogs.kudl.com/files/2010/03/starbucks-drive-thru.jpg) and this is where we place our orders. Then you pull up to [the window to pay and pick up your beverage/treats](http://pulse995.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/drive-thru.jpg). Once you or any other car pulls away from the giant menu, the barista/window worker has the orders totaled up. So, if you notice [a long line of cars behind you](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JI3v7GDgSTU/TUwNVt1ghDI/AAAAAAAABKU/CopWCapfZZs/s1600/Starbucks_Drive_Thru_012408_fs.jpg) and you'd like to do something nice for the person behind you, you can tell the worker that you'd like to buy the other driver's order too. No guess work is needed about the amount since it's already been totaled. Hope that clears some stuff up!


**Edit 5:** While I'm still planning on updating the above list to help folks navigate around this incredible thread, this will likely be my last ramble. First, thank you for sharing your wonderful stories! I enjoyed reading all of them. :) Second, thank you to the anonymous gifters for the reddit gold!

Now, I know several of you are still critical of this kind of behavior (and I definitely apologize if you've ever been a recipient of one of my errant coffeecup gifts!) and just don't get ""the point"" of all this. I think the biggest concern is that this type of act conflates helping *people in need* with giving a superfluous gift to someone who doesn't need it. I never wanted there to be a weighing of the two types of acts, especially since one is obviously more significant than the other, but I don't believe the latter is totally inconsequential... I mean, one can never be 100% sure that the person standing next to you isn't suffering somehow. That they aren't trying to cope with a terrible loss or struggling through a horrible bought of depression. But still, a coffee cup doesn't do any substantial good for those folks either, but it may just brighten their day a bit, which I think does everyone a bit of good. At the worst, it was a free annoyance. 

What ultimately makes this experience (and others like it) so beautiful for me, and why I think so many others love the concept, is that no one was harmed, nothing was solicited, and the only thing that connected a bunch of strangers for a brief moment in time, was a piece of shared kindness in the form of a cup of coffee. :) These moments are also poignant reminders of just how important it is to give to those who are struggling! If a pre-paid cup of coffee, toll charge, carwash, bar tab, or meal can make such an impact on so many of us, I can't imagine how life changing having someone providing for your actual needs can be. 

Thank you again for these wonderful stories, and I'll still try to add new/hidden ones to my list above. Take care Reddit!

Deafy,2689,7625,ttya2,2315,"I've been deaf since birth and there are lot of ""sound words"" that I read a lot but don't really know what they mean, and dictionary definitions often just refer to other sound words. It's never mattered to me before, but now I'm trying to write a novel with one hearing narrator and every time I use a sound word I'm not sure I'm using it right. I posted awhile ago to /r/writing about ""scream"", ""shout"" and ""yell"" but I've generated a list of questions so I thought I should take it to a larger audience.

* People crying in sadness vs crying out in anger, I know there's some gray area in between where they can be used interchangeably, it's hard to get
* ""shriek"" and ""ream"" are both words that seem to imply emotion more than any specific sound. Is that right?
* Can any sound be described as ""piercing"" if it's loud and annoying? Like thunder for example.
* apparently people use ""ejaculates"" as a dialogue tag?!?! It seems to mean ""to say suddenly or without warning"" (or does it just mean ""interrupt""?), but the more normal use of ""ejaculates"" doesn't imply that at all. I don't know if this is a deaf thing or maybe I'm just dense. Does sound have something to do with this?
* What does ""jive"" mean? Does ""he speaks jive"" and ""he speaks AAVE"" and ""he speaks Ebonics"" all refer to the same thing? I was raised by black parents but I can't understand any dialogue written in black dialect. I know not all black people talk like that but is there a way to mark that in a novel? Do you know of a webpage that would tell me how to translate dialogue into dialect like that? 
* Are ""stammer"" and ""stutter"" synonymous?
* What about ""chat""? Dictionary says ""to speak informally"" but I feel like it implies something I'm not getting. Is it speaking fast? Can you use ""chat"" as a dialogue tag? (like ""What are you doing tonight?' he chatted""), I don't think I've seen it but the dictionary makes it sound like you can.
* ""mumbling"" sometimes implies apathy but other times hostility. Is that right? That's weird because it connotes opposites. What does it sound like? Is it synonymous with whispering?
* I know cats ""meow"", dogs ""bark"" and cows ""moo"" but what does these words mean when used in other contexts? Sometimes other animals are described with the same sounds, like I think foxes bark which makes sense because they're like dogs but I think I've heard dolphins described as barking too. That's weird. Does a dolphin and a dog really make the same sound?
* ""howl"" is just for animals except ""howling in pain"" right? Is a dog's howl just a long bark or does it sound different? Do different dogs sound different? What if they're the same size and breed?
""Chirp"" and ""squawk"" were originally animal noises but are now used in other contexts right? I don't know what they mean really. Birds and mice do them both interchangeably, that's as specific as I know. And I think bats chirp but never squawk? Is there a chart somewhere showing which animals make which sounds? Like, can a weasel growl? What about bears? Bears look like the kind of animal that should ""growl"" but I feel like I've never seen that written and Google doesn't show a lot of usage.
* Do all doors creak? Can all doors be slammed? Windows? Does ""slam"" always imply loudness? Do you always slam doors when you're mad? Do deaf people slam doors when they're mad? (I don't think so, but if it's just a function of being mad I might do it and not notice because I'm mad). People say ""he slammed that beer"" to mean chugged, that's silent right? Or does it mean ""gurgle"" in that sense?
* ""Gurgle"" is another hard one. And ""gargle"", that means something different right?
* ""Ring"", like ""ringtone"" is hard to get. What else ""rings""? Cell phones sound different from landlines, right? People sometimes describe them as ""chirping""?
* Dictionary says ""click"" is ""A short, sharp sound as of a switch being operated or of two hard objects coming quickly into contact."" but I feel like I've seen it in other uses, it's hard to remember exactly what I'm thinking of. But could I use it to describe cymbals, pennies or pencils hitting each other?
* If a voice is described as ""tender"", what does that mean?
* ""moan"" can be painful or sexy right? Anything else? Is it possible to moan joyously or humorously?
* ""cooing"" What is that? Is there a difference between a woman ""moaning sexy"" and ""cooing sexy""?
* Apparently it's possible to ""whisper"" loudly and ""shout"" softly? WTF!?

So I take what they give me, get their change, close the cash drawer, turn to hand their change to them and see she is holding 2 quarters to give to me. She has an angry look on her face and I said ""Oh I'm sorry, you told me you didn't have the change."" The thing that baffles me is that while I was getting her change, she could have spoke up and said ""Hey wait I have it!"" But she chose not to. So in anger she turns to her husband and says ""What does she have? Fucking downs syndrome?"" They both start laughing and I'm standing there shocked that something as terrible as that would come out of someones mouth. And that's when the customer behind them said ""What are you?

**EDIT:** Holy crap I was not expecting this big of a response. These stories are awesome and disheartening all at the same time.


**EDIT 2:** Thank you to who ever gave me the 3 months reddit gold. Was not expecting that :D

**EDIT 3:** I promised to post some stories from working at McDonalds, so here it goes.

I was working the afternoon shift and this lady comes to register asking for some grilled snack wraps and some other things. I ring her up, get her food to her, and she's on her way. 5 minutes later she comes back storming in claiming I gave her a crispy snack wrap not grilled. So I said to her ""Oh I'm sorry let me get you a new one."" I check the wrap, and it's grilled! She's getting pissed over nothing. I explain to her how I did give her the right one. She insists I didn't so I explain to her how crispy is breaded and the chicken I gave her was not breaded. She get's really loud and start's screaming ""I have my fucking kids waiting in the car, THEY ARE ONLY 3, I don't have time for this bullshit!"" And that's when she throws the snack wrap at me! My manager tells her to get the fuck out as I'm standing there crying covered in snack wrap.

This other story is actually a story about my manager. During the interview at McDonalds, I told them that I would need 2 weeks off in 2 months because I was going to Germany. They said that was okay. So when I was hired, I put the request off in the folder. I also reminded them 2 weeks before I was leaving. So I get back from Germany, and my first day home I get a phone call and it's my manager bitching how she's been trying to contact me for a week because I haven't been showing up. I told her I was away for 2 weeks and that I told her when she first hired me. She started cursing saying how I never told her and how I needed to get my ass to work or I'm fired. I told her ""Go check the fucking request off folder, my paper is in there. Go fuck yourself I'm never coming back."" and I hung up. In retrospect, I could have handled the situation better, but I was jet lagged and cranky from an 8 hour flight.

We have called the local environmental agencies, but they will only be here tomorrow.

The poor little thing does not seem to be doing well.

Is there anything we can do until tomorrow?

The kids just named him Gunter  :-)

I am in the extreme south of the state of Bahia in Brazil. It is very rare to find penguins this up north, but this week alone, 3 washed up on the beaches. This is the first one that is alive. 

We are in a very small town, far away from any major cities, so there are no zoos or vets who can help around here. The people we called were not much help (it was the end of the day and the specialists were not in) but we were told that they will come by tomorrow. 

I would just like to know if any biologist here knew if there is anything we can do to help keep him comfortable (and alive) until tomorrow. Anything we can give it to eat? Where would he be most comfortable - in a cool place or not? He is not getting up, but he is moving a lot more now.

[Video of Gunter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snTO2dKcgmU) when we found him

----------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 2 - Gunter made it through the night!!! He is resting in his towels, and was following me around curiously with his little head when I walked in to check on him. He is sooooooo cute!! We checked him for dehydration and to see if his temperature was ok (as per instruction of a biologist specialized in penguins) and he seemed just fine). He drank and also ate a little. I called the people who will come and pick him up, and the good news is that instead of keeping him the small center until they had more animals for the trip, they will try to drive him off today to the really big center 4 hours north!!  I will take more pics before Gunter goes, and ask the people in the center to keep me updated. Thank you all for the help!!! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 3 - Gunter does not seem to be doing well at all!! :-(   :-(  He is not responding to when we walk in, and when we touch him, he does not move his head much. He is sleeping and his eyes are closed, but he is breathing heavily. I think he is dying... :-(   :-(   ARGH!! And they called saying they won't be here until the afternoon. It will be too late!! I did not want him to die here  :-( 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 4- Well, maybe he was just sleeping really deeply? Because he woke up and ate TWO live little fish!! He was not interested with the dead stuff yesterday, but he gobbled up the live fish! He also had water!  I am afraid to hope, but how can I help it? Fight Gunter!!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT 5- They called again, and should be here soon.

Guys do generally want it more then women ? It doesn't bother me, and we've been together for about a year and a half, and I have Waxed the Winnebago before but she has NEVER caught me. This is actually the first time I've ever been caught.

*I understand she's overreacting, which is why I am going to talk to her, but you guys need to understand as well that it's someone I care about.

Also, I'm not apologizing for making the cyclops fight a 5 headed monster, I'm apologizing to her for posting it here. ( Even though logically to you guys it's a story, you don't know us so it shouldn't really bother her because it's not like I'm going to my moms house....Pun intended.*

Also, this conversation just has never really been brought up personally between us. I never thought about bringing it up because I've seen it normal since i was 10 years old. And she just never brought it up either.
I am 25 years old, she is 23.

**EDIT 7** I have not read all of the comments posted, to many for me to keep track of, but I know It pisses me off when I read a story that is happening, and the author doesn't update it, so i'll do my best to update it and keep it private at the same time. So, I go home, unlock the door, try to open it. The little chain is on the door. Her mom comes towards the door and says hi with the stupidest, smuggiest look I have ever seen in my life. ( Her mom never liked me to begin with ) and says ""that's disgusting"" straight away, and walks away from the door, leaving the fucking chain in. I'm not the kind of guy to lose my temper, specially when it's regarding women, but me and her mom have never had good blood between us so the way she said it pushed me over the edge I guess.... Well anyways, she walks away and I kick the door and break the stupid little chain and I told her in a louder then average voice that it wasn't her fucking business, and I needed to talk to her daughter in private... ( to clear things up between us ), sooooooooo she gets her bag, calls Ashley over and she calls me an aggressive sex deviant. Then she tells Ashley "" we're leaving "" and I look at Ashley, then ask her if she's actually going to let things get to this point over nothing, after everything we've been through. She say's ""you didn't have to kick the door open like that Dom, you need some time to calm down "" and they leave.


And that's where I now draw the line. I'm done with this, you, and your mom Ashley. I've done nothing but be nice to you, treat you with respect, ALWAYS go out of my way to make, and keep you happy. You should honestly let her read this thread so she can realize what a fucking CUNT she is. Tell her to stop using the fucking tanning bed because her skin looks like the leather off of an Alligators asshole. I kicked the door open because it's MY FUCKING APARTMENT. Honestly I'm glad you caught me making my baldie puke, because if it wasn't for this I wouldn't have realized how much like your mother you are. My phone is OFF, don't call, or text me. I'm going to SMOKE AND MASTURBATE ALL NIGHT.

**PRE-8 Update**
For all of you who say this is fake, I would like to help you guys out. Tomorrow morning I'll take pictures of the door incident and post them here as update 8. I still have my phone off, so no updates on her. I haven't even touched gtalk or msn either. Now, I would also like to say that if she does message me tomorrow, I am definately going to consider what she has to say, because we have been together for a long time and I have never seen this side of her, shes still someone special to me. As mad as I may get those kinds of things don't change overnight. But don't get me wrong, if she tries to defend any of her actions I will, as you guys say, masturbate on her things, while looking directly in her eyes,** like a boss**. (joke)
Maybe she will realize it was an extreme over reaction and come to her senses. If not honestly the thought of being single is not that bad of a thing. 

Good night for now redditors, and reddettes. Thanks for everything, if this post is still going in the morning i'll make sure to post an update on the situation. If it gets boring i'll just leave it be.


**Update 8, and probably the last update**

I did as planned last night, even though I felt like shit about it. It hit me that I could seriously lose someone I care about, over something miniscule.. It's just eating at me, even though YES I know she's at fault, she may be immature, she's over reacting, she's socially uneducated about the general populations ( including my own ) beliefs in certain things, but she's also an amazing talker/listener, fun person to be around, she's smart, witty , and i'll stop now before this gets too stupid.

So yea, I turned my phone on, and there were 5 messages. The first two we're ""we need to talk please call me ""
the other two were ""call me now Dom I'm serious "" and the last one stated that if I can so easily turn my phone off and vent about our relationship on reddit instead of talking to her then we need to take some time apart to re-evaluate things. ( Now I know most of you will say ""See, you shouldn't have been immature and turned your phone off"" but the truth is, had I not done that I would have said things I probably would have regretted, she may have as well in return. I wanted to wait for me to calm down before talking to her.... evidently that was a mistake, and now she will be coming over on Saturday to pick up some of her stuff with her mother. Maybe it's for the best, and maybe you guys are right and I did dodge an emotional trainwreck of a bullet ( which I still find hard to believe due to how our relationship was prior to this incident )  but it still feels like SHIT. It feels like theres a blender inside of me. This is it Reddit, you have just witnessed a relationship go to hell due to an overly obsesed piece of shit mother who will ruin her daughters life if she doesn't realize what she's doing.
I feel helpless right now... I'm still kind of like ""wtf... ?""
I'm tempted to publicize her mothers contact information so that you guys can have a go at it. But after reading some of the comments left here, I will indeed take the high road and let it be. No work today, and i'm single.. So I'll just smoke away my *stupidity* of feeling bad and play the 2 shitty games I have on steam ( CS and CS:S I think ? ) :/.  IF any of you redditors would like to join me in steam, don't hesitate to add me if you don't mind playing shitty games to pass time, my steam account name is; Fjufju


And I bid you farewell, from this post at least. I'll always be amongst you redditors upvoting and spending 69 sleep hours a week on reddit. Thanks for everything, the insightful posts, the comments that made me laugh, and even the harsh-reality posters. I guess I need to *open my eyes.*

One last time, for reddit.

Everything reposted.

---------

So I may just be paranoid.... but I came home last night after being gone all day to find my exterior garage door keypad was left open, my remote then would not close the garage door, the garage door remote when I clicked the close button would just flash the light on the garage door opener three times. The door did close when I pressed the wall opener.

Now this alone is not that big of a deal, weird stuff happens with electronics. But then my mind started racing with all of these things that have happened over the years so I started thinking about those things and went to investigate around my Town House. 

I present to you my list of evidence to you, convince me I am crazy or tell me I’m not. Regardless give me some ideas on how to test if there is someone in the attic.

* I have never been in the attic, I tried to open it once.... I had a step ladder and I could not get enough leverage to lift it up, it seemed stuck so I just put the box in my extra bedroom.
* I investigated the attic entrance last night and noticed 3 scuff marks on the wall, a finger print on the door below the attic entrance (There was also a fair amount of dust that had dropped from the attic entrance onto the door that is where the fingerprints were.
* I have never noticed anything out or place or food or drink missing.
* The only exception to this is the door knob on the door that goes out to the garage. I noticed on day that it was coming apart. I had assumed that I had simply slammed the door while leaving and broke it myself but I have no recollection of anything like that. Yesterday when I come home the door handle looked more broken. I rarely lock this door. 
* Twice that I can think of I have heard a loud noise upstairs, when this happened I slowly found a big knife and went upstairs to look around, each time something had fallen down, a closet door once, and some boxes the other time
* I live alone, and work crazy hours. Often 7 AM to 10 PM and another 8 hour days on weekends (I love my job) So there is plenty of time for a person to exit and enter the house.
* I never did a home inspection when I purchased the property because of time constraints with a tax credit. As such since the last person moved out the attic has never be accessed....
* Speaking of the previous resident. The property was a short sale..... and was being rented to someone for $100 a month. When I went on a tour of the house the house simply had a sleeping bag and some clothes in a bedroom.........
* I have lived here for 1.5 years.

Holy shit I think my have just convinced myself, but I feel crazy calling the cops cause all of the evidence can be explained in one way or another. But there is no way in hell I am knocking on the attic door. What can I do to prove someone is in my attic?

I just ordered a Wireless IP camera system but it will not be here to Tuesday.

**Update #1 Just called the Cops, So yeah....... This is either going to make me feel like an idiot or make me freak out cause someone is living in my attic**

**Update #2 Well this sucks. I only own a step ladder. As such the Deputies listened to my story, stood on the step ladder and could not climb into the attic....... Then they told me its probably nothing and suggested I replace the locks, reset the garage keypad entry, and put tape on the attic door or nail it shut.**

**So...... I guess I am where I started........ but feeling more like an idiot. The deputies did appear to understand my concern that was nice.**

**Now to tape the shit out of that door, close the door the bedroom, and build a fort of boxes in front of the door. And I guess I am borrowing a ladder from work tomorrow.**


* **Update #3 1:19 AM ----- I finally went back up stairs, taped the door, closed the door to the room where the attic entrance is, taped that door, and positioned a bunch of heavy stuff that will fall if they open it. I am not trying to trap the person in, I just want to know if they left. I also setup a USB webcam on my computer downstairs that will record to a online location if it detects movement. I also deactivated the keypad on the garage door. I am now going to my workplace, I will be returning after work, with a ladder and coworker with a handgun, and a tripod with a videocamera and a led strip to provide lighting.**

* **Update #4 2:07 AM ----- I am now at work, in my locked office, with the door looked and the building security system on and honestly kinda still freaked out about this whole thing. I'm going to try and get some sleep......... **


* ** Update #5 12:07 PM ----- I am at work right now, but since so many people are asking for an update..... I got here at work and sat in my office locked with the security system on and I was honestly still freaked out and could not sleep. I took that time to get a tripod setup with a flashlight and video camera so I can look up there without having to put myself in much danger. I am going home early today so expect the next update to be around 6 PM CST. **

* ** Update #6 5:33 PM ---- Going upstairs to check this out.

-------------------
Update #7 6:12 PM CST (Sorry for not including this before). I headed up stairs with a ladder and camera attached to a tripod and light attached. I was honestly too embarrassed to ask a co-worker to come and help me look so I took the advice of my fellow Redditor's and I manned up. I went up stairs and used the ladder to move the hatch, and then I used the camera to look up there without having to stick my head up there. **And....... There was nothing** I climbed up the ladder and had to stand on the 2nd to the top rung to see over the ledge(I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall).......... **And there was nothing.**

So end of the story is there is no one in my attic. Would I have done anything different if I could redo this entire experience? YES.

I tell people all of the time to stop letting fear hold you back and cause you to be inactive. So why did I not just act? Call the cops earlier? Get a ladder sooner? Find a Camera? Do something but give in to my fear........

Thank you Reddit for your jokes, your distractions, your honest advice, and your motivational rudeness. I think in some way, shape, or form I needed all of it. As my Thank You to each one of you I promise to read each and every comment and take them to heart, but even more so I promise to be a man of action, not inaction.

exatorp,4729,6011,145gae,2288,"Years back I used to visit a website where people would occasionally post little small fiction pieces. Short stories, or poetry or even songs, even though that wasn't the purpose of the site.

This one kid of seventeen would post these comedy zombie stories, and while the melodramatic horseshit posted by prominent users would have endless comments of adulation and love, this kids stories went unnoticed except by me. I would always post a little comment to let him know someone appreciated it. 
Others started commenting in time, but he would always send me a PM letting me know he posted one, and thanks for reading when no one else did.

In time I began to get busy with life. I found a job I hated but paid exceptionally well. More I worked, more I earned. I also met my now wife. I stopped commenting. 

I still got the PMs, but generally either ignored them, or replied with a thanks for letting me know. Read the ones I missed soon. 

One day I log on to the site after about a two week absence. In my inbox is a message from the kid that's unusually plaintive. Asking if please could I please read the latest story, as it might be his last and he'd appreciate the feedback, and if he didn't see me, thanks for reading it meant a lot to him. I ignored it, and didn't log back on for another good while. 

Eventually I log in one weekend, and think fuck it, ill read and stop being a dick. So I read them all and enjoy them immensely (they were genuinely good). So I PM the kid, letting them know how good they are, and keep writing. I don't hear back. 

Couple days go by, and I see someone he spoke to on the site chatroom and ask if anyone's seen the kid. There's one of those chatroom pauses where it goes from lines and lines of new text to stop. I get a private chat pop up with a Link to a post. I read through and its a post by the kids mum on his account saying he passed away a few days ago in his sleep after succumbing to cancer. I suddenly remember a while back he posted saying that his cancer had returned, but he was doing okay, but at that point he hadn't posted any stories, and he was just another username to me.

I felt shit. I still feel shit. I still don't watch zombie things because it reminds me of how if I'd have spared an hour I'd have probably made one of that kids last days.

This happened not even a half hour ago, as I'm typing this from an airport terminal with my heart still pounding and a grin on my face. Before I passed through the checking I decided to take a bathroom break. Number two. Inside the stall there was a distinct lack of hooks so I instead draped my jacket over the door and thought nothing of it. Now, I was just wiping up when I *felt* somebody enter the bathroom. Then I heard a pair of feet walk in front of my stall. Then I saw someone peek under the door. My legs snapped closed but the face was gone as soon as it was there. Then my jacket was gone as well. The man had pulled it from the door. Now, had it just been my jacket, I might have cursed the guy to seven hells, finished my shit and reported the offense. But my boarding ticket was in the pocket. This changed the game completely. Pants still around my ankles, was up in a second and shouldering the door open in even less time. The door caught the thief on either the back of the legs or the ass, no matter which one, he stumbled into the sink. I followed suit and caught him around the neck with one arm, the other reaching over his shoulder to snatch at my jacket. He was wearing gym shorts. I was wearing no shorts. My dick was flopped against the back of his leg. We seemed to both realize this at the same time, but I reacted first. Taking a gamble that could have resulted in myself using the female restroom from that point on, I neither retreated nor adjusted, instead squashing myself against the guy all the more and, mouth very close to his ear, began shouting **""YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS.""** over and over again. He choked out the bastard child of ""what the fuck"" and ""jesus christ"", cast my jacket upon the floor and tried to shake me off. His hostage free from harm, I allowed him to do so and he ran out. I managed to retain my decency before anyone else came in and, half an hour later, here I am.

[deleted],4642,9316,n9zki,2277,"Passengers on a plane are waiting for the flight to leave. The entrance opens, and two men walk up the aisle, dressed in pilot uniforms. Both are wearing dark glasses. One is using a seeing-eye dog, and the other is tapping his way up the aisle with a cane.

Nervous laughter spreads through the cabin, but the men enter the cockpit, the door closes, and the engines start.

The passengers begin glancing nervously, searching for some sign that this is just a little practical joke. None is forthcoming. The plane moves faster and faster down the runway, and people at the windows realize that they're headed straight for the water at the edge of the airport.

As it begins to look as though the plane will never take off, that it will plow into the water, screams of panic fill the cabin. But at that moment, the plane lifts smoothly into the air.

Up in the cockpit, the co-pilot turns to the pilot and says, ""You know, Bob, one of these days, they're going to scream too late, and we're all gonna die.""

Sesame Street debuted 42 years ago today.  But like most other TV shows, we had a test pilot.  We created it in the summer of 1969, just a few months before the first episode aired.  The actor who played Gordon on the show, pictured on the above-linked page (or if you that page goes down, [here's an imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/Ov6vr.png), was replaced by an actor named Matt Robinson (who, by the way, is Holly Robinson Peete's father).

Two years ago, we put together a huge anthology of our then-40 year history... and realized that we do not know who played Gordon in the test pilot.  We've asked everyone we could think of -- actors, actresses, and puppeteers who have been on the show since its inception; Sesame Workshop's founder, Joan Ganz Cooney; and of course, dug through seemingly endless boxes of documents and photos.  

Any clue would be great, even if it's seemingly esoteric or mundane. You can email it to us at wheresgordon@sesame.org, drop me a message here, or if it doesn't involve someone's personal info, leave it in a comment.

Oh, and one other thing: [Here's a clip of our mystery Gordon from that test pilot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHiEvVK5D-0).

Lope31,2640,9185,jw513,2270,"I definitely would. Right now I find I'm constantly defending myself when people ask why I download all my shows. I personally do it for the convenience of being able to watch them at my leisure.

As a consumer, I would happily download a torrent straight from the broadcasting company's site since I know it would be coming from a good source, that it would be high quality and would be helping them pay their bills. 

Advertisements make the entertainment industry go round, I'm not oblivious to that. I'll happily be pitched to if the companies are willing to meet me and my lifestyle halfway. Chances are, if I'm vegged out on a couch watching a show, most of the time I'm not even going to fastforward through the commercials either. They simply just aren't a big deal to me.

The question is, would everybody else download torrents with ads in them for ""the good of it"" when there would inevitably be alternative options WITHOUT ads?

EDIT: For what it's worth, I am in Canada too. With Bell I pay $55 for 65 GB. I'm not sure how that ranks against American downloaders, but it's not the only way Canadians get the raw end of the deal with major broadcasting companies. Most of the streaming sites aren't available in Canada, not Hulu, not NBC, etc. If a Canadian wants to stream a show legitimately they'll have to do so through a Canadian syndicate (like Global TV, in a lot of cases). The stupidity doesn't stop there, though. I, getting excited for the TV season, tried to watch a preview of NBC's Fall lineup from NBC.com but couldn't because I was geographically restricted.

I sold my PSP and some other things so I can afford it.

So there we were at the dinner table opening presents. She opened mine and has this grim look at her face.
""This is it? I thought you'd buy me a brand new one""

""You know I can't afford it. It's the best I can do.""

""I want a brand new one, not this. This sucks! Worst present ever!""

She then shoved the laptop and box across the table and fell down the floor.

I picked it up, and walked out. My cousin tried to stop me, I just said ""I would never give her anything again.""

She even had the nerve to call back and asked for the laptop. Apparently her parents punished her for her behavior and she will now have to buy her own things. No hand-outs or gifts. 

My friend bought it as a favor. He helped me pick it out, and knows how much I bought for it. The profit was only $10(roughly)

I wrote a message, is this okay to send? I decided I don't want to come off as bitter or angry. But I don't want him to still have hope of some kind of hallmark movie ending either.

Dear Jack,

I am 24 years old. I am not the little boy who cried when you left. I am a man, with a son and daughter of my own. I've never spent more than a weekend away from them. I am a father and a damned good one. I don't need you anymore.

Once, I needed you. When my mom died, I really could have used a dad. I could have used anybody. When she died, there wasn't even anybody there. No one cared about us. I spent three days in that apartment, eating toast and just waiting for her to wake up. 

And then they called you. Because you were my dad. You were twenty three, young, but not so young really. If you had came and gotten me, you would have had a son. I would have loved you forever. 

But you didn't. So I went to a bunch of people who didn't love me, but liked the check they got with me. It didn't make them treat me well. I have burn marks on my arm and I still can't spend time in closed in dark spaces after being shut in closets. An afternoon is a long time when you can't count. 

I didn't count on anybody. I used to pray, the way mom did with me when I was little. But after praying for someone to come and rescue me, long enough, hiding under my bed and praying that my foster dad wouldn't come in and would leave me alone for just one night. Just one night. I stopped believing in most things.

I lived in seven different homes from 4-16. And even the decent ones, I was never family. I didn't have real birthdays or christmases. I wasn't allowed to go in the fridge and just get food when I Was hungry.

When I was 16 me and my foster dad got in a fight over a ham sandwich. ""Boy, what are you doing in our things?"". And so, I left. Sixteen, with nobody to call, and 40 bucks. I just walked away with a backpack. Anything could've happened to me.

But I made it. I'm a man now. And I don't need you. I don't want you to feel bad. I just want you to know why I can't be your son. I'm 24 and have never been any one's son. I don't know how. And I just don't have it in me.

So, the true dates we were on Ngesebus was the 28th and 29th of September.

See, we made another amphibious assualt from Peleliu to Ngesebus to neutralize that island, as well.  After we handed off the rest of the island to the army, there was a film crew right on the beach filming us getting into the amtracs, on our way back to more fighting on Peleliu.

When Seymour Levy and I saw the film crew, we broke rank for about a minute and started cutting up for the camera.  The dance?  It was called ""Truckin'"" in those days.  It was probably the last ""fun"" moment we had before losing it all forever.

I think the film exists because someone claims to have seen it a long time ago.

At any rate, the film would be worth a lot to me, to see myself again at 20 years old with a very good pal of mine.  I've looked at the Critical Past and various other internets, but I have not found it.

This would be a **friendly** place to ask questions, when Google and Wikipedia still don't make it clear. A place to ask questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored. While r/askreddit sometimes has submissions like this, the VAST majority of the subs there are more in the vein of asking for advice [like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j1rsq/i_just_found_this_piece_of_artwork_sitting_on_top/) or questions that are rhetorical in nature [like this one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j25pj/soare_we_over_google/) I want a place specifically for asking the community questions about current events or other topics you'd usually be afraid to ask.

A great example of a question here would be: ""Can someone explain the deal with the debt ceiling?"" A lot of us may have heard a lot about it in recent news, and despite being fairly well-educated, might not really understand the basic concept. Here's a place to get an answer -- OR, show off your knowledge! 

The number one rule here would be simple: Respect. As a submitter (asker), you need to respect the subreddit by being honest and asking good questions. While there are no ""dumb"" questions here, please don't waste the space by asking questions that are clearly rhetorical in nature. As a replier (answerer), please remember that no matter how simple the question may seem to YOU, the spirit of this subreddit is for people to come here without fear of being condescended to (despite the catchy name of the subreddit.) All parties should politely contribute to the discussion.

All science-related questions would be kindly directed to the awesome folks at r/askscience (from whom I got the inspiration for this idea.)

I really think this could be a great place that would enrich our conversations on Reddit as a whole -- and, possibly even our own personal lives as well. This can be an opportunity to really expand your knowledge so that you can have more enriching discussions with the people in your life. That's the whole idea behind r/explainlikeimfive.

I'd love to hear feedback, thoughts, and suggestions -- and of course if anyone would like to help me moderate, that would be awesome. Thanks for checking it out!

**EDIT** Wow, thanks for the great response! I'm grateful for all the terrific feedback, and the couple of folks who've offered to help moderate -- we'll need you! ModMail me over at the new subreddit to let me know if you're interested.

As per your suggestions, I'll be adding a couple more rules for the sub:

**No Politics in your answers.**  DISCUSSION of politics is fine, but the blatant advancement of your political agenda (whatever it may be) is not for r/explainlikeimfive. Any such posts will be STRICTLY filtered. Take it to r/politics, please.

**No bias.** Like the above, there's no real place for this here. This includes religious bias, gender bias, or any other kind of personal bias that detracts from the sole purpose of this subreddit - to spread basic knowledge. These responses will be filtered also.

**Please, no blatant speculation.** It's okay not to be the world's foremost expert on a subject, but please, if you have absolutely no knowledge on the question at hand, please don't guess. 

**The above rules will apply to question-askers, too!**


**Submissions should be tagged something in the subreddit such as (LI5), so we'll know exactly what kind of post we're looking at.**

I'll be adding more of your suggestions as they roll in. In the meantime, if you do think this is a good idea, please subscribe and maybe fire off a submission if you feel so inclined.

Later on when I started driving and hanging out with friends he would have me call in by Midnight.  I would always hit the phone 15 minutes early (so I could have time to be home by midnight if he didn't answer) and he'd always extend my curfew to 2am.

irishintexas,1693,6144,12fy6j,2206,"So I moved to the U.S a few days ago. We were originally supposed to go from Dublin to London, then on to LA where we'd spend two days seeing some sights then head on to Austin, Texas. Our flight from Dublin to London was delayed and we ended up missing our connection. After standing in line in London for about 6 or 7 hours we were put on a flight to Paris leaving the next day and then went on to LA. Our bags were never returned to us and we were told we'd get them in LA. When we arrived in LA we were told they were missing. With the delay we then ended up having to fly out to Austin (our final destination) a few hours later and couldn't do much about it. Finally after 4 days in Austin our bags were finally found and sent to Austin airport. 

When we arrived to collect them we noticed there was a huge hole in the side of one of them, the one which held our camera equipment. We checked it immediately but everything was gone. The guys at the baggage desk told us it was most likely the TSA who were responsible. We've tried contacting the airlines, but so far we are just being bounced around by all of them because of all of the different airlines we flew with because of all the connections we were on (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Air France and United, plus American Airlines who delivered the bags). We're also trying to get in touch with our insurance company in Ireland but we haven't had any luck with that yet. Even if they do let us make a claim theres no way they'll come close to covering the replacement costs. 

The biggest problem though is that we are in the U.S on 1 year work visas which require us to get a job asap. Every day without our equipment is a day we can't work. We can't afford to replace it and we just don't know what to do. 

Is there anything we can do to make this process go faster? Do we have any chance of recovering our stuff? Has anyone else been through this and can offer some advice? Do any redditors who work in the airline industry or with the TSA have any suggestions?

Any ideas or suggestions at all would be a huge help. I know it Halloween so I'm not expecting a huge response but we're just really worried since we put all of our savings into this trip and getting ready for it and its turning into a disaster. We just don't know what to do.

As a teenager dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, I could not laugh this off. I went straight to the office and demanded to see a vice principal. I was sobbing uncontrollably and visibly a danger to myself, but they just sat me down and had me fill out a form. I called my Dad, who cancelled his flight out-of-town to come be with me. He was furious that he was not called in a situation like this. We had a conference with the vice principal, and we were told there would be consequences if it happened again.

It has been months. Multiple people have gone to the office with complaints about his bullying, and absolutely nothing has been done. Not so much as a detention. He is now attacking the leader of our school's GSA, members, and myself through twitter. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided that I needed to go through his history to get hard evidence. Here are a few gems I found- some submitted by other people. There are actually over 20 screen shots.

""Life has its ups, and you have the Downs. Please do us a favor, and fucking drown"" -- A poem dedicated to Sarah.

""I have AP Lit in the morning. Sarah, if you say a single word, you are getting choked"" (I am the only person in the class who will participate in discussions without being forced).

""I was to roofie Sarah""

""Sarah has a boyfriend and I'm still single? Time to die""

""Sarah for biggest slut. Go die""


It is hard enough for me to want to be on this planet, and people are taking time out of their day to wish that I would die. I think this has passed what the school can do. They lost my faith when they didn't help everyone else who begged for some sort of relief after me. I live in Anne Arundel County. How can I get my story (and the others') out there so that we can see some real change before it is too late? 


TL;DR: The bullying isn't worthy of school attention unless I die. 

Edit: It's not just me. I have screen shots of him saying things about a TON of people who I am sure have no idea it exists. 

Going to bed for tonight! I will NOT let him stress me out to the point where I miss class. The other girl involved talked to people at PFLAG tonight, and they suggested board of ed. I might show her this page later. Thank you everyone, and I will be back reading your suggestions and updating you on my progress on this yet-to-be-named operation.

Edit 1: Front page? It was amazing to wake up to all this support! I'm on my way to a meeting with two other girls who feel equally trapped in this situation. We will have our proof with us, and we are demanding to speak to someone. I will let you know how it goes!

**Edit 2: HOLY S%&amp;^ YOU GUYS! I get off my bus this morning, and I see an unusual amount of cops around the school. I find the group who was going with me into the office, and we sat in guidance, waiting for the counselor to see us all (There were about six of us). Next thing I know, someone asks me if I'm Sarah. They had been looking for this ""Sarah"" all morning, and had even called down another girl by the same name. I get taken into one of the counselor's rooms, and a BOOK of these comments is placed in front of me. She tells me that she has gotten a ton of emails, and that the page has been forwarded to several teachers and the principal. I was shocked. Thankfully, she was not upset about the emails, though some of them were a little nasty. I learn that my Principal has been up all night trying to deal with all of the emails she has been getting. Though she seemed a little mad at first, we quickly settled everything. I was taken into a room with the principal, the counselor, and an administrator to share my story again. I printed off every tweet and the cops collected any threatening ones. They might be able to do something about it, which is amazing, because I wasn't expecting it at all. I'm still shocked that many of the school officials were just now learning about this kid, but I know now that they know: every body knows. Nothing can happen immediately, but the process is starting and consequences will happen.**

**I am slightly scared about the possible backlash, but I feel amazing knowing that even if people dislike me for it, I stood up for my own safety. I have a ton of support- both from you guys and my friends. Thank you everyone who sent an email (they kept mentioning some guy from Montana). There is no need anymore to contact the school or the county about this issue. I will be checking in every morning with the counselor, and she will give me a pass to see her if I ever feel like I'm being harassed over the next few days. You guys made this all happen overnight and sped up the process ten-fold! I don't think I can say thank you enough for helping me, and everyone else, finally deal with the school cyber bully. I love you, Reddit!!!**

The bride isn't there but the little sister is, little sister tries to seduce him, he runs outside, and the whole family is outside congratulating him on not succumbing to her temptation. The joke being that he keeps his condoms in the car and was just going to get them...




Guess what? This shit HAPPENED to me today.

My girlfriend calls me over to help her friend (who is definitely not unattractive and I've known quite well for some time) with some computer problem. I show up and the friend tells me the GF ran out to do some quick errands. I ask about the computer and she starts bullshitting about how it's been ""running slow"" or some other non-point issue. 




Suddenly, the friend asks if I think she is attractive. I hesitate. Not wanting to upset one of the future bridesmaids I tell her ""of course, you're pretty."" She then starts telling me all this shit about how she has always had her eye on me, and how nice I was, and how hot I was...



I was kind of just floored. After that she fully came on to me. Went for the embrace, tried to convert to kiss. I pulled away, excused myself, and went out the door.




Head count: Mom, 3 other friends, my girlfriend, and her sister are outside waiting for me. They all laugh and cheer, the girlfriend runs up and jumps in my arms like I'm some sort of hero, and the mom has tears running down her cheek. They all kept saying how glad they were I ""passed the test"" and how ""good I was"" for her, etc. 




I smiled a bit, was really shaken up. In the middle of all the celebration I quietly said I wasn't feeling well, and excused myself. Got in the car and drove off (small burnout, it's what the Camry could manage), and have been hitting ignore on the countless phone calls I've gotten since then. As of this post (6:13AM PST), it's been about 12 hours since the incident and I still can't place my thoughts.




On one hand, I feel deeply and utterly betrayed. On the other, it's ridiculous to the point that it's funny and my girlfriend has never done *anything* even close to this before. Reddit, talk to me. What are your thoughts?




**EDIT:** (6:50AM PST) Wow, the initial feedback is huge. I guess this struck a chord with many people. I e-mailed her a little note that basically said I needed ""some time to think about what happened today."" I haven't slept at all so I think I'm going to see if I can get a few hours in and then go from there. Thanks for all the kind words so far.

So far after learning a bit about hair, girls have been easier then boys. Today my second oldest daughter Catherine got her first period. I haven't had to deal with this with my oldest yet. I haven't actually seen her yet I am about to leave work to get her. She had her period in the middle of class and sounded embarrassed on the phone. She is a lot like her mother smart but fairly shy. She is certainly not going to open up to me about this. What do I do? What do I say? If you were a young girl what would you need? I know these are childish questions but maybe I am a little scared and could use any advice. Ok I wrote this in a panic. Any advice appreciated. Wish me luck

EDIT::: WOW! i did not expect this level of response. i am honestly really touched. For everybody who wants to know my girl go; Sarah (10), Catherine (9, the lucky lady), and River (3). Their mother died giving birth to River. River is also blind and has slightly underdeveloped lungs, but she is also the best dancer in the family. 

Catherine took a nap when she got home. i took her out shopping and bought WAY too many brands of pads. we all built a cover fort and ate pizza in it. So far I might be a mess, but my girls are amazing and mature, and quite frankly i want to get older and be like Catherine. She gave more of everybody has their own time talk then me. 

I want to thank everybody for their advice, kind words, unwarranted compliments, and PM's. Catherine is a currently a Buddhist, I am an atheist but i let them find their own religion. I told her that i got a lot of advice from lots of nice people online. She wanted me to thank you all and wish you peace and happiness and a good nights sleep. I am obviously paraphrasing she is 9. 

From the bottom of my heart i would like to thank you all so much. I will continue to read and reply as i continue to be clueless. ",How should a single dad handle his daughters first period?,6624

The worst part was that his daughter was a couple of years below us and she ended having to move schools because the girl who had an affair with the teacher was bragging about the details of the affair and said that when he got out of jail, he was going to divorce his wife and marry her.

searchingforolivia,847,7386,f1saj,2153,"When I was four or five years old, there was a girl in my class who had very few friends. My mom always told me to try to make friends with everyone at school, so one day I walked up to her and and asked her if we could be friends. I would play with her on the swings, and sit next to her during class. I remember her being very shy, but a great friend. I had so much fun playing with her, and we would make believe about swinging all the way out into outer space - we even made up a song. One day, suddenly, she stopped coming to school - our teachers told us she moved away to another state. I was sad to know I couldn't see her anymore, but I accepted that she had left.


Recently, while talking nostalgically about the past, my mom was able to tell me the truth about what happened to my friend.


Her name was Olivia, though we both cannot remember her last name. She attended Dallas International School, and was in the same class as me in pre-K (this must have been circa 1996-1997). I couldn't remember this, but my mom told me that Olivia always came to school in tattered clothing, looking very unkempt. My mom remembers that, when attending birthday parties, her mother would drop her off and only pick up her daughter many hours after the party had ended and all the other children had been picked up. These were little things that the other parents noticed, but that could very easily be concluded as an unfortunate financial situation where the mom worked, and therefore could not pick up her child on time.


However, one morning my mom was watching the morning news, and she was shocked to find out that Olivia's mother had murdered her children/family, and then killed herself. 


Reddit, I know that this happened over a decade ago, but it still deeply, deeply saddens me to find out that my friend died. I tried to research her story online, but I figure there must not be very many reports from the 90's. Also, because these are only my mom's memories, we cannot remember how she killed her children, how many children she had, etc. I know this is an extremely long shot, given how little information there is to work from, but I wanted to try my best to pay my respects to Olivia after all these years. If you could help in any way to figure out what her story is, I would be incredibly grateful!




** EDIT **: Reddit, I cannot thank you enough - within fifteen minutes of posting, Olivia and her story were found thanks to jacques45 and a few other posters several moments later. You have proven to me once again that this is a truly wonderful community, and I am very grateful! I am not sure where to go from here - I feel as though I am mourning a loss many, many years after the fact - though I know I can finally rest knowing that she will never be forgotten. Once again Reddit - thank you!


** EDIT 2 **: 2 hours and this thread has reached the front page of Reddit. I am overwhelmed with emotion, and am so happy that Olivia and her story have incited such a response from this community that never ceases to amaze me. I apologize for my lack of replies - I broke down after reading her story and have sought some immediate solace in the company of very close friends who have made this easier to bear.

DanteLesnie,9399,14484,xdya5,2144,"I went on a business trip this weekend and got home at 6:25AM.  I didn't want to wake her and the kids, so I sat quietly in the living room watching TV.  A few minutes later I get a text from her:

**""Thanks for staying over babe.  I love sleeping next to you.""**

Obviously, I wasn't here last night.  I'm still on the couch and haven't responded. I think she went back to sleep and has no idea she accidentally texted me.

-----------------

**Monday:**

1.  I had to go to work before confronting her.  I think it was better anyway, since it gave me time to think about what to say instead of rushing to anger.

1.  I asked my assistant to go to the 7-11 next door and see if they have Shiner Bock.  If they don't, I'll ask him to go as far as Publix.  For science!  (Edit:  we didn't find any)

1.  She finally texted me at work, and said that her (girl)friend stayed over.  I didn't respond.  (3:00PM EST)


-----------------

**Tuesday:**

1.  I left work last night and went to dinner with one of my work partners.

1.  I didn't say a word to my wife when I came to bed.  In the morning I mentioned the text after I woke up.  I told her I was surprised she would use that language with a girlfriend.

1.  She broke down and admitted that she had a (platonic) girlfriend AND an (not-so platonic) ex-boyfriend over while I was away.

1.  She admitted it wasn't the first time.

1.  I calmly told her I would have to think about how I feel about the situation and let her know whether we should seperate.

Thanks, reddit, you prepared me for the worst, way in advance.  It's nice to get the hivemind's opinion sometimes before jumping into a rash and complicated situation, or acting brash and angry as a reaction.  I really appreciate everyone's comments and help figuring out the next steps!

Forensicunit,4835,24242,wm35b,2146,"Let's try this again...

Traditionally suicides skyrocket during November and December.  In 2011 they didn't, and I noticed.  Then 2012 came along.  And people started killing themselves.  At the rate of 1 or more per week in my relatively small jurisdiction.

Roommates come home to find their roommates hung, boyfriends are shooting themselves in front of girlfriends, an adult brother called the police to tell us to come get his juvenile sister, who was sleeping, after he kills himself.  I've cut people down from doorways and performed chest compressions on shooting victims.

When I get dispatched to a death, I can't ""not click the link.""  I have to go.  I have to go in.  I have to see the result.  I have to handle the body.  I have to talk to the family.  I have to hear the screams and hysteria.  And I frequently have to bring those images home.

People, especially relatively young people, are killing themselves at what I consider an alarming rate.  I want it to stop.

Please.  If you are feeling like you want to hurt yourself reach out to r/suicidewatch.  Or call 1-800-784-2433 (1-800-SUICIDE).  Or call a loved one. Or reach out to [Befrienders](http://www.befrienders.org/helplines/helplines.asp?c2=USA).  And if you see a friend or loved one in need, give them the support you need.  This is my Cake Day wish.

We all know about the [P-Dub asking for help thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ag96s/i_have_a_problem_and_i_dont_know_what_i_can_do/). Everyone donated to the guy who was popular on Reddit simply because he asked people to remind him about doing his homework. We didn't know the full story of what happened with his mom, nor did we wait to see what transpired. No, we donated $7,000 as of 24hours ago because we wanted to help.


21 days ago, a [woman who had similarly fallen on hard times](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a90vh/askreddit_how_can_i_pull_off_keeping_my_home_and/), a Redditer for over a year (more than P-Dub, I may add), was thrown into a pit. She also reluctantly posted a Paypal link (which she later removed). She was told to stop having children, Redditers were told to be a ""bit more skeptic and not just throwing money at people,"" and she was called a beggar.

Two people came asking for help. One made off with $7,000+ dollars, one got nothing. One got praise, helpful advice, and assistance, one got insulted and called a scammer.

Can we just ban e-panhandling altogether? The generosity of Reddit is amazing, but one of two things will happen if this continues:

1) People will become jealous, because someone got superstar treatment and help from Reddit because they were a user people ejaculated over, while other users in similar or worse circumstances who contributed just as much got nothing. 

2) People are going to start preying on our generosity in order to potentially make off with some money

The best thing we can do when someone has hit hard times is to give them our experience. We can offer words of wisdom as a lawyer, put people in touch with people we know that can help them, and even offer services to these people that they need at no charge. Scammers or unethical people will have no use with specialized help and advice, and the people down on their luck will be thankful for anything they can get.


**EDIT 1:**
Just got this from Shannonigans:

&gt;I know this will be buried if I just post a comment, but I just hoped maybe you could put an edit in there for me. No matter how many people were mean, the kind ones meant way more, I've received several gifts in the mail from redditors. Several stuffed animals, books, and a gift card, not to mention a giftcard to kohls to help. Reddit did about 1/3 of my Christmas shopping for me and the ones that sent kind words meant just as much. Right after my girls open their gifts, there will be a follow up with words of appreciation and recognition and pictures of the Christmas that reddit helped happen. I appreciate being skeptical, but I was really telling my true story. I hold no resentment towards P-Dub at ALL. If I could help right now, I would!

&gt;For now, a picture of my oldest and I with the card sent in stilesjp's care package of soaps (one of which she will NOT put down) http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v12/Shannonista/CIMG0278.jpg

&gt;Thank you, reddit, and thank you eggbrain, for caring. All the love in my immediate family goes to all the love for my reddit family.

**EDIT 1.5: (same time as the previous edit, but wanted to separate thoughts)**

I'm really glad things worked out for Shannonigans. I was disgusted when I saw her called terrible names (some of which, since this posting, have been deleted.)

Unfortunately, this doesn't change the fact that had there not been this topic, no one would have known about her, or any of the other unfortunate stories, some of which have been posted in this thread. I respect the right of individuals to make their own decisions as to whether or not to donate to a particular user. But I also think there is a responsibility of users to not just throw money at situations that they know almost nothing about.

I think it also teaches a bad example that someone down on their luck can get an instant solution in the form of cash without working for it (Which is why I think gifts of service and people is much more helpful). Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

I was so offended and embarrassed for the server, so I couldn't help but say something to her, ""That was extremely rude. You came here to get a sub so don't yell at her for providing the service you asked for. Just get off your phone, order your toppings and stop acting like a child."" 

She looked at me with contempt and anger, but I think I intimidated her so she didn't say anything back to me. The server looked at me, smiled, and mouthed the words thank you.

shadowshea,4496,22664,xjelq,2120,"So I am a cashier at Walmart. There's a particular old man who comes in just about everyday, and always comes through my line and we talk about conspiracy theories and all kinds of things. I usually always walk him to his car and help him put his groceries away, and he always tries to give me a dollar even though I've told him I can't take tips.

Today, I was coming back from break and noticed him checking out with another cashier. I walked over and said hi to him, and he smiled really big and looked super excited. He had bought some suspenders he wanted to put in in the store, but couldn't clip the back of them. So I helped him. I didn't even think about it, I just helped clipped them to his belt because it was no big deal. The cashier started giggling, and was like ""omg did you see that?? She touched that old guy!!"" And told everyone like it was big gossip. 

I walked him out to his car like I usually do, and when we got to his car, he stopped and said he had a question for me. He asked me why I was always so nice to him, and I told him my mother is a geriatric nurse, and when I was a kid, I used to hang out at the nursing home with her playing with the old ladies and pretending I was there granddaughter, because it made them extremely happy that someone cared. My mother always taught me to respect my elders, because a lot of them have no one that talks to them, or is even nice to them. I told him I wasn't trying to say he was a lonely old man no one talked to, but I'm always polite to everyone, especially the elderly, because that's how I was raised. He got teared up and told me I was absolutely right, his children hadn't spoken to him in years, his wife had passed a while ago, and when he goes out in public people treat him like a burden. He said I am the nicest person he had ever met at a Walmart, and that I'm the only reason he ever comes here anymore, and that he wished some people would learn some manners. He hugged me and asked me when I worked next, and usually I never tell anyone, but I gave him my entire schedule for the next two weeks and told him to avoid the times I go to break.

I just don't understand why it was such a joke that I helped an old man, and why no one else would help him. Yeah, he's a crotchety old guy who talks constantly about nonsense, but he's still a person. I hate my generation sometimes. I'm 25, and it blows my mind how many people my age are so blatantly rude to people.

alcimedes,7284,9208,hqyxq,2110,"So I'll give my example here, I was reminded after reading the post about someone warning a kid buying from an undercover cop.

Back when I was in school, the University newspaper ran a story about undercover cops using a younger, cute girl to camp outside the liquor store just off-campus and ask people to buy her beer.  She'd give the people money, then ask them if they wanted to come back to her vehicle and share one as a way to say thanks.

Get back to where her car is supposed to be, van door opens up, cops inside, and you'd get a ticket for underage buying.

Later that evening, my friend and I were going to this same liquor store to get some beer, when we were approached by a cute girl, who asked us if we could buy her a six pack of beer since she was underage.

Being a dumbass, I said sure, took her money and we went inside.  About 10 seconds later I remember the piece about the undercover cops, and realized we were about to get arrested.  At that point, we decided the best thing to do was to buy a 6 pack of super expensive root beer (blowing $9 of the $20 she gave us) and we put it in a paper bag.

We walked back out, and she asked us ""did you get it?"" to which we said ""yeah, of course.""

She invited us back to her car to have one each as a thank-you.  Sure enough, we head to the back and there's the black van.

The door opens up, cops sitting in there with headphones on etc. and they tell us ""you're in a world of trouble now.""

I put on my best trollface and said ""really?  I really thought you guys could use some root beer sitting out here in that cramped van all night.""

There was an awkward pause, and then they opened the bag.  Root beer, nothing else.

Then they told us to get the fuck out of there, and we were interfering with a police investigation, and if we didn't leave we'd get arrested.

We walked across the street to our apt. building went into the various laundry rooms and yelled out the window every time she approached someone that it was a sting.  They left after 20 min. of that.

tl;dr - cops tried to trick us into buying beer for an underage girl, we took their money and bought them root beer instead.

edit:  For those saying this would have been entrapment, it wouldn't have been.

http://www.lectlaw.com/def/e024.htm

&gt;A person is 'entrapped' when he is induced or persuaded by law enforcement officers or their agents to commit a crime that he had no previous intent to commit; and the law as a matter of policy forbids conviction in such a case.

&gt;However, there is no entrapment where a person is ready and willing to break the law and the Government agents merely provide what appears to be a favorable opportunity for the person to commit the crime. For example, it is not entrapment for a Government agent to pretend to be someone else and to offer, either directly or through an informer or other decoy, to engage in an unlawful transaction with the person. So, a person would not be a victim of entrapment if the person was ready, willing and able to commit the crime charged in the indictment whenever opportunity was afforded, and that Government officers or their agents did no more than offer an opportunity. 

I would have been screwed, because of the three things required for entrapment, they didn't do #2

&gt;Second, the government agents then persuaded or talked the person into committing the crime. Simply giving him the opportunity to commit the crime is not the same as persuading him to commit the crime.

She just asked, she didn't persuade.  She offered the opportunity, that's it.  If I'd said no, and she proceeded to badger me it would be entrapment, but I just say ""sure"".",Trolling law enforcement - what's your story?,11318

iaacp,3705,11199,x0tpe,2106,"So for the summer, we've had an intern. He started around June. He's a pretty cool guy, and he gets along well with the office. The first few weeks, he was fine. We gave him simple tasks to ease him in, which he picked up on. Over time, we gave him more and more, but nothing too hard or too high a work load.

Now, for the past month or so, he's been completely slacking off. I noticed the work flow coming from him has slowed dramatically, and he seemed a bit more lazy in general. So, I asked my friends in the IT department to give me a report on his internet usage. Surprise surprise. Browsing the internet, plenty of reddit, even some youtube here and there. All times of the day, at a high volume. When we last talked, I brought up that work had slowed, and asked why. His response was that he felt his work had gotten more difficult - which is BS, because he's very qualified for what I've assigned to him.

I'm not a tough boss, and I've never had to confront a worker before - our office has always had really great employees. So, how should I go about this? Give him a stern talking? A friendly one? A joking message through reddit that says ""Get to work!"" anonymously? He's a good kid, he's just been lazy lately.

**Edit:** OP has not abandoned you all, don't worry. As for all the comments about interns shitting yourselves - good. It might be you I call into my office later today or tomorrow. Straighten up, and get to work. The more I from interns here, the more I want to prank him!

Yes, I plan on talking to him either this evening or tomorrow morning. Yes, I will update. Some have asked how much he makes, and if it's for free: definitely not free labor - THEN I would probably understand. He makes around $18/hour if I recall correctly.

**Edit 2**: [The hour of reckoning is near.](http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/bwe/images/2011/03/prairie_dog.gif)

**Edit 3:** Edited the poor bastard's name out because the sound of so many interns shitting their pants in this thread is too beautiful. Unfortunately, there won't be time to call him in today - a meeting came up and I have other stuff to do by the end of the day. He'll be called in first thing tomorrow morning, and I **will** update you beautiful sons of bitches. Going to try and keep it light hearted, but at the same time keep firm that he *does* need to get more work done and that his browsing needs to decrease drastically. We are okay with some browsing, just not the amount he does. 

One last gem: called friend in IT, had him check again since he did earlier today. Looks like he  cleared his browsing cache and cookies, probably upon seeing this thread. Stay tuned...

**Edit 4:** Guys, we aren't hiring right now. I'm sorry :( Please don't PM me, I can't get you a job. If I could, I would - but you'd probably go on reddit as much as this guy. And then I'd have to come to /r/askreddit on how to deal with the situation. And then I'd get more PM's asking to be hired.

**Edit 5:** Really, we aren't hiring. I promise I can't get you a job.

**Update after our talk:** So, I met with him in our small conference room this morning. He seemed really nervous. Asked how he was doing, how work was going, etc. Asked if he had anything to air out, if he was happy with his work, interested in it, etc, etc. He gave me mostly small answers like 'yes' and 'no', while remaining a little nervous. So I asked the ""okay, well do you know why I asked you here?"" while remaining friendly, not stiff (heh) or anything. He had this shit eating grin on his face and said ""uhh, you don't go on reddit, do you?"" to which I also had a shit eating grin on my face. We laughed, and I said how browsing the internet is fine, and I don't want to have to monitor him, but we *need* more work coming from him.

So then I asked if he has trouble focusing, or is bored with work or whatever. It mostly came down his lack of focus, which I can completely relate to (I was very recently diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and we are close in age). We talked about things that would help him stay on track. I recommended getting up out of his cubicle every hour for 5 minutes, or walking around on our floor, and drinking plenty of water. Maybe take 5-10 minutes at lunch and go for a walk. He responded well to all of my suggestions, and I feel like the talk went great. 

Then I had to inform him where we go from here: like someone suggested here, I told him we're not here to baby sit, but to help him grow and learn as a programmer. We need to make sure his time is being used appropriately. If I notice another decrease in work, that's when the the punishments are going to have to get serious and I'm going to have to inform *my* boss about all of this, which will likely result in early termination. You know, to let him know we're cool, but we are still professional and work has to be done. I also told him if he feels like he's drifting again, or needs more assistance, to contact me before he goes back into this loop.

As we parted, I said to take 10 mins to browse reddit or whatever, and then continue on his assignment. Little did he know I had my IT friend redirect reddit to his own ""GET BACK TO WORK"" page, just for a short while.

I believe the problem is fixed. Thanks to all who gave input on the situation, to all interns who shat their pants upon reading this, to the few that sent me some seriously awesome FBI-level interrogation techniques, and to the many of you that inquired about jobs. No, I still can't get you one. I'm sorry.

&gt;""Look at her. Just look at her, walking with her expensive boots and jacket, all fancy. Since when are women allowed to make money, anyway? Look at her fancy ass.

P-Dub,1793,1239,ag96s,2083,"So, one hour after I finished my last final, my mom calls to tell me she has just been suspended. She was told that she would get the remainder of her contract, which is payment until August, and was then ordered off the premise. I thought this was kind of shitty, but at least she has 8 month's pay.

Today, the principal that fired her (she is a teacher), said they are breaching the contract and not paying her. Normally, this would be something she could take to her union, but she couldn't afford insurance *and* the union, so this was the first year she has not been in the union.

The first year she is not in the union, and they fire her on christmas and breach contract. She called her *old* union rep and he said that they are fighting this kind of thing all over the place, but they won't represent her because this is the first time in 25 years that she was not paying union dues. She was even promised by the secretary that was going to handle the paperwork that she would get full pay, on wednesday. That secretary was fired today.

The principal said, ""If you want to fight it, hire a lawyer."" 

I think that, collectively, we have 1,500 dollars between me, my brother and my mom, and the lowest that we have heard from a lawyer initally is 2 grand.

\*there is a *tiny* mortgage on the house (about 8 grand or so), but if she can't pay that, she is going to lose the entire house.

I don't know what to do, my mom doesn't know what to do, and my brother is in the Navy, so he is completely oblivious to the problem.

In summation, My mom's school district fired her, broke her contract because she was not in the union.

Frankly, I only post this here because I'm desperate I have no idea what can even be done.

\* I wrote ""I don't know what to do"" twice here. This is effecting my posting skills.

D:

\* make that 500 emails.
___

I thought I'd update you all on the plan that has come up from all this:

1. The NLRB keeps unions in check, and apparently what my mom's union has done may have been against the rules, and I have the form to submit to the NLRB concerning the union rep.

2. If the union thing does not work, someone has contacted me with a lawyer they know that may take the case Pro Bono (oh, how many times have I written that today and wanted to write 'Pro-Boner')

3. At the very least, a scary letter from a lawyer may do the trick and get the contract reinstated.

4. If all else fails, your donations will at least keep things afloat for some time.

5. Alternate 'If All else fails', taking this to the press. I list this as a last resort because I don't see my mom going for it. She feels really bad about the whole experience.

That is all for right now. Being Friday night, not much can be done over the weekend in regards to this whole mess, so any real action will have to wait until Monday. I think this is why they fire people on Fridays...

Update Tuesday the 29th or Wednesday the 30th, everyone that donated will be getting an email from my mom (at least, everyone whose email I could find)

DanFromSesameStreet,828,10212,n6hwo,2080,"Yay!  Here's the story, and [here's a link to the original AskReddit thread, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m7g6k/reddit_we_lost_something_can_you_help_sesame/): 

In 2009, we put together an anthology of Sesame Street’s then 40 year history.  The end product of this anthology was a coffee table book, “Sesame Street: A Celebration –  40 Years of Life on the Street.”  The book is extensive – a full color, 300-plus page masterpiece.  The amount of research it took to produce the book?  A years-long endeavor, involving multiple people digging through a seemingly endless trove of boxes and bins -- all of which, collectively, promised to tell the complete story of Sesame Street’s history. 

Except there was one item missing.

In the summer of 1969, Sesame Workshop (then Children's Television Workshop) created an episode of Sesame Street -- an unaired test pilot shown only to a focus group of children. Later that year, on November 10, 1969 after incorporating the data gathered by this test pilot and many other sources, the first ever episode of Sesame Street – Episode 0001 -- debuted. 

The actor who played Gordon in the Episode 0001 was Matt Robinson, who held the role through season 3. In seasons four and five, Hal Miller took over. Since season six, Roscoe Orman has played the role. But the man who played Gordon in the unaired test pilot?  We did not know who he was.  And our records came up empty, the man’s identity, we feared, was lost to history.

On November 10, 2011 – our 42nd birthday – we decided to ask the Internet for help.  And congratulations, Internet: 

You found Gordon.

[Here's a pic of him from 1976, eight years after the episode was filmed.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvy8brgL7j1qcaggg.jpg)

Gordon’s name was Garrett Hobart Saunders, an actor local to New York who primarily performed in traveling theater.  Out of respect for the privacy of his family, we won’t be sharing the details of his life here.  But the story as to how we found him – how you found him, well, here it goes.

We posted our call for help everywhere we could think of, starting with SesameStreet.org.  We shared it across our social media accounts – Facebook (even on Elmo’s and Cookie Monster’s pages), Twitter, and Tumblr as well.  And we posted it to Reddit, where it quickly hit the front page. Within hours, people were making suggestions, and within days, the story travelled across the web and across mediums.  It even made a few television news shows, one of which ended up being the big break.

Mr. Saunders’ nephew saw a story of our search and immediately contacted his cousins – Garrett Saunders’ two daughters.  Both women reached out to us later that day, providing us the photo above and the other information we needed.  With their help, we were able to verify that Mr. Saunders was, in fact, the first Gordon.

We’d like to thank everyone who helped us spread the word and ultimately, solve our mystery.  And thank you, too, to Garrett Hobart Saunders, for being part of Sesame Street’s history.

elleyia,2775,1768,wszqn,2077," Today, while at work (library), a man came in and one of our regular patrons, a teen who's probably 15 or 16, came running up to him and gave him a hug. Turns out, the man is the teen's father. Now, through two years of seeing this kid almost every day, I know a few things about him: he's in foster care, his mom OD'd last year, he grew up on the streets, he was abused by several of his mom's boyfriends. 

So I was surprised to see he had a dad, honestly. But it became quickly apparent (to everyone else) that the dad wasn't that in to seeing his son. But the boy could not see that. He was talking all about his life, his group home, his younger brothers, etc. Then he says, ""Why don't we go to lunch? Let's go to Wendy's"" (right across the street.) The dad goes, ""Sure, let me go get my wallet, I'll be right back."" And he walks out the door and doesn't come back. At all.

This kid stood in the middle of the library for like an hour, then went back and forth between us and Wendy's for the rest of the day. A co-worker and I ended up sitting in the parking lot with this kid for like two hours after we closed, just letting him cry.

This is a teenager who has seen and experienced the very worst things, many of them probably at the hands of his father, and yet he wanted so desperately to be part of his life.

**Requirements:** A car with electric windows and a passenger.

When you stop at a stop sign/stop light and there is someone standing on the street outside of the passenger side window (perhaps waiting to cross the street), simply roll down the passenger side window. Done.

This causes two things to happen. 

First, the passenger will look out the window and wonder why it's going down. Especially when the weather doesn't warrant an open window.

Second, the pedestrian will take notice and look at the window being rolled down.

What then ensues is a gloriously awkward moment between the passenger and the pedestrian as they stare at each other without any clue as to what is actually happening.

DrRob,7042,37302,xf5c2,2068,"Hi all.  I'm a psychiatrist.  My main area of clinical work is emergency psychiatry, and my main research interest is functional brain imaging.  I'd like to start a discussion about the rapist thread, which I see as a serious danger.  In a nutshell:

* Rape is a crime which sometimes hinges directly on feelings of power over the victim.  
* That power often loses its meaning if the victim is unconscious.  Many rapists typically need a victim who knows they are being victimized.  
* This victim is the rapist's audience.  This is crucial.
* The audience gives the rapist pleasure, euphoric delight from unfettered, witnessed suffering.  That euphoria is intense and is possibly driven by the same neurobiology involved in a drug high. 

Now, when Reddit invites rapists to retell their stories, they offer an audience of thousands.  The possibility that individuals reading these stories will be horrified afresh is very appealing to some rapists.  It’s neurobiologically very much like anticipating drug use.

Note:  the audience doesn’t actually need to be horrified.  In the mind of the rapist, the possibility of horrifying an audience is what is appealing.

Ever wonder what makes addicts keep using?  A major factor is the craving that comes from recalling the feelings associated with the pleasurable activity or drug.  Cocaine addicts, active or in recovery, who are asked to think about using cocaine have measurable brain changes precisely when they report cravings.  We haven't actually measured this in rapists, but we suspect it's *highly analogous*.

Thus, the Reddit rape forum is very possibly triggering rape cravings in rapists.  

It is also teaching rapists how to rape better via shared stories, the same way we teach new participants to improve in any field, by sharing our experiences.

I plan to be available to discuss this, so jump in.

Fourth edit, 2:09 pm 31 July:  My point is that speech has power, and it can be dangerous.  I wanted to outline why it might be dangerous in this instance.  Is censorship the answer?  ~~No.  Responsible and accountable speech is the answer.~~  I don't know what the answer is.  That question is in the domains of law and philosophy, for it is a question of values, a question about how the world *ought* to be.  My point is about how the world *is*, and it stands whether or not there is free speech.  Also, yes, I fully agree that rape is a complex phenomenon with multiple motives.  I'm speaking specifically about sadistic, serial rape, which can indeed involve euphoria and the triggering of cravings.  I've made edits above as well to soften the tone.  Also, removed the distracting asterisks.

Fifth edit:  a number of people have requested links to research about rape and rapists.  All links are to free, full-text articles, so you can read in depth if you wish.  Here we go...

* Male rapists in this sample were [1.5x as likely to have been physically violent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3365003/?tool=pubmed) to a female partner
* Male rape is [2x more likely](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3256140/?tool=pubmed) in societies where gender inequity is normalized
* In this sample of 1686 men, 466 had raped a woman, and [251 were multiple rapists](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247272/?tool=pubmed).  The most common motivation ""stemmed from ideas of sexual entitlement.""

That trip occured this past July, and during it, I decided to hop on a random cruise ship to Croatia where I met this guy. 

We talked and after hearing how I had no place to go when I reached there, he invited me onto his boat/yacht. Over the course of a 2 days, we sailed around the Adriatic Islands on his private boat, drank beer and just talked. After we docked back into the marina, we said our goodbyes and the only contact I had with him was a single email thanking him for his hospitality.

This morning, I received this email.

A buddy and I went to Argentina for two weeks and spent 3 days at Iguazu Falls.

So we spent a full day at the falls doing the standard touristy trails and boat rides, absolutely breathtaking, and talked to a park ranger about finding a real adventure away from the crowds and he told us about this hike that is about 2-3 miles on a flat path through the rainforest followed by about a mile of downhill switchbacks to a lone gorgeous waterfall that you could swim under. 

The next day we began our journey and all the splendors of the rainforest were out: butterflies of every color, giant golden ants, toucans, camouflaged iguanas within a foot that were 3-4 ft long and much more. It was the one time in life I got why chicks got butterfly tattoos. 

We get to the waterfall and like a dream that came true there is a model photo shoot going on under this gorgeous waterfall. We were like two kids in a candy store with perma Cool-Aid smiles. Its 3 models, camera crew, a park ranger and us. We were in heaven. After playing under the waterfall and swimming in the little pond we were eating lunch.

I look to my buddy and said ""No one is ever going to believe this happened to us"" all he said was ""They are getting naked."" My head whipped around and all 3 were completely nude with the waterfall flowing over their bodies...I love South America. For the next 2 hours we sat there in nirvana.

EDIT:
Now that I think that this post is just about to reach it's peak I think it is time for me to explain the purpose of this little exercise.

I find that many people that live busy day to day lives often don't have the time nor energy to take a step back and notice the little things that they have done, only focusing on the bigger things that they are about to do. The little steps that are over looked can often make us feel slightly proud of ourselves and can give  the boost that is needed to reach the overall goal, so when looking back on it, we haven't just enjoyed the outcome, but the process as well.

On the other hand, there are people who don't feel like they lead full busy lives. This idea of reflecting on the most positive thing you've done recently gives you a little pat on the back, showing you that you have been doing something no matter how small or insignificant you think it is.

In future if you ever find yourself rushed, anxious or just feeling a bit down and out, just think of this and every single time you do, you will always find a boost in your self worth.

Then one day this exceptionally dicky kid came up to ""pat"" my dog on the head. This pat however was pretty much just a punch to the nose, which my dog did most certainly not like. So she bit the kid on the hand (didn't even draw blood), and the kid made a huge scene after which my dog was banned from the school.
As we lived in a very crowded suburban area, the school oval/park was the only place we could walk her so instead of letting her never be able to get rid of energy we promptly 'sent her off to the farm'.

We were just shooting some hoops and talking when someone suggested a game of Strip Basketball. The three girls wanted to be on a team together, so they told me I could go choose anyone I wanted for my second. Naturally, I bolted for my highschool's basketball team captain's house. Pounded on his door at 10 pm, sweating and out of breath and said ""No time to explain, let's go,"".

[deleted],1665,6027,13vjy0,2049,"  As said in the title, my parents have worked hard all their lives for their family. We never had really nice stuff but they always gave everything they could while putting off their own desire. I'm the youngest and now in my mid 20s, so my parents should be able to wind down and get ready for retirement, do a bit of travelling, etc. Unfortunately with their financial situation (+11 grandkids to spend money on), that won't be happening. 

  My parents always talked about going on a trip but it's never happened. Dad works for weeks at a time, staying in camps doing 12 hour days and only coming home on (some) long weekends. It makes me sad that he works so hard with no end in sight, so it's the least we can do to show our gratitude for all the love and help they've given us. 

  Originally I was thinking some all-inclusive type package where they can just relax but I'm not sure it's really up their ally. One of my brothers suggested Ireland (we live in Canada) because both sides of the family originate there and I know both of my parents have expressed a desire to see that country over any other.

  Some questions I have are: 

* What is the best way to look for deals on international flights? I know of expedia and that's about it. 

* What kinds of places would you want to stay? What cities are best for travelling? Are there any dangerous places you would recommend avoiding as a tourist?

* Is Christmas a good time to visit a country like Ireland? My sister also suggested their anniversary (in June), which still gives them 6 months to organize themselves but may be tougher for my dad as far as time off work goes. 

Thanks for any help!

*Edit 1* - So many insightful and informative responses! Lots of good points, some already considered and some not.  I will respond whenever I can, since I'm at work right now. Thanks Reddit! 

*Edit 2* What an overwhelming response! I have my reading cut out for me.. Thank you all foer sharing your advice and bringing up details I hadn't even thought of. For those saying it's a bad idea, it's not. We will ultimately do what's affordable and reasonable with the decisions on where/when left up to my parents.

EDIT:  Was quite impressed with all the comments and feedback on here when I woke up this AM.  Even the silly comments.  

Some answers to questions I have received:  Clinton was speaking at the Ontario Economic Summit in Toronto.
At one point he actually said that he feels he should be taxed more.  I'm not sure how this impacts discussions here, but some people seem to think this is a critical fact that is needed.  I don't think it matters myself.

I don't have a transcript or a video and I'm not sure if one will become available, if so I will share.

I'm not opposed to OWS, I'm not for OWS either.  Many people, including Clinton, have a hard time supporting OWS because it isn't entirely clear what OWS stands for.   It is too broad.  

I'm no longer a banker, I work close in the area of public policy, I'm not the government that OWS is opposed to.  I'm FOR distribution of wealth.  Though in my meetings that is not my direct message.  I state problems and offer solutions.  I tackle issues one at a time.  When I worked for a bank, I was NOT the 1%.  It is PART of why I left, not that I was looking to become the 1%, I just didn't agree with the direction the banks are going.  Even the CDN banks.

Clinton IMO was simply offering advice, I don't believe he was speaking out against OWS, in fact I think he wants them to be successful.  I could be wrong, he is a great word smith as some have said.

Another personal opinion:  If I judged you based on your past, specifically a 1-5 key negative elements of your past, would YOUR own advice be valid?  I know I have made some major errors in my past.  I agree Clinton has goofed up royally in the past, but I think he offers a valid point.  Also I feel that because OWS has decentralized itself, it also opens itself up to individuals who may be a little too right wing and they discredit the OWS movement.  i.e. those protesting things like oil in the general sense and are doing it under the OWS movement.  

FOCUS is needed and I personally believe that some sort of centralized publicity needs to take place.  I feel like OWS is trying to speak on our behalf as the 99%, yet I can't support such a disorganized cause that lets many factions speak on my behalf that I don't really agree with.

Anyway, I posted this to open dialogue, that was my only motive.  I'm not saying I'm a Clinton supporter or I'm against OWS, just helping set the stage for discussions on where OWS is going.  Cause I don't know and that makes it hard for me to share my support to them.  In my own town, all OWS has done is provide a home for the homeless, for now.

EDIT 2:  For the purposes of dialoguing the statement, I should have just left out who said it.  I feel like some of you are more concerned with who said it, than the validity of the point.  Great discussions here regardless.  Thanks everyone.  And I wish I could read ALL the comments, but there are far too many now.

When our movie finished, my friends went to the bathroom, as is necessitated by the female movie theatre ritual, and I elected to wait out in the secondary lobby.

That was probably my second mistake.

This theatre, due to its lack of staff, often has more people sneaking into the theatre than people paying for tickets. It is very, very easy to simply waltz in through a side door when another person is walking out. 

I was the only one in the hallway which made me a target for an extremely large, homeless/cracked-out-looking 40+ year old black man (only relevant because I'm pale as fuck and he could *not* pass as my dad). He was built like a truck.

 Generally I'm extremely outgoing and can talk with strangers easily; however, the moment I noticed this fellow approaching, an overwhelming sense of fear washed over me and my brain kept telling me to get out of there fast. My naive 14-year-old self decided to stay where I was, thinking: ""There's no way in hell anything bad could happen to me since I'm obviously invincible to the world. Bad shit only happens in the news. Don't judge a book by its cover, aphrodite_whities! He's probably a lovely guy.""

He approached and asked me if I had any cigarettes. I said no and that I didn't smoke, when he suddenly reached out and grabbed my hand. He stood there shaking my hand saying how he was just dying for a cigarette, increasing his deathgrip every time I tried to pull my hand away. He kept closing the distance between us while strangling my hand and eventually he had me backed into a corner, all the while he keeps fiddling around with something in his pocket (I don't know what it was; he never took that hand out of his pocket the entire time). He kept saying how he wasn't even there to see a movie, just wanted some cigarettes. He was insistent that we go get cigarettes and kept trying to steer me towards the side door.

I was so scared that I was probably on the brink of pissing myself. I looked to see if anyone was around, only to notice my two friends standing outside the bathroom door -- not doing anything while this man was forcing his body onto mine in a public place. They were the only people around and they were just standing there. Understandably, they later said they were confused as to what was happening and didn't know what to do.

Thankfully, a movie lets out right in front of where the man has me trapped. 

Every single person passed by without so much as a second glance. Shit, I thought, I'm gonna get kidnapped. This man wouldn't take his eyes off of mine for a second, and pushed his chest against mine every time I looked around for help. I was too afraid to yell.

Suddenly, a group of three guys (probably only around 15 or 16 years old) came straggling out of the theatre. They didn't notice me at first, but just as they were rounding the corner out of the lobby, one of them turned around and stared at me oddly. He mouthed ""**do you need help?**"", and I nodded as discreetly as I could.

The guy came running up and threw his arm around my shoulders, saying things along the lines of ""thanks for waiting, babe. You ready to go? That was a great movie, huh? I'm glad we went in the end. Who's this guy?!"" The man instantly lets go of my hand, keeping his other hand in his pocket, and backs away quickly, mumbling how he just wanted a cigarette, and then he ran out of the emergency exit at the back of the lobby. 

My guy escorted me outside, and I was in such a state of shock that I think I just hugged him and ran away to my mom who had been waiting in the parking lot. I had been so sure that no one was going to help me, not even my friends, and in such a moment of panic I was really not thinking straight enough to follow the steps I should have (i.e. yell for help). 

Ever since, I've made an effort to make sure I'm aware of my surroundings just in case someone needs help but can't ask. Haven't ""saved"" anyone yet, but only time will tell! The extent of my ""paying it forward"" is saving girls from bad situations at the bar, nothing heroic yet, but hopefully I'll be able to help someone out when they really need it.

So, Reddit, what has a stranger done for you that made you want to pay it forward?

**TL;DR: 14yo me didn't go to the bathroom after a movie, ended up wanting to piss my pants while being harassed by a man in the lobby. Random guy pretended to be my boyfriend, scaring off the creep and potentially saving my life.**

JustRice,941,3075,dl5ol,2018,"Redditors frequently ask how they can counter protest or stop the WBC. Most of you are aware that they troll funerals with the intent of inciting a response. The ""Phelps-Chartered Firm"" is the legal arm of the WBC, located in Kansas.


Here's how we stop it: file a bar complaint with Kansas and get Phelps-Chartered Firm attorneys suspended/disbarred. Take it from a lawyer, a bar complaint is serious business and must be responded to. This is not an issue of whether WBC may express their opinion (they're legally permitted to do so), but whether the attorneys participating in this scheme are acting professionally and ethically. I contend that they are not.


**Step 1**

Print out a [complaint form](http://www.kscourts.org/pdf/complaintform.pdf) and fill out the required information. 


**Step 2**

The most important thing is to make proper allegations. Here's what I've come up with, feel free to submit or modify **(Edit: I would honestly encourage everyone to do their own research and determine if there are any other rules which you believe the Phelps-Chartered Firm violates. My letter is a template, not meant to be copied en masse. If you find the firm's actions disparaging to the profession, inform Kansas of your opinion in your own way.)**:

&gt;*This complaint is against members of the Phelps-Chartered Firm (""The Firm""), located in Kansas. Its members include, but are not limited to, Jonathan B. Phelps, Shirley Phelps Roper, Rachel I. Hockenbarger, Rebeka A. Phelps Davis, Margie J. Phelps. The Firm has violated the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct numerous times and continues to engage in acts which demean the legal profession.*

&gt;*The Firm is the exclusive counsel of the Westboro Baptist Church (""WBC""), with WBC providing the near-total source of work for The Firm. Every member of The Firm is a member of WBC. WBC is engaged in the practice of protesting high profile and military funerals throughout the United States with the purpose of inducing violent reaction against WBC members. The Firm is so closely involved with the operations of the WBC that it is an actual part of the WBC.*

&gt;*Members of The Firm have repeatedly violated Rule 8.4(http://www.kscourts.org/rules/Rule-Info.asp?r1=Rules+Relating+to+Discipline+of+Attorneys&amp;r2=2) of the Kansas Rules of Professional conduct. Members of The Firm have represented their client (WBC) with the knowledge that their client's actions will likely lead to an attempted battery or assault. Members of The Firm have conducted this representation with actual or constructive knowledge that their client's actions will lead others to engage in criminal violence against WBC, in direct violation of 8.4(a).*

&gt;*The Firm provides actual and constructive support of WBC's actions, which adversely reflects on the The Firm and its members' fitness to practice law, in violation of Rule 8.4(g). In addition The Firm's actions violate the Kansas Bar Association's Hallmarks of Professionalism as The Firm diminishes respect for the role of the lawyer in society and fails to respect all persons, regardless of gender, race, or creed.*

&gt;*As stated in the Scope of the Kansas Rules of Professional conduct, ""[t]he Rules do not, however, exhaust the moral and ethical considerations that should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules. The Rules simply provide a framework for the ethical practice of law."" Members of The Firm have acted unprofessionally, unethically and counseled their clients to induce others to violate the law. To permit their continued ability to practice law in Kansas would be a flagrant disregard of professional guidelines and would put the Kansas legal community into disrepute.*


**Step 3**

Mail this out to:

Office of the Disciplinary Administrator

701 Southwest Jackson, First Floor

Topeka, Kansas 66603


Please be respectful, articulate, and professional. Bar complaints are a serious business and the goal of this is not to inundate the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator with paperwork. The goal is to present reasonable arguments and public support as to why the Phelps-Chartered Firm should not be permitted to practice law in Kansas.

**tl;dr** Make a bar complaint against WBC lawyers with handy instructions provided.

**Just to be clear (because this has been a recurring point brought up): This is NOT an attempt to infringe WBC's free speech. If courts say the 1st Amendment permits them to protest funerals, so be it. I just find attorneys who protest funerals in this manner as unfit to have a license. This is not what attorneys should be known for and it is not how we should act. Model Rules of Professional Conduct exist in every US state and I believe that if this firm doesn't violate the letter of the law, it certainly violates the spirit of it.**",I hope this may help some of you since I see it asked so often: How EVERYONE can retaliate against the Westboro Baptist Church from the comfort of your home.,5093

Yama_Roo,1851,4878,142m0f,2008,"I think it's only fair that I start, if I'm going to ask others to share things that may be personal.

I'm male, 27 and have had HIV for 5 years. When I was 22, I moved out from San Diego to Kansas City to be with my boyfriend of 3 years. He just had heart surgery (he is only a year older than I am, it was due to a faulty valve) and wanted to move back home to Kansas City. I followed him and a month later he dumped me. 

I was stranded out here financially and trusted people I shouldn't have. After a couple quick failed relationships, I gave up on love and looked for lust (hey, it was still attention). I went online to find someone to play with, and we played bare, and that's all it took.

I didn't cope well. Most of my close friends backed away or abandoned me at the time. I stopped going to school, quit work, didn't pay the bills, and found myself on the streets. A friend took me in and told me to get my shit together, and I did.

Right now, I'm going to college full time, work in web design full time, been in a relationship for 4 years with someone who is HIV negative, and am taking life one day at a time.

Statistically, I'll die before my friends, but it has made me appreciate life a lot more and enjoy their company. It sucks, but I'm still alive, and that's what counts right? 

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me, went looking online for sex, got HIV. Have had it for 5 years.

EDIT: Couple of things since I've found similar questions being asked, and feel it's best to answer them here.

**What's life like with your HIV negative boyfriend?** It's fine. Small things have to be remembered. When playing with each other, we do things that are low risk. Oral (no swallowing) use condoms, jerk each other off. Those sorts of things. I'm a bottom so it is a very low risk, but low risk doesn't equal no risk. Other than that, when I get injured (I play rugby, and I rock climb) or hurt myself, I have to remind people not to get near my blood if they can avoid it. 

**Why is HIV more prevalent in the gay community?** Many reasons. Mostly that anal sex will usually tear part of the inner walls, causing blood. Those pipes weren't meant for that kind of abuse ultimately. That's why it's such high risk for bottoms. The vagina is a little more resilient, but it's still an exchange of fluids. Nothing is 100%, remember that.

**Why did you have sex without a condom?** Because I was caught up in the moment, didn't want to ruin it, and I'm an idiot.

**Why did I talk about this?** I don't look for sympathy in posting this. I've come to terms pretty easily. It was my fault and I deserve it. I'm doing this so others out there don't feel alone. Though we might have contracted HIV differently, most of us are dealing with the same things. It's good to let others know they're not alone.

EDIT 2: More things I missed

**How do you feel about people who make jokes about HIV/AIDS?** I have no right to complain honestly. I make jokes about it to make it easier, and I've used it to (jokingly) guilt trip someone into small things (""You can't just eat my yoghurt!"" ""But... I'm dying!"" ""God damn it! Fine, you can have it!""). I've also made jokes at the expense of others due to their plights so I'm not sure I have room to complain. Regardless, I've always had a sunny disposition about things so honestly I prefer humour over not talking about things. If you can make me laugh about what's trying to kill me, you must be an alright person. And yes, I laughed at the AIDS song in Team America (because that was a very good parody of RENT).

**Why were you getting tested so often?** Everyone should. If you're sexually active, it's the smartest thing to do. It protects you, and it protects those around you that you play with. I know it may seem a bit odd, but asking people for proof of their last test shouldn't be so damn hard in our society. Between offending someone for asking them for their resent STD test results, or getting HIV because you trusted someone, I'd pick the option that doesn't try to kill me. Get tested, and get the people you know to be tested. Awareness and education about these things are important. It shouldn't just be for the gay community.

**Why don't you fix your title?** I know, I know. I messed it up, and you can't edit titles. This is what I get for rushing the title to get to the body of the post. I've made a horrible mistake :(

LAST EDIT

**Why not do an AMA?** I wanted this to be more about everyone else, and an outlet for them to tell their stories, just in case they felt like no one else would listen to them, and the ability for people to read other's stories. Nothing about me is special. There are plenty of people who have HIV/AIDS, and have just as much if not more to say than I do. I don't feel there's really a demand for it, and since I have no scientific answer, but merely personal ones, I don't see how it would help others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an overwhelming number of positive posts in this thread, and it makes me happy. I appreciate the sentiments. 

For those who just spout of the first hateful thing you can, I'd love to refute the things you say, but it simply isn't worth the time. I don't know you, and you don't know me. It seems it'll stay that way.

For those that shared their stories, I thank you. It isn't always easy, and I appreciate it. For those letting others know they're loved and not alone, thank you. And for those who generally wanted to know more and read this, thank you. You guys are good people.

Sadly it's that time for me to pass out, so I won't be able to respond. I hope people keep up the discussion, and keep up the awareness. If this can keep even one person from having to go through the same thing, it was worth it already.

supersan,779,4447,ghal9,1984,"Ok, I run a website design site. On 2009 February, McAfee’s siteadvisor.com flagged one of my sites as “not safe” and anyone with McAfee virus scanner or toolbar is now told it has a virus and is blocked from visiting it (existing users have emailed me daily about this too).

What actually happened is they basically pulled links to all executable files on my hosting. They then run it via their virus scanner with heuristic scanning turned ON. What this basically means is that any file which McAfee scanner ""thinks"" is a virus is now flagged as one. Anyway, so they found a file on my domain and tagged it as virus called “Search threat library”. Their result is based on guesswork because it says on the page: “In our tests, this download contained programs **some people** would consider adware, spyware or other potentially unwanted programs.” Thank you, that’s not vague at all! Now the reason I know this file *cannot* be a virus is because I compiled it myself (with *Delphi*) and was not a public download either.

So, I wrote to them, their support told me they’ll re-scan my website. I waited patiently for weeks but the flag was not removed. Being a small webmaster, I said fuck it and I just deleted the file from my server this time (to a 404 page). Wrote to them again (this was few months ago). They did not even reply this time. I emailed them a few more times to finally get another canned reply that my site will be queued again for scanning. I patiently waited for weeks again but nothing happened. So now I am basically being punished for something I **never** did and a file which *doesn't even exist* on my server for the last six months. 

Then one day it suddenly hit me.. You see the thing is McAfee siteadvisor.com also sells these hacker-safe certificates to websites for $360 / year. With that in picture, this whole fucking thing just makes sense. This is just a ploy to sell those certificates. In internet-speak, this is how it works:

    * Find and flag random files as a generic virus (based on some guesswork scanning)
    * Flag the entire domain for hosting viruses and start blocking visitors to it.
    * Domain owner buys *hacker-safe* certificates for an inane $360/year to get site re-tested.
    * Profit!

My option now is to either buy their $360 hacker-safe badge or keep losing more business everyday.. I’m a small webmaster, even if they turn 10 people away daily, it hurts me bad :( I do not have the resources to hire a lawyer or send them legal notices either.

So, I can buy their stupid certificate but I have been **waiting patiently since 2009 February** to resolve this and being strong armed into buying their stupid certificate after all this time will be so fucking very unfair. So I'm posting here as my last ditch attempt. 

I'm desperate for ideas, Reddit. What are my options? Please help me.. 

**edit:** I can see this on the front page. woohoo! Hopefully someone from McAfee will see it now and reply. Also I don't mind if a blogger wants to contact me for more details to write about this little scam too. I've also emailed all details to *AHhHhh_shit* and he has also been a lot of help. My site has been listed on McAfee ever since 2009 Feb and finally i'm beginning to see some hope that someone will at least hear my case! Thank you again Reddit for being awesome. 

**edit 2:** the editors of two leading tech blogs  just contacted me for details last night (replying now). Also, a lot of people have replied (or PMed me) with their own sites and similar stories which only makes me happy that this is finally getting some attention. I wrote to McAfee again (as per turnipsoup's advise) but it will take two business days before we hear from them. I am amazed with the advice and help Reddit has offered me. I will definitely post an update too if something happens.

**edit 3:** my site is finally green again.. woohoo! reddit did it. Everyone who mailed/contacted McAfee on my behalf thank you! I have waited almost an year for this to happen and you guys did it in less than 2 days. I really can't thank you guys enough for your support.

While those cheats may be awesome, it's about time we got some new ones up there and i'm sure there are more than 30 cheat codes we could all use. I've messaged [Bacongobbler](http://www.reddit.com/user/bacongobbler) - A redditor who makes AmA's into comprehensive, easy to read and straightforward lists about doing the same with the cheat codes so they're easier to read. 

That's about it, I'll start us off:

1. When you go to a restaurant where they bring you your drink in a cup/glass, ask for no ice or for ice on the side. Often what they do is load your drink with ice so that it seems as if there's more in there, especially at bars.

2. When you pour soda, pour it along the side of the cup instead of directly into it - like they do at bars. This keeps alot of the ""fizzyness"" in the drink and as a result, it keeps a lot of the texture and flavor.

3. If you need to withdraw more money than your limit, if you do it quickly enough, you can withdraw your limit twice from the same ATM and sometimes the one next to it before it stops you from withdrawing any more.

Thanks for your submissions!

**EDIT:** Woah! Front page! Bacongobbler replied and said he'd be able to make the list sometime today.

Jonnism,5473,11461,11ofxj,1975,"It was six years ago when I was eighteen. I had been in my first year of college so needless to say my student diet wasn't that great. My boyfriend and I were house sitting for a friend and on the third night there I was awoken to the most terrible stabbing pain in my stomach. I tried to get to the bathroom but I ended up collapsing on the floor in a near fetal position, barely able to breathe and sweating profusely. My boyfriend hears me fall and gets up to see what is wrong. I can't speak, the pain is so great and I am having a hard time breathing so he painstakingly leads me to our friends car and drives me to the hospital. 

At this point I'm in so much pain from him not really knowing how to drive a stick and jerking and stalling along the way that he has to go in and ask for assistance. I'm loaded onto a gurney and strapped in because the outstretched position nearly kills me with pain and I start lashing out. After the doctor cuts off my clothes and sees no outward injuries on my stomach, he begins to compress on my stomach which nearly makes me pass out. He thinks my appendix must have burst, or that I had a ruptured intestine. I'm administered IV Morphine and finally get some relief. 

They roll me down the hall and take some instagrams of my stomach. To get the X-rays back takes a while, so while we were all awaiting the pics I was administered more morphine. Eventually, a big woman with a Texas accent enters the room and exclaims, ""You're full of shit!""

""What?"" I ask, completely confused and holding my stomach. ""I'm serious. I'm in a lot of pain.""

""Oh, no doubt,"" she said, and pulls out an X-ray of my stomach. ""See all that white in your guts?"" She points with her pen and traces all the way from my anus up through my large intestines. ""You are LITERALLY full of shit. I have never seen someone so full of shit in my life.""

My boyfriend erupts in laughter and the nurse is trying her best to hide her amusement as she has been tending me through the hours and knows that I am obviously in a lot of pain. I groan but am a bit amused myself. It WAS pretty funny, after all. I ask the doctor what they were going to do about it and she said that they were going to do an enema and see how that went. I was given laxatives and a ton of water and told to wait 20 minutes. I can feel my stomach rumbling a bit at this point and it hurts me a lot when it does. 

Eventually a nurse wheels in what looks like a dominatrix sex rack, complete with ankle and wrist straps. My boyfriend again erupts into a fit of laughter. I am not amused this time. I'm starting to get a bit embarrassed so before we begin I ask that he leave. He pretty much begs me to let him stay but I'm having none of it. After he leaves the nurse wheels in what looks to be some sort of futuristic pressure washer; I'm pretty much right. 

She straps my ankles and wrists to the rack in an upright position and proceeds to insert the tube into my ass. It's uncomfortable and cold, but hey, I'm gay so it's like.. whatever. She then turns it on, and like the first mate on the Titanic begins to slowly increase power and pressure. I can feel and SEE my stomach begin to inflate slightly and OH MERCY does it hurt like nothing else. It felt like knives were pushing OUT of me now, ever so slowly. I cry out but she insists ***MORE POWER*** and I keep filling up like a balloon, hollering in agony. After a minute or so of constant pressure she turns it off and tells me to clench up because she was removing the tube. I want nothing more than to do just the opposite, but I assume she knows what she's doing and follow orders. She then attached another tube to a hose and inserts it. This one is MUCH bigger and the lube is cold as fuck, but I'm gay so it's still whatever. 

She then proceeds to Hoover my mother fucking insides. After 30 seconds I hear a ""hmmm"". I ask her what the problem was and she told me nothing was coming out but I beg her not to pressure wash my guts again. At this time the doc comes in as she's pulling out my butt plug and informs me that the shit packed in my colon is too wide in girth to be machine enema'd out. She was going to have to do this manually. 

She has the nurse grab a bucket, a plain white janitors bucket and puts it underneath me. She then puts on the latex gloves, completely lubes up her hands and begins what I consider to be some sort of medical fingerbang to loosen me up. After a while of this (I was trying to keep my mind focused on something other than this butch P.E. teacher-lookin' southern woman giving me assplay legally so I wasn't keeping track of time) she brings out a stretching device and begins to open me with it. At this point I feel so ashamed of myself, but I'm also doped out of my mind. The pain begins to come back in full force and I start shouting for more painkillers but Lady McGuyver down there tells me that they can't administer more because it will stop me up even more. I'm just going to have to deal with it until they can ""unclog me"". So, I endure as I'm being stretched. It hurts like hell down on my asshole, too. I feel her fingers in there and she tells me to push. So, I push. I push so hard that I feel like the blood vessels in my face are popping. My head starts to bang. I'm pushing hard and she's telling me to push more. I must have been screaming my head off. I can't imagine that I wasn't. Finally, I felt something give. She told me to push more and I did I could feel things moving. So, I push some more. After a minute I finally feel myself deflating as water and shit debris tumble out into the bucket. It all happened very quick after that. I was unobstructed and gushing hot lava a minute later and finally felt complete, utter, blissful relief. 

I was told after I woke up in the hospital 8 hours later, around 5 PM, that the doc literally helped deliver my shit child. I had never been more embarrassed in my life. But, as time passes, and my humor ""evolves"", I find myself laughing about it. I changed my diet immediately after and have a good healthy bowel movement at least once a day. I found it strange how my depression lifted a lot after that. I had been severely depressed for a couple of weeks before that and I found out that being constipated does that. 

So, your turn!

**TL;DR** Got severely constipated so much that I had to go to the ER, where enemas and laxatives didn't work. A woman doctor had to crank my asshole open and help me deliver a shit baby with her hands.

[deleted],4107,1728,e02zc,1966,"Relationship hacks:

1) When she's not around, go check the labels on her shoes, shirts, pants, bra, and underwear. Measure one of her necklaces to see what length she likes. Pocket one of her rings, take it to a jeweler and have them tell you what size it is. Write all of these sizes down.

2) At some point she will ask you to buy tampons for her. It happens. When you go to the store, buy 3 small packages of her brand. Give her one and hide the other two in your car (near the spare tire, she'll never look there). Next time she asks you to buy her some you can just go to the bar and have a beer instead of actually going to the store.

3) Never buy a diamond. Cubic zirconia and moissanite look just as good, and man-made diamonds are getting easier to find every year.

Edit: To clarify #3, there doesn't need to be any deception. It's just stupid to pay $1500 for a worthless rock. Go buy a $300 ring, propose, if she says yes then tell her that you bought a ring with a synthetic stone because you don't enjoy funding civil wars. If you still feel the obligation to verify your love with a poor financial decision, give her a $1200 gift certificate to a bridal store.

jrouble,1714,7614,xpsnl,1966,"The organization I work for is one of the largest employers in the country, their annual profits (public information) could fund a small country, or purchase half of Africa, for obvious reasons that is all I'm going to say to indicate the scale of this matter.

A few months ago, a form circulated through nearly every major department. We were given no explanation on what this form was for, even when asking managers etc. Their responses were always vague and something along the lines of ""it's for training purposes.""

I tried to politely decline filling out one of these forms which required all kinds of personal information but was told in no uncertain terms ""I had to"" - now I know in a perfect world I would have stuck it to the man, but I have rent to pay and I get dizzy if I don't eat at least twice every 24 hours. First world problems!

Today, the reason we were ""forced"" to sign this form became apparent (to me at least) - a small group of employees from my department were invited into a room to complete the aforementioned ""training.""

Now this training was supposed to have taken place over a period of months - which they illegally back dated all the paper work to reflect. A facilitator was supposed to monitor and observe our competencies and have us complete a number of practical tasks as well as fill out some written short answer questions, multiple choice, standard stuff.

Instead, they had us fraudulently complete the assessments by feeding us the answers, filling in all the sections with competent where the trainer should have, place back dates and numerous other fallacies all over this thing, and then sign, date it and hand it back like it was nothing to worry about.

Here is the kicker, for every hour spent by this imaginary facilitator over the imaginary period of imaginary months, observing us and training us to be competent in this particular area, they are receiving government funding, subsidization and kick backs. 

Now don't get me wrong I know it's pretty commonplace for corporations to make their training ""fool proof"" pad it out and do some spoon feeding. But straight up lying and then making your employees a party to it, all under the guise of something very vague in an environment where major line managers are there and it's unbelievably uncomfortable to be the guy who says ""Hey, something is not right here"" - which I did at stage 1 on multiple occasions only to be shot down is not something anyone should have to endure in a professional environment.

I'm kind of at a loss as to what I should do, am I over reacting and being an asshat about this? I consider myself to be a more or less good person, I value morals, you can sugar coat it and say who cares or whatever but at the end of the day, this is pure and simple.

A massive corporation fraudulently acquiring government kickbacks, which taxpayers then have to foot the bill for, when said company already makes squillions more than necessary for any one to be happy with. I feel like I've been made an accessory to some greedy low act and I am not happy about it.

I don't know whether to try and ask someone about it, I have a feeling that would go badly. I could try to deal with it internally, I also have a feeling that would go very badly, and know from experience that it has for others in the past. Or I could go to an independent watchdog type organization and become a full on whistleblower....

Conflicted, help me reddit, what do? This is not sitting right with me at all.


PS.

Did some very approximate number crunching based on the limited information that I do have for sure, if they did this with all the staff in my department alone which is a small fragment of the total organization, they would stand to gain in excess of $1.7million in tax payer funds.

Multiply that out across the entire organization, I cringe at the very idea of what that final number would be.","Corporate Whistleblower, should I do it?",9580
