eternalkerri,350,1297,12wfcz,2554,"In the past two days we have had two threads, one about Puerto Rico statehood and one about ""Why is the South so Conservative"".

Both threads were rather popular, but both were full of empty answers, stereotypes, pun threads, circle-jerking, outright bad information, wild baseless speculation, political soapboxing, and outright awfulness.

Both threads have been nuked from orbit.

We have had a massive influx of new users, who apparently have not bothered to familiarize themselves with the culture of this sub.  The top tier/lower tier answer and casual comment rule is being wildly abused.  Subjects are drifting WAY off topic.  There is to many unsupportable answers.  There is to much of getting up on a soap box to lecture the sub about your political beliefs.

Simply put, it is being abused, and the moderators are going to have to play Social Worker.  

1. Unless the jokes are relevant, they will be removed....and even that is getting pushed to the breaking point.  Meta threads are really the only place where we are looser with the rules on this.

1. Stay on topic or relevant.  Your trip to the gas station today or the pizza you ate today had better be relevant, or it goes.

1. Keep it in /r/politics.  No seriously, I'm not kidding.  Any discussion of modern politics after the early 90's will be nuked.  It has to be VERY RELEVANT to be allowed after that.

1. Posts had better start being backed up, no more idle speculation.  There are far to many posts that are just random wild guesses, half-informed, or are based on what is honestly a grade-school level of understanding of the material.  

This sub has grown massively based on it's reputation, and we are going to maintain it.  You, the user base has to help maintain that reputation, downvote posts that are not fitting of this subs standards, report spam and garbage posts, and hold each other to a higher standard.  

The moderation team does not want to have to turn this completely into /r/askscience in it's strict posting standards, but if we cannot trust the user base to police itself, we will have to continue to enact tougher and tougher standards until this sub becomes what is honestly an overly dry and boring place.

Id_rather_be_eating,352,944,1247fn,2417,"I find the idea of Law Enforcement fascinating.  We take for granted that if a law is broken there will be a group of well funded, motivated people to discover who is responsible and hand out justice.  I know that a ""public police force"" is a relatively new development in history but also assume that most cultures have been against having friends and family killed.  

So what was the process to figure out who did it without the modern police?  I assume most murders happen in private.  If someone killed my brother I'd want to know who was responsible.  It's in everyone's best interest to catch the person.  Any special methods or rights given to investigators?

The panelists also have expertise in caring for a world-class collection and know what it’s like working in one of the most visited museums in the world. Questions on museum work are also welcome.

The panelists include:

Allan Needell, curator of human space flight in the Space History Division
I will answer questions about the Museum’s Apollo artifacts and current plans to completely redo our exhibit on the early U.S. Human Space flight programs through Apollo. I am especially interested in what people want to see in a Smithsonian Apollo exhibit and what about that period is deemed most interesting and important (and why).

Jennifer Levasseur, museum specialist in Space History
I will address questions regarding small astronaut equipment including space food and hygiene equipment, astronaut photography and cameras, our post-Apollo spaceflight collection, and acquiring objects from NASA.

Cathleen Lewis, curator of international space programs and spacesuits
I will answer questions about the museum’s spacesuit collection and the history of spacesuit development.  

Lisa Young, museum conservator
I will address inquiries pertaining to the conservation and preservation of the spacesuits at the Museum; material analysis and identification of spacesuit hard and soft goods; display and storage of spacesuits; and conservation questions related to spacesuit materials found on related Apollo-era objects in the National collection.

eternalkerri,1693,766,1bd62c,1661,"Over the past year r/AskHistorians has grown from a small community of historinerds to a subreddit that gets touted on r/AskReddit as a “must-have.” While the consistent influx of new subscribers (~10K per month on average over the past 6 months) has brought new contributors and new viewpoints, it has also meant that a lot of the same historical ground gets covered, re-covered, and covered again.

The mods of r/AskHistorians have attempted to contain this repetition by pointing questioners to our FAQ, and many contributors to this sub have done the same (for which we thank you!). This has not been enough though, and certain topics get brought up so frequently as to drown out other areas of inquiry. We mods have thought long and hard about how to handle this, but have unanimously settled on the following rule changes as the only viable solution to the problem:


1)  **No more questions about Hitler**  We are constantly saturated by questions about what did Hitler think of cap and trade, the infield fly rule, Coke or Pepsi.  It delves into the absurd at times, and honestly blocks the access to better questions.  Therefore, in order to improve the quality of the sub, we will spin all Hitler questions off into /r/askaboutHitler.  A sub completely dedicated to the history of Adolf Hitler.

2)  **Starting next week (4/8), r/AskHistorians will no longer be accepting questions about World War II. Those posted will be removed.**  This may seem like a drastic measure – we mods acknowledge this – but we also feel that it is the only way to keep our community asking fresh and interesting questions about history. At this point, there is simply nothing left to ask and answer about WWII in this subreddit; everything has been covered already. In the future, we may phase out other topics that have been frequently and completely covered, such as Rome and Vikings. In the meantime, make sure to visit the new queue and upvote intriguing and novel questions there! Just not ones about Nazis.  Please visit the future /r/askaboutWWII for your questions.



3)  **Poll type questions will return with a twist**.  We removed poll type questions like ""Which General had the nicest uniform,"" or ""Which King was the most Kingly"" because they were heavily subjective and full of bad information.  However, they were also immensely popular.  So, we decided to re-allow them with a twist.  If you want to ask a poll question, as the OP you must now keep editing your post to keep a tally of all the answers and reasons within your top post.  This allows people to keep from repeating answers.

4)  **Jesus is real.  End of story**.  After constant incessant and heated argument, in order to prevent further discord, we have decided to go with the majority opinion of the historical community and state that Historical Jesus is real.  If he was the son of God is still debatable, but it is outside of the purview of this sub.  We will delete any further questions or assertions that Jesus did not historically exist.

5)  **All first hand sources from Greece or Rome must be posted in the original language.**  Due to the heavily contentious nature at times of various translations and word usage, only citations of Greece and Roman literature must be in the original language so that we may see and be able to interpret the wording that you are using.  This allows us to further analyse the first person source.  We will be partnering with /r/linguistics to properly interpret these posts.  

6)  **Going forward all conspiracy nuts, racists, homophobes, and sexists will be pre-emptively banned**.  Going forward, AnOldHope, Eternalkerri, and Algernon_Asimov, will begin going through sexist, racist, and biggoted subs collecting user names and pre-emptively banning those users before they can participate in this sub and try to sneak in bad history.

7)  **Artrw will be stepping down as mod at the end of May**  Art will be backpacking through Europe this summer, and not have access to the internet regularly.  This will leave me as the senior moderator on this sub.  I know this might be a source of concern for you, but I assure you, all the other moderators support this, and will usher in some major changes in the sub going forward.

8)  **We will be allowing pictures from /r/historicalrage and [Historic LOLs](http://roflrazzi.cheezburger.com/history).**  People have often complained that we are to serious here, so we will begin experimenting with allowing a few meme jokes.  This will allow us to not be seen as such a stuffy and unfun sub.  We want users to enjoy themselves, and feel that these are relative comics and can serve a decent purpose here.

9)  **Due to complaints from multiple users, all dates must be cited in both Gregorian, but culturally specific dates**.  This means all dates involving Muslims must be cited in the Muslim Calender, Chinese the Chinese calender, Jewish dates in the Jewish calender, etc.  We do not wish to offend any users culture, and are doing this to accommodate them and bridge a cultural divide. 

10)  **Sports questions are exempt from the 20 year rule**  Due to the growing disinterest in academic study of sports, we are exempting all sports from the 10 year rule.  This will hopefully increase the academic interest in athletics not only currently but in the study of the past.


We understand the gravity of these changes, and understand that they will be contentious, that is why they will not be implemented for a week.  This will allow the community to adapt to these changes, and discuss it amongst themselves.  However, they will not be subject to being dis-allowed; the moderation team has discussed this heartily in back channels and agree that these changes are for the best for the sub.

Thank you, and enjoy your Easter.  God Bless.

Cenodoxus,329,289,1c29lu,1177,"Hi everyone. I'm Cenodoxus. I pester the subreddit a lot about all matters North Korea, and because the country's been in the news so much recently, we thought it might be timely to run an AMA for people interested in getting more information on North Korean history and context for their present behavior.

A little housekeeping before we start:

 - **/r/AskHistorians is relaxing its ban on post-1993 content for this AMA.** A lot of important and pivotal events have happened in North Korea since 1993, including the deaths of both Kim il-Sung and Kim Jong-il, the 1994-1998 famine known as the ""Arduous March"" (고난의 행군), nuclear brinkmanship, some rapprochement between North and South Korea, and the Six-Party Talks. This is all necessary context for what's happening today.

 - **I may be saying *I'm not sure* a lot here.** North Korea is an extremely secretive country, and solid information is more scanty than we'd like. Our knowledge of what's happening within it has improved tremendously over the last 25-30 years, but there's still a lot of guesswork involved. It's one of the reasons why academics and commenters with access to the same material find a lot of room to disagree.

I'm also far from being the world's best source on North Korea. Unfortunately, the good ones are currently being trotted around the international media to explain if we're all going to die in the next week (or are else holed up in intelligence agencies and think tanks), so for the moment you're stuck with me.

 - **It's difficult to predict anything with certainty about the country.** Analysts have been predicting the collapse of the Kim regime since the end of the Cold War. Obviously, that hasn't happened. I can explain why these predictions were wrong, I can give the historical background for the threats it's making today, and I can construct a few plausible scenarios for what is *likely* happening among the North Korean elite, but I'm not sure I'd fare any better than others have in trying to divine North Korea's long-term future. Generally speaking, prediction is an art best left to people charging $5.00/minute over psychic hotlines.

 - **Resources on North Korea for further reading:** [This is a list of English-language books and statistical studies](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78zzl9) on North Korea that you can also find on the [/r/AskHistorians Master Book List](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). All of them except Holloway should be available as e-books (and as Holloway was actually [published online](http://www.aidanfc.net/a_year_in_pyongyang.html), you could probably convert it).

I'm currently reading History: a very short introduction by John H. Arnold in which he decries this portrayal of battles (perpetrated in his particular gripe by Renaissance historians). It got me wondering: what exactly did happen before a medieval battle like this? Would a leader ever address the troops as a whole body? How did soldiers know when the battle had actually started and they were supposed to be charging or shooting or whatever? 

Another common image is the leaders of each side riding out to meet each other and try and convince each other to back down before the actual fighting starts.

Some examples, off the top of my head:

* I think George Bush I had some kills as a pilot in WWII (Wiki said he personally dropped bombs on at least one occasion).
* Between the Spanish-American war and his time in the NYPD, there is no way Teddy Roosevelt killed fewer than half a dozen men.

[Here's the comment I talked about.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jxpt3/til_when_alexander_the_great_was_a_child_his/cbjdn12)

I concluded that you'd have to know something about ancient history and the context of the story: what was Alexander's life like, how reliable was the person wrote this down, how often Alexander did things like this, did the contemporary people often make up something like this for the sake of propaganda or a cult of personality, was there lots of outlandish stories like this that actually have been verified by multiple sources etc. 

I don't even know if these factors are important or if there's more things you'd have to take into account. Until you know something about the context, it's really hard to estimate how likely or unlikely this event actually was.

I don't know any of that so that's why I am asking you. How likely is it that this event actually happened in some form? Whether or not this took place: why was this written and who was meant to read it?

_____

edit. Sorry, I didn't notice that it says in the beginning of the book that: 

&gt;This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents either are the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental

So this question might be pointless...

edit 2. actually it isn't, [pqvarus said in the comments that this anecdote is authentic](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jybwx/there_was_til_today_how_alexander_the_great_sent/cbjilp5)

&gt;It would seem, namely, that Leonidas, as Alexander was one day sacrificing and taking incense with both hands to throw upon the altar-fire, said to him:—‘Alexander, when thou hast conquered the spice-bearing regions thou canst be thus lavish with thine incense; now, however, use sparingly what thou hast.’ Accordingly, Alexander now wrote him: ‘I have sent thee myrrh and frankincense in abundance, that thou mayest stop dealing parsimoniously with the gods.’",There was TIL today how Alexander the Great sent 18 tons of spices to his tutor as a joke.

MrMetamucil,117,451,1ny2sl,1147,"I searched Wikipedia and Google and came up with next to nothing in terms of explanations for the grammatical quirk.

The sources were uninformative or unreliable, and as a layman, I'm not exactly sure where to look, so I hope this question isn't boring or obvious!

Is this a result of the translation from Sanskrit to English? Or is there some greater meaning in using ""I am"" as opposed to ""I have""? does the use of the present tense serve to indicate a sense of timelessness, either of Vishnu or death itself?

Today we will be doing a panel on the history of sexuality. The field is a relatively recent one, and has really only been around since the 1970's (though there are no doubt earlier historians that prefigured and modeled the field.) Most accounts of the field begin with [Michel Foucault](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault) and his [The History of Sexuality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality). 

The history of sexuality (among other things) tries to discover how people in earlier times interacted with each other and identified themselves on the most basic, human level. As our panel shows, historians have taken this field in a number of different ways, from discussing the history of romance in the Roman world to the stories of gays and lesbians in the Weimar and Nazi periods.

Without further ado, let's go to our panel for today:

* /u/caffarelli: able to talk about the romantic and sexual lives of eunuchs. I focus especially on the castrati of 18th century Europe but I've recently been researching the eunuch traditions in the Middle East, China and Byzantium as well.


* /u/heyheymse : able to talk about the history of romance and sexuality in the Roman world and, to a lesser extent, the Classical world as a whole. I focus particularly on sexual morality and immorality in the late Republic/early Empire.


* /u/naturalog : able to answer questions about queer (especially lesbian) sexualities during the Weimar and Nazi periods (post-WWI to WWII Europe, but especially Germany). (Will be posting about 2PM Eastern Time)

* /u/cephalopodie studies late 19th and 20th century American gay and lesbian history. I am particularly interested in the relationship between sexuality and culture, and how American gay and lesbian communities created unique social customs and institutions. I'm happy to answer any questions about homosexuality in American culture. (Won't be answering questions until 4:30 PST)

* /u/victoryfanfare who is able to answer questions about the intersections between Sexuality, Gender and Race

* /u/vertexoflife who studies the history of pornography in Europe, from the Early Modern (1500) to the Victorian periods. I'm most knowledgeable about England from 1700-1850 but I'm more than happy to answer any questions you might have about book history, pornography, or anything related from 1500-1850 throughout the continent.

Recent events in my life have caused me to re-evaluate priorities in life.  This ranges from my job, to my academic career, to my love life, my hobbies, to well...a ton of things. 

With what I want to accomplish in my life going forward, the internet will be a bit of a distraction. Instead of looking at history subs or web comics, short news articles, etc., I'm looking to accomplish things that will improve my quality of life, my personal happiness

So, I want to take a step back from moderating for a while until I can achieve a balance in my life. I don't want to quit at all. I love this place. I'm proud of it. As lame as it sounds, it's actually a source of pride for me when I talk to people in real life. I discovered this place when I went to create ""askhistorians"" myself, just to discover Artrw had already created it. I knew right away, I wanted to make this place awesome, just like askscience. I started participating, helping to create the academic, professional atmosphere it has today. I created many of the formative rules that we adhere to still, and helped pick some of the first of the new moderators. I've enjoyed every bit of it.  This is my internet child.

That's why I don't want to quit in total and walk away. I still like this place, and want to be a part. What I would like to do, is take on the role of 'moderator emeritus' (my flair would change to denote that status). I would not always be involved in the daily running of this sub, I would not be active in deciding flair, or bans, or major rule changes. I would sometimes offer my two cents worth if I feel it is necessary, advise on things, participate if summoned. This would mean that I still am a moderator, I'm just...less active and not necessary to make minor changes to the sub.

Perhaps in time I would be more active once I have achieve a work/life balance that works better for me. Yet, as it stands now I want to start to step back, and well...take some me time. Become a better person in the world away from the internet.

My understanding/summary from y'all's help; comments/discussion on this would be great, especially if I've misunderstood something:

Carter isn't **technically** correct because at least one shot was fired by Americans during Operation Eagle Claw. However, that was *extremely* small, and was literally just a few shots, so he's right there were no major boots-on-the-ground operations or aerial campaigns by the US military under his administration

HOWEVER - he funded actions that were arguably proxy wars, providing logistical support to Mobutu (but not lethal weaponry directly) in Zaire. His administration also funded the mujahideen, Ethiopian fighters, and later Somali fighters when the Soviets began supporting the Ethiopians. Support for the Nicaraguan contras began under Carter as well.

All this was largely logistic support, and Carter did indeed generally avoid directly providing weapons to anybody for proxy wars. 

Not so in Indonesia. The Carter administration, according to comments below, **provided weapons and funds to support the brutal and murderous Indonesian invasion of East Timor.** where the number of civilian casualties, while disputed, [seems comparable to the ongoing war in Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor#East_Timorese_casualties)

With this information, we can all be the judge of how peaceful the Carter administration was - I argue that we need to also consider it in relation to other post-war administrations, but should be careful in using such relativistic standards as basis for normative judgment.

**tl;dr:** He's ALMOST right, technically, but deciding how meaningful the statement really is requires some higher critical thinking.","""We never dropped a bomb. We never fired a bullet.

I first heard about this a few years ago when I read [this post](http://www.cracked.com/forums/index.php?topic=71139.msg1594966#msg1594966) on the Cracked forums:

&gt;Most of us are incapable of fathoming such evil that is child molestation, especially incest.  And so we almost never suspect it, even under the most dire evidence.  I read once that the misconception that it's possible to catch an STD from a toilet seat arose because of such obliviousness.  Doctors couldn't understand why children were catching the same infections their parents had.  It seemed the only possible answer.

That post caught my eye when I first saw it, but I never looked into it. For whatever reason, I recently remembered it and decided to do a bit of research.

From [Lynn Sacco](http://works.bepress.com/lynn_sacco/):

http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Th-W/Venereal-Disease.html

&gt;Doctors were vexed as to how so many girls had become infected, particularly those from white middle- and upper- class families, which white professionals considered respectable. Many white professionals believed that only foreign or ignorant men abused their daughters and so assumed that INCEST occurred only in poor, working-class, immigrant, or African-American families. When the evidence increasingly pointed to men from their own class, doctors, public health officials, social reformers, and educators speculated that girls could become infected from nonsexual contacts with toilet seats, towels, or bedding–modes of transmission doctors had already rejected for adults and boys. Doctors based their speculation on the fact that the epithelial lining of girls' genitals is so thin that it provides little protection against bacteria. They knew it was unlikely that soiled objects could spread gonorrhea because the bacteria dry quickly when exposed to air, yet without proof that even one girl had become infected after using the school toilet, from 1900 to the 1940s, health care professionals ignored the possibility of sexual assault and insisted instead that girls faced the greatest risk of exposure in the school lavatory.

http://www.faqs.org/childhood/In-Ke/Incest.html

&gt;Historians have shown how twentieth-century rhetoric may have hidden more abuse than it exposed. The strangerperpetrator, so threateningly portrayed in mid-twentieth-century media, diverted attention from more likely perpetrators in the home. Freud's notion of children's innate sexuality and his belief that memories of sexual abuse represented unconscious wishes stressed the erotic nature of children and caused many professionals to question the validity of memories of sexual abuse. Even as concern about sexual abuse grew throughout most of the twentieth century, most experts resisted the idea that incest might be common.

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;While the bacteria which cause gonorrhoea could survive for several hours in dried purulent discharge on a toilet seat, the survey failed to find any. Nonsexual transmission from toilet seats is not impossible, just very unlikely. The authors give some interesting ways in which pathogens can be transmitted.

I happen to know that American WW2 soldiers (the part of history I know best) would commonly modify their issued uniforms by cutting off the chin strap on their helmet because it had a thin metal piece that could cut the neck. They would also often tape together their dog tags to prevent them clinking which would later cause rubber silencers to be made. Because of a lack of winter clothing, US soldiers would cut holes in bedsheets and use them to aid winter camouflage.

I've even heard (moreso in Vietnam) that American officers would sometimes order the removal of rank insignia from uniforms so that snipers would have a harder time picking off officers. Cutting off local flora and using it to aid camouflage is probably pretty old, but the advice is in fact in the US army manual on camouflage.

My main area of interest is racial and gender history in the USA, so I've mainly read articles relating to that, but would love to know if there's anything in particular that you guys think is essential reading before I lose it.

Mods, sorry if this is an inappropriate post! Feel free to delete it if so.

Thanks in advance guys! :)

Yui108,140,224,1mxmey,781,"Was just wondering about this the other day. Has there been an ongoing decay of British royal power?

kinkykusco,394,423,18s8yr,779,"Today I came across several posts to a question about how Lincoln was perceived.  Unholycheese copy-pasted in several relevant, informative and timely sections from two different high-quality sources which answered OP's question, and he cited where he took them from.  EternalKerri stated this was not acceptable on this sub, and I asked (and still wonder) why copy-paste info, *when it's of high quality*, is not wanted here.  

This led to a series of back and forth posts between several other users and mods, and ended with most of the comments being deleted, and a new rule specifically outlawing copy-pasted information being the bulk of a post.  Here's what I have a problem with:

Sometimes there won't be a user who's an authority on a subject.  If it's proclaimed that the only good content here is original content, some questions will not get answered.  Sure, the user in question could have added some BS lines of his own commentary to supplement the quotes, but he/she probably wasn't an expert on the subject, and that would have at best added nothing to the discussion.  Also,

One of the replies I got to my [polite question on what was the matter with his post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/18rhoh/how_was_lincoln_portrayed_in_the_confederacy/c8hfovv), from /u/eternalkerri was downright rude.  The comment was deleted, so I've pasted it below:

&gt;Because anyone can bloody google and go look at an article. People come here for discussion, for an analysis, and for information, not any little thing they can look up themselves.
&gt;And this was addressed in a moderator post over a month ago..
&gt;Copypasta is against the rules. Period.
  

Ignoring the fallacies in his/her argument, I'm not going to continue to contribute to a subreddit where I get berated and swore at by the mods, especially when their own rules state ""Flaired users are held to a higher standard. They must be polite, helpful, and comprehensive in every comment they make.""  

This subreddit still has a lot of great content - probably the majority of it is.  The issue I have is the mods have swung so far to the dictatorial side of moderating that good, quality content is getting deleted even when it's the only answer to a question, and users are getting flamed for asking questions.  /r/askscience should be a model for how an academic subreddit should be run - they ask for and strive to get the most helpful, usually original content answer to each question that's possible, but their moderation isn't so onerous as to delete completely accurate, helpful information which probably answers the question better than any redditor could, just because it was copied from a historical journal.

And they definitely don't delete it, then edit their rules retroactively when the users protest.  I'd paste in that post too, but the thread I'm referencing has now been obliterated.

tl;dr, this is a quality thread that's being stifled by moderation for the sake of moderation.   And also mod's like eternalkerri posting quality posts such as:

&gt;Okay William Wallace (or based on your posting history Che).
&gt;Spare us the ""MAH FREEDOMS!"" rhetoric.
&gt;I get it, you believe in the freedoms of teh interwebs. Well, sorry. Thats not how it works here. The moderators create and enforce the rules. These are the rules, and they are enforced. You don't like it, go kill a Russian nobleman.
&gt;And yes, I am the mean mod.

**Edit** - I want to clarify that while I disagree with not allowing copy-pasted posts of quality material, the reason I'm abandoning this subreddit is because of the behavior of the mods.  /u/eternalkerri chose in this thread to double down about his/her behavior.  If the mods are going to judiciously enforce rules that are not posted on the rules list, while ignoring their own rules, I'm not going to contribute any more [quality](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16fdu8/strong_supporters_of_the_us_constitutions_2nd/c7vo90o) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14vjli/were_people_allowed_to_move_freely_within/c7h0cb3) to this subreddit.  /r/AskSocialScience might be smaller and a bit lawless, but I'll take that to what's happening to this subreddit.",[Meta] Why I'm leaving this subreddit,1202

* /u/caffarelli can cover the castrati (castrated male soprano/contralto singers), as well as general eunuch questions about the physicalities of castration, including sex, what they looked like, and how ‘the deed was done.’ And, as someone here once saw my flair and asked me if I *was* a castrato, let’s get it out of the way: I’m a lady, with all my ladyparts! 

(Quick disclaimer: /u/caffarelli is too poor for cable and does not watch Game of Thrones, so if you’re asking a question based on the eunuchs who are in that show please give me some background!) 

* /u/lukeweiss can talk about the Chinese court eunuchs and their role in Imperial China 

* /u/Ambarenya can talk about the Byzantine imperial eunuchs and their role in Byzantium and the early Christian church

I want to know, from a proven and historical standpoint, what the overall consensus was on Hitler as far as what motivated him to be arguably the most influential figure of an entire century, when many of you here at AskHistorians basically make it out to seem like he basically caught lightening in a bottle, got lucky early via the element of surprise, but ultimately fell victim to his Breaking Bad-esque pride.

Being raised a Jew I was taught, and I quote (from Hebrew school): ""The guy was just batshit insane."" This isn't to oversimplify what he did in reality or what you all research, but people don't just flat out surprise the world and try and conquer it all the time.

Obviously, even if Hitler HAD flat out said to someone holding a tape recorder, ""Look, guys, I knew my whole life I wanted to rule the world, kill the Jews, etc,"" that'd only be his own self-analysis with his own personal self-awareness, which it seems he didn't have much of.

**""Skogsrå"" or Huldra**
http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogsr%C3%A5et
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldra

A beautiful woman, sometimes naked, that seduces wanderers and hunters in the forest. Seen from behind, her true form appears, either hollowed out lik an old tree or ugly. In some parts of sweden its only a foxtail that peeks out from her dress that can warn her victims.
Can also give gifts from the forest, such as luck with hunting.
Steals the souls of the men she beds.

Also, this creature has a counterpart in the folklore of the coast, where she comes to sailors and fishermen and trades their soul for sex, luck with fishing and most importantly for the fisherman - the promise that the sea will never take him, no matter how horrible the weather.

To understand the implications of this story, you must know about the superstitions regarding women and ships that prevailed  for a long time in sweden. No woman where allowed onto a ship, even meeting a woman while on the way to your boat was enough to bring bad luck.



**""Näcken"" The Neck** 
A young attractive naked male, appearing in water streams, often depicted as playing an instrument, often a fiddle.
Is said to lure people into the stream, where he drowns them.

It is said that the melody of his fiddle is magical in itself, any human who learned to play it was cursed, as he would never be able to stop playing it. Any who dances to the tune, was unable to to stop, and they would play and dance until they died, or where lured down into the waters.

The tales also said that for the price of your soul and/or blood, he could teach you to play the fiddle as masterly as him. For this to happen, you would either seek him out by the stream, or according to some stories at crossroads. It was espescially likely to meet him during the midsummer festivities.

CanadianHistorian,557,196,171yv9,646,"Hello and welcome to my AMA on Canadian History.  

My name is [Geoff Keelan](http://uwaterloo.academia.edu/GeoffKeelan), I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/history/) in Waterloo, Ontario, and I am a Canadian historian.  I am in my 3rd year and am currently writing a dissertation on [Henri Bourassa, a French Canadian nationalist](http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=8422&amp;PHPSESSID=pr9hf4t19h27c8f96a8suu0sp3), and his understanding of and his impact on Canada’s experience of the First World War.  Since 2008, I have worked for the [Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-Newsletter-LCMDS-final-ss2.pdf), a [military studies/history research institute](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/), where I am a [Research Associate](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/geoff-keelan/).  Through the Centre, I have had the opportunity to participate in many different projects and several guided battlefield tours over the years as a student and as a teacher/driver.   I have been fortunate enough to personally see some of the [Canadian battlefields](http://www.canadianmilitaryhistory.ca/category/publications/guidebooks/) of the First and Second World War in northwest Europe (for the First World War battles in France/Belgium and for the Second World War battles in Normandy, Belgium, Netherlands, and a bit of Germany).  I mention these tours and the Centre because they deserve some credit for the historian I am today.

While I would like to say I can answer every question about Canadian history, there are some areas I specialize in over others.  I am primarily a Canadian political historian, but I have also read a lot of military (or War and Society) history and some aboriginal history.  I can’t say I know much about the literature of other fields, like social, labour, or economic history. I focus primarily on Canada’s history from 1867-1919, with a few other subject-specific concentrations I’ve looked at for various projects.  Still, I wanted this to be as open as possible.  So today I am answering all questions about Canadian history, not just the areas where I’m familiar with the literature (that is, exactly what some historians say versus others).  I am hoping my general (but still formidable) knowledge can answer most of your questions. Who doesn’t love a good historiographical question though.

That being said, I’m going to repeat a caveat I sometimes put on my answers: I am always open to corrections (ideally with sources) and clarifications!  I can misremember, not be up to date with recent research, not be aware of another interpretation, or just be plain wrong.  (By the way, if you are another Canadian historian, I’d love to hear from you.)  I know a lot about Canadian history, but certainly not everything. I’ll try to add sources if I think knowing the literature will help the answer, or if I’m asked.   Like any good historian, I should clarify potential problems of plagiarism.  Sometimes there’s imaginary footnotes in my head that I don’t necessarily put into answers. I might take parts of my other answers from Reddit, or essays and articles I’ve written, and re-use them for questions here. I assure you it’s all my own words though.  Sometimes facts/interpretations/ideas will be pulled from historians uncited (never words though), but again, ask if you are curious where I am getting my information.

I want to end with an important point for me.  I think it’s essential that “professional” historians communicate history to the public.  Not that the amateur historians here aren’t informative and interesting, but I believe that there is a professional duty attached to my chosen career.  I see /r/AskHistorians as the perfect place to fulfil that duty.  When I first discovered this subreddit, I didn’t jump right in to answering questions because I was a little wary about “taking it to the streets,” that is, the general public.  But I realised this subreddit is what historians *should* be doing - **explaining, communicating, and enriching the public’s knowledge of history** - and I started to participate a lot more.  Publications, conferences, even lectures, are all well and good, but I can’t think of a better medium than this subreddit to reach such a varied and interested audience and pay attention to a duty I feel is often minimized by my profession.  I hope that today, as a “professional” historian, I can convey to you some small part of the why and the how of Canada’s history alongside its facts.  

**For my fellow Canadians**: our history helps us understand who we were, who we are, and who we will be.  All Canadians know our history. It is the story of our nation and our people, a story that (unbelievably sometimes) ends with all of the Canadian people who live here today.  Simply by being a Canadian in 2013, you are a part of that story and you are a part of our history.  I hope I can help you find out how you got there.

Then *The Wild One,* and it went downhill from there. *Damn* you, Marlon Brando! ;)

Almost every man is wearing a suit. Very spiffed up. It makes me envious of the characters in all those wonderful Hitchcock films (well, except for being framed for crimes I didn't commit (although, Grace Kelly awakening me with a kiss might make up for all the bother of having a *creepy* Raymond Burr as a neighbor)).

Documentary shots seem to agree. As xiaorobear kindly pointed out, [it was very common](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEykTo0n9yk).

Is this Hollywood over-idealizing, or did men generally wear suits when in public? Were men who did not mildly looked down upon (much as a man walking shirtless would be today)?

There were ranges for ""good"" suits and mass-produced ones, but it seems hard to imagine *every* man being able to afford *multiple* suits, often dry-cleaning and pressed, with nary a complaint.

Basically, I'm wondering how people viewed oral sex within your period of study, and whether there were different shades of opinion when it came to fellatio vs. cunnilingus.  I was talking with a friend the other day, and she mentioned that oral sex was fraught with concerns over interpersonal power dynamics in ancient Roman times, while in more recent centuries it was sometimes described (in Europe, I can only assume) as ""the French sin.""

I don't know how accurate that all is, but it's an interesting subject.

So what's going on with this in your period, exactly?  Do people talk about it at all?  Do they even practice it?  Is it encouraged/discouraged?  Is there any difference of ""merit"" (for lack of a better word) between fellatio and cunnilingus?  How was it treated in the arts, if at all?

I'm making this post as a part of the reason why I contribute to r/AskHistorians : I have been disappointed at the level of discourse, but before I unsubscribed I thought I'd make an effort to be the change I'd like to see.

To that end, I'd like to bring the community's attention to today's news:  as a result of the work of independent scholars and activists, the premier database of academic journals has made a slight change to their website.  JSTOR has pdfs of thousands of academic journals, and usually the full run of that journal, extending back sometimes a century.  Access to JSTOR is so expensive that, in general, only research institutions can afford it; faculty and students at 4-year colleges or community colleges might have limited access, or none at all.  And it's prohibitively expensive for most individuals.

But now JSTOR is offering read-only access to most of these materials to everyone -- three articles every two weeks to those who register, and no downloads.  

It is limited access, but is still an incredible opportunity for those interested in history.  Access to academic journals has, in previous generations, required physically travelling to some research library with a subscription.  It might have even required student or faculty status.  In general, these academic articles are written for other historians, not for the general public.  But in a great age of the democratization of information, this expensive resource is now available to all.

I'd like to encourage all the interested historians on this sub who don't already have access to JSTOR to take a look.  It's a hell of a resource; basically the scholarly output of generations of historians, available to the public.

A little background on Chechnya, and on myself:

Chechnya is nominally a part of the Russian Federation in the North Caucasus. Chechnya first came under Russian control in the late 19th century, and has essentially a part of the Russian Empire since then.

The Chechens fought a long war of independence in the 19th century, and fought two more wars with Russia beginning in 1994, and ending roughly in 2004. The Chechens are historically Sufi Muslim. Within Sufism there are several 'paths' to the divine, somewhat like denominations. Sometime in the 20th century, most Chechens followed the Naqshbandiyya path (tariqa), while today they are predominantly Qadiriyya.

The North Caucasus are extremely diverse, with hundreds of ethnicities and languages over the past few hundred years, although the republic of Chechnya is one of the most homogenous countries in the area, with a vast majority of ethnic Chechens.
The issue of language in Chechnya is, like nearly everything regarding contemporary Chechen culture, extremely politicized and pregnant with the politics of history. The native language of Chechnya is Chechen (noxchiin mott in Chechen), a Caucasian language in the Nakh-Daghestanian language family. It is unique to the Caucasus, and is spoken by the great majority of ethnic Chechens living in Chechnya. Throughout Chechnya’s history Cyrillic, Latin, and even Arabic alphabets have been used, depending on the influence of Russification policies, Islam, or anti-Russian nationalism in vogue at the time. Like most other ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union though, most Chechens throughout the twentieth century also spoke Russian. In the early 1990s all non-Cyrillic alphabets were made illegal for use in the Russian federation, and Chechen has since been written in the modified Cyrillic.

I am not a linguist, nor an expert in the language, but I can answer basic questions.

I received my degree in Russian History, with a Thematic Specialization in Political Violence. My dissertation was on the motivations behind Chechen terrorists, particularly suicide bombers. This AMA is a bit of a hybrid, as I am willing to field questions on Chechnya and its history, and also on theoretical terrorism, suicide bombing, and guerrilla warfare as it pertains to Chechnya. I have published two peer reviewed articles on Chechnya, one on the Russian counterinsurgency operation in Chechnya from 1994-1996, and the second on the Chechen insurgency and the development of terrorism.

I will not answer nor address any questions or comments with racist or hateful undertones. This sub is for enlightened and educational historical dialogue, not as a venue for bitter diatribes and hateful rhetoric. Please be respectful. I will not speak on the morality of terrorism. I do not condone terrorism. I recognize terrorism as a form of political communication. Even so, the 'ism' ending on the word implies not only a communicative act, but also an ideology and mindset of 'terror,' and so I recognize that terrorism comprises much more than a single act. There is no universally agreed upon definition of terrorism, so the definition that I use, a combination of two common definitions, one provided by Boaz Ganor and by Rhonda Callaway &amp; Julie Harrelson-Stephens:

&gt; ""Terrorism is defined as any intentional act of violence against civilian targets that do not have the authority or ability to alter government policy, with the purpose of attaining or furthering political aims.""

Daeres,225,174,1cjatl,597,"***Rules Post Part the First***

Recently there has been a growth in posts asking extremely general questions. These questions often sound extremely similar, and in particular many of them use the phrase ‘in your area of expertise’. Though the questions themselves are well-intentioned, we have received numerous complaints about them. They encourage extremely short replies, and often extremely bad answers. This then often requires moderator intervention due to the large number of responses ignoring our guidelines and rules. The subreddit is intended to be a source of in-depth historical knowledge, and these questions are not taking advantage of that.  

The mod team has therefore agreed that we want to take direct action, much as we did previously regarding poll questions; we are going to be removing these extremely general threads from now on. The aim is twofold; to have less generalised questions posted in the subreddit, and to redirect those generalised inquiries to more appropriate places.  

For those seeking clarification about what ‘more appropriate places’ means, we have two weekly meta threads which suit more trivia-oriented questions and answers; the Tuesday Trivia thread and the Friday-Free-for-All. The former has a particular topic each week, but the latter is explicitly designed to fit questions that don’t quite fit elsewhere.

These are the guidelines that we will be using when removing these kinds of questions:

**One of our key principles regarding questions is that they should be as precise as possible; we do not want threads that will attract only bad answers, or are so generalised that they cannot be answered. We will therefore remove questions that are seeking trivia rather than informed answers.**

**Our guiding rubric is; if a thread can be summarised as ‘tell me random stuff about X through history’ then it falls into this category of trivia rather than looking for in-depth answers which are this community’s main focus. Questions likely to be removed are those asking about all periods and all places at once. If your question begins with the phrase ‘In your area of expertise’ strongly reconsider posting it, or consider making it more specific. For example, perhaps narrowing your question to a specific time period or area, or focusing your topic to enable more informative answers.**

***

***Rules Post Part the Second***

Following our recent meta thread on the issue (found here) we have also decided to implement some measures regarding NSFW threads. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, we mean questions whose content can cause problems in non-private environments.

We would like anyone asking a NSFW question to put the ‘nsfw’ tag on their question after posting it, and we would like them to make the title as SFW (safe for work) as possible. If questions violate this, they will be removed and we will message the OP about reposting that question with a changed title. We are operating on a ‘we know it when we see it’ principle regarding NSFW content in titles.

This is only ever likely to be relevant to a small number of threads, as NSFW questions are not asked that often here. But our aim is to help anyone browsing the subreddit for whom NSFW text may be a problem. In addition, *our only concern here is the titles of threads*. When it comes to the actual posts within the thread, we aren’t concerned about NSFW content at all. These rules are about allowing people to a) know that a thread has NSFW content before looking at the comments and b) making sure no-one gets in trouble for accidentally viewing a NSFW title.",Meta: A pair of rules announcements,771

&gt;Dear Mr. Andropov,

&gt;My name is Samantha Smith. I am ten years old. Congratulations on your new job. I have been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war. Are you going to vote to have a war or not? If you aren't please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war.

&gt;Dear Samantha,

&gt;I received your letter, which is like many others that have reached me recently from your country and from other countries around the world.

&gt;It seems to me – I can tell by your letter – that you are a courageous and honest girl, resembling Becky, the friend of Tom Sawyer in the famous book of your compatriot Mark Twain. This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girls.

&gt;You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.

&gt;Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply to you seriously and honestly.

&gt;Yes, Samantha, we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be war on Earth. This is what every Soviet man wants. This is what the great founder of our state, Vladimir Lenin, taught us.

&gt;Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, Nazi Germany, which strove for supremacy over the whole world, attacked our country, burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women and children.

&gt;In that war, which ended with our victory, we were in alliance with the United States: together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders. I hope that you know about this from your history lessons in school. And today we want very much to live in peace, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth—with those far away and those near by. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.

&gt;In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons—terrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That's precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never—never—will it use nuclear weapons first against any country. In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on Earth.

&gt;It seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question: 'Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?' We want nothing of the kind. No one in our country– neither workers, peasants, writers nor doctors, neither grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government–want either a big or 'little' war.

&gt;We want peace—there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, building and inventing, writing books and flying into space. We want peace for ourselves and for all peoples of the planet. For our children and for you, Samantha.

&gt;I invite you, if your parents will let you, to come to our country, the best time being this summer. You will find out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an international children's camp – Artek – on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.

&gt;Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.

&gt;Y. Andropov

Noting the escalated tensions during that period it was a blessing for the Soviet leader, once cast as a threat to world stability, to declare straight that their main priority is not to wage war but instead to focus on economy. The entire operation played a large part in humanising Soviets and Americans from each side and may have played a part in defusing aforementioned tensions.

There's also something else, if you guys don't mind [a second example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#The_Fall) also from the 1980s:

&gt;After hearing the [news conference] broadcast [announcing relaxed border control between East and West Germany], East Germans began gathering at the wall and at the six checkpoints between East and West, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates. The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the ""more aggressive"" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through ""as Schabowski said we can.""

&gt;It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Finally, at 10:45 pm, the guards yielded, opening the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. As the Ossis swarmed through, they were greeted by Wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the wall, and were soon joined by East German youngsters. They danced together to celebrate their new freedom.

In the movie, the village is rather undefended. The samurai have to abandanon a few homes and erect walls. Would a real Japanese village be so undefended in a time where armies often went to war &amp; raiders walked the lands?

The villagers have a lot of samurai loot from samurai that they've hunted down. I've seen this come up in other Japanese movies. Was this something that truly happened after battles?

The samurai used swords, even though many of their opponents were mounted. It makes sense to me that one of the samurai who goes on a stealthy mission to steal a gun would use his sword, but in the pitched battles, would samurai have preferred some type of spear?

The bandits also primarily used swords and it seemed like they had a tough time agains the bamboo spear-wielding villagers. 

How realistic is it that bandits, upon finding a village that's walled &amp; defended with Samurai, would fight until the bitter end? Is it more likely that they'd move on, hoping to catch another village by surprise? Or perhaps negotiate to get some loot from the villagers and move on?

This will be identical to the previous list, only I will insist much more strongly on the proper format. This format is:

* *Book title* by Author (date--optional): short, two-to-three sentence description here.

Do not put author name first. Do not give just a list of books. Do not put your descriptions in the first person (no ""I really like this book because..."", rather ""this book is good because..."").Make sure the description is actually descriptive (Don't just write ""this is a great book on early modern France!"" Obviously it is, because this list should consist of *exclusively* really great books, and I am, after all, putting it in the Early Modern France section). In general, more detail is better than less--if someone is planning on reading an entire book on the subject, have faith they can wade through a few sentences on the book.

_________________________
General/Historiography
------------------------------

**General**

1. *The Human Past* by Chris Scarre (ed.): A very readable, although also very expensive, overview of all of human history from an archaeological perspective. It's very detailed, and used as an introductory book in many universities. Still updated.

2. *How Humans Evolved* by Boyd and Silk: Everything is also discussed by The Human Past, but Boyd and Silk have slightly different opinions and reading both keeps you updated not only on 'how it was' but most importantly what the current debate is and what arguments are used. Also very readable and almost compulsory for everyone into 'evolutionary anything'.

-----------------------------------------------------
Modern
-------------------------------------------------

**General**

1. *The Birth of the Modern World: Global Connections and Comparisons 1780-1914* by C.A. Bayly. The book, written by someone who is not a specialist in Western Europe, shows the myriad ""modernities"" that started emerging in the long 19th century and showing how the Western, eventually dominant one, interacted with them. It also raises the issue of this age as the first true globalization.

2. *Replenishing the Earth: The Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Angloworld 1783-1939* by John Belich. Why is it that British colonialism made the largest impact, in terms of lasting sense of Anglo-connections, whether with America or Australia? In a somewhat controversial book, Belich draws attention both to the economic cycles that made the British Empire the paramount power, and the revolution in settlerism as an ideology that allowed for a wide-ranging cultural expansion.

3. *The Red Flag: A History of Communism* by David Priestland. One of the dominant modern ideologies, communism has often been treated in just its Soviet guise. This book, however, creates a theoretical framework for understanding its different manifestations (dividing it into three large currents - romantic, radical and modernist) and pays close attention to Chinese, Cuban and other communisms, rather than concentrating on Moscow alone.

4. *The Global Cold War: Third World Interventions and the Making of Our Times* by Odd Arne Westad. Tracing the origins of modern Third World interactions with the developed world to the geopolitics of the Cold War, Westad also greatly expands the scope of Cold War history to move beyond Europe. He also takes the ideological clash between the USA, USSR and eventually political Islam more seriously than many scholars.

5. *The age of...* series by Eric Hobsbawm. This series of books (the Age of Revolution, Age of Empire, and Age of Extremes) is one of (and is thought by some to be the best) introduction to modern history. A phenomenally well researched and analysed series of books from the greatest Marxist historian of the last century.


*WWI*

1. See [NMW's incredible list here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78pg65)

2. *The First World War*, by John Keegan (1998): a fine single-volume introduction, and one of the most accessible. Keegan was one of the best popular military historians going, and he was generally believed to be at the height of his game in this particular work. It situates the war in the ""senseless tragedy"" school of cultural memory, but this is hardly a fringe position. Still, very good.

3. *The First World War*, by Hew Strachan (2004): offers a remarkably international view of the conflict, and in a compact single volume at that. This was meant as a companion piece to the (also quite good) television documentary series of the same name which he oversaw. Still, if you want more, look to his much larger The First World War - Vol. I: To Arms (2003) -- the first of a projected three volumes and absolutely staggering in its depth. This first volume alone runs to 1250 pages.

4. *The First World War: A Complete History*, by Martin Gilbert (2nd Ed. 2004): The title is a bit of a lie, but this work from Winston Churchill's official biography is as lucid and sensitive as anything else he's written. Gilbert takes great pains to situate the operations described within the context of their human cost -- not everyone has always found this to be a satisfying tactic when it comes to the critical distance of the scholar, but it's a decision for which good arguments can be made.

*WWII*

1. *The Struggle for Europe* by Chester Wilmot. A detailed account of the European theater during World War II, starting with the allied preparations for D-Day, subsequent invasion of Normandy, and major battles / strategies of the rest of the war.


**Europe/ ""The West""**

1. *Postwar* by Tony Judt - a fantastic in-depth history of Europe after the second world war more-or-less up to the present day by one of the greatest historians of Modern Europe. There are some fantastic insights (like a chapter on the formation of welfare states) as well as a general overview of the period to be found here.

2. *Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century* by Mark Mazower. Less a comprehensive history of the continent than a piece to explain how ""civilized"" Europe became the bloodiest continent in that century, Mazower brings fascism back into the picture as a really competing opponent to communism and capitalism; and looks at how imperial practices cultivated abroad were copied and applied to Europe itself.

*Eastern Europe*

1. *Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism as Civilization* by Stephen Kotkin. The book takes the building of Magnitogorsk, an industrial city built from scratch, as a way to show how people learned to ""speak Bolshevik"" and thus both survive within and use the regime; thus it complicates hugely the usual top-down view of the Soviet Union.

*Western Europe*

1. *Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age* by Ruth Harris. Taking the Lourdes site and the original visions supposedly seen there in 1855, Harris uses this as a microcosm to tell us a lot about emerging civic and patriotic identities in France, raises questions of science versus religion in the age of modernisation, and the question of faith and belief. It is a beautifully written book, and goes far beyond what the title suggests.

2. *A History of Contemporary Italy: Society and Politics, 1943-1988* by Paul Ginsborg. Examines the Italian society from the end of World War II to 1988 with particular emphasis on the transformation of the Italian economy and Italian social structure.

3. *A History of Western Society* by McKay, Hill and others, 2008: A good overview, picks up where The Human Past left off (with an overlap in antiquity) and provides the historical, rather than archaeological, perspective. Very readable, and though it's a textbook and thus most suitable for students (with plenty of 'summaries' and lists of important key words), I'd still recommend it to people who are interested in history without having access to the formal education (and to archaeologists who only study prehistory!).

4. *The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy* by David Cannadine. A massive (800 pages) look at everything to do with the downfall of the British aristocracy at the end of the 19th century. I'm not done it yet, but so far it's absolutely engaging.

5. *The French Enlightenment and the Jews: The Origins of Modern Anti-Semitism* by Arthur Hertzberg. This work focuses on the development of modern, secular antisemitism (i.e., antisemitism not based in religious beliefs), examining how ostensibly humanist Enlightenment thinkers could justify the continued exclusion of a group. Fascinating reading, not only for its investigation of Jewish history, but also for examining an aspect of the Enlightenment that doesn't often get to the general public.

6. *The Conquest of Nature: Water, Landscape, and the Making of Modern Germany* by David Blackbourn. An excellent investigation of how industry and society shaped and were shaped by bodies of water in modern Germany. Starts in the 1700s and goes to the twentieth century, with really interesting sections on Frederick the Great, the reshaping of the Rhine, and how Nazi racial and environmental policy intersected.

*Australia*

1. *The Federal Story*, by Alfred Deakin (1900). A behind-the-scenes description of the events and people involved in bringing Australia to federation, written by a man who was at the centre of it all. Deakin wrote this manuscript over a period of years as the events happened. This is history in real time, with no hindsight or after-the-fact analysis.

2. *Alfred Deakin*, by Professor J. A. La Nauze (1965). A biography of Alfred Deakin: a central figure in Australian federation, and later three-time Prime Minister of Australia.

3. *Federation Fathers*, by L. F. Crisp (1990). A collection of essays about various key people involved in the Australian federation movement.

4. *The First Decade of the Australian Commonwealth*, by H. G. Turner (1911). Turner’s personable history of federal politics following federation, describing the people and events that moulded the new country during its first years. His bias against the labour movement and the deluded Labor Party is a bit obvious in places, but it’s sweet.

5. *Australians*, by Thomas Keneally (2009, 2011, ???). This trilogy (which is still being written) is essential reading for anyone interested in Australian history. Keneally, the author responsible for ‘The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith’ (made into a classic Aussie movie) and ‘Schindler’s Ark’ (filmed as ‘Schindler’s List’), shares the stories of the “little people” in Australia’s past. These are real stories of real people, set in their proper context of Australia’s larger history, and described with a novelist’s style.

*Holocaust*

1. *War &amp; Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust* by Doris L. Bergen. A brief, yet comprehensive, and accessible overview of the Holocaust, tracing from the prewar Nazi ascent to power through the end of World War II. Written by one of the best academics currently working on the subject. Includes a good amount of analysis of postwar Holocaust scholarship, too.

2. *The Destruction of the European Jews* by Raul Hilberg. Basically the original work on the Holocaust by the father of Holocaust studies. Originally published in 1961, and revised in 1985, it is available in both an abridged version and as three volumes. Hilberg was a stellar scholar, and while some of it is naturally out of date, it still holds up well today.

3. *Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution* in Poland by Christopher R. Browning. This focused case study investigates the nature of German killers in the Holocaust, and concludes that the majority, at least in the unit surveyed, were ""ordinary"" guys without any particular ideological commitment to Nazism or antisemitism.


**Africa**

1. The Fate of Africa* by Martin Meredith, 2005. I think this is the best single, readable volume on post-colonial Africa. Entertaining largely because of the ridiculous behavior of many of the characters. It runs 700 pages but it's worth it if you want recent African history.

2. *We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families* by Philip Gourevitch, 1999. Probably the best account of the Rwanda genocide of 1994.

3. *Across the Red River* by Christian Jennings, 2001. Another very good look at the Rwanda genocide.
In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo by Micheala Wrong, 2002. A close look at the rise and fall of Zaire's dictator. Very readable.

**East Asia**

1. *Daily Lives of Civilians in Wartime Asia: From the Taiping Rebellion to the Vietnam War* by Stewart Lone: Fairly straightforward. Not just China but basically every major Asian conflict. It is a behemoth of information that has been collected from far and wide for the reader's convenience. It covers history, provides detailed and cited statistics, and gives insight to culture, art, social chances and upheavals, family and even romantic impact from living during all these wars. An excellent reference.

2. *English in Singapore* by Lisa Lim et al: Discussion of the evolution of the English language in Singapore after independence, related domestic policy, how it affects education, social movements and chances, and even how it affects foreign policy and international standing in economics and business. It also gives a solid history on the developments of Singapore's economy and political system. Awesome read.


*China*

1. *China's Rise in Historical Perspective* edited by Brantly Womack: [fishstickuffs note: If I had to suggest just one book to read from this list this would be it] If anyone is seriously interested in what trends have shaped the current Chinese political landscape, this is the book to read. The perspectives of the contributors are diverse, and so are the topics covered, which include religious cosmology, identity crises in wake of the revolution, ecological issues, and international relations.

2. *Chen Village* by Chan, Madsen and Unger (2nd ed. 2009). This is a beautiful book that traces the life and growth of a village in Southeast China through the entirety of the communist revolution until 2009. Its ambition is incredible, and its execution satisfies its aims. It is effectively an anthropological ethnography written by historians, and the work reflects some of the best of both disciplines. Rarely have I felt as connected to historical characters as I have in learning of the exploits of low-level, unimportant peasant officials in Chen Village. This book communicates the trends in political and social change in China in the last 60 years in a way that is hard to replicate from pure analysis.

3. *Taiwan-China: A Most Ticklish Standoff*- edited by Adam W. Clarke. Besides having the most fantastic name of any academic work on the subject I've seen, this book provides a survey of the triangle of relationships between the US, China and Taiwan through a mixture of excerpts from declassified/public primary sources and academic analysis.

4. *Managing Sino-American Crises: Case Studies and Analysis* edited by Michael Swaine and Zhang Tuosheng. Pretty much THE book on the issue. By far the most extensive analysis of crisis behavior by China and America during Sino-American crises that I know of. Begins with the pos-WWII period, and continues to 2006.

5. *US Taiwan Strait Policy: The Origins of Strategic Ambiguity* by Dean P. Chen This book actually came out this year, and I'm very excited about it. It provides a fantastic summary of the US approach toward China in regards to the Taiwan issue, and is the first major book to do so in regards to the Obama administration's policies. However, certainly not for casual reading. This is an academic analysis of the policy making process, and is making an argument for how to conduct US policy into the future. But in the course of its analysis it provides a fantastic history of the relationship between the US and the Taiwan issue.

6. *Charm Offensive* by Joshua Kurlantzick: An excellent history and analysis of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) international politics, plays in the geopolitical arena, and how foreign policy affects domestic policy as well as vice versa. It is a concise and thorough introduction to the PRC's commitment to the 'soft power' grand strategy, and a must read for any student of the PRC's foreign policy history.

*Korea*

1. *The Koreans: Who They Are, What They Want, Where Their Future Lies* by Michael Breen: This is the primer for all things South Korean history during the 20th century. Starting with the history and effects of the long embedded Japanese occupation, then moving through the Korean War, the rebuilding, the Korean economic development and social &amp; political upheaval, the Seoul Olympics which was instrumental to South Korea's rise to the global stage, and North &amp; South relations through out. A must read.

2. *Nothing to Envy* by Barbara Demick: A heart wrenching piece on the effects of the North Korean regime on the lives of regular North Korean people. It's half based on oral accounts that were taken down by Demick as she interviewed many defectors from the North. The other half is grounded in well researched statistics, diplomatic papers, and economic studies of the North. It is a very compelling read, more focused on telling a narrative of famine, oppression, and strange social constructs than standing as a historical reference but one of the essentials on getting a ground eye view of what life was like in the North.

3. *The North Korean Economy* by Nicholas Eberstadt: Focusing on the economic history of North Korea, this text, in my opinion, is essential to understanding how the North started so strong but is today, practically a failed state. Eberstadt worked tirelessly to check and recheck, then check again all of his numbers because North Korea is notorious for inflating or deflating numbers as they see fit so much that often the records that they present to the outside world cannot be trusted, nor can they be verified. The economics of the North affected every other aspect of life in the North, as well as shaping its political, domestic, and foreign policy because of necessity. The extensive and easily digested statistics, often presented in text and reinforced visually with many graphs, tables and charts, give credence to the analysis of the two Koreas by Eberstadt, starting from the division in 1950 all the way to today.

*Japan*

1. *The Making of Modern Japan* by Marius Jansen: This is the definitive work of modern era Japan. Jansen's work is a chronicle of not just the rise of railroads, of factories, the modern firearm, electricity and gas, the telegraph, milk!, and other interesting developments of early modern Japan. He gives background, history, cultural and political analysis, event and timeline breakdowns and more. An expansive work that takes the reader through decades upon decades of Japanese development and progress that happened at break neck speeds, but can now be looked at retrospectively at our leisure, guided by Jansen's steady hand.

2. *Inventing Japan* by Ian Buruma: I've joked to friends before by calling this ""The Making of Modern Japan Lite"" but this is essentially an extremely succinct look at the changes and developments Japan went through, and its metamorphosis as a nation as it moved from the 19th century into the 20th. This book is seriously tiny, a slip of a book and you could breeze through it in one sitting but its depth of content is surprising for its deceptively small size. I highly recommend this book as a solid introduction, a way to get your foot in the door of the maze that is early modern Japanese history.

3. *Early Japanese Railways 1853-1914: Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meiji-era Japan* by Dan Free: Surprisingly enough, is not just a book on trains. It is definitely a must read for studies on the Meiji Period and the development going on at the time. It details the massive influx of modern technologies that various Japanese companies were more than happy to incorporate and invest resources into.

**Western Eurasia**

*Prehistory*

1. *The Horse, the Wheel and Language* by David Anthony: A slightly polemic book from 2007 providing his view on the spread of Indo-European language and, in his opinion, culture at the beginning of the Bronze Age. The most current version and most factual (and least political) of the Indo-European debate, for critical readers it's still very valuable because of the large amount of archaeological data that is presented while the polemic writing style makes it accessible to non-specialists as well.

*Mesopotamia*

1. *A History of the Ancient Near East: ca 3000-323 BC*, Marc van der Mieroop: It's an expansive history of the region that at once shows off its scale but also avoids overwhelming with information. It's a must read to acquire a sense of perspective over the region's history.

*Iron Age Europe*

1. *The Celts* by Nora Chadwick: Introduction to Celtic studies. It's an older book (first published in 1970), and focuses on a wide range of Celtic topics including religion (both pre and post Christian), culture, art, and society. It also does a fantastic job of explaining how ""Celtic"" isn't a homogenous entity, but rather many different cultures over a large area over a large period of time.

*Carthage*

1. *Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization* by Richard Miles. One of the few general histories of Carthage with a decent detour into syncretism of the Herculean and other cults. Can't fully vouch for the accuracy as this isn't my specialization but it appears well researched with a decent amount of cross reference to the archaeological evidence.

*Classical Greece*

1. *A History of the Greek City-States, 700-338 BC* by Raphael Sealey, whilst the developments of Greek cultures are presented in a narrative fashion the book is arguably more focused on introducing the reader to problems within understanding Greek history. It's therefore a good way to both understand changes in Greek history over time and the reality of interpreting it academically.

2. *A Social and Economic History of the Greek World*, by M. Rostovtzeff, for those interested in ancient economics this book is a must have, and a good introduction into how ancient Greece's economics have been interpreted. It is a little dry, so do not take this as a casual read.

3. *Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times* by Thomas R. Martin. This provides a survey of Greek history focusing mostly on political and military events. Good for those looking for an introduction but also provides fairly in depth analysis of key subjects.


*Rome*

1. *The World of Pompeii* edited by John. J. Dobbins and Pedar W. Foss, a comprehensive collection of papers on every aspect of Pompeii as a city and all written relatively recently. It's very up to date and deals with a lot of aspects of Pompeii's archaeology that don't get much coverage outside of the field itself.

2. *Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History* by Christopher S. Mackay. This is another survey from the ancient world, this one is primarily political and military history. It provides a solid understanding of events, their significance and implications on the Roman state. It covers both empire and republic very efficiently.


*Medieval Europe*

1. The Viking World* by Stefan Brink: A 2008 book which combines many short chapters on any topic relevant to Vikings or the Scandinavian late Iron Age. Strong point is that many chapters are written by the relevant specialists instead of a single author who is trying to specialise in everything. Bad point is that this means that there's not much of a central theme connecting the chapters, which makes this more of a reference work than a bedtime story.

2. *The Discovery of the Individual 1050-1200* by Colin Morris. This is an older work but represents a shift in thought regarding the individual on a personal level. Framed within the context of Western Christianity, Morris looks at the 12th century renaissance as a period of heightened awareneess and self expression.

3. *Britain After Rome* by Robin Fleming. A comprehensive guide to Anglo-Saxon England. Its kinda hard to jump into (it assumes you already know the politics, wars, and events), but does a fantastic job of creating a narrative tale of the Anglo-Saxon people. More of an archeological look than a historical look.

*Early Modern Europe*

1. *Tudor England* by John Guy, a really good introduction to the period with plenty of detailed analysis of the major events that occurred under the Tudor monarchs (Henry VIII-Elizabeth I)

2. *The 16th Century* edited by Patrick Collinson. (Good god, three of the four people I've recommended here have died in the last 3 years). A fantastic collection of essays relating to the Tudors including some really insightful ones on culture, religion, and the fringe areas of the British Isles - great for both dipping in for short chapter-length essays but also for detailed study.

3. *Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490-1700* By Diarmaid MacCulloch - pretty much the definitive book on the European Reformation, a sweeping, detailed and actually readable account of the European Reformation.

4. *The Elizabethan Puritan Movement* By Patrick Collinson - a bit more specific but the best account of perhaps the most interesting period of religious change in English History by one of its greatest historians, though it is quite a dense book.

5. *Montaillou* by E. Le Roy Ladurie. One of the first and best microhistorical books, this is a highly interesting account of the inquisition of the small village of Montaillou in the 14th century and the insights it can reveal to us.

* France

1. [Night Hawk's fantastic list on France](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1403l7/askhistorians_master_book_list_ii/c78t1q0)

2. *A History of Modern France*, Jeremy Popkin: exactly what it sounds like. It's not one where you can just sit down and read for fun, like these other ones are - it's a textbook, and it's written like one. Very dense and not much verve, but extremely useful in providing context for a lot of these other books and clearing up their ambiguities.

3. *The Village of Cannibals*, Alain Corbin: a ""microhistory"" of a small town in southern France during the Franco-Prussian War, and how the local peasantry reacts to the ousting of Napoleon III. His writing style is a little hard to get used to, but it's an interesting tale of shifting ideas of social class and political thought in a particular setting. Bonus feature: gory murders of French noblemen! (well, one French nobleman, but you can't have everything)

4. *Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1880-1914*, Eugen Weber: a classic if there ever was one. It's easy to get enamored with Paris and the Eiffel Tower and the Belle Epoque when we think of this period, but France has always been tricky: it's much more rural than you think, especially the southern half. Weber does a great job explaining how France was rural and how the Third Republic worked to bring rural France into the fold: peasants into Frenchmen.

5. *Marianne in Chains*, Robert Gildea: how did people actually navigate Vichy France? Gildea's case study of one region in occupied France helps clear the air on this question - like Nemirovsky's work, he's asking about collaboration and resistance, and has some really interesting points to make on historical memory after the war, as well. Not a political history - he references Pétain and Laval on some occasions, but the most political he gets is going into local governments.

6. *Suite Francaise*, Irene Nemirovsky: I throw this book at everyone who asks about Vichy France because it is such a fantastic picture of the choices people had to make during wartime. What is collaboration? What is resistance? Can you be both a collaborator and a resister? It's a thought-provoking historical study and a good novel in its own right. Unfortunately, Nemirovsky died before she had a chance to properly finish it, so what we have is constructed from her drafts and her unfinished notes.


**South Asia**

1. *Forging the Raj, Essays on British India in the Heyday of Empire* by Thomas R Metcalf: Very good book if you want to really look into how the 1857 revolt changed the way Britain acted in India. The book breaks down the essays into sections which include Land Policy,Land tenure architecture and much more. It gives a good view into the different Raj's or mini prince's in India. Lot's of tine going into detail on an an individual one and their life before and after the revolt.

**Africa**

1. *Africa in History* by Basil Davidson, revised ed., 1995. This is a broad survey of African history/prehistory. The first edition is often considered the first culturally neutral attempt to document African history.

2. *The African Slave Trade* by Basil Davidson, revised ed., 1988. As he was an expert in Portuguese colonies, his research and knowledge are particularly strong in that area.

3. *The Strong Brown God* by Sanche de Gramont, 1991. The history of early European attempts to reach Timbuktu and to map the entire Niger River in the 19th century. It's a highly entertaining read; I strongly recommend it to all audiences.

**East Asia**

*China*

1. *Cambridge Illustrated History of China* by Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2nd ed. 2010). Fantastic general survey of Chinese history, and a standard in college courses. I put this under the ""Imperial"" section because there are better resources dealing strictly with modern China.

2. *Chinese Civilzation: A Sourcebook* edited by Patricia Buckley Ebrey. Another standard find in intro Chinese history courses in college. This is a great introduction to

3. *Soldiers of the Dragon* edited by CJ Peers. Osprey publishers have a wide variety of awesome military histories. You wouldn't be likely to find this in a college classroom, but that can be a plus. It's not a hard read, but extremely informative.

4. *This Is China: The First 5,000 Years* by Haiwang Yuan: This should be the standard text in every introductory class to Chinese history. It is an incredibly short, brief book that is a crash course on Chinese history to the uninitiated as well as a solid quick reference for the more experienced. It is a work that runs over the surface of almost everything Chinese history has to offer and dips its head under the water at select places to try to give the reader a real taste of what lies before them. More than cover Chinese history, it is a great book to illustrate the fact that trying to understand all of Chinese history at once is impossible and is as much art and dynamic dialogue as it is inexact science and lively academia. Another must have.

5. *The Archaeology of China: From the Late Paleolithic to the Early Bronze Age* by Li Liu and Xingcan Chen: Only recently having finished reading this myself, I highly recommend this book for its compelling points about, well everything. It sheds light on topics ranging from the structures of societies, agriculture, tools and warfare, regional and inter-cultural influences on development, to even diet and health. Most of the research comes from archaeological studies as well as interpreting inscriptions, artifacts, and other reputable academic sources.

6. *Chinese Ceramics: From the Paleolithic Period through the Qing Dynasty* by Laurie Barnes et al: This incredible work not only talks about porcelain and other Chinese pottery, which are all exquisite, but also its impact on culture, life, trade, and politics. It is an extremely good book for general Chinese history as well as an in depth look at Chinese art over the centuries, which relates heavily to Chinese cultural, philosophical and religious thought, all through the lens of pottery.

7. *Daily Life in Traditional China: The Tang Dynasty* by Charles Benn: Extremely accessible book that is based completely on secondary sources and cites other reference books. It is a very handy introductory primer to what life generally was like for the average Chinese person. While obviously focused on the Tang Dynasty, it is a solid place for a start as serious readers/history buffs can build off of this solid foundation as they research more on their own. It is a very light read compared to the more academic texts that I usually recommend but personally this one of my favorites.

*Japan*

1. *The Samurai Sourcebook* by Stephen Turnbull (and any other book by Turnbull for that matter): An extremely detailed and thorough, yet highly readable, work on all that is samurai, the warrior class that shaped Japan. It covers everything anyone ever wanted to know about samurai, from daily life during piece, life during war, equipment, pay, rank, military organization, politics, to things like diet, music and art, high culture &amp; low culture. This is the samurai book.

2. *The Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan* by Takekoshi Yosaburou: Exhaustive in its breadth and scope, it covers the economics of Japan throughout the centuries. A monstrous book filled with more numbers, names, places, and dates than one could ever hope to find in one consolidated text, this is everything you ever wanted to know about Japanese money, economics, and value and more. I recently went back to this monster of a book to fulfill a request to find out what the koku(measure of wealth) value of all the individual Japanese provinces were. Sure enough, it was only a matter of picking out the relevant statistics and information, compiling and a short outing with the calculator and BAM. Incredible resource for the impact of money on salaries, prices, access to goods by various people of society, etc. Simply amazing.

**The Americas**

*Mesoamerica*

1. *Codex Chimalpopoca* by John Bierhorst (1998): This text actually contains two sources, the Annals of Cuauhtitlan and The Legend of the Suns. Readers unfamiliar with religious features of Mesoamerica may find this book a little confounding, however it does have a notable place in academic understandings of precolumbian faiths. Bierhorst was also kind enough to include the original Nahuatl which is useful for students of the language.

*North America*

1. *Archaeology of the Southwest* by Linda Cordell and Maxine McBrinn (Third Edition is from 2012): A comprehensive look by two of the most respected names in the field.

2. *The Chaco Meridian* by Stephen Lekson (1999): One of the most interesting and innovative books about the area, by one of its most famous scholars -- he posits a unified theory of the Pueblo world centred on Chaco Canyon.

3. *Archaeology Without Borders: Contact, Commerce, and Change in the U.S. Southwest and Northwestern Mexico* (Southwest Symposium Series) ed. by Maxine McBrinn and Laurie Webster (2008): A collection of papers about the connections between the US Southwestern Pueblo period and Mesoamerica.

Cultural/Intellectual/Religious Studies

**Religion**

*Christianity*

1. *Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity* by Daniel Boyarin (2004): although it has serious problems of readability if you do not know enough about the period, Boyarin's work is easily the most revolutionary thesis about the 'parting of the ways'--between Judaism and Christianity--to come out in recent memory. He argues that, in fact, neither Judaism nor Christianity existed before they constructed each other. See also Judith Lieu's Neither Jew nor Greek (2004).

2. *The Parting of the Ways: between Christianity and Judaism and their significance for the character of Christianity* by James D. G. Dunn (1991; 2nd. ed. 2005): a thorough survey of the status of Judaism at the time of Jesus, and how Christianity slowly positioned itself as 'not Jewish.' A readable classic in the field.

3. *The Quest of the Historical Jesus: a critical study of its progress from Reimarus to Wrede* by Albert Schweitzer (1905, German original): although weighed down by over-faithful English translations, Schweitzer's book is literally the beginning of all contemporary attempts to understand Jesus in a non-theological light, to the point that the historiography of historical Jesus research in split into 'quests', the first of which begins with Reimarus and ends with Wrede (and Schweitzer). This book is essentially a historiography of the Jesus question, and introduced one of the most enduring questions in Jesus research: was Jesus eschatologically minded?

4. *The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? The Search for the authentic sayings of Jesus* by the Robert Funk, Roy Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar (1993): This is effectively the result of a panel of experts, assembled by Funk, to determine the 'authentic' teachings of Jesus by voting on each one with coloured beads. This book contains both their own translation (the ""Scholar's Translation"") of the four canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas, coloured sayings of Jesus, and a guide to their methodology. Incredibly controversial, both within and without the field, the Jesus Seminar's work is best appreciated when compared to the work of others in the ""Third Quest.""

5. *A brief introduction to the New Testament* by Bart D. Ehrman (2004): a very good introduction to the methods and contexts of New Testament studies, going book-by-book. Written at the level of an interested undergraduate student.

*Chinese*

1. *Death Ritual in Late Imperial and Modern China*- Edited by James Watson and Evelyn S. Rawski. A rigorously researched academic treatment of its subject based on both ethnographic fieldwork and collection of primary resources.

2. *Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China*- by Arthur Waley (1939). This book has been criticized and expanded upon with the increased study of the intellectual history of China, and suffers from the traditional failure of historians to take Chinese lay-religion into account when evaluating the broader intellectual trends in China. Nevertheless, it is an excellent introduction to Chinese religious and philosophical thought.

3. *Religion in China Today* edited by Daniel L. Overmyer. A wonderfully informative collection of articles on the resurgence of Chinese religion under communist rule. Academic in nature, but not a terribly difficult read. Anyone interested in how China has attemped (and failed) to repress religious practices in the last 60 years should read this book.

**Intellectual History**

This question and similar others emerged last night when my brother and I had a little debate about this topic and some others regarding national identity. It is my impression that there is people in the Spanish-speaking world that seem to have an issue with this and consider that US citizens have somehow co-opted this term out of some feeling of superiority. Although this feelings might or might not be part of the American present or past identity, the fact is that US citizens simply call themselves Americans because there is no other name for that in English. Our little discussion was not about the present but about the past and origin of this usage of the word ""American"". However we found ourselves somewhat lacking the historical references to properly discuss this topic. That is why I came here to ask.

In order to further illustrate the nature of our little midnight debate I will throw out some more questions. I am not really asking for a list of anwers matching this list of questions, I just want to know more about the topic.

- When did the term ""American"" become the denonym of citizens in the United States?
- Did the inhabitants of the English colonies called themselves Americans?
- If they did, did this term coexisted with other terms like ""colonist"" or any other? Were this terms equally popular?
- Did citizens in some other  North American colonies like Quebec called themselves ""Americans""?
- If they did, how and when did the term started to clearly differentiate US citizens from, for example, Canadian or Mexican ones? In other words, when did it started to refer exclusively to US citizens?
- How is this identity linked to American Revolutionary War and Independence? Did authorities such as politicans or the ""Founding Fathers"" encourage the use of the word ""American""? Did they discouraged other terms or denominations?

Despite my immediate reaction upon seeing [the final photograph in kligon5's series](http://imgur.com/a/pxAvz#8), I could not help but be overwhelmed by what little knowledge I have of the kind of compassion that often provides words like ""humanity"" with a positive connotation. 

Allow me to explain: 

My grandfather was sixteen when he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943. Needless to say, he lied in order to do so. For some reason, he really wanted to be an Airborne Ranger. And that he was. 

Upon completing his training, he was assigned as a medic to the 17th Airborne Division. Less than a year later, his division was deployed. At the ripe age of 17, he found himself parachuting into gunfire . 

""We were tough. Not so tough as trees, the trees that broke our backs and made us easy targets, but we were tougher than the bones in our knees when we landed. I remember we went into the barn after the shooting stopped and we had to shoot the cows. The grenades, too many grenades, you see, they threw pieces of wood at them, at the cows in the barn. They were on the ground, in their hay and their shit, screaming like cows don't scream with splinters bigger than ribs in their ribs. So we shot them good in the head, the poor things. After, we went outside and walked around to see what we could keep. I heard a soldier. He was moaning. When I found him, he was holding his arm and I knew it was bad. He took one in his right. Went clean through. Hit him in the face. His eye was hanging down on his cheek. Didn't want to go the way of the rest of them. Had to cut it clean, but his arm was bleeding dry. And that's bad. When I tried to wrap him up, he screamed, 'Mein auge!' And he fought. I didn't know what he was saying, but I said, 'I know. I know.' I grabbed his arm. I wrapped it good. He screamed, 'Mein auge!' I thought maybe he was calling for his nana, so I told him he'd be good as new if only he stopped screaming, and cut that wire on his eye. He screamed again, 'Mein auge!' And he poked his other eye and out it came. A glass eye sitting in his lap, his other sitting in the dirt. I told myself only God would put me here to help a blind man be more blind, German or not. So I don't like Him. He never did any good by me in that war. And if that German can't see me, then I can't see Him anymore. Not like I used to.""

Specifically, I'm asking about long-term spies who would assume a new identity living as a Westerner in the West.  Because I am an American, experts or people knowledgeable on Soviet spies in the U.S. are especially but not exclusively welcome.

I feel ok in assuming that ordinary people across the world are generally well-meaning and nice, or at the very least uninterested in malice. I assume, then, that the people these spies interacted with in their daily activities; e.g. their coworkers, friends, maybe even their children; revealed themselves to be people just like them.

This part is certainly a little ethnocentrist, but I doubt I'm alone in thinking that life in the West was better than life in the U.S.S.R, and I understand the difficulties and problems that come with attempting to analyze the psychology of a *particular* historical figure, let alone an entire class of them, but what motivation would these presumably very intelligent, very educated, and very adept at seeming Western people have had not to simply join the enemy, so to speak?

I understand that it need not have been hatred for the people they had gotten to know in the West; it's possible that they might have been trying only to keep the balance of power and information even so as not to allow their government to fall.

I'm hoping the answer is more interesting than the threat of death for turning their coats.  

Perhaps some of them did join those they were spying on. Do any of you know anything about that? I hope for their sake there weren't any loyal Soviet spies in the Witness Protection Program or its analogs.

Loidis,131,146,15y9fe,510,"I did a course on Western medicine through the ages in school, and we were taught that scientific progress was largely blocked by the Church in the Middle Ages, though they did allow students to study medical texts from Antiquity. As I understand it, the Roman Catholic Church forbade dissections, disliked doctors with medical knowledge or innovative ideas about health as a threat to their authority, and instead encouraging a focus on prayer. 

My teachers also told us that though much Greek and Roman medical knowledge was lost in Western Europe, some such as Galen remained and was held as the ultimate truth of human anatomy. From a textbook: ""although students did debate the ideas of Galen, any new ideas were judged on the debating skills of the student, not on scientific proof. The Church said that Galen's ideas were so correct that there was no need to investigate any further"". Chaucer also mentions his Doctor was ""well-versed in Aesculpaius too | And what Hippocrates and Rufus knew |
And Disocorides now dead and gone, | Galen and Rhazes, Hali, Serapion"". It seems that Classical medical thinkers were held in the greatest esteem in the Middle Ages.

From this, I have a few questions:

1. Why was the Church more accepting of sources from Greece and Rome (presumably more fallible than contemporary Christian doctors)?
2. Did this attitude apply across the arts, sciences and philosophy?
3. If the Church saw the Greeks and Romans as the pinnacle of human achievement and knowledge, did they consider later times to be in a downward decline?
4. What, if any, influence to the Arabic world have on Medieval understanding of science and human progress through their contact with the Middle East during the Crusades?

I hope these questions make sense and I apologise if I've used some terms incorrectly. Also, I read that people in the Middle Ages had a much more elastic view of history, and frequently conceptualised Biblical events as happening within their own geosocial context (Benedict Anderson, *Imagined Communities*). Therefore, I can understand why it might be inappropriate to imagine Medieval people having a historical lens to view ""human progress"".",Did people in medieval times consider themselves to be on a downward decline compared to Greek or Roman thinkers?,656

I have a PhD in the History of Science from Harvard University, where I focused on the history of biology and the history of physics. My all-consuming research for the last decade or so has been on the **history of nuclear weapons.** I wrote my dissertation on the history of nuclear secrecy in the United States, 1939-2008, and am currently in the final stages of turning that into a book to be published by the University of Chicago Press. I am presently employed by the Center for the History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland, near Washington, DC. 

I am best known on the Internets for writing [Restricted Data: The Nuclear Secrecy Blog](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/), which has shared such gems as the fact that [beer will survive the nuclear apocalypse](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/09/05/beer-and-the-apocalypse/), [the bomb doesn't sound like what you think it does](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/07/13/the-sound-of-the-bomb-1953/), and [plenty of other things](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/archives/). 

I also am the creator of the NUKEMAP, a mashup nuclear weapons effects simulator, and have just this past week launched [NUKEMAP2](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/), which added much more sophisticated effects codes, fallout mapping, and casualty estimates (!!) for the first time, and [NUKEMAP3D](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap3d/), which allows you to visualize nuclear explosions using the Google Earth API.

Uncontrollablellama,24,182,1pokrp,456,"When reading about the history of monarchies, I feel like I've read a lot about regencies, but not very much on how regencies come to be. Was it usually just a matter of the more powerful members of the king's court sitting together and picking someone? Or, I imagine that if the king's death was not a surprise, then he would be able to make personal arrangements for who would run the show after his death. I'd be interested if there are some documented examples of how a regent has been chosen.

My second question is: what is the justification for the almost doctrinal tendency throughout history to appoint the mother of a child monarch as the regent, even in especially patriarchal and ancient monarchies where women are otherwise not allowed to rule under any other circumstances? (e.g. Cixi in China, Marie de Medici in France, Hatshepshut in Egypt [though she eventually seized the throne for herself, she started as a regent iirc])

Unlike queens regnant who legally inherited their right to rule, queen regents were not legally entitled to this appointment and many nations seemed to avoid female rulers at all costs, yet time and time again we see these misogynistic courts freely deciding to choose a woman as a temporary ruler when they certainly have other options. What gives?

My best guesses are that 1) in the court of a child king, the queen mother is the highest-ranking adult around in title. So she was a natural deputy ruler. But I'm not sure how much weight ""rank"" really holds in these matters (since queen consorts often had no political power whatsoever). 2) The mother of the ruler is someone who can be trusted to have the best interests of the ruler in mind, whereas other choices for regent may end up abusing the post for personal motivations.

So does anyone have some less speculatory explanations? It is such a widespread and old custom that I feel like there must be a good reason for it.","In monarchies with a newly-crowned child ruler, who was responsible for determining Regency appointments? Why was the ruler's mother such a common choice?",638

That being said, I like to think I know quality when I see it, and the events of the last few days have shown that I'm not alone in my opinion on this subject.

In the last few weeks, r/History has been having a series of AMAS from popular history podcasters.  Some of them have been pretty okay, but none of them have been up to the amazing standards that this sub has set for itself and it hurts to see them promoted.  This has been especially frustrating with two of them in particular.

Rather than repeat my complaints, [check them out here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1fh62j/rhistorys_users_are_really_defensive_about_their/).

- Ray Harris, of the History of World War II podcast, [did one here](http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1gntgm/i_am_ray_harris_creator_of_the_history_of_war_war/).  It was even worse; by any standard it was awful.  This was like getting a guy who wasn't even smart enough to consult wikipedia properly to do an AMA.  I've laid out some specific complaints [about it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gsat2/friday_freeforall_june_21_2013/canf8sd?context=1), in response to r/History's top mod's defending it, but I was not alone.  There were several flaired users in r/AskHistorians who complained about it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gsat2/friday_freeforall_june_21_2013/cancws3), and on [the day of the AMA here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gnu3s/ray_harris_creator_of_the_history_of_world_war_ii/), and who contributed really welcome challenges to the podcaster in his own thread too.  Just scroll down and look for rusoved, prufrock451, renoXD, and there may be more too.  To put it bluntly, this podcaster spent the whole day providing absolute shit in response to really simple questions, and there's not a single thing he posted in there that anyone should respect.  Please go take a look and see for yourself.

I know that these two subreddits need to get along because that have so much overlapping community and interests, but the thing I love most about r/AskHistorians is the high standards it sets for everything that appears here.  Promoting this sort of thing seems to go against that, and I am offering a formal complaint.

I hope it's okay to make a thread like this.  I searched up past METAS and it seemed like it would be, but I can delete it if not.

Edit edit: I had earlier said I thought I was banned from r/History for this post, but the ban actually came in a few minutes before I made it and I just hadn't noticed.  It seems instead to have been because of [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gwlcq/day_of_reflection_june_17th23rd/caot8xf), based on the time stamps, but no actual reason was given to me so I don't 100% know.

I also study quite a bit of Colonial South Asian history, as a person of Punjabi descent the impact of colonialism really hits close. The Punjabi people are one of the biggest examples of the lingering effects of Colonialism. 

* /u/vonstroheims_monocle : I can answer questions related to the armies which served the British Empire in India during the colonial period.

eternalkerri,112,126,16r63g,431,"Okay folks, lets talk.

We have seen a recent amount of sizable growth in the past few months with our repeated posting to /r/bestof and winning ""Best Large Sub"" from truebestof 2012.  We are flattered and excited by this growth, but at the same time have seen some growing pains occurring, so we wanted to go ahead and address them.


Lately we have seen quite a few rules debates occurring around here.  They have gotten so bad that they ended up exceeding the actual number of posts that actually addressed the issue.  Its fine that you want to debate the rules, however, if you feel passionately enough about them, contact the moderators and ask for a clarification, or ask to take them to a meta thread.  We are here to answer questions, not bog down a thread with debates over the definition of ""is.""

Now, let me go ahead and clarify a few thing outright.

1. ) **The rules are the absolute bare minimum that must be met**.

Most top tier posts fit these guidelines.  However we have seen quite a few mediocre posts (using those terms loosely).  We prefer that you exceed the rules.

2.)  **Copy pasta of an article is lazy posting and spammy**

Someone the other day simply copy and pasted the text of a wiki article as their entire post.  Firstly, always assume that the OP has read the bare minimum of information to include Wikipedia.  You can quote it in your answer, but as your only answer, its just spammy and lazy.  This leads me to...

3.)  **Simply throwing a link up is also a bit lazy** 

If you are linking to a web site or another /r/askhistorians thread that already answered this question, please give a ""TL;DR"" for the links.  

4.)  **Don't post just to ""save for later""  There is a save link feature to reddit.**

Please use it.  You are just spamming up the thread.

5.)  **If you can't answer now, don't answer**

If you do not have to the time to answer, don't throw up a ""I know the answer, but I can't answer now.""  Just wait until you can answer please.  It's not a race to karma, and even though your answer may not end up at the top, you can still use it later to get your flair if that is what you are after.

6.)  **If your answer begins with ""I'm guessing"" or ""I don't know, but I think.."" or god forbid, ""I was told by a guy I once knew"" just don't post.**

If you are not **100,000% sure** of your answer, just don't bother.  It spams up the thread.  This isn't a test you are taking, and its not a contest to answer.  I myself have stopped halfway through more posts than I have finished here because I wasn't 100% sure of my answer.  Quit guessing, you aren't being graded.

7.)  **Source PLEASE if asked, especially if you are not flaired**

If you are being asked for a source, it completely behooves you to find *something* to back up your claims, especially if you are not a flaired user.  Flaired users have shown that they are reliable and are able to substantiate their claims.  Non-flaired users should really substantiate their claims with a source.  No, it doesn't need to be a citation down to the page, but something should be available if you are asked.  You probably aren't the only person to read that book, so it allows people to check your work.

8.)  **In any debate, the mods pretty much are the final word**

Unlike many other subs, the moderator team here are actual experts in their fields varying from college professors to grad students to published writers to highly read amateurs.  We also spend much of the day debating back and forth about new policies, new rules, and the way controversial posts are handled.  Very little is done arbitrarily by ""power tripping mods"" outside of elimination of posts that blatantly violate the rules.  When a mod says the post is not good enough and deletes it and you want to object, take it to mod mail.  When a mod asks for a source, they are doing so for a reason, just give sources.  If you have any problems send it to mod mail, do not spam up a thread with your Braveheart style ""FREEEDOM TO POST!!!!"" speech.

And before you ask, yes, mods here have changed their minds about things after they have been clarified.

9.)  **""UPVOTED FOR AWESOME!""  ""You rock!"" etc. are spam.  Stop it**

'Nuff said.  Let your upvotes speak.

10.)  **Two sentences does not an answer make.  If you are going to answer the question, give an in depth quality answer.**

If your answer is something like this exchange, Q: ""What did pirates really sound like?"" A: ""Pirates came from like all over and they really wouldn't have sounded like you think they do.""  Then you have given a bad answer.  You need to explain yourself, clarify things, show why.  Anyone can write a two sentence answer, someone who actually cares writes a paragraph.

11.)  **Actually answer the question.  Quit trying to redefine the question for them and obfuscate that you don't actually know the answer.  Just bloody answer it.**

Lately, I have seen a lot of hand waving that doesn't actually answer the question.  For example, I myself asked the other day ""How many members of a Roman Legion were from the upper classes?""  The response I got was telling me all about how you had to be a leader in the legions to gain high office.  Yes, thats nice and all, but it doesn't answer the question.  If someone asks, ""Why did Hitler have a mustache?"" don't answer with a bunch of half thought statements about the history of facial hair, answer that specific question.  

12.)  **Stop with the non-sequitors.  Only post something that is relevant.**

Similar to #11.  If OP asks about the history of Islam in the Philippines, don't say something like, ""Bangladesh is Muslim too!""  It's irrelevant and makes you sound like Ralph Wiggum.

The history of Alchemy (more Egyptian/Greek/Middle East/European than Indian or Chinese)

/u/bemonk:

Fell in love with the history of alchemy while a tour guide in Prague and has been reading up on it ever since. I do the [History of Alchemy Podcast](http://historyofalchemy.com/podcast.html) ([backup link](https://itunes.apple.com/cz/podcast/history-of-alchemy-podcast/id601738089?mt=2) in case of traffic issues). I don't make anything off of this, it's just a way to share what I read. I studied Business along with German literature and history.

/u/Bemonk can speak to

* neo-platonism, hermeticism, astrology and how they tie into alchemy

* Alchemy's influence on actual science

/u/MRMagicAlchemy

First introduced to Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy as a freshman English major. His interest in the subject rapidly expanded to include both natural magic and alchemy from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the 19th-century occult revival. Having spent most of his career as an undergraduate studying ""the occult"" when he should have been reading Chaucer, he decided to pursue a M.S. in History of Science and Technology.

His main interest is the use of analogy in the correspondence systems of Medieval and Renaissance natural magic and alchemy, particularly the Hermetic Tradition of the Early Renaissance. 

/u/MRMagicAlchemy can speak to

* 19th century revival

* Carl Jung's interpretation of alchemy

* Chaos Magic movement of the late 20th Century - sigilization

**We can both speak to alchemical ideas in general**, like: 

* philospher's stone/elixir of life, transmutation, why they thought base metals can be turned into gold. Methods and equipment used. 

* Other occult systems that tie into alchemy: numerology, theurgy/thaumatargy, natural magic, etc.

* ""Medical alchemy""

* **facepoundr**: 
I studied Russian history and more specifically Soviet Union history from high school to university. I received my Bachelor's in History from one of the best public schools in my state. I did my honor's thesis concerning Khrushchev's visit to Iowa in 1959. I've also done research into the Gulag system, WW2 (The Great Patriotic War), Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, and probably too much about grain. I am currently reading more Russian Literature and would like to continue my education and receive a graduate degree. Furthermore currently I am employed as non-academic staff at Cornell University. 

* **Fandorin**
I've primarily focused on Russian history between 1700 and 1917, with particular attention to language and culture. Recently, my interest has shifted to the Soviet period, particularly the development of the Soviet Army during WW2, from the strategic and tactical failures at the outset of the war, to the development of the Soviet Army that was able to successfully conduct theater-wide operations against the Wehrmacht. I'm a native Russian speaker.

* **TenMinuteHistory**
I am a graduate student studying Soviet history. The focus of my research is Soviet culture. I received my masters in World history (with a thesis focusing on Soviet Film), and am now working on my Phd in Soviet history. My time period of greatest interested is the Revolution itself, really up until World War II. A great deal of good work is currently being done on the post war era currently and I foresee myself doing a project in that era down the road

* **occupykony**

* **MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE**
I worked for two years at a bipartisan foreign policy think tank as the research assistant to a former U.S. National Security Adviser who served during the Cold War. My Ph.D. studies have included a course on Soviet foreign policy taught by a long time member of the intelligence community who was working in the DNI during the Bush administration, a course on the Eastern Bloc taught by an advisor to the Policy Planning staff at the Department of state, and a course on modern Chinese history (which necessarily covers its relationship with Russia/USSR) taught by the former State Department historian for China. I have done a significant amount of graduate work on my own on geopolitics and nuclear weapons, both of which focus centrally on the foreign policy and international relations of Russia/USSR.

At one point, a group of women gossip about the effrontery of ""an Oriental"" asking her for the time with another mentioning that ""there's a law against that.""  Later, another lady asks the player (in the guise of the ruggedly handsome Booker DeWitt) for the time in a rather lewd tone.  This made me wonder if the game creators might be using asking for the time as code for a request for a sexual ""hookup.""  I mentioned it [in another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1h27xu/bioshock_infinite_asking_the_time_is_code_for_a/) and a commenter pointed out that in *Catcher in the Rye*, Holden refers to having sex as ""giving her the time"" and speculates the term might be period slang and not unique to the game.

So, my question is this:  Was asking for the time ever used as code for a sexual hookup?

EDIT:  /u/Ex-PFC-Wintergreen has come up with a reference of the term being used in London gay circles.  Whether the authors of the game intended this is unknown.  Also, /u/xiaorobear has pointed out the term is also a nice play on the phrase ""I wouldn't give him the time of day"" and still works if it's just a conversational gambit as opposed to an actual code.

charugan,111,136,1gc0wz,418,"Independent cities are cities that do not even nominally exist within a county -- they are beholden only to the state.  In the United States, there are 42 independent cities, and 39 of them are in Virginia (the exceptions are Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson City, NV).

I have been trying for some time to figure out why this is so.  I know that this practice started in the Virginia Constitution of 1870, so I'll wager it has something to do with the civil war, the secession of the counties that became West Virginia, and/or reconstruction.  However, I have been unable to locate any sources that give me a firm answer.  Particularly frustrating is the fact that the Virginia General Assembly didn't keep records until the 20th century.

* **Ankhx100** will be answering questions about Egypt from *1800 AD* onwards, and also has an interest in *Ottoman, Medieval, Roman* and *Byzantine Egypt*.

* **Daeres** will be answering questions about *Ptolemaic Egypt*, in particular regarding state structures and cultural impact.

* **Leocadia** will be answering questions about *New Kingdom Egypt*, particularly about religion, literature and the role of women.

* **Lucaslavia** will be answering questions about *New Kingdom Egypt* and the *Third Intermediate Period*, and also has an interest in *Old Kingdom* and *Pre-Dynastic Egypt*. A particular specialist regarding Ancient Egyptian Literature.

* **Nebkheperure** will be answering questions about *Pharaonic Egypt*, particularly pre-Greek. Also a specialist in hieroglyphics.

* **Riskbreaker2987** will be answering questions regarding Late *Byzantine Egypt* all the way up to *Crusader era Egypt*, including *Islamic Egypt* and *Fatimid Egypt*.

* **The3manhimself** will be answering questions regarding *New Kingdom Egypt*, in particular the *18th dynasty* which includes the Amarna period.

In addition to these named specialties, all of the panelists have a good coverage of Egypt's history across different periods.

- The Mongols believed that religion was tied to your birthplace and saw no reason why someone from one area would need to believe the same thing as someone from another. 

-The Mongols benefitted from religious refugees from other places, accepting in intelligent, trained persecuted individuals from all faiths. 

-The Mongols themselves were very diverse religiously and so therefore they were tolerant and accepting of each other so why wouldn't they be tolerant and accepting of the people in their empire. 

-The Mongols believed that any religion could potentially be correct, so by stipulating that the faithful pray for blessings on the Khan of Khans, they would be protected and blessed from any of them if that particular religion was correct.

I'd like to announce a new sister subreddit to /r/AskHistorians and the rest of the /r/Ask... family, **/r/AskAnthropology**. It's devoted to anthropology, which to the uninitiated is the holistic ""science of humanity"" and traditionally encompasses human evolution and physical diversity (biological anthropology), cultural and sociolinguistic diversity (sociocultural and linguistic anthropology) and archaeology. We get a lot of questions on those subjects here; but while we have a number of fantastic flaired users who specialise in some aspect of anthropology, they unfortunately don't always get high quality answers. So the idea of /r/AskAnthropology is to have a Q&amp;A subreddit focusing on anthropology alone, giving them a better chance of getting answered.

Myself and our very own /u/Pachacamac have started the new sub, and I've invited some of our anthropologically-minded flairs to start the panel, so it will very much be run in the same mould as /r/AskHistorians. We're already off to a good start with a number of interesting questions (some shamelessly pinched from recent questions here that weren't answered), so please do come along, subscribe, ask questions, and help us get it off the ground! And if you're knowledgeable about anthropology or a related discipline, we of course need people to answer them too! 

I should point out that **this by no means implies that questions about prehistory and archaeology are no longer appropriate for /r/AskHistorians!** Rather, archaeology, and especially historic and late prehistoric archaeology, is the nice fuzzy overlap zone, and questions about it are welcome in either sub. We may gently steer questions that are *exclusively* about, say, evolution or ""human nature"" towards /r/AskAnthropology, in the same way we often suggest people crosspost questions about historical linguistics to /r/linguistics.

I fell immediately in love with the job, and returned to it for 8 summers and one winter.

Being that I enjoyed this job so much, I went on and got my Master's in Public History, with a focus on museum education. Along the way, I worked at a few other museums (mostly historic houses), and served as the education coordinator for two small, struggling museums. 

I'd like to keep this AMA focused on work and life in the museum sector, [as my last AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ymybd/wednesday_ama_iama_history_professor_museum/) focused mainly on academic and factual questions about the American Revolution.

Alot_Hunter,76,91,11dkfx,329,"On the one hand, rape seems like it's incredibly common, particularly in Greek myths. Almost every Homeric hero rapes someone at one point or another. The gods are constantly raping people. Even in ancient culture, the inhabitants of a conquered city were typically raped.

On the other hand, rape seems at times like it's condemned. In the Greek myths, a number of men are punished in the Underworld for raping women or attempting to rape a goddess. Homer in particular seems contradictory -- on the one hand, the major feud between Achilles and Agamemnon is that Agamemnon took Briseis away from him; she was *his* to be raped. On the other hand, the gods do punish people for raping others. Ajax rapes Cassandra on the altar of Athena and is later killed by Poseidon in punishment. In some myths, Orion tries to rape Artemis and is killed either by her or Apollo. Tityos tried to rape Leto and was punished in a manner similar to Prometheus.

With the Romans, rape seems to be the cause of a number of problems historically. The rape of Lucretia sparks the creation of the Roman Republic. The rape of Verginia incited the people to drive out the Decemvirs.

I was re-reading Game of Thrones like a giant nerd, and I was thinking about the character of Varys the spymaster.

Since this subreddit’s inception nearly two years ago, we’ve grown to be one of the bigger subs on Reddit, arguably the most active history board on the internet (depending on how one defines that), and we’re often lauded as one of the most consistently academic and reliable sections of Reddit.

All of this is thanks to the work of many people, but one of the groups that deserves a special amount of recognition is our flaired users.

Alas, as we have grown larger than I ever imagined, we could use some additional flaired users. While we have many skilled people currently answering questions for us routinely, we are also aware that we have pretty big gaps in our collective expertise. For example—our India specialists are particularly scant. 

Even in those disciplines for which we *do* have good posters, *more* commenters can only diversify our focus, taking our current status as a sub for historical *explanation* among experts, to the next level—a sub for historical *discussion* among experts. I know, for example, /u/NMW has been itching to get into some deep WWI discussions.

For these reasons, the moderating team is opening, for this week, our first ever **FLAIR DRIVE**! Here’s what that entails:

1. There are people on this subreddit who consistently post fantastic answers, yet continue to muck around without flair. We want these people signing up, ASAP. Signing up for flair allows us to more easily pinpoint where our experts are, so we can organize our subreddit better. So, *please*, if you know your historical niche quite well, *please* apply! We’ll be messaging people who we think make good candidates, but if you don’t get a letter, that doesn’t mean we don’t want you applying—it just means you’ve gotten lost among the piles of great posters we have on this sub.

2. Tell your historically-inclined friends/family about the sub! We know that there are history buffs hidden in the woodwork all over the place—please direct them to /r/askhistorians for us!

3. We (the mod team) will be going around to other subreddits, asking their respective mod teams for names of particularly knowledgeable individuals, whom we will then proceed to invite to our sub, encouraging them to make the requisite 3-5 quality comments for flair.

So here’s what we ask you:

•	If you fit in the description in the above number one, APPLY!

•	If you know some history buffs, follow the instructions in number two!

•	Let us know if you have any other ideas to encourage people to sign up for flair!

Thanks,

My name is Heribert von Feilitzsch. I grew up in Germany, only yards from the East German border, the ""Iron Curtain."" In 1988 I came to the United States as a student. Fascinated with the ""Tortilla Curtain,"" the Mexican-American border, I pursued a Masters Degree in Latin-American History with focus on Mexican-American relations at the University of Arizona. The Mexican-American border still constitutes a barrier that divides two cultures, two distinct national identities, and creates a complicated economic and political framework worth studying. Last year, after 20 years of research, I published a book about the German spy Felix A. Sommerfeld, who became a very influential actor in the Mexican Revolution and the German intelligence organization in the USA during World War I. 

As a historian I believe in three basic premises: Let the information lead you to the story, do not use hindsight to judge historical actors, and triangulate all available information to form your theses.  

I will answer any questions that concern the time period of 1906 to 1918 that have to do with Mexico, the United States, and Germany. My special interest is intelligence history and German involvement in U.S. and Mexican relations in that time period.

Fallingwater_Admin,51,70,1jf5h6,309,"From 1935-1938 architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed and oversaw construction of a modernist home resting above a waterfall in the Laurel Highlands of Pennsylvania. He named it Fallingwater, and it remains one of America’s most visited and recognizable homes. Two members of Fallingwater’s senior staff have agreed to answer questions about Frank Lloyd Wright, Modernism, and preservation of Fallingwater. 
The panel includes:

Scott W. Perkins, Director of Preservation (username Fallingwater_Preserv). I oversee preservation of Fallingwater’s buildings and collections (furniture, artwork, textiles, books), including the areas of landscape maintenance and museum housekeeping. I am trained as a design historian and specialize in the history of interiors. I am also a PhD candidate at the Bard Graduate Center, currently writing my dissertation on the life and work of artist-designer Eugene Masselink, who also happened to be secretary to Frank Lloyd Wright. 

Clinton Piper, Museum Programs Assistant (username Fallingwater_Admin). I am a preservationist and architectural historian by training.  I started working at Fallingwater as a tour guide during summer breaks and later took an administration position in which I work closely with Fallingwater’s Director in general museum administration and numerous special projects including copyright and trademark issues, the recent adaptive reuse of the Bear Run Barn at Fallingwater and other capital improvement projects.

eternalkerri,166,92,18sbnb,309,"We are quickly approaching 100k users.  This will make us one of the 125 largest subreddits on this site.  This is going to present a few new challenges for us.  Here they are with their answer.

**1)  Default status.**

Askhistorians WILL NEVER BECOME A DEFAULT SUB IF WE HAVE ANY SAY SO.  I believe the way we put it in moderator discussion was, ""I would rather burn this sub to the ground than let it become a default sub.""  That was me, I said that, and everyone agreed.  We have already set the system to not allow this sub to become part of the default set.

**2)  More posters**

We recognize that there are more people posting here.  Therefore we have a few things in place.  Firstly, we will be contacting users we have singled out for their quality posting to become moderators.  This will bring the team up to about 17 moderators.  This will allow moderators to participate as well as moderate as it will take some of the stress off of them.  Additionally we would like to direct you to [the Panel thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/13kurw/the_panel_of_historians_iv/) and the [Quality Contributor thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16hjgd/meta_flaired_users_list_quality_contributor_flair/).  If you feel that you would like to receive flair or nominate someone for flair, feel free to use these links to nominate yourself or others.

Additionally, more posters means more users unfamiliar with this subreddits rules and culture.  So let me direct you again to [OUR RULES](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) as well as our [GUIDELINES FOR RULES](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/16r63g/meta_some_reminders_and_clarifications_about/).  Think of them like this, the Rules = Constitution, Clarification = The Laws.  Both are enforceable, and will be.

We also request that you view the [POPULAR QUESTIONS](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/faq) thread before you ask.

**3)Now we need to also make a few of our rules clear to you guys, again.  These are the important rules**

1)  20 year rule.  If it has occurred in the past twenty years, it is off limits pending moderator review.

2)  NO RACISM, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, OR OTHER BIGOTED BEHAVIOR

I am so not kidding.  Do not think you are being clever, we have many historians in this sub who actually specialize in racial, sexual, or gender history INCLUDING A MOD.  We have had more than enough experience in recognizing the behavior.  Yes, if you come here and post something racist and you are from one of the several racist or other biggoted subreddits, we will not only thoroughly thrash your propaganda, but we will also ban you.  Yes, we will read through your posting history to see if you have a history of bigotry.

3)  No soapboxing or speechifying.

You hate America?  Fine, go somewhere else.  You a die hard college communist?  Great.  Go somewhere else.  This is not the place to recruit, to rabble rouse, to instigate.  At this point we have plenty of experience spotting that too.  You will have your post removed.

4)  Copy Pasting **ANY SOURCE** as your only way of posting, is VERBOTEN.  People come here to receive quality, in depth analysis from historians, history students, and history buffs.  Please assume the OP of the question isn't a complete moron and has googled for the answer.  Additionally, this is /r/askhistorians, not /r/askgoogle.  Yes, you can copy and paste a source and give a summary of that link and source,  but simply throwing up a link or a wall of copied text is intellectually lazy and will result in the post being removed.

5)  On topic, relevant humor only.  No memes, advice animals, reaction gifs, or funny videos are allowed.  The humor cannot be top tiered comments.  Humor is allowed to stray more off topic in *meta threads only*.  Jokes otherwise must be relevant, on topic, and hopefully funny.  I personally hate puns.

6)  Topic drift.  The original Godwins Law stated that the longer a UseNet conversation went the more likely Hitler was to be brought up.  It meant the thread was dead.  Here we also avoid topic drift.  A logical progression of topics being brought up is allowed, but please, don't let a thread on 19th Century agriculture end up about cow tipping.

7) Anecdotes are frowned upon.  Unless you were there yourself at the event, its probably not a strong enough source.

8) If you are guessing, or you heard from something somewhere some time ago, don't bother.  We will delete with extreme prejudice.

9) Wikipedia is the worst possible source you can use.  Its acceptable at times, and in a pinch, but it really isn't a good source.  If you couldn't use it in a paper, it probably wont work here.


**4) Eternal~~kerri~~ September

In light of the ever expanding number of users, of course there will be cries of Eternal September.  The moderation team can only do so much.  We need the user base to assist us by flagging violating posts as spam.  We also want you to understand **we enforce rules here**.  If you have a problem with the rules, address them to the moderation team, but Braveheart style speeches do not endear us to your plight (neither does calling us faggots after we ban you).  The level of our enforcement and strictness of enforcement, as well as our patience is directly inverse to the level of chicanery in the sub.  The more the rules are violated, the more people flagrantly violate them, the more people thumb their noses at the mods, the more likely we are to increase the intensity and harshness of our moderation.

This is your sub, we just enforce the rules.  If your fellow users cannot police themselves and you are not willing to assist in helping them understand they are violating the rules, then we will have to enforce the rules more and more strictly until we suck every bit of fun out of the sub.","[Meta]100k users, Eternal September, Rules, Moderators, and a million other things.",401

Tiako,211,63,timi4,304,"This is for ""above average"" general readers. If the book averages two or more footnotes per page, think twice and justify its inclusion. Secondary and tertiary sources are *strongly* favored: this is for general readers. Feel free to ignore these suggestions, but include reasons for why you are ignoring it (ie, ""This is an academic work, but is highly readable""). As Agentdcf pointed out, we don't want this turning into the ""History"" section at the Barnes &amp; Noble, but also bare in mind that these works should be accessible both in terms of content and in terms of availability. Anything, however, is acceptable with sufficient justification.

So, without further ado:

**General**

1. *Why the West Rules, for Now* by Ian Morris: An excellent overview of both Western and Eastern history. Morris combines a readable style and an ability to explain historical concepts in an easy manner with a historian's rigor. An excellent introduction to the topic of historical studies.

2. *A Little History of the World* by Ernst Gombrich. It is essentially a summary of human history to around the 1930s. I read this when I was younger - it's aimed perfectly at interested children, and manages to be accessible and entertaining without being condescending.

3. *Cities* by John Reader. A social history of the development of cities - particularly good chapters on the Renaissance and Mexico City stick in my mind.

4. Winchester's *Atlantic* is a very interesting history of the Atlantic Ocean, and particularly of the relationship between Britain and the Americas. It is somewhat similar to Kurlansky and Bryson's work but still enjoyable. Winchester has also written a book on the invention of the dictionary - I haven't read it but it's supposed to be excellent.

5. *The Mediterranean in the Time of Philip the Second* by Fernand Braudel: Possibly the most important work of history of the 20th cen. I probably wouldn't argue this, but my point is the case can and has been made. It's a major major work -- and tremendously written. When we talk about Jared Diamond, we're talking about big, long, slow processes as determining the shape of history. That's Braudel, in a nutshell--except he tried to deal with everything from trade, warfare, religion, urbanism, naval technology, culture, individual agency, etc. He may not have succeeded in explaining everything, but he literally changed the game in France in the 1950s and 60s (and 70s in America, when his work was translated into English).

6. *Empires of the Word* by Nicholas Oster: A great work of general world history for the general public. Exploring history through the lens of languages give a new perspective on many eras. As a bonus, a historian's work is often based around reading primary sources - knowing why the primary sources are in a particular language helps you appreciate them all the more.

7. *The Prize* by Daniel Yergin: Describes the history of the oil industry beginning in the 1800s through the 1990s. Combines many historical narrative types to create a sweeping, global narrative of how oil has impacted all aspects of society. Particularly good at explaining the science aspect of the oil industry--how oil is found and produced, how oil varies from region to region, etc.

**Historiography**

1. *Who Owns Antiquity?* by James Cuno. Title is self-explanatory - discusses issues of nationality and imperialism in the management of historical artefacts. The author is making an argument against nationalistic retention, but still provides a very good overview.

2. *The Landscape of History* John Lewis Gaddis: If you are interested in how History and Historians view the world around them and the world of the past this is for you. You'll often hear references to 'thinking like a lawyer' or some other profession. Gaddis sums up what it means to think like a historian. He also provides a strong line in the sand between historical inquiry and the social sciences and I personally enjoyed him sort of tearing into the objectivity and the 'scientific' approach that social scientists shroud themselves in.

3. *What is History* E. H. Carr: Read this for the same reason you would read Gibbon's decline and fall. Its extremely eloquent and flat out beautiful in its prose at times. E H Carr was a leading man in the historical field in the mid 20th century. He treads a middle line between empiricism and idealism. To quote from a review 'Arguably the central ideas in the book constitute today's mainstream thinking on British historical practice'.

4. *History: A very short introduction* John H Arnold: Its short. Its less a true 'historiography' in that it doesn't get into method or theory and is more a history of history. Again I will quote a far more able reviewer.
""This is an extremely engaging book, lively, enthusiastic and highly readable, which presents some of the fundamental problems of historical writing in a lucid and accessible manner. As an invitation to the study of history it should be difficult to resist.""--Peter Burke, Emmanuel College, Cambridge

5. *That Noble Dream: The ""Objectivity Question"" and the American Historical Profession* by Peter Novick. Addresses the naivete of the ideal of objectivity. A nice complement to Gaddis in some respects, though Gaddis is probably the better volume.

**Modern History**--The study of history beginning with the 19th century globalization.

*East Asia*

1. *A Modern History of Japan* by Andrew Gordon

2. *War without Mercy* by John Dower is pretty much the best comparative look at race and ideology in the Pacific War. It's long and a bit academic, but there's none better. (WWII)

3. *America's Geisha Ally* by Naoko Shibusawa Is a very readable account of the cultural and media politics of the US occupation of Japan. It examines the transformation of Japan from implacable enemy to ""geisha ally"" in US eyes, and in doing so, explains much of Japan's current relationship with the US. (US occupation of Japan)

3. *Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader* by Bradley K. Martin: It blends into journalism by the end (plenty of descriptions of current happenings), but his explanations of Japanese occupation, revolution and Kim Il-Sung's rise to power was quite good.

4. *Embracing Defeat* by John Dower: The benchmark book on immediate postwar culture in Japan. It is a bit more readable than War Without Mercy. (Immediate Post-WWII)

5. *Rearranging the Landscape of the Gods* by Sarah Thal: Nominally this work is about the Konpira Shrine and its changes from the late Sengoku to the modern world. But it goes far deeper, and provides a vivid illustration of the extraordinary changes in Japanese socity, particularly during the tumultuous times after the Meiji Restoration.

*Europe/""The West""*

1. *Cod and Salt* by Mark Kurlansky are similar to Bryson - both use a somewhat obscure but still fascinating subject matter to narrate the rise of America (among other things). His work is very readable.

2. *The Balkans* by Mark Mazower: A Brief Summary of Balkan history to the present day, but nevertheless very insightful. A great starting point to see why people tend to have been wrong about the Balkans.

3. *Yugosavia: Twice there was a Country* by John Lampe: A great overview of the turbulent 20th century and the brief existence of a Yugoslav state.

4. *Postwar: A history of Europe since 1945* by Tony Judt: Very detailed and good overview of Europe's post war history.

5. *George, Nicholas, and Wilhelm* by Miranda Carter: A very good account of the politics leading up to WWI; Carter's thesis is that the actions of George V of England, Nicholas II of Russia, and Wilhelm of Germany had repercussions and led the countries to war. It helps if you have an understanding of late 19th century politics, but it's not necessary. Carter's writing is pretty scholarly, but I caught myself laughing a few times while reading - really readable.

*Eastern Europe*

1. *Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin* by Timothy Snyder. Very readable account of the events in countries caught between the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany during the beginnings of WWII, starting with Ukraine's Holodomor and the political tensions that rose from Stalin's paranoia of outside influence during those events. Really gives you a sense of the suffering of the people.

2. *The Dictators* by Richard Overy. This is not quite a readable as Snyder, but a very well-written and well-documented comparative history of the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, highly recommended for the enthusiast already familiar with the general details of each regime's history and wanting to really gain an understanding of their similarities and differences.

3. *Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State* by Satter. Very readable and recent history of the rise of the criminal influence in Russian government following the downfall of the Soviet Union. Really uses his understanding of Russian psychology gained by years as the Moscow correspondent for the WSJ to give insight into what happened and why.

4. Three books by Richard Pipes: *Russia Under the Old Regime, The Russian Revolution* and *Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime*. Pipes has a somewhat conservative take on events, but the writing clearly quarantines his opinion away from his facts, and, well, for someone who still remembers standing in line around the block for stale bread in winter of '92, like myself, his harsh criticism is not unjustified.

5. *The Russian Revolution* by Sheila Fitzpatrick is a shorter summary of the Revolution which is extremely readable.

6. *The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia* by Davis Hoffman. A very well-written account of the rise of the current Russian inner-circle in the highest echelons of power under Putin in the years during the downfall of the Soviet Union. Starts with short biographies of the 6 main players in this history, and then gives a fascinating detailed account of their accumulation of and fights for power.

*North America*

1. *1861: The Civil War Awakening* by Adam Goodheart: A popular history book that discusses the mood of the nation in the lead-up to the Civil War.

2. *Arc of Justice: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age* by Kevin Boyle: Winner of a National Book Award, this book is a great introduction to housing discrimination and racial tensions in Detroit in the early part of the 20th century.

3. *Red Hills and Cotton: An Upcountry Memory* by Ben Robertson: Provides a history of the upcountry of South Carolina as memoirs.

4. *Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion* by Peter H. Wood: Discusses the early history of African slaves in Colonial South Carolina to the plantation period.

5. *The Glorious Cause* by Robert Middlekauf: Rather by definition the master book on the Revolution. Not formative or revolutionary in its approach, but a comprehensive look at the entire war.

6. *Who Killed Canadian History?* - Jack Granatstein. If you want to go in to any depth in Canadian history, reading Granatstein is a must. This is one of his more controversial books, it's always under fire from other scholars, which makes it an interesting read about Canadian history.

7. *The Empire Within* - Sean Mills. Important because it provides detailed information about the rise, and existence of the FLQ. Important to show that Quebec has a distinct history from the rest of the country.

8. *Towards Defining the Prairies: Region, Culture, and History. A Collection of Essays about the Canadian West* from Gerald Friesen to W.C. Morton. Way more academic. Shows how unique the Canadian west is, and much like Quebec, how it has its own distinct history.

9. *John Adams* by David McCullough: Very readable account of an often misunderstood man. Particularly great at juxtaposing Adams's vanity with his genuine belief in the ideas of the American Revolution.

10. *Battle Cry of Freedom* by James McPherson: Widely considered as the seminal one-volume work on the Civil War period, focusing holistically on the economic, social, political, and military aspects of the time.

11. *Oxford History of the United States* series, of which I don't think I have seen anything negative written about any of the books in the series.

12. *Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963* by Taylor Branch: a Pulitzer Prize winning book detailing, as the title implies, the civil rights movement in the United States.

*Middle East*

1. *Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict:* a history with documents by Smith. This is a nice, concise history of the conflict that contains accessible documents that are relevant to the previous section. It is largely low-bias and perfectly captures both sides of the debate.

2. *Turkey: A Modern History* by Zurcher. This book, while lacking in primary source references in some spots, is the most expansive modern history of a country that I've ever read. It manages it's events in a clear way, and connects the important events to the overall history of the middle east.

3. *A History of the Arab Peoples*: Albert Hourani, a classic in the discipline.

4. *The Modern Middle East: A History* James Gelvin, I think this book wants to avoid being a textbook but ends up in the same place, but does it better and in fewer pages than Cleveland.

5. *A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire* M. Şükrü Hanioğlu, because none of the other synthetic histories of the late Ottoman Empire are as brief or succinctly worded as this one.

6. *Osman's Dream: A History of the Ottoman Empire* by Caroline Finkel: the best, and really only, single-volume history of the OE. Most of the rest are a snore to read.

7. *A Quiet Revolution: The First Palestinian Intifada and Nonviolent Resistance* by Mary E. King:
The title is fairly self explanatory, but I think it gives a good analysis of the events. Also the focus on the non-violence movement and its effect are frequently missing from the popular discourse on the matter.

8. *The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years* by Bernard Lewis -This is a very readable book by the fields leading scholar.

9. *A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind* by Michael Axworthy

10. *Rule Of Experts: Egypt, Technopolitics and Modernity* by Timothy Mitchell: an innovative take on the history of the modern world in eight interlocking essays about Egypt in the 20th century which deal with everything from land surveys to the plagiarisms of mid-century anthropology to a history of the Aswan Dam from the perspective of a mosquito. This book challenges traditional ways of talking about history by deemphasizing human agency and focusing on the formative power of knowledge practices and technology.

11. *Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History* by Thomas Barfield: Broad history detailing the political changes that have taken place within Afghanistan over the past few centuries, along with a readable description of the various ethnic groups residing within the country.

12. *All the Shah's Men* by Stephen Kinzer: A great read about the overthrow of Iran's shah, the role of the U.S. in that coup, and the eventual rise of the revolutionary movement in the region.

**Western Eurasia**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from Mesopotamian agriculture.

*Near East*

1. *Persian Fire* by Tom Holland: is a really great introduction, whilst also being a great book about Greek History at the same time. Now, because he is deliberately constructing a comprehensive world for readers he is having to fill in quite a few gaps, and in my opinion not always correctly. But nonetheless his style of writing will leave you with a very clear image of the cultures he writes about. 

2. *Rise and Fall of Egypt* by Toby Wilkinson It's very well written with a superb narrative style and from an academic perspective its predominantly spot on. It tends to gloss over some of the debates which are still ongoing but only to maintain a cohesive narrative.

3. *The Twilight of Ancient Egypt* by Karol Mysliwiec. It covers the cultural melting pot in the Nile valley quite nicely and is very accessible in terms of style. Not quite as general a history as Toby Wilkinson though.

4. *The Tomb in Ancient Egypt* by Salima Ikram: which is comprehensive and full of beautiful pictures to properly track evolution of funerary culture. 

5. *Complete Pyramids* by Mark Lehner: Of a similar ilk but more focused on the old kingdom complexes.

6. *The Bible Unearthed* by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman. Among the most popular introductory level books on any biblical subject ever written. Just be a little bit careful, Finkelstein works in his ""low chronology"" without preface, which is good for his inteded audience, but bad for a broader view, as it remains contentious. It's worth picking up Grabbe's book to help spot where he does so.

7. *Did God Have a Wife *by William Dever. Dever has a decidedly more conservative flair, but trumps other more conservative scholars by being an archaeologist, and--for the most part--giving the archaeology priority.

8. *Israel's History and the History of Israel* by Mario Liverani. Liverani stands out as being perhaps the truest scholar of the Ancient Near East generally to write on the history of Israel, and this is valuable on that basis alone.

9. *Ancient Israel: What do we know and how do we know it?* by Lester Grabbe. Despite the somewhat colloquial feel of the title, this is not light reading. Nor is it intended to be, it provides a succinct, easily understandable discussion of all of the major debates in Israelite archaeology today. It wonderfully fills a fairly obvious gap for a quick and dirty reference for recent discoveries.

10. *Biblical History and Israel's Past*, Megan B. Moore and Brad E. Kelle (2011). I can't say enough about how fantastic this book is. The breadth and accessibility of this overview of the current state of research is incredible. The suggested reading at the end of each chapter provides a wonderful selection of equally readable texts (at least among ones I've read). Just. . .fantastic.


*Classical Civilization*

*Iron Age Europe*

1. *The World of the Celts* by Simon James: Provides a condensed overview of the Celtic world including everything from theoretical beginnings to the idea of modern Celts and from fighting Rome to farming practices.

2. *The Atlantic Celts: Ancient People or Modern Invention* by Simon James: A very short book which outlines the development of the Celtic ""myth."" Its conclusions are fairly controversial, but some very interesting light is shone on the creation of national identities.


*Greece*

1. *Thundering Zeus: The Making of Hellenistic Bactria, by Frank L. Holt* (1999): It's quite a current book, it's well researched, it's a great introduction to Bactria and to Central Asia as an entity.

2. *From Samarkhand to Sardis*, by Susan Sherwin White and Amelie Kuhrt. It's very well written, it introduced the approach of looking at the Hellenistic world and Seleucid Empire in their own right as opposed to just an extension of Classical Greece, and it is very comprehensive.


*Rome*

1. *Why Rome Fell* by Adrian Goldsworthy: Goldsworthy is the author of numerous works of popular history and is very familiar with the form. He provides and excellent and detailed narrative, as well as an analysis focused on political systems.

2. *The Fires of Vesuvius* by Mary Beard: Readable and lively, Beard captures the vivacious character of Pompeii along with providing an introduction to the field of classical archaeology.

3. *Rubicon* by Tom Holland: A great read that really brings Republican Rome to life.

4. *Mediterranean Anarchy, Interstate War, and the Rise of Rome* by Arthur Eckstein: I'm probably biased because Dr. Eckstein is one of my professors, but this book brought up an idea of why Rome came to be the preeminent Mediterranean power that hadn't really been explored extensively yet. Eckstein chose to explain it in modern Realist terms of political relations and alliances, rather than the raw brutality and tendencies towards violence which characterized the period - something he argues was not unique to Rome at all, nor were they ""better"" at it than anyone, as was the prevailing theory.

5. *The Fall of Rome and End of Civilization* by Bryan Ward-Perkins: A work that has quickly become a standard, it uses archaeology to provocatively draw a harsh line between the Roman and post-Roman world. It also functions as an excellent introduction to archaeology and the Roman economy.


*Medieval*

1. *The Year 1000* by Robert Lacey and Danny Danziger: a fascinating narrative history of the year 1000. It is short and certainly aimed at a mass market but still informative and entertaining.

2. *Exploring the World of the Vikings* by Richard Hall: Written by the former head of the archaeological digs in York, it's the best and most up-to-date overview of the Viking age. It's a bit archaeology-heavy, but in that field that's a must, due to the basically non-existing genuine historical tradition.

3. *The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy Land* by Thomas Asbridge: Asbridge is one of the leading modern scholars of the crusades, and this books is not only expansive in its scope, covering the crusading movement from genesis to the aftermath of the fall of Acre, but it is also quite readable. Plus it's quite inexpensive for a scholarly work. Heavily focused on the Third Crusade, particularly on Saladin and Richard.

4. *The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire* by Edward Luttwak. Luttwak focuses on the general narrative of Byzantium in this book. He spends time detailing the military, social, political, and cultural realities of the Byzantine Empire and outlines why it was able to function as long as it did in spite of a great many internal and external stressors.

5. *The Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History* by Norman F. Cantor: he is able to explain the schism of the Catholic church very well, as well as the various societies. He also presents a theory on why Eastern Europe opposed the use of icons.

*Early Modern*

1. *Natasha's Dance* by Orlando Figes is a very readable record of Russian history and cultural identity, from Peter the Great to the Soviet Union.

2. *The Origins of Modern Europe 1660-1789 by James L. White. Readable summary of European history during that period - I've only used a few chapters for papers but it was extremely useful.*

3. *Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766* by Fred Anderson: It was a great book about the events that proceeded (and Anderson asserts helped to bring about) the American Revolution while also touching upon the broader war between Britain and France throughout the world (Havana, the Philippines, India, Europe). But don't be fooled, this is mainly focused on the invasion of Canada and what would become the Midwest and the immediate aftermath.

4. *The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806* by Jonathan Israel: An impressive scholarly well-documented account of the history of the Low Countries (in relation to the rest of Early Modern Europe). Yet, very accessible for the general reader.

5. *The Rise of Modern Warfare 1618-1815* by H.W. Koch: Absolutely full of etchings, portraits, and diagrams. Divided into several sections based on country: England, France, Russia, etc., as well as general discussion of modern warfare. Each section discusses uniform, armament, and tactics. Suitable for in-depth study or just looking at the pictures.

6. For Russian history, anything by Robert Massie. *Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, The Romanovs.* Very readable, well-written, well-researched, very detailed and in-depth and yet never boring accounts of Russian history.

7. *History of Russia* by Vernadsky. A readable overview of Russian history from Kievan Rus' through WWII, if you get one of the later editions (the earliest edition was published in 1929). Much better written than Riasanovsky's still-in-print book of the same name, which I could never understand why people enjoy reading.

8. *The Return of Martin Guerre* by Natalie Zemon Davis: Heavy archival research backs an exploration of common culture in a 16th-century French village. Particularly present are questions of identity, evidence, and community. This is a very popular work by a celebrated American cultural historian of early modern France

9. *The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller* by Carlo Ginzburg: The author uses archival research to address questions of how common people lived in early modern (northern) Italy. The book offers a glimpse of the ways common people participated in the discourse of ideas in counter-reformation Italy.

*Early Modern Colonial*

1. *Mayflower by Nathaniel Philbrick* - a very good book about the founding of Plymouth Plantation, and the first 50 years afterwards.

2. *Mayflower Bastard* - An interesting book, about a young boy on the Mayflower, and his life afterwards up to and including the Salem Witch Trials. The style of the book is offputting to some, and the author has been criticised for including too much supposition, but it is worth a read.

3. *Savage Kingdom* by Benjamin Woolley - a very well written account of the Jamestown colony, including a lot of detailed build up explaining the background to the colony's founding. Almost as much of the book is set in England as it is in the new colony.

4. *Big Chief Elizabeth* by Giles Milton - Giles Milton is definitely popular, rather than academic, history, but he has a great readable style and his books seem to be well researched. This book is about the precursors to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, including the lost colony of Roanoke.

5. *The Island at the Centre of the World* by Russell Shorto - the story of the founding of New York (New Amsterdam) based on 17th century Dutch records which have only recently been discovered/translated. An extremely good book.

6. *A Voyage Long and Strange* by Anthony Horowitz - a popular history book about early European colonisation attempts of America, before the successful Jamestown colony. Written as a semi-travelogue by the author, but an interesting read.

7. *The Age of Reconnaissance* by J. H. Parry: A formidable classic on the Western Expansion and the age of exploration. Parry provides a dense but excellent description of how the west was able to conquer and their motivations. His section on the development of scientific navigation is particularly good.

**East Asian History**--The study of civilizations ultimately derived from the Yellow River Valley

*China*

1. *China: A New History* by John K. Fairbank: An excellent introduction to the topic by the doyen of American Sinology. China's modern history is the main concern, but the earlier periods are treated sufficiently.

2. *The Search for Modern China* by Jonathan Spence. It's a pretty good overview that starts with the Ming and goes through the late 1980s. Covers all the bases. Nothing is covered in exceptional depth (with a subject like China it rarely can be in a single book) but for a general idea of recent Chinese history it's more than adequate. Also, a very readable book.

3. *A History of Chinese Civilization* by Jacques Gernet: A readable and detailed survey of Chinese history that is notable for not prejudicing modern history over earlier periods. It heavily focuses on intellectual and cultural history, and at times the details of the political history get ignored, but any survey this ambitious must make cuts. The account of the nineteenth century is particularly vivid.

4. *China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty* by Mark Edward Lewis: Divided between sections on history, geography, the economy, society, and culture, this book is comprehensive without being overloaded--whether your interests are agriculture, the status of women, or the nature of the poet in society you will find information here. It also does well at torpedoing national mythology.

*Japan*

1. *As We Saw Them* by Masao Miyoshi is a highly readable account of the first Japanese mission to the west. It offers an interesting reversal of the typical narrative of Westerners observing inscrutable ""Orientals."" (1860)

2. *Civilization and Monsters* by Gerald Figal: an academic book, but extremely readable (in my opinion- the one amazon reviewer disagrees). Its central thesis that discourse on monsters, ghosts, the supernatural was central to the formation of modern Japan is surprisingly innovative, and fun to read. (Meiji period)

*Mongolia*

1. *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World*: Entertaining, interesting and good for history geeks and the general population. There are some misrepresentations that the author makes, and I also think that he relies on the Secret History a little too much, but all in all, awesome!

**South Asian History**

1. *Modern South Asia* by Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal: A very concise (less than 200 pages of narrative) history of South Asia from around 1600 CE onward. A very accessible and complete explanation of British colonialism in South Asia with a well-rounded perspective of the subsequent nationalist movements.

**Native American Peoples**

*Pre-Columbian*

1. *1491* by Charles Mann: A popular history book that covers the general history of Native Americans until European contact. It discusses both North and South America. Although Mann is not a professional historian, his work is very thought-provoking and approachable for a lay-audience. He also has a follow-up book, 1493, which covers interactions between Europeans and Native Americans post-contact.

*Post-Columbian*

1. *The Cherokee Cases* This book isn't too difficult, and it adds in a great deal about President Jackson, which is always a crowd pleaser. Although, this might sadden a great deal of Jackson lovers. This book details the politics behind Worcester v Georgia and Cherokee Nation v Georgia, which are the cornerstones of Native American Law.

2. *Custer Died For Your Sins* by Vine Deloria Jr: This book went a long way in shifting the focus of Anthropology and History away from Indians as objects and victims towards Indians as active participants. Written in 1969, I make sure students read this before they are allowed to talk about Native History. Indians have fantastic senses of humor, and this book really shows it.

3. *Landscape Traveled by Coyote and Crane* by Rodney Frey: This is is a representation of the perfect way in which to work with tribes to do Anthropology and History. He uses old stories and modern stories told by living Coeur d'Alene people to contextualize everything he writes. He involves the Coeur d'Alene people without losing his focus or professionalism.

4. *Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation* by John Ehle: A very readable history of the Cherokee Nation. It follows the life of John Ridge, a Cherokee leader whose rise and fall parallels that of the nation.

**Cultural/Intellectual History**

1. *A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus's Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich* by Christopher B. Krebs: Provides an interesting history of Tacitus's Germania from contextualizing its writing to how it was sought after in Renaissance Italy to how it was eventually used for propaganda purposes.

2. *Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey* by Kenneth Ch'en: An excellent history of Chinese Buddhism, including its intellectual development and the societal reactions to it.

3. *From Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life* by Jacques Barzun: A magisterial work of cultural history, an end-of-life summa penned by one of the most civilized men ever to exist. It's both scholarly and accessible, narrated in gorgeous prose, and deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Thucydides, Tacitus, Gucciardini, Gibbon, Macaulay, and Burckhardt.

4. *Pioneers of Photography* by Aaron Scharf. Contains personal writings of Nicephore Niepce, the inventor of the first photograph, as well as biographies of other pioneers and an in-depth discussion of their techniques.

5. *Picture Machine: The Rise of American Newspictures* by William Hannigan and Ken Johnston. While mostly a collection of photographs, there is a very nice preface that discusses the adoption of photography by newspaper companies.

6. *Hippie* by Barry Miles: An excellent, detailed history of the counter culture from 1965-71 in both England and the U.S, from Ken Kesey and the Magic Bus, to the music scenes, to hippies, and Vietnam protests, he covers a lot. Also, there are a lot of pretty pictures and it looks great on a coffee table.

7. *Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy* by Paula Findlen: This book looks at the development of scientific culture in Europe, using early modern (northern) Italy as a case study. Cultural forces like patronage and identity have large roles in proto-scientific circles.

8. *Playboy and the Making of the Good Life in America* by Elizabeth Fraterrigo and Bachelors and Bunnies: The Sexual Politics of Playboy by Carrie Pitzulo - both excellent books about not only Playboy magazine, but also postwar culture, American consumerism, and shifting gender roles in the 1960s and 1970s. You don't even have to have read Playboy to understand them!

*Exploration*

1. *The Last Expedition: Stanley's Mad Journey Through the Congo* by Daniel Liebowitz and Charles Pearson: This is the ideal book for anyone interested in Exploration. Stanley represents the end of the colonial explorer because of the intense and frightening stories brought back to England.

2. *Over the Edge of the World* by Laurence Bergreen: Bergreen is not a professional historian, but he presents the story of Magellan's circumnavigation in an entertaining way. He doesn't add anything new to the table, but I can respect someone who can take primary documents and make them enjoyable to read.

3. *Longitude* by Dava Sobel: This book details how the world figured to procedure of finding longitudinal coordinates in the world. Great Britain offered a huge cash prize to anyone able to work out a way to find longitude. Without a way to track longitude reliably, ships had been getting lost and running aground.

4. *The Worst Journey in the World* by Apsley Cherry-Gerrard: This is a first hand account written by one of the scientist on the expedition to the South Pole. The book is impressive because of how disastrous and pointless their expedition turn out. Terrific examples of the conditions near the pole.

*Terrorism*

1. *The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al-Qaeda* by Gerard Chaliand and Arnaud Blin: Two French scholars trace the path of terrorism from the ancient world to the present day, with a particularly lucid section differentiating terrorism from other acts of violence. (academic)

2. *A History of Terrorism* by Walter Laqueur: Another broad history of terrorism. Laqueur takes an interesting stance, arguing that history and the social sciences can't accurately explain terrorism; instead, he believes studying literature is the best method for arriving at accurate conclusions about the phenomenon.

3. *Inside Terrorism* by Bruce Hoffman: Maybe considered the best work on terrorism. Holistic study explaining the era of modern terrorism (1968-present), with particularly adept analysis of the relationship between the media and terrorist groups. (academic)

4. *The Looming Tower* by Lawrence Wright: Excellent narrative history of the birth and rise of al-Qaeda, told mainly through multiple biographies of the key players.

5. *Bringing the War Home: The Weather Underground, the Red Army Faction and Revolutionary Violence in the Sixties and Seventies* by Jeremy Varon: A comparative work detailing the similarities and differences of German and American society in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as between the two terrorist organizations.*

*Christianity*

1. *The Historical Figure of Jesus* by E P Sanders. A popularization of his important work Jesus and Judaism. Intended for non-specialists, which may find the former incomprehensible.

2. *The Historical Jesus: Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant* by John Crossan. I personally disagree with pretty well every word Crossan writes. But even when he's wrong, he's wonderfully productive. A contrast to Sanders view, representing two sides of one of the major debates of the last quarter century or so.

3. *Paul: A Very Short Introduction* by E P Sanders Sanders' work on Paul in his more academic books revolutionized Pauline studies over the last half century. The VSI series is always excellent, and this is no exception. A wonderful introduction to recent work on Paul and the so-called ""New Perspective on Paul.""

*History of Science*

1. *The Pasteurization of France* by Bruno Latour: I think Latour does a good job at showing the social and cultural prerequisites necessary to encourage the French to accept Pasteur's microbes as revealed truth, as well as the process by which these conditions are obscured in favor of the ""Great Man"" thesis.

2.  *A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England* by Steve Shapin: Shapin deftly argues that the practice of science in seventeenth-century England relied heavily on the reliable word of ""experts"" in a particular field, as experiments were expensive and laborious to reproduce. Trust emerges as a critical element in the production of scientific knowledge, and Shapin demonstrates that what we assume to be objective in science often rests on this foundation of trust in the scientist (as it does in every academic field).

3. *Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism* by Mario Biagioli: Biagioli shows how crucial the patron/client relationship was for scientists in early modern Europe - particularly for Galileo and his principal patron, Pope Urban VIII. Again, this is another work that unpacks the social networks that undergird(ed) scientific study.

4. *Objectivity* by Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison: The book traces a critical problem of representation in the Scientific Revolution, particularly relating to representing objects of scientific study in atlases. For example: when making an entry for oak trees in a botany book, what kind of picture should one include? No two oak trees will look the same (though they will look similar), so how does the artist draw it so that it can be easily recognized in real life by referencing the atlas? How do you draw something like cloud formations in an atlas to demonstrate the difference between Cirrus and Cumulus clouds, even though clouds are constantly changing shape? Daston and Galison do a great job explaining the context of these debates and anxieties and what they reveal about the practice of science.",The AskHistorians Master Book List,367

Daeres,51,75,1afin4,304,"Kingdoms, empires, princes, and wars are all frequently discussed and asked about in historical discussion. But 'the city' has been part of the conversation about the human past for a very long time.

The term 'city' can deal with many variagated kinds of state and society throughout history. We have the ancient cities of Mesopotamia, such as Ur, Uruk, Babylon and Assur. We have the *poleis* of the various Greek speaking cultures. We have various Roman built settlements and refoundations. We have the medieval merchant republic, and the medieval urban environments to which a *burgess* belonged. We have the industrial cities of the 19th and early 20th centuries. To dip out of Eurocentric perspectives a second, we have the great capitals of the various Chinese Empires, the city-states of Mesoamerica, the planned grids of Kyoto, post-Timur Samarkhand. There are probably many other variations on the concept of 'the city' that I've missed out here as well.

To clarify exactly what I'm asking;

* Are we right to refer to all of these as cities, and imply they are such directly comparable phenomena?

* What is the dividing line that makes an environment urban?

* Are there features of any particular period/culture's take on 'the city' that you think mark them out?

* Conversely, do you know of any pre-modern examples of cultural contact resulting in completely new ideas regarding 'the city'?

* Are there examples of cultures observably encountering cities when they possessed no similar concept of their own, and if so what resulted from this?

&gt;My area is Newfoundland history, I'm more comfortable with the government of NFLD and the later history (1800's on) but will do my best to answer anything and everything related. I went to Memorial University of Newfoundland, got a BA and focused on Newfoundland History. My pride and joy from being in school is a paper I wrote on the 1929 tsunami which struck St. Mary's bay, the first paper on the topic. 


* /u/Barry_good
&gt;My area of studies in university was in History, but began to swing between anthropology and history. My area of focus was early relations specifically between the Huron and the French interactions in the early 17th century. From that I began to look at native history within Canada, and the role of language and culture for native populations. I currently live on a reservation, but am not aboriginal myself (French descendants came as early as 1630). I am currently a grade 7 teacher, and love to read Canadian History books, and every issue of the Beaver (Canada's History Magazine or whatever it's called now).

He studies 20th century Quebec history and is writing a dissertation examining the perspective of French Canadian nationalist Henri Bourassa on the First World War.  He has also studied Canadian history topics on War and Society, Aboriginals, and post-Confederation politics.

I'm setting this up now, but I will start answering questions about 12-12:30 EST--have a few things to attend to. I will try to get to all of the questions, even if not all today. :)  


I’m a cultural historian, focusing on two fields: History of the Book and History of Pornography. Specifically, I focus on printed/literary pornography from Early Modern Europe (about 1400 or so) to about 1850  (the term ‘pornography’ was coined in 1849, and laws were passed against it in 1857). My geographical focus is Europe, especially Great Britain, but I also know a good amount about Anthony Comstock and his crusade. In a sense, I deal with the ‘prehistory’ of pornography.  


History of the Book is a much more established field, and has been around since at least the early 1990’s, though with many prefigurations of the field much earlier. The most famous book to put history of the book on the map was Robert Darnton’s The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France which, although it has been recently criticized, remains a pioneer work. The History of Pornography is still a relatively new field, especially the ‘prehistory’ subfield of it, and no program exists specifically studying it. The two pioneering books in my field are likely 1) Walter Kendrick’s The Secret Museum—which focuses on how porn as a ‘category’ was created to suppress universal access to it and 2) Lynn Hunt’s The Invention of Pornography, which is a collection of papers studying porn from 1500-1800.","AMA: History of Pornography, 1400-1800",344

**ATTN: [Here are all the questions asked &amp; answered as of around 11pm EST](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ee1h9/wednesday_ama_mesoamerica/c9zofy2).** 

You can stop asking those questions now, we've solved those problems forever. Also, I think most of us are calling it a night. If you're question didn't get answered today, make a wish for the morrow (or post it later as its own question).

Your esteemed panel for today consists of:

- /u/snickeringshadow who has expertise in cultures west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, especially the Tarascans and the cultures of Oaxaca, but whose magnificent knowledge extends to the Big 3, as well as writing systems.

- /u/Ahhuatl whose background is in history and anthropology, and is not afraid to go digging in the dirt. Despite the Nahautl name, this thorny individual's interest encompasses the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples as well. (Ahhuatl, due to time and scheduling constraints, will be joining later, so please keep the questions rolling in. We're committed to answering until our fingers bleed.)

- /u/historianLA, a specialist in sixteenth century spanish colonialism with a focus on race and ethnicity, who will also adroitly answer questions regarding the ""spiritual conquest"" of Mesoamerica and thus expects your questions about the Spanish Inquisition.

- /u/Reedstilt is our honorary Mesoamericanist, but also brings a comprehensive knowledge of Native American studies and a command of the kind of resources only a research librarian could have in order to answer questions on North American connections and the daily life of the past.

- and finally myself, /u/400-Rabbits. I have a background as a true four-field anthropologist (cultural, biological, archaeological, and pretending to know something about linguistics), but my interests lay in the Post-Classic supergroup known as the Aztecs. I am also the mod who will ban anyone who asks about aliens. Just kidding... maybe.

In this week's AMA, we'll be discussing the geocultural area known as Mesoamerica, a region that (roughly) stretches South from Central Mexico into parts of Central America. Mesoamerica is best known for it's rich pre-Columbian history and as a one of few ""cradles of human civilization"" that independently developed a suite of domesticated plants and animals, agriculture, writing, and complex societies with distinctive styles of art and monumental architecture. 

While most people with even a rudimentary historical education have heard of the Big 3 marquee names in Mesoamerica -- the Olmecs, Maya, and Aztecs -- far fewer have heard of other important groups like the Tarascans, Zapotec, Otomi, and Mixtec. Though these groups may be separated by many hundreds of kilometers and centuries, if not millennia, far too often they are presented as a homogenous melange of anachronisms. Throw in the Andean cultures even further removed, and you get the pop-culture mish-mash that is the [Mayincatec](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec).

The shallow popular understanding and the seeming strangeness of cultures that developed wholly removed from the influence of Eurasian and African peoples, bolstered by generally poor education on the subject, has led to a number of misconceptions to fill the gaps in knowledge about Mesoamerica. As such, Mesoamerica has been a [frequent topic on AskHistorians](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/nativeamerican) and the reason for this AMA. So please feel free to ask any question, simple or complex, on your mind about this much misunderstood region and its peoples. Ask us about featherwork and obsidian use, long-distance trade, the concept of a *Cultura Madre*, calendrics and apocalypses, pre-Columbian contact hypotheses, actual contact and the early colonial period, human sacrifice and cosmology. Ask us why all of this matters, why we should care about and study these groups so seemingly removed from daily life of most Redditors.

In short, ask us anything.

What exactly is the common narrative concerning these events? I have heard two things in particular from the Turkish side: 

* without reducing the significance of the events and their faults, what occurred was ethnic cleansing rather than genocide (this is more semantic than anything else - according to the Turks, Armenian populations were moved to Syria to prevent defection to the Russian Empire in a possible war between the two states. *edit: completely forgot my WWI history, the Ottomans and the Russians were already at war by that stage*); and,

* there was never any actual intent from the Ottoman government or any highly-ranking commanding officers to exterminate Armenian populations, with the deaths that occurred not having been the result of a systematic policy but a widespread racism brought to the fore by the death throes of the empire and a lack of discipline in the field on the part of both soldiers and lowly-ranking COs.

The author's claim is that India was always inclusive, but that the Europeans could not ""understand"" this inclusivity, and decided that India is not actually a single country.  The article quotes John Strachey (but misspells his name):

&gt; This is the first and foremost thing to learn about India that there is not, and never was an India, or even any country of India possessing, according to European ideas, any sort of unity – physical, political, social and religious, no Indian nation, no ‘people of India’, of which we hear so much.

Is there validity to the claim that India was a single inclusive nature of religious and cultural diversity and that the Europeans simply could not understand it, or is this more along the lines of a wishful retelling of history?

/u/profrhodes and /u/khosikulu here, ready and willing to answer any questions you may have on the history of Southern Africa. 

Little bit about us:

/u/profrhodes : My main area of academic expertise is decolonization in Southern Africa, especially Zimbabwe, and all the turmoil which followed - wars, genocide, apartheid, international condemnation, rebirth, and the current difficulties those former colonies face today. I can also answer questions about colonization and white settler communities in Southern Africa and their conflicts, cultures, and key figures, from the 1870s onwards!


/u/khosikulu : I hold a PhD in African history with two additional major concentrations in Western European and global history. My own work focuses on intergroup struggles over land and agrarian livelihoods in southern Africa from 1657 to 1916, with an emphasis on the 19th century Cape and Transvaal and heavy doses of the history of scientific geography (surveying, mapping, titling, et cetera). I can usually answer questions on topics more broadly across southern Africa for all eras as well, from the Zambesi on south. (My weakness, as with so many of us, is in the Portuguese areas.)

/u/khosikulu is going to be in and out today so if there is a question I think he can answer better than I can, please don't be offended if it takes a little longer to be answered!

Before the introduction to the topic, I just want to say that I know that this topic can be sensitive to some people and that while I keep myself as unbiased as possible, some readers may take offense at some of my answers that goes against their belief or understanding of a certain conflict, group or event. In particular with the recent conflicts, it can be rather politically charged. I just wanted to put this disclaimer up to let people know.

In the studies of military history, the use of guerrilla warfare and the response to such tactics are often overshadowed by other, contemporary events and field battles. It wasn't until modern time that guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency has taken the central stage in the annuals of military history. Starting with the Cold War up until the present day conflict in Afghanistan, the refinement of both guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency have managed to make it both more civilized as well as more brutal - a paradox worth investigating. From the streets of Belfast to the highlands of Vietnam all the way down to the bush country of Mozambique - these wars of irregular tactics and counterinsurgency have led to some of the most unexpected outcomes, horrific crimes and lasting historical personalities. 

Ask about anything related to modern guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency. To make it even more precise, 1899 up until now would be a good way to measure it properly. I am also qualified to answer questions on modern warfare in general, in particular from the perspective of the ordinary infantryman.

I often raise Ibn Battuta as an example of ""unknown"" explorers that should be more known when I talk about the Age of discovery and/or Marco Polo/Christopher Columbus/and all that with my students. Today it struck me I have no idea about some more practical details.

Some of the facts of his life suggests to me that he came from a decently wealthy background (legal scholars, and he got to study), so it is not surprising that he would manage to undertake a pilgrimage. The travels to Mecca took 16 months (mainly due to detours) and I guess it is at least feasible that a sum of money that will last that long can be taken in normal travel luggage. However, when he arrived in Mecca and was ""done"", instead of travelling home, he decided to keep traveling, and did so an enourmously long time. Whatever leftover cash was intended for the journey home can't have lasted long, the amount of enlistment possibilities (working as a caravan guard or aboard a ship) mostly covers travels expenses, so ... what gives?

Finding a place to sleep without paying is one thing, but how did he afford food, and presumably, travel costs, and as the travels dragged on, new clothes and such? He even married!

eternalkerri,82,58,13vmq6,236,"I love movies.  Love them, love them, love them.  So with my rather long list of films from all era's I've seen, it's interesting to me to see how acting in the films themselves changed.

Films from the beginning of the ""talkies"" up until about the mid to late 60's have an especially different flavor.  The dialogue is more formal, enunciation is more pronounced, fight scenes are stiffer with more exaggerated moves (the wind up and punch), faces don't seem to be as expressive and the voice seems to carry more expression.  Also the actors seem to be much louder or at least their voices carry a lot of weight behind them.

My personal theory is that many of the actors from that era came from theater, where facial expression is not as important as vocal expression.  Additionally movements had to be more pronounced to be visible to the entire audience.  Additionally, the audio recording equipment of the time was not as high of a quality as it is today requiring the actors be be more formal in their pronunciation.  By the time the late 50's into the 60's and beyond, a new generation of actors and directors had arrived in Hollywood who were more exposed to film than theater, causing them to shift to a more naturalistic style.

I ask the question because when I lived somewhere remote for a few months I stopped caring about changing my pants and shirt once per day, and instead did it once every few days.

Edit: I found the following on a 'historic park' website called Conner Prarie on a section discussing clothing of the 1830s. ""Of course, ordinary people didn't have the large wardrobes we expect today. They made do with one outfit for everyday, one for Sunday best, and perhaps one other, or parts of another, for seasonal change. Even wealthy people didn't necessarily have lots of clothes, although their money allowed them to purchase ready-made items from the storekeeper, or to hire custom sewing done outside the household, or by a temporary live-in seamstress.""",When did people start changing their clothes every day?,290

These two articles are about two men, born 6 years apart in different countries, with an unbelievable appetite, while being of normal weight. Their condition has not been recorded this severe in modern times.

I can't check the sources directly, but something doesn't seem right.
